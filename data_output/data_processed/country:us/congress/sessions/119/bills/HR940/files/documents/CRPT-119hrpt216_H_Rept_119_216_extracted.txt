PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 940, the Fair Audits and Inspections for Regulators’ (FAIR)
Exams Act, was introduced on February 4, 2025 by Chairman
French Hill (AR–02). H.R. 940 establishes an Office of Independent
Examination Review within the Federal Financial Institutions Ex-
amination Council (FFIEC) to review material supervisory deter-
minations issued by the federal banking agencies. The bill allows
all financial institutions—including community banks, rural banks,
and credit unions—to appeal supervisory findings without fear of
retaliation. It requires bank examiners to complete examinations
within 60 days of the exit interview and to share all materials used
to support the supervisory determination with the institution
under review.

BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

Section 8:
Section 309 of the Riegle Community Development and Regu-
latory Improvement Act of 1994 (Riegle Act) directed each federal
banking agency and the National Credit Union Administration
(NCUA) to create an intra-agency process for reviewing material
supervisory determinations. However, the law provided little guid-
ance on implementation, and in practice, the resulting appeals
processes have proven opaque, inconsistent, and largely ineffective.
Agencies narrowly define what qualifies for appeal, and decisions
overwhelmingly favor examiners, resulting in minimal account-
ability.
Between 2018 and 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and
Federal Reserve received only 24 appeals combined. Of those, just
four were decided partially in favor of the institution, according to
the Government Accountability Office. The rest were either denied
or withdrawn—illustrating a systemic failure in the current frame-
work. This lack of meaningful recourse undermines financial insti-
tutions’ trust in supervision, particularly among small, community-
focused banks that often lack the legal and financial resources to
navigate prolonged disputes.
H.R. 940 addresses these shortcomings by creating a truly inde-
pendent review body and ensuring timely and transparent exam-
ination procedures. By improving fairness and reducing examiner
overreach, the bill strengthens—not weakens—prudential super-
vision.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
119TH CONGRESS
On February 4, 2025, Chairman Hill introduced H.R. 940, the
Fair Audits and Inspections for Regulators’ (FAIR) Exams Act, with
Representatives Dan Meuser (R–PA), Ann Wagner (R–MO), Bill
Huizenga (R–MI), William Timmons (R–SC), Tim Moore (R–NC),
and Roger Williams (R–TX), as original cosponsors. Representa-
tives Mike Haridopolos (R–FL), Pete Sessions (R–TX), David Scott
(D–GA), and Cleo Fields (D–LA) were added subsequently as co-
sponsors.
The bill was referred solely to the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices. The bill was attached to the February 5, 2025 hearing titled
‘‘Make Community Banking Great Again.’’

ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes

On May 21, 2025, the Committee ordered H.R. 940, as amended,
to be reported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 35 yeas
and 17 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–132).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
940:
• Chairman Hill offered an amendment in the nature of a
substitute, which included several changes, including: improv-
ing accountability around timeliness throughout the examina-
tion process, such as extending the deadline for final exam re-
ports from 60 days to 90 days; restructured the Office of Inde-
pendent Examination Review to be led by a three-member
board rather than a single director and including explicit pro-
hibitions to avoid conflicts of interest; and enhanced protec-
tions against retaliation, clarifying reporting obligations to en-
sure that Congress remains informed while safeguarding the
confidentiality of financial institutions. This amendment was
adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amend-
ment (No. 8), designated WATERS_069. This amendment di-
rects the Federal banking agencies to design a strategic plan
on how the agencies will escalate matters and hold large banks
accountable when such an institution engages in a pattern of
compliance failures. This strategic plan would include an out-
line of penalties and require a report to Congress. This amend-
ment failed by a recorded vote of 23 yeas and 29 nays, a
quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–129).
• Representative Scott offered an amendment (No. 9), des-
ignated HR940_5. This amendment modifies the qualifications
for individuals to serve on the new Board of Independent Ex-
amination Review, requires the three-member Board to not
have more than two members of the same political party, and
clarifies when the Board constitutes a quorum to align with

other federal financial regulatory agencies. This amendment
was agreed to by a recorded vote of 52 yeas and 0 nays, a
quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–130).

designated AMENDHR_940_4. This amendment prevents any

ciency (DOGE) from accessing confidential supervisory infor-
mation. This amendment failed by a recorded vote of 23 yeas
and 29 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 940. The Committee

of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a

cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 13:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 14:
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 940 as the ‘‘Fair Audits and Inspections
for Regulators’ Exams Act’’ or the ‘‘FAIR Exams Act.’’

Section 15:
Section 2. Timeliness of examinations and examination reports
This section amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examina-
tion Council Act of 1978 by adding a provision requiring federal fi-
nancial institutions regulatory agencies to complete any examina-
tion within 270 days of commencement, except that the agency may
extend this period by providing written notice to the financial insti-
tution explaining the justification for the extension. The section
further mandates that the regulatory agency conduct an exit inter-
view with the senior management of the financial institution with-
in 30 days following the completion of the examination. Addition-
ally, the final examination report must be delivered within 90 days
of the exit interview or the receipt of any additional information
from the institution, whichever is later. Upon the request of the fi-
nancial institution, the agency is required to include an appendix
in the final report listing all examination or other factual informa-
tion used to support any material supervisory determination.

Section 16:
Section 3. Timeliness of required permission, regulatory, and report-
ing guidance
This section requires federal financial institutions regulatory
agencies to respond promptly to written requests submitted by fi-
nancial institutions seeking permission, regulatory interpretations,
or accounting guidance. Agencies are obligated to acknowledge re-
ceipt and completeness of such requests within 30 days and to
specify any missing information. If a request is deemed complete,
the agency must issue a written determination within 60 days.
Furthermore, the agencies must publish summaries of these deter-
minations on their public websites within 120 days, while ensuring
that any confidential or identifying information is redacted.

minations issued by federal banking agencies. The office shall be
led by a three-member Board, consisting of individuals with exper-
tise in federal regulation, law or accounting, and private sector fi-
nancial management. The Board is tasked with investigating com-
plaints related to examinations, conducting quarterly meetings, re-
viewing agency examination procedures, and performing quality as-
surance reviews to ensure the integrity and fairness of examina-
tions.

Section 18:
Section 5. Right to independent review of material supervisory de-
terminations
This section grants financial institutions the right to request an
independent review of material supervisory determinations made
in final examination reports. The financial institution must file a
written notice of appeal with the Board within 60 days of receiving
the determination, with the possibility of an extension for good
cause. The Board is required to review the appeal on the record or,
if requested by the institution, conduct a hearing where testimony
and evidence may be presented. The Board must issue a written de
novo decision within 60 days of the record’s closure. The section
also prohibits retaliation by regulators against financial institu-
tions exercising their appeal rights. Additionally, the Board is re-
quired to submit an annual report to the House Committee on Fi-
nancial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs detailing the reviews.

Section 19:
Section 6. Additional amendments
This section removes outdated regulatory appeals procedures
from the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improve-
ment Act of 1994 and updates the role of the regulatory ombuds-
man to include protections against regulatory retaliation. It further
amends the Federal Credit Union Act to incorporate the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau as a covered regulatory agency. Fi-
nally, this section updates definitions and cost-sharing provisions
within the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act
to align with current regulatory frameworks.

able to the public, including on the website of the
Board.
(ii) CONTENTS.—The forms and instructions de-
scribed under clause (i) shall provide a sample cover
letter and a comprehensive list of items that may ac-
company the application, including clear guidance on
evidence that may support a finding of rehabilitation.
(F) CONSIDERATION OF CRIMINAL HISTORY.—
(i) REGIONAL OFFICE CONSIDERATION.—In reviewing

(I) primarily rely on the criminal history record
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and
(II) provide such record to the applicant to re-
view for accuracy.

tion.
(G) CONSIDERATION OF REHABILITATION.—Consistent
with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.

has elapsed since conviction or program entry, and the
relationship of individual’s offense to the responsibil-
ities of the applicable position;

participating in job preparation and educational pro-
grams, and other relevant mitigating evidence; and

determines necessary for safety and soundness.
(H) SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.—With respect to an ap-
proved consent application filed by an insured credit union
on behalf of an individual, if the Board determines it ap-
propriate, such approved consent application shall allow
the individual to work for the same employer (without re-
strictions on the location) and across positions, except that
the prior consent of the Board (which may require a new
application) shall be required for any proposed significant
changes in the individual’s security-related duties or re-

tions that the employer determines will require higher se-
curity screening credentials.

Section 25:
section, the Board shall consult and coordinate with the

other similar purposes and which is not operated for profit, and
with respect to deposits of public funds by an officer, employee, or
agent of the United States, any State, county, municipality, or po-
litical subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, any territory or
possession of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof.

appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of

sured credit union or may authorize an insured credit union to pur-
chase any of the assets of, or assume any of the liabilities of, any
other insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insol-
vency if the Board is satisfied that—

spect to such other insured credit union;

to purchase any of the assets of or assume any of the liabilities of
an insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insol-

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would impose certain timelines for examiners from the
Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), National Credit
Union Administration (NCUA), and Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB) to share exam reports, as well as all supporting
documentation, with a financial institution they supervise following
an exam. This bill would also establish an Office of Independent
Examination Review (OIER) within the Federal Financial Institu-
tions Examination Council (FFIEC) to review appeals of material
supervisory determinations (MSD) issued by these Federal agencies
for financial institutions they supervise, including the largest
banks and large nonbank financial companies (e.g. big tech pay-
ment providers, nonbank mortgage companies, credit bureaus, etc.),
which would further be subject to judicial review.
The Fed, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, and CFPB would be required to
defer to OIER rulings even though this office has no mandate to
ensure the safety and soundness of depository intuitions, consumer
protection, or financial stability. Moreover, the bill would allow not
just small community banks and credit unions, but also the largest
banks and other financial institutions, to challenge any MSD a reg-
ulator may give, which could interfere with ensuring the institution
promptly addresses compliance problems that could become bigger
safety and soundness or consumer protection problems if not
promptly addressed.
For example, consider the multiple supervisory warnings Silicon
Valley Bank received in the lead up to their failure in 2023. GAO
and other experts said the problem was not due process, but rath-
er, that supervisory concerns were not elevated quickly enough to
ensure they were addressed.1 The Committee found similar dynam-
ics at Wells Fargo, as the bank received various citations that
snowballed into significant and repeated consumer harm.2 Accord-
ingly, this bill would weaken the supervisory framework and un-
dermine consumer protection as well as the safety and soundness
of depository institutions.
Consumer groups including Americans for Financial Reform
(AFR) and Public Citizen oppose the bill. In a statement opposing
a similar measure in 2018, AFR explained: ‘‘This new appeals proc-
ess is an addition to formal appeals processes and ombudsmen al-
ready present at the banking agencies. The agencies affected by
this legislation—including the CFPB, FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve,
and National Credit Union Administration—each already have an
1Id. Also see GAO, Bank Supervision: More Timely Escalation of Supervisory Action Needed
(Mar. 6, 2024).

agency ombudsman and an intra-agency formal review and appeals
process. In addition, banks are already free to bring a court chal-
lenge to any formal regulatory enforcement action. By layering an
entirely new appeals process on top of existing processes, this bill
would greatly increase the ability of banks to resist supervisory
oversight and ignore or delay changes called for by supervisors.
The impact would be most pronounced at the largest banks, which
can receive dozens or hundreds of material findings from every ex-
amination. The ability to appeal every one of those material super-
visory findings, or just to threaten to appeal them, would create an
enormous new barrier to effective supervision of big banks.’’3 (em-
phasis added)
The Committee previously passed a bill last Congress, H.R. 8337
(118th), the ‘‘Bank Resilience and Regulatory Improvement Act,’’
that included similar provisions, by a 24–22 party-line vote.4 Before
that, in 2018, the Committee considered another similar bill, H.R.
1515 (115th Cong.), which passed the House though did not ad-
vance further in the Senate.5
During the debate, several amendments were considered. Rank-
ing Member Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amendment that
would require Federal banking regulators to develop a strategic
plan on how they will escalate supervisory matters to promptly ad-
dress compliance deficiencies concerns. This would help ensure we
don’t have a repeat of Silicon Valley Bank, when matters were not
escalated fast enough. Ranking Member Waters offered another
amendment, in light of DOGE recently visiting FDIC and the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to prohibit DOGE employees
from accessing confidential bank held by Federal regulators, in-
cluding bank exam files. These amendments were rejected by Re-
publicans.
Rep. David Scott (D–GA) offered an amendment that attempts to
ensure that there is consumer protection expertise on the appeals
oversight board to review appeals that banks may have on super-
visory outcomes. This amendment would also prevent more than
two members of the board from being part of the same political
party. These changes, which were adopted by the Committee, make
some modest improvements to the underlying bill, though as Rank-
ing Member Waters discussed, there would need to be further
modifications to ensure they cannot be gamed, as President Trump
is doing now, for example by firing individuals from a different po-
litical party serving on a bipartisan Federal board. Moreover, these
changes do not fix many of the underlying concerns that the bill
will have to make it harder to hold the biggest banks accountable
for their actions and delay remediation for harmed consumers.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 940.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 940, the Fair Audits and Inspections for Regulators’ (FAIR)
Exams Act, was introduced on February 4, 2025 by Chairman
French Hill (AR–02). H.R. 940 establishes an Office of Independent
Examination Review within the Federal Financial Institutions Ex-
amination Council (FFIEC) to review material supervisory deter-
minations issued by the federal banking agencies. The bill allows
all financial institutions—including community banks, rural banks,
and credit unions—to appeal supervisory findings without fear of
retaliation. It requires bank examiners to complete examinations
within 60 days of the exit interview and to share all materials used
to support the supervisory determination with the institution
under review.

BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 309 of the Riegle Community Development and Regu-
latory Improvement Act of 1994 (Riegle Act) directed each federal
banking agency and the National Credit Union Administration
(NCUA) to create an intra-agency process for reviewing material
supervisory determinations. However, the law provided little guid-
ance on implementation, and in practice, the resulting appeals
processes have proven opaque, inconsistent, and largely ineffective.
Agencies narrowly define what qualifies for appeal, and decisions
overwhelmingly favor examiners, resulting in minimal account-
ability.
Between 2018 and 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and
Federal Reserve received only 24 appeals combined. Of those, just
four were decided partially in favor of the institution, according to
the Government Accountability Office. The rest were either denied
or withdrawn—illustrating a systemic failure in the current frame-
work. This lack of meaningful recourse undermines financial insti-
tutions’ trust in supervision, particularly among small, community-
focused banks that often lack the legal and financial resources to
navigate prolonged disputes.
H.R. 940 addresses these shortcomings by creating a truly inde-
pendent review body and ensuring timely and transparent exam-
ination procedures. By improving fairness and reducing examiner
overreach, the bill strengthens—not weakens—prudential super-
vision.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
119TH CONGRESS

COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.
On May 21, 2025, the Committee ordered H.R. 940, as amended,
to be reported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 35 yeas
and 17 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–132).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
940:
• Chairman Hill offered an amendment in the nature of a
substitute, which included several changes, including: improv-
ing accountability around timeliness throughout the examina-
tion process, such as extending the deadline for final exam re-
ports from 60 days to 90 days; restructured the Office of Inde-
pendent Examination Review to be led by a three-member
board rather than a single director and including explicit pro-
hibitions to avoid conflicts of interest; and enhanced protec-
tions against retaliation, clarifying reporting obligations to en-
sure that Congress remains informed while safeguarding the
confidentiality of financial institutions. This amendment was
adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amend-
ment (No. 8), designated WATERS_069. This amendment di-
rects the Federal banking agencies to design a strategic plan
on how the agencies will escalate matters and hold large banks
accountable when such an institution engages in a pattern of
compliance failures. This strategic plan would include an out-
line of penalties and require a report to Congress. This amend-
ment failed by a recorded vote of 23 yeas and 29 nays, a
quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–129).
• Representative Scott offered an amendment (No. 9), des-
ignated HR940_5. This amendment modifies the qualifications
for individuals to serve on the new Board of Independent Ex-
amination Review, requires the three-member Board to not
have more than two members of the same political party, and
clarifies when the Board constitutes a quorum to align with

other federal financial regulatory agencies. This amendment
was agreed to by a recorded vote of 52 yeas and 0 nays, a
quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–130).
• Representative Waters offered an amendment (No. 10),
designated AMENDHR_940_4. This amendment prevents any
individual affiliated with the Department of Government Effi-
ciency (DOGE) from accessing confidential supervisory infor-
mation. This amendment failed by a recorded vote of 23 yeas
and 29 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 940 as the ‘‘Fair Audits and Inspections
for Regulators’ Exams Act’’ or the ‘‘FAIR Exams Act.’’
Section 2. Timeliness of examinations and examination reports
This section amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examina-
tion Council Act of 1978 by adding a provision requiring federal fi-
nancial institutions regulatory agencies to complete any examina-
tion within 270 days of commencement, except that the agency may
extend this period by providing written notice to the financial insti-
tution explaining the justification for the extension. The section
further mandates that the regulatory agency conduct an exit inter-
view with the senior management of the financial institution with-
in 30 days following the completion of the examination. Addition-
ally, the final examination report must be delivered within 90 days
of the exit interview or the receipt of any additional information
from the institution, whichever is later. Upon the request of the fi-
nancial institution, the agency is required to include an appendix
in the final report listing all examination or other factual informa-
tion used to support any material supervisory determination.
Section 3. Timeliness of required permission, regulatory, and report-
ing guidance
This section requires federal financial institutions regulatory
agencies to respond promptly to written requests submitted by fi-
nancial institutions seeking permission, regulatory interpretations,
or accounting guidance. Agencies are obligated to acknowledge re-
ceipt and completeness of such requests within 30 days and to
specify any missing information. If a request is deemed complete,
the agency must issue a written determination within 60 days.
Furthermore, the agencies must publish summaries of these deter-
minations on their public websites within 120 days, while ensuring
that any confidential or identifying information is redacted.
Section 4. Office of Independent Examination Review

Review within the FFIEC to review material supervisory deter-

minations issued by federal banking agencies. The office shall be
led by a three-member Board, consisting of individuals with exper-
tise in federal regulation, law or accounting, and private sector fi-
nancial management. The Board is tasked with investigating com-
plaints related to examinations, conducting quarterly meetings, re-
viewing agency examination procedures, and performing quality as-
surance reviews to ensure the integrity and fairness of examina-
tions.
Section 5. Right to independent review of material supervisory de-
terminations
This section grants financial institutions the right to request an
independent review of material supervisory determinations made
in final examination reports. The financial institution must file a
written notice of appeal with the Board within 60 days of receiving
the determination, with the possibility of an extension for good
cause. The Board is required to review the appeal on the record or,
if requested by the institution, conduct a hearing where testimony
and evidence may be presented. The Board must issue a written de
novo decision within 60 days of the record’s closure. The section
also prohibits retaliation by regulators against financial institu-
tions exercising their appeal rights. Additionally, the Board is re-
quired to submit an annual report to the House Committee on Fi-
nancial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs detailing the reviews.
Section 6. Additional amendments
This section removes outdated regulatory appeals procedures
from the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improve-
ment Act of 1994 and updates the role of the regulatory ombuds-
man to include protections against regulatory retaliation. It further
amends the Federal Credit Union Act to incorporate the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau as a covered regulatory agency. Fi-
nally, this section updates definitions and cost-sharing provisions
within the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act
to align with current regulatory frameworks.

thereon. If such greater rate of interest has been paid, the person
who paid it may recover, in a civil action commenced in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of
such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of interest
paid from the credit union taking or receiving such interest.
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board may
authorize a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union
which is insolvent or is in danger of insolvency with any other in-
sured credit union or may authorize an insured credit union to pur-
chase any of the assets of, or assume any of the liabilities of, any
other insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insol-
vency if the Board is satisfied that—
(1) an emergency requiring expeditious action exists with re-
spect to such other insured credit union;
(2) other alternatives are not reasonably available; and
(3) the public interest would best be served by approval of
such merger, consolidation, purchase, or assumption.

to purchase any of the assets of or assume any of the liabilities of
an insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insol-
vency, except that prior to exercising this authority the Board must
attempt to effect the merger or consolidation of an insured credit
union which is insolvent or in danger of insolvency with another
insured credit union, as provided in subsection (h).
(2) For purposes of the authority contained in paragraph (1), in-

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would impose certain timelines for examiners from the
Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), National Credit
Union Administration (NCUA), and Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB) to share exam reports, as well as all supporting
documentation, with a financial institution they supervise following
an exam. This bill would also establish an Office of Independent
Examination Review (OIER) within the Federal Financial Institu-
tions Examination Council (FFIEC) to review appeals of material
supervisory determinations (MSD) issued by these Federal agencies
for financial institutions they supervise, including the largest
banks and large nonbank financial companies (e.g. big tech pay-
ment providers, nonbank mortgage companies, credit bureaus, etc.),
which would further be subject to judicial review.
The Fed, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, and CFPB would be required to
defer to OIER rulings even though this office has no mandate to
ensure the safety and soundness of depository intuitions, consumer
protection, or financial stability. Moreover, the bill would allow not
just small community banks and credit unions, but also the largest
banks and other financial institutions, to challenge any MSD a reg-
ulator may give, which could interfere with ensuring the institution
promptly addresses compliance problems that could become bigger
safety and soundness or consumer protection problems if not
promptly addressed.
For example, consider the multiple supervisory warnings Silicon
Valley Bank received in the lead up to their failure in 2023. GAO
and other experts said the problem was not due process, but rath-
er, that supervisory concerns were not elevated quickly enough to
ensure they were addressed.1 The Committee found similar dynam-
ics at Wells Fargo, as the bank received various citations that
snowballed into significant and repeated consumer harm.2 Accord-
ingly, this bill would weaken the supervisory framework and un-
dermine consumer protection as well as the safety and soundness
of depository institutions.
Consumer groups including Americans for Financial Reform
(AFR) and Public Citizen oppose the bill. In a statement opposing
a similar measure in 2018, AFR explained: ‘‘This new appeals proc-
ess is an addition to formal appeals processes and ombudsmen al-
ready present at the banking agencies. The agencies affected by
this legislation—including the CFPB, FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve,
and National Credit Union Administration—each already have an
1Id. Also see GAO, Bank Supervision: More Timely Escalation of Supervisory Action Needed
(Mar. 6, 2024).

agency ombudsman and an intra-agency formal review and appeals
process. In addition, banks are already free to bring a court chal-
lenge to any formal regulatory enforcement action. By layering an
entirely new appeals process on top of existing processes, this bill
would greatly increase the ability of banks to resist supervisory
oversight and ignore or delay changes called for by supervisors.
The impact would be most pronounced at the largest banks, which
can receive dozens or hundreds of material findings from every ex-
amination. The ability to appeal every one of those material super-
visory findings, or just to threaten to appeal them, would create an
enormous new barrier to effective supervision of big banks.’’3 (em-
phasis added)
The Committee previously passed a bill last Congress, H.R. 8337
(118th), the ‘‘Bank Resilience and Regulatory Improvement Act,’’
that included similar provisions, by a 24–22 party-line vote.4 Before
that, in 2018, the Committee considered another similar bill, H.R.
1515 (115th Cong.), which passed the House though did not ad-
vance further in the Senate.5
During the debate, several amendments were considered. Rank-
ing Member Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amendment that
would require Federal banking regulators to develop a strategic
plan on how they will escalate supervisory matters to promptly ad-
dress compliance deficiencies concerns. This would help ensure we
don’t have a repeat of Silicon Valley Bank, when matters were not
escalated fast enough. Ranking Member Waters offered another
amendment, in light of DOGE recently visiting FDIC and the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to prohibit DOGE employees
from accessing confidential bank held by Federal regulators, in-
cluding bank exam files. These amendments were rejected by Re-
publicans.
Rep. David Scott (D–GA) offered an amendment that attempts to
ensure that there is consumer protection expertise on the appeals
oversight board to review appeals that banks may have on super-
visory outcomes. This amendment would also prevent more than
two members of the board from being part of the same political
party. These changes, which were adopted by the Committee, make
some modest improvements to the underlying bill, though as Rank-
ing Member Waters discussed, there would need to be further
modifications to ensure they cannot be gamed, as President Trump
is doing now, for example by firing individuals from a different po-
litical party serving on a bipartisan Federal board. Moreover, these
changes do not fix many of the underlying concerns that the bill
will have to make it harder to hold the biggest banks accountable
for their actions and delay remediation for harmed consumers.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 940.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
