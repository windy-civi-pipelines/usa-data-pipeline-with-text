SEC. 2. STUDIES, REPORTS, AND RULES REGARDING SMALL ENTITIES.
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section—
(1) the term ‘‘Commission’’ means the Securities and Exchange Commission;
and
(2) the term ‘‘small entity’’—
(A) has the meaning given the term in section 601 of title 5, United
States Code, with respect to the activities of the Commission; and
(B) includes any definition established by the Commission of the term
‘‘small business’’, ‘‘small organization’’, ‘‘small governmental jurisdiction’’, or
‘‘small entity’’ under paragraph (3), (4), (5), or (6), respectively, of section
601 of title 5, United States Code, with respect to the activities of the Com-
mission.
(b) STUDIES AND REPORTS.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of
this Act, and again 5 years thereafter, the Commission shall—
(1) conduct a study of the definition of the term ‘‘small entity’’ with respect
to the activities of the Commission for the purposes of chapter 6 of title 5,
United States Code, which shall consider—
(A) the extent to which the definition of the term ‘‘small entity’’, as in ef-
fect during the period in which the study is conducted, aligns with the find-
ings and declarations made under section 2(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 note);
(B) the amount by which financial markets in the United States have
grown since the last time the Commission amended the definition of the
term ‘‘small entity’’, if applicable; and
(C) how the Commission should define the term ‘‘small entity’’ to ensure
that a meaningful number of entities would fall under that definition; and
(2) submit to Congress a report that includes—
(A) the results of the applicable study conducted under paragraph (1);
and
(B) specific and detailed recommendations on the ways in which the Com-
mission could amend the definition of the term ‘‘small entity’’ to—

(ii) expand the number of entities covered by such definition.
(c) RULEMAKING.—Concurrently with, or after the completion of, each study re-
quired under subsection (b), the Commission shall, subject to public notice and com-
ment, revise the rules of the Commission consistent with the results of such study.
(d) INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS.—After the Commission issued the final rule revi-
sions required under subsection (c), and every 5 years thereafter, the Commission
shall adjust any dollar figures under the definition of small entity established by
the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3382, the Small Entity Update Act, was introduced on May
14, 2025, by Representative Ann Wagner (MO–02). H.R. 3382 di-
rects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct a
study, followed by a rulemaking consistent with the results of such
study, including by defining the term ‘‘small entity’’ under the Reg-
ulatory Flexibility Act.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Under current law, agencies subject to the Regulatory Flexibility
Act need to determine if their rules have a significant economic im-
pact on ‘‘small entities,’’ including businesses, nonprofit organiza-
tions, and governmental jurisdictions. If so, agencies must consider
alternatives that minimize that impact. Regulations often impose
disproportionate burdens on startups, small businesses, and other
small entities. This bill represents a thoughtful approach to ad-
dressing longstanding concerns that numerous SEC rules are not
tailored to appropriately balance the SEC’s mandates to protect in-
vestors and facilitate capital formation. Studying and revising
these definitions—and considering whether such definitions should
include more meaningful metrics—will result in a better under-

standing of regulatory costs on small entities and will ensure that
the SEC modernizes its criteria for defining ‘‘small entities.’’ As
such, H.R. 3382 will lead to more tailored regulations and appro-
priately reduced burdens on small entities under our securities
laws.
