COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
fostered relationships with American K–12 schools through grants,
sister school partnerships, and other programming called Confucius
Classrooms.

China’s Activity in U.S. K–12 Schools
Styled as language and culture programs, Confucius Classrooms
are an important element of the CCP’s global influence campaign.
The Chinese government’s effort to forge ties with American
schools through its Ministry of Education Office of Chinese Lan-
guage Council International, which until recently was known as
‘‘Hanban,’’ is one facet of the CCP’s broader soft-power strategy to
influence policy in nations throughout the world. The United States
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that ex-
panding Confucius Classrooms in the United States has been a top
priority for the Chinese government.1 Many K–12 schools accepted
CCP-linked grants, which come with perks including fully funded
teacher exchanges, Chinese language programs, and opportunities
for American students to learn in China.2
Confucious Classrooms are smaller-scale, K–12 versions of
Confucious Institutes that the CCP has pushed for on U.S. college
campuses. These institutes purport to teach Chinese language and
culture. Confucius Institutes are established as partnerships be-
tween a host institution, a Chinese partner (usually a Chinese uni-
versity), and a Chinese government agency. The Ministry of Edu-
cation Office of Chinese Language Council International funds each
Confucius Institute, often at around $100,000 per year, and asks
host institutions to match those funds with their own contributions,
usually classroom and office space.
China heavily encouraged the creation of Confucius Classrooms,
and many of these developed as offshoots of Confucius Institutes.
China strategically deployed and rapidly expanded its Confucius
Classrooms, going from very few in 2008 to more than a thousand
worldwide by 2017. More than 500 American K–12 schools have
hosted Confucius Classrooms, aided in part by the Asia Society, an
American nonprofit that previously ran a network of 100 Confucius
Classrooms before they ended the partnership in 2021.3 A Parents
Defending Education report tracked Chinese affiliation in 143
schools across 34 states—with at least seven still active as of publi-
cation.4
Confucius Institute funding comes with strings attached that
compromise academic freedom. The Chinese government approves
teachers, events, and speakers and requires teachers to sign con-
tracts pledging they will not damage the national interests of
China. The contracts make clear Chinese directors or teachers will
be terminated if they ‘‘violate Chinese laws’’ or ‘‘engage in activities
detrimental to national interests’’ and states that they must ‘‘con-
scientiously safeguard national interests.’’5
It is imperative to ensure that American students are not subject
to malicious foreign influence in their schools. As such, the PRO-
TECT Act prohibits federal education funds from being given to
any elementary school or secondary school that directly or indi-

lic of China. Forms of support may include partnerships with cul-
tural or language institutes funded by China, such as the Confu-
cius Institute; operation of Confucius Classrooms supported by
China; and teaching materials, personnel, or funds received from
an individual or entity acting on behalf of the Chinese govern-
ment.6
CONCLUSION
It is unacceptable that the CCP is attempting to influence U.S.
K–12 schools. Congress should take immediate action to ensure
that students are not being indoctrinated with communist propa-
ganda. H.R. 1069 will help ensure that the Chinese government
does not take advantage of local school districts and the parents
and students in them.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1069 is to prohibit fed-
eral education funds from being given to any elementary school or
secondary school that directly or indirectly receives support from
the Government of the People’s Republic of China.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 1069 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 1069: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1069 would prohibit elementary or secondary schools that
receive direct or indirect support from an individual or entity rep-
resenting the government of the People’s Republic of China (includ-
ing Confucius Institutes) from receiving funds from the Depart-
ment of Education.
CBO expects that schools would comply with the new require-
ments; thus, enacting the bill would not affect their eligibility to re-
ceive federal funds. Based on the costs of similar activities, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost the Department of
Education less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any re-
lated spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Garrett Quenneville.
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1069. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 1069, as reported by the Committee, makes no changes to
existing law.

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1069, the Promoting Responsible Oversight Eliminate Com-
munist Teachings (PROTECT) for Our Kids Act, prohibits federal
education funds from going to elementary and secondary schools
that receive direct or indirect support from the Chinese govern-
ment. The Majority claims that this bill will ‘‘halt the flow of [the
Chinese Communist Party] money and propaganda into our K–12
schools . . .’’1 Yet, neither the bill nor its supporters have dem-
onstrated a significant amount of such funding is going to K–12
schools, or that such a ‘‘flow of propaganda’’ actually exists. Fur-
ther, the bill raises a number of administrative questions and con-
cerns for public schools and could fuel anti-Asian sentiments in
classrooms.
SUMMARY OF CONCERNS
Chinese influence has not posed a threat to Elementary and Sec-
ondary classrooms
Confucius Classrooms, which are affiliated with Confucious Insti-
tutes, are centers for Chinese culture and language established at
public and private elementary and secondary schools—either to bol-
ster a Chinese language program already at the school or to start
a new one. Many countries around the world lack quality Chinese
language and culture resources and Confucious Institutes and
Classrooms provide those resources for free.2 However, over nearly
five years, the number of U.S. Confucius Classrooms has dropped
from more than 500 to currently no more than 16.3 Experts have
summed up the current state of these programs, saying ‘‘[t]he
harsh reality is that Confucius Institutes/Confucius Classrooms
stepped up to fulfill a need that governments were not—and they
were happy to accept a ‘freebie,’Now that Confucius Institutes have
been tainted by wider distaste and suspicion of the Chinese govern-
ment, this ‘freebie’ now has a cost.’’4

Parents Defending Education (PDE), a right-wing non-profit or-
ganization, published a report in July 2023 entitled, ‘‘Little Red
Classrooms: China’s Infiltration of American K–12 Schools.’’ The
report cites the mere presence of Confucius Institutes, Confucius
Classrooms, and related ‘‘programming’’ (including local program-
ming that may have pre-dated the establishment of a Confucius
Classroom), sometimes in areas near U.S. military bases, to allege
the Classrooms exert undue Chinese influence in America.5 Despite
the claims in the report, Committee Democratic staff have been un-
able to locate credible evidence to support either the claims made
by the Majority or PDE that there is inappropriate and undue for-
eign influence in our nation’s K–12 public schools currently as a re-
sult of Confucius Classrooms. In 2019, the Senate Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ (HSGAC) Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing entitled ‘‘Chi-
na’s Impact on the U.S. Education System’’. The hearing was held
the day after the HSGAC released a bipartisan staff report with
the same title.6 While the staff report made recommendations that
schools should ensure that Chinese partnership organization’s ‘‘vet-
ting, screening and interview processes are aligned with their own
hiring protocols and procedures’’7 and that ‘‘the State Department
should demand reciprocal and fair treatments of its diplomats and
employees in China.’’,8 the Committee did not find security risks or
curriculum vulnerability, as claimed by the Majority.
H.R. 1069 Will Raise Administrative Questions and Concerns for
Public Schools
H.R. 1069 would raise a number of administrative questions and
concerns. The bill restricts funding from any U.S. Department of
Education (Department) administered programs going to schools
with direct or indirect support from the Chinese government. The
bill specifically prohibits funds from going to elementary and sec-
ondary schools that ‘‘have a partnership in effect with a cultural
or language institute directly or indirectly funded by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including a Confu-
cius Institute’’;9 operate a ‘‘learning center directly or indirectly
funded by the Government of the People’s Republic of China’’;10 or
‘‘receive support from an individual or entity acting directly or indi-
rectly on behalf of the Government of the People’s Republic of
China, including support in the form of teaching materials, per-
sonnel, funds, or other resources.’’11
Implementing the text of H.R. 1069 in public schools will likely
be massive administrative burden. First, a school may not even be
aware that a funder or partnership entity it works with has ties
to China that would be prohibited under the bill. Often local busi-

nesses partner with schools to provide support for students, a com-
mon community practice throughout the U.S. If, for example, a res-
taurant donates a free dinner to students in conjunction with a
school achievement, and the owner has ‘‘ties’’ to China that could
be implicated by H.R. 1069 (e.g., is a legal Chinese immigrant, with
a work visa), it is unclear whether such donations would be prohib-
ited under this bill.
Second, a plain language interpretation of the bill text suggests
that if an individual with Chinese citizenship wanted to donate a
new field, an HVAC system, or work at an elementary or secondary
school, that school could potentially lose their funds administered
under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965
(ESEA) because the bill lacks detail on how to determine whether
someone is indirectly acting on behalf of the Chinese government.
Such concern about whether any Chinese national could be classi-
fied as someone who acts directly or indirectly for the Chinese gov-
ernment is complicated for multiple reasons. Unilaterally claiming
anyone who possesses Chinese citizenship is directly or indirectly
under the control of the PRC has negative social and economic con-
sequences. This was evident in the Department of Justice’s China
Initiative which unfairly accused Chinese researchers of being spies
resulting in charges that were ultimately dismissed after ruining
the careers of several researchers.12 For example, Gang Chen, a
Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was
falsely accused of being a Chinese spy and investigated by the De-
partment of Justice (DOJ) because of his identity.13 Although all
charges against him were dismissed, the negative impact on his
personal and professional life from being arrested in front of his
wife and children and being placed on administrative leave from
work resulted in irreparable career damage and drove Dr. Chen to
leave his profession.14
That is not to say that the PRC has clean hands. Amnesty Inter-
national has recently reported on Chinese transnational repression,
the effort by the PRC government to harass, intimidate, or surveil
Chinese nationals, particularly students, while they are abroad.15
The report documents PRC efforts to intimidate students to self-
censor in both academic and social settings, and to make certain
research and career decisions.16 Ironically, to the extent the deplor-
able efforts of the PRC are successful, it would strengthen argu-
ments that Chinese students are inherently under some form of
control by the PRC.
The likely result under this bill would be a chilling effect on
schools working with Chinese nationals and Chinese-Americans.
Schools may not feel comfortable accepting gifts from Chinese na-
tionals unless the donor can provide them with documentation that

they are not working with the Chinese government—which would
likely be impossible to disprove to anyone looking for such a link-
age. Further, this could seriously impact the ability of U.S. schools
and foreign language education programs to hire Chinese-American
Mandarin teachers and educational specialists as they would also
likely have ties in China that could dissuade schools from working
with them, for fear of losing federal funds.
Public Schools Would Be the Most Impacted by H.R. 1069
Although H.R. 1069 applies to all elementary and secondary
schools, public schools would be disproportionately impacted since
private schools typically do not receive federal funds directly
through ESEA programs. Therefore, even though the bill’s prohibi-
tions would apply to private schools, there would be no method to
enforce such a prohibition under the bill, since they likely have no
federal funds that could be rescinded.
H.R. 1069 has the Potential to Limit Chinese Language and Cul-
tural Exchange Programs
As discussed earlier, under H.R. 1069 schools may avoid collabo-
rations with ‘‘Chinese language and cultural institutes’’,17 and
‘‘learning centers’’18 fearing regulatory complications or loss of fed-
eral funding. This will have the unintended result of reducing the
diversity of educational experiences available to students. There is
a mountain of evidence to support the notion that a bilingual popu-
lation boosts the economy and opens the door for increased earn-
ings and job opportunities.19 Additionally, bilingualism promotes
cultural awareness and competency.20 H.R. 1069 has the potential
to weaken the future of America’s labor force by decreasing student
access to vital skills that are beneficial for successful futures.
H.R. 1069 Could Further Fuel Anti-Asian Sentiment and Actions
In attempting to target Chinese government influence in schools,
H.R. 1069 could further fuel anti-Asian sentiments, which are al-
ready prevalent in the U.S. For example, Stop AAPI Hate, a U.S.-
based coalition with the goal of stopping racism and discrimination
against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), has re-
ported receiving over 11,000 incidents of hate driven by anti-Asian
rhetoric from the start of the COVID pandemic in March 2021 to
March 2022.21 It is important that we do not further such senti-
ments and cause unnecessary alarm and suspicion in school staff,
parents and communities due to increased discrimination against

DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1069
Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–VA) put forward an amend-
ment to provide funds to assist schools with the administrative
burden of complying with the bill. Significant effort may need to be
expended to investigate existing and new contracts, and to deter-
mine whether existing or potential business partners have ties to
the PRC that could be implicated by the bill. The amendment au-
thorized $300 million for fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent fis-
cal year to carry out the requirements in the bill.22 Committee Re-
publicans rejected this amendment on a party- line vote.
Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) put forward an
amendment designed to ensure the Department of Education, and
no other agency, is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of
this legislation. Over the past several weeks, President Trump has
suggested he will have a plan soon to eliminate the Department of
Education, calling into question how this bill would be adminis-
tered. Yet H.R. 1069 specifically calls for funds that are adminis-
tered by the Department of Education to be withheld if schools do
not comply. Therefore, the Bonamici amendment sought to ensure
that the Department be the sole agency empowered to enforce the
bill. However, Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on
a party-line vote.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1069 is a solution in search of a problem. While the Major-
ity claims that the Chinese government is infiltrating our school
systems and brainwashing our children—or has the ability to do so
if left unchecked—there is no such evidence. Further, the legisla-
tion disproportionately punishes public schools and leaves them
with a significant administrative burden. Lastly, it could further
fuel anti-Asian sentiments. For the reasons stated above, we urge
the House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 1069.

22According to the National Center for Education Statistics in the Institute of Education
Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education, there were 99,388 public elementary and sec-
ondary schools for the 2022–2023 school year. NCES, Digest of Education Statistics tbl. 216.10
(2023), https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_216.10.asp. Three hundred million
dollars would provide $3,000 per year to each of those schools to offset the costs of compliance.
In reality, the administrative burden this bill poses could easily require a full time administra-
tive staff person at each school.

COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
fostered relationships with American K–12 schools through grants,
sister school partnerships, and other programming called Confucius
Classrooms.

China’s Activity in U.S. K–12 Schools
Styled as language and culture programs, Confucius Classrooms
are an important element of the CCP’s global influence campaign.
The Chinese government’s effort to forge ties with American
schools through its Ministry of Education Office of Chinese Lan-
guage Council International, which until recently was known as
‘‘Hanban,’’ is one facet of the CCP’s broader soft-power strategy to
influence policy in nations throughout the world. The United States
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that ex-
panding Confucius Classrooms in the United States has been a top
priority for the Chinese government.1 Many K–12 schools accepted
CCP-linked grants, which come with perks including fully funded
teacher exchanges, Chinese language programs, and opportunities
for American students to learn in China.2
Confucious Classrooms are smaller-scale, K–12 versions of
Confucious Institutes that the CCP has pushed for on U.S. college
campuses. These institutes purport to teach Chinese language and
culture. Confucius Institutes are established as partnerships be-
tween a host institution, a Chinese partner (usually a Chinese uni-
versity), and a Chinese government agency. The Ministry of Edu-
cation Office of Chinese Language Council International funds each
Confucius Institute, often at around $100,000 per year, and asks
host institutions to match those funds with their own contributions,
usually classroom and office space.
China heavily encouraged the creation of Confucius Classrooms,
and many of these developed as offshoots of Confucius Institutes.
China strategically deployed and rapidly expanded its Confucius
Classrooms, going from very few in 2008 to more than a thousand
worldwide by 2017. More than 500 American K–12 schools have
hosted Confucius Classrooms, aided in part by the Asia Society, an
American nonprofit that previously ran a network of 100 Confucius
Classrooms before they ended the partnership in 2021.3 A Parents
Defending Education report tracked Chinese affiliation in 143
schools across 34 states—with at least seven still active as of publi-
cation.4
Confucius Institute funding comes with strings attached that
compromise academic freedom. The Chinese government approves
teachers, events, and speakers and requires teachers to sign con-
tracts pledging they will not damage the national interests of
China. The contracts make clear Chinese directors or teachers will
be terminated if they ‘‘violate Chinese laws’’ or ‘‘engage in activities
detrimental to national interests’’ and states that they must ‘‘con-
scientiously safeguard national interests.’’5
It is imperative to ensure that American students are not subject
to malicious foreign influence in their schools. As such, the PRO-
TECT Act prohibits federal education funds from being given to
any elementary school or secondary school that directly or indi-

rectly receives support from the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China. Forms of support may include partnerships with cul-
tural or language institutes funded by China, such as the Confu-
cius Institute; operation of Confucius Classrooms supported by
China; and teaching materials, personnel, or funds received from
an individual or entity acting on behalf of the Chinese govern-
ment.6
CONCLUSION
It is unacceptable that the CCP is attempting to influence U.S.
K–12 schools. Congress should take immediate action to ensure
that students are not being indoctrinated with communist propa-
ganda. H.R. 1069 will help ensure that the Chinese government
does not take advantage of local school districts and the parents
and students in them.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1069 is to prohibit fed-
eral education funds from being given to any elementary school or
secondary school that directly or indirectly receives support from
the Government of the People’s Republic of China.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 1069 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 1069: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1069 would prohibit elementary or secondary schools that
receive direct or indirect support from an individual or entity rep-
resenting the government of the People’s Republic of China (includ-
ing Confucius Institutes) from receiving funds from the Depart-
ment of Education.
CBO expects that schools would comply with the new require-
ments; thus, enacting the bill would not affect their eligibility to re-
ceive federal funds. Based on the costs of similar activities, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost the Department of
Education less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any re-
lated spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Garrett Quenneville.
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1069. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 1069, as reported by the Committee, makes no changes to
existing law.

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1069, the Promoting Responsible Oversight Eliminate Com-
munist Teachings (PROTECT) for Our Kids Act, prohibits federal
education funds from going to elementary and secondary schools
that receive direct or indirect support from the Chinese govern-
ment. The Majority claims that this bill will ‘‘halt the flow of [the
Chinese Communist Party] money and propaganda into our K–12
schools . . .’’1 Yet, neither the bill nor its supporters have dem-
onstrated a significant amount of such funding is going to K–12
schools, or that such a ‘‘flow of propaganda’’ actually exists. Fur-
ther, the bill raises a number of administrative questions and con-
cerns for public schools and could fuel anti-Asian sentiments in
classrooms.
SUMMARY OF CONCERNS
Chinese influence has not posed a threat to Elementary and Sec-
ondary classrooms
Confucius Classrooms, which are affiliated with Confucious Insti-
tutes, are centers for Chinese culture and language established at
public and private elementary and secondary schools—either to bol-
ster a Chinese language program already at the school or to start
a new one. Many countries around the world lack quality Chinese
language and culture resources and Confucious Institutes and
Classrooms provide those resources for free.2 However, over nearly
five years, the number of U.S. Confucius Classrooms has dropped
from more than 500 to currently no more than 16.3 Experts have
summed up the current state of these programs, saying ‘‘[t]he
harsh reality is that Confucius Institutes/Confucius Classrooms
stepped up to fulfill a need that governments were not—and they
were happy to accept a ‘freebie,’Now that Confucius Institutes have
been tainted by wider distaste and suspicion of the Chinese govern-
ment, this ‘freebie’ now has a cost.’’4

Parents Defending Education (PDE), a right-wing non-profit or-
ganization, published a report in July 2023 entitled, ‘‘Little Red
Classrooms: China’s Infiltration of American K–12 Schools.’’ The
report cites the mere presence of Confucius Institutes, Confucius
Classrooms, and related ‘‘programming’’ (including local program-
ming that may have pre-dated the establishment of a Confucius
Classroom), sometimes in areas near U.S. military bases, to allege
the Classrooms exert undue Chinese influence in America.5 Despite
the claims in the report, Committee Democratic staff have been un-
able to locate credible evidence to support either the claims made
by the Majority or PDE that there is inappropriate and undue for-
eign influence in our nation’s K–12 public schools currently as a re-
sult of Confucius Classrooms. In 2019, the Senate Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ (HSGAC) Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing entitled ‘‘Chi-
na’s Impact on the U.S. Education System’’. The hearing was held
the day after the HSGAC released a bipartisan staff report with
the same title.6 While the staff report made recommendations that
schools should ensure that Chinese partnership organization’s ‘‘vet-
ting, screening and interview processes are aligned with their own
hiring protocols and procedures’’7 and that ‘‘the State Department
should demand reciprocal and fair treatments of its diplomats and
employees in China.’’,8 the Committee did not find security risks or
curriculum vulnerability, as claimed by the Majority.
H.R. 1069 Will Raise Administrative Questions and Concerns for
Public Schools
H.R. 1069 would raise a number of administrative questions and
concerns. The bill restricts funding from any U.S. Department of
Education (Department) administered programs going to schools
with direct or indirect support from the Chinese government. The
bill specifically prohibits funds from going to elementary and sec-
ondary schools that ‘‘have a partnership in effect with a cultural
or language institute directly or indirectly funded by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including a Confu-
cius Institute’’;9 operate a ‘‘learning center directly or indirectly
funded by the Government of the People’s Republic of China’’;10 or
‘‘receive support from an individual or entity acting directly or indi-
rectly on behalf of the Government of the People’s Republic of
China, including support in the form of teaching materials, per-
sonnel, funds, or other resources.’’11
Implementing the text of H.R. 1069 in public schools will likely
be massive administrative burden. First, a school may not even be
aware that a funder or partnership entity it works with has ties
to China that would be prohibited under the bill. Often local busi-

nesses partner with schools to provide support for students, a com-
mon community practice throughout the U.S. If, for example, a res-
taurant donates a free dinner to students in conjunction with a
school achievement, and the owner has ‘‘ties’’ to China that could
be implicated by H.R. 1069 (e.g., is a legal Chinese immigrant, with
a work visa), it is unclear whether such donations would be prohib-
ited under this bill.
Second, a plain language interpretation of the bill text suggests
that if an individual with Chinese citizenship wanted to donate a
new field, an HVAC system, or work at an elementary or secondary
school, that school could potentially lose their funds administered
under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965
(ESEA) because the bill lacks detail on how to determine whether
someone is indirectly acting on behalf of the Chinese government.
Such concern about whether any Chinese national could be classi-
fied as someone who acts directly or indirectly for the Chinese gov-
ernment is complicated for multiple reasons. Unilaterally claiming
anyone who possesses Chinese citizenship is directly or indirectly
under the control of the PRC has negative social and economic con-
sequences. This was evident in the Department of Justice’s China
Initiative which unfairly accused Chinese researchers of being spies
resulting in charges that were ultimately dismissed after ruining
the careers of several researchers.12 For example, Gang Chen, a
Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was
falsely accused of being a Chinese spy and investigated by the De-
partment of Justice (DOJ) because of his identity.13 Although all
charges against him were dismissed, the negative impact on his
personal and professional life from being arrested in front of his
wife and children and being placed on administrative leave from
work resulted in irreparable career damage and drove Dr. Chen to
leave his profession.14
That is not to say that the PRC has clean hands. Amnesty Inter-
national has recently reported on Chinese transnational repression,
the effort by the PRC government to harass, intimidate, or surveil
Chinese nationals, particularly students, while they are abroad.15
The report documents PRC efforts to intimidate students to self-
censor in both academic and social settings, and to make certain
research and career decisions.16 Ironically, to the extent the deplor-
able efforts of the PRC are successful, it would strengthen argu-
ments that Chinese students are inherently under some form of
control by the PRC.
The likely result under this bill would be a chilling effect on
schools working with Chinese nationals and Chinese-Americans.
Schools may not feel comfortable accepting gifts from Chinese na-
tionals unless the donor can provide them with documentation that

they are not working with the Chinese government—which would
likely be impossible to disprove to anyone looking for such a link-
age. Further, this could seriously impact the ability of U.S. schools
and foreign language education programs to hire Chinese-American
Mandarin teachers and educational specialists as they would also
likely have ties in China that could dissuade schools from working
with them, for fear of losing federal funds.
Public Schools Would Be the Most Impacted by H.R. 1069
Although H.R. 1069 applies to all elementary and secondary
schools, public schools would be disproportionately impacted since
private schools typically do not receive federal funds directly
through ESEA programs. Therefore, even though the bill’s prohibi-
tions would apply to private schools, there would be no method to
enforce such a prohibition under the bill, since they likely have no
federal funds that could be rescinded.
H.R. 1069 has the Potential to Limit Chinese Language and Cul-
tural Exchange Programs
As discussed earlier, under H.R. 1069 schools may avoid collabo-
rations with ‘‘Chinese language and cultural institutes’’,17 and
‘‘learning centers’’18 fearing regulatory complications or loss of fed-
eral funding. This will have the unintended result of reducing the
diversity of educational experiences available to students. There is
a mountain of evidence to support the notion that a bilingual popu-
lation boosts the economy and opens the door for increased earn-
ings and job opportunities.19 Additionally, bilingualism promotes
cultural awareness and competency.20 H.R. 1069 has the potential
to weaken the future of America’s labor force by decreasing student
access to vital skills that are beneficial for successful futures.
H.R. 1069 Could Further Fuel Anti-Asian Sentiment and Actions
In attempting to target Chinese government influence in schools,
H.R. 1069 could further fuel anti-Asian sentiments, which are al-
ready prevalent in the U.S. For example, Stop AAPI Hate, a U.S.-
based coalition with the goal of stopping racism and discrimination
against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), has re-
ported receiving over 11,000 incidents of hate driven by anti-Asian
rhetoric from the start of the COVID pandemic in March 2021 to
March 2022.21 It is important that we do not further such senti-
ments and cause unnecessary alarm and suspicion in school staff,
parents and communities due to increased discrimination against

DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1069
Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–VA) put forward an amend-
ment to provide funds to assist schools with the administrative
burden of complying with the bill. Significant effort may need to be
expended to investigate existing and new contracts, and to deter-
mine whether existing or potential business partners have ties to
the PRC that could be implicated by the bill. The amendment au-
thorized $300 million for fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent fis-
cal year to carry out the requirements in the bill.22 Committee Re-
publicans rejected this amendment on a party- line vote.
Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) put forward an
amendment designed to ensure the Department of Education, and
no other agency, is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of
this legislation. Over the past several weeks, President Trump has
suggested he will have a plan soon to eliminate the Department of
Education, calling into question how this bill would be adminis-
tered. Yet H.R. 1069 specifically calls for funds that are adminis-
tered by the Department of Education to be withheld if schools do
not comply. Therefore, the Bonamici amendment sought to ensure
that the Department be the sole agency empowered to enforce the
bill. However, Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on
a party-line vote.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1069 is a solution in search of a problem. While the Major-
ity claims that the Chinese government is infiltrating our school
systems and brainwashing our children—or has the ability to do so
if left unchecked—there is no such evidence. Further, the legisla-
tion disproportionately punishes public schools and leaves them
with a significant administrative burden. Lastly, it could further
fuel anti-Asian sentiments. For the reasons stated above, we urge
the House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 1069.

22According to the National Center for Education Statistics in the Institute of Education
Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education, there were 99,388 public elementary and sec-
ondary schools for the 2022–2023 school year. NCES, Digest of Education Statistics tbl. 216.10
(2023), https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_216.10.asp. Three hundred million
dollars would provide $3,000 per year to each of those schools to offset the costs of compliance.
In reality, the administrative burden this bill poses could easily require a full time administra-
