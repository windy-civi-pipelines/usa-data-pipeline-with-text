Section 2:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Recovery of Stolen Checks Act’’.
SEC. 2. ELECTION TO RECEIVE CERTAIN REPLACEMENT REFUNDS ELECTRONICALLY.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended
by adding at the end the following new subsection:
‘‘(o) ELECTIONTORECEIVECERTAINREPLACEMENTREFUNDSBYDIRECTDEPOSIT.—
Not later than the date which is 6 months after the date of the enactment of this
subsection, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations to establish procedures to allow
for taxpayers, which are otherwise eligible to receive an amount by paper check in
replacement of a lost or stolen paper check which was previously sent by the Sec-
retary as a refund of an overpayment of tax, to elect to receive such amount by di-
rect deposit in lieu of receiving such replacement paper check.’’.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by this section shall take effect on
the date of the enactment of this Act.
I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 1155, the ‘‘Recovery of Stolen Checks Act,’’ as
amended, was ordered reported by the Committee on Ways and
Means on February 12, 2025.
The bill requires that the Internal Revenue Service establish pro-
cedures to allow certain taxpayers to elect to receive a replacement
refund amount by direct deposit in lieu of receiving a replacement
paper check. Specifically, under regulations to be prescribed within
six months of the date of enactment, if a refund of an overpayment
of tax has previously been sent by paper check and that check is
lost or stolen, then the taxpayer who is otherwise eligible to receive
the replacement amount by paper check will be allowed to elect to
receive such amount by direct deposit.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
In 2022, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network received
over 680,000 Bank Secrecy Act filings related to check fraud, which
is nearly double the filings received for the previous year.1 If a tax-
payer does not receive their refund check within six weeks of mail-
ing their tax return to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the tax-
payer can request a ‘‘refund trace.’’2 Once a taxpayer has deter-
mined the refund is missing, they can ask the IRS to trace the re-
fund using the ‘‘Where’s My Refund’’ system on the IRS website.3
If a check is determined to be stolen or lost, and not cashed, a
taxpayer will receive a replacement check once the original check
is cancelled. This replacement check is sent in the same form as
the original paper check.4 However, many taxpayers are having
their replacement checks stolen as well. Taxpayers who have a

check stolen are unable to request that the replacement check be
sent via direct deposit.
There is currently no law that prohibits the IRS from allowing
taxpayers to request a replacement refund via direct deposit. How-
ever, the IRS would need to develop processes and procedures to
provide taxpayers with this service. As of now, the IRS has not de-
veloped this capability.
The Committee on Ways and Means is committed to ensuring
that taxpayers who have been victims of fraud can receive the
funds owed to them without further hassle and uncertainty. This
bill will help combat fraud and provide taxpayers with the option
to use direct deposit for a replacement check ensuring the replace-
ment check is not stolen again.
C. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
Background
H.R. 1155 was introduced on February 10, 2025, and was re-
ferred to the Committee on Ways and Means.
Committee Hearings
On February 11, 2025, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on
Oversight held a hearing on ‘‘IRS Return on Investment and the
Need for Modernization.’’
Committee Action

February 12, 2025, and order the bill, as amended, favorably re-
ported (with a quorum being present).
D. DESIGNATED HEARING

used to develop and consider H.R. 1155:
‘‘IRS Return on Investment and the Need for Modernization’’ on
February 11, 2025.
II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
A. ELECTION TO RECEIVE CERTAIN REPLACEMENT REFUNDS ELEC-
TRONICALLY (SEC. 2 OF THE BILL AND NEW SEC. 6402(n) OF THE
CODE)
PRESENT LAW

Section 3:
Section 6402(a) requires the Secretary5 to issue refunds for over-
payments of tax liabilities. As required by the Code, the Secretary
has prescribed regulations for taxpayers to report instances in
which a refund made by the Secretary by electronic funds transfer
was not transferred to the account of the taxpayer.6 The regula-
tions refer to this as a ‘‘misdirected direct deposit refund.’’7 Under
5The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Sec.

6Sec. 6402(n). Treas. Reg. sec. 301.6402–2(g).
7Treas. Reg. sec. 301.6402–2(g)(1) (‘‘The term misdirected direct deposit refund includes any
refund of an overpayment of tax that is disbursed as a direct deposit but is not deposited into
the account designated on the claim for refund to receive the direct deposit refund.’’)

the regulations, a taxpayer may report to the Internal Revenue
Service (‘‘IRS’’) that the taxpayer never received a direct deposit re-
fund and request a replacement refund.8 The report must include
the name of the taxpayer who requested the refund, the taxpayer
identification number (‘‘TIN’’) of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s mail-
ing address, the type of return to which the refund is related, the
account number and routing number that the taxpayer requested
the refund be directly deposited into, and any other information
necessary to locate the misdirected direct deposit refund.9
When the IRS has determined that a misdirected direct deposit
refund has occurred, the IRS will issue a replacement refund in the
full amount of the refund that was misdirected.10 The replacement
refund may be issued as a direct deposit or as a paper check sent
to the taxpayer’s last known address.11
REASONS FOR CHANGE
According to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the De-
partment of the Treasury (‘‘FinCEN’’), there has been a nationwide
surge in mail-theft related check fraud schemes.12 If a refund check
is determined to be stolen or lost, and not cashed, a taxpayer will
receive a replacement check once the original check is cancelled,
however, many taxpayers are having their replacement checks sto-
len as well. The Committee believes that the bill is a valuable first
step in combatting fraud. Providing taxpayers with the option to
use direct deposit ensures the replacement check is not stolen
again.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
Within six months of the date of enactment, the provision re-
quires the Secretary to prescribe regulations establishing proce-
dures to allow certain taxpayers to elect to receive a replacement
refund amount by direct deposit in lieu of receiving a replacement
paper check. Specifically, if the Secretary has previously sent a re-
fund of an overpayment of tax by paper check and that check is
lost or stolen, then the taxpayer who is otherwise eligible to receive
the replacement amount by paper check will be allowed to elect,
under procedures prescribed by the Secretary, to receive such
amount by direct deposit.
EFFECTIVE DATE
The provision is effective on date of enactment.

structuring Act of 1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the Inter-
nal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a
tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all
legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the
House Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of con-
ference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indi-
rectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has widespread ap-
plicability to individuals or small businesses.

that there are no provisions that are of widespread applicability to
individuals or small businesses.

SEC. 6402. AUTHORITY TO MAKE CREDITS OR REFUNDS.
(a) GENERAL RULE.—In the case of any overpayment, the Sec-
retary, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit the
amount of such overpayment, including any interest allowed there-
on, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on
the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall, sub-
ject to subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), refund any balance to such
person.
(b) CREDITS AGAINST ESTIMATED TAX.—The Secretary is author-
ized to prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the
estimated income tax for any taxable year of the amount deter-
mined by the taxpayer or the Secretary to be an overpayment of
the income tax for a preceding taxable year.
(c) OFFSET OF PAST-DUE SUPPORT AGAINST OVERPAYMENTS.—The
amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making
the overpayment shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due
support (as defined in section 464(c) of the Social Security Act)
owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified by
a State in accordance with section 464 of such Act. The Secretary
shall remit the amount by which the overpayment is so reduced to
the State collecting such support and notify the person making the
overpayment that so much of the overpayment as was necessary to
satisfy his obligation for past-due support has been paid to the
State. The Secretary shall apply a reduction under this subsection
first to an amount certified by the State as past due support under

Section 6:

solvent corporation.

The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Recovery of Stolen Checks Act’’.
SEC. 2. ELECTION TO RECEIVE CERTAIN REPLACEMENT REFUNDS ELECTRONICALLY.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended
by adding at the end the following new subsection:
‘‘(o) ELECTIONTORECEIVECERTAINREPLACEMENTREFUNDSBYDIRECTDEPOSIT.—
Not later than the date which is 6 months after the date of the enactment of this
subsection, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations to establish procedures to allow
for taxpayers, which are otherwise eligible to receive an amount by paper check in
replacement of a lost or stolen paper check which was previously sent by the Sec-
retary as a refund of an overpayment of tax, to elect to receive such amount by di-
rect deposit in lieu of receiving such replacement paper check.’’.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by this section shall take effect on
the date of the enactment of this Act.
I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 1155, the ‘‘Recovery of Stolen Checks Act,’’ as
amended, was ordered reported by the Committee on Ways and
Means on February 12, 2025.
The bill requires that the Internal Revenue Service establish pro-
cedures to allow certain taxpayers to elect to receive a replacement
refund amount by direct deposit in lieu of receiving a replacement
paper check. Specifically, under regulations to be prescribed within
six months of the date of enactment, if a refund of an overpayment
of tax has previously been sent by paper check and that check is
lost or stolen, then the taxpayer who is otherwise eligible to receive
the replacement amount by paper check will be allowed to elect to
receive such amount by direct deposit.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
In 2022, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network received
over 680,000 Bank Secrecy Act filings related to check fraud, which
is nearly double the filings received for the previous year.1 If a tax-
payer does not receive their refund check within six weeks of mail-
ing their tax return to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the tax-
payer can request a ‘‘refund trace.’’2 Once a taxpayer has deter-
mined the refund is missing, they can ask the IRS to trace the re-
fund using the ‘‘Where’s My Refund’’ system on the IRS website.3
If a check is determined to be stolen or lost, and not cashed, a
taxpayer will receive a replacement check once the original check
is cancelled. This replacement check is sent in the same form as
the original paper check.4 However, many taxpayers are having
their replacement checks stolen as well. Taxpayers who have a

check stolen are unable to request that the replacement check be
sent via direct deposit.
There is currently no law that prohibits the IRS from allowing
taxpayers to request a replacement refund via direct deposit. How-
ever, the IRS would need to develop processes and procedures to
provide taxpayers with this service. As of now, the IRS has not de-
veloped this capability.
The Committee on Ways and Means is committed to ensuring
that taxpayers who have been victims of fraud can receive the
funds owed to them without further hassle and uncertainty. This
bill will help combat fraud and provide taxpayers with the option
to use direct deposit for a replacement check ensuring the replace-
ment check is not stolen again.
C. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

PRESENT LAW
Section 6402(a) requires the Secretary5 to issue refunds for over-

the name of the taxpayer who requested the refund, the taxpayer
identification number (‘‘TIN’’) of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s mail-
ing address, the type of return to which the refund is related, the
account number and routing number that the taxpayer requested
the refund be directly deposited into, and any other information
necessary to locate the misdirected direct deposit refund.9
When the IRS has determined that a misdirected direct deposit
refund has occurred, the IRS will issue a replacement refund in the
full amount of the refund that was misdirected.10 The replacement
refund may be issued as a direct deposit or as a paper check sent
to the taxpayer’s last known address.11
REASONS FOR CHANGE
According to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the De-
partment of the Treasury (‘‘FinCEN’’), there has been a nationwide
surge in mail-theft related check fraud schemes.12 If a refund check
is determined to be stolen or lost, and not cashed, a taxpayer will
receive a replacement check once the original check is cancelled,
however, many taxpayers are having their replacement checks sto-
len as well. The Committee believes that the bill is a valuable first
step in combatting fraud. Providing taxpayers with the option to
use direct deposit ensures the replacement check is not stolen
again.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
Within six months of the date of enactment, the provision re-
quires the Secretary to prescribe regulations establishing proce-
dures to allow certain taxpayers to elect to receive a replacement
refund amount by direct deposit in lieu of receiving a replacement
paper check. Specifically, if the Secretary has previously sent a re-
fund of an overpayment of tax by paper check and that check is
lost or stolen, then the taxpayer who is otherwise eligible to receive
the replacement amount by paper check will be allowed to elect,
under procedures prescribed by the Secretary, to receive such
amount by direct deposit.
EFFECTIVE DATE
The provision is effective on date of enactment.

The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, stipulates
that revenue estimates provided by the staff of the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation (‘‘JCT’’) will be the official estimates for all tax
legislation considered by Congress. As such CBO incorporates these

ommendations that are reflected in this report.

With respect to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the bill does
not authorize funding, so no statement of general performance
goals and objectives is required.
C. APPLICABILITY OF HOUSE RULE XXI, CLAUSE 5(b)
Rule XXI 5(b) of the Rules of the House of Representatives pro-
vides, in part, that ‘‘A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or con-
ference report carrying a Federal income tax rate increase may not
be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a
vote of not less than three-fifths of the Members voting, a quorum
being present.’’ The Committee has carefully reviewed the bill, and

mined that the bill does not impose a Federal intergovernmental
mandate on State, local, or tribal governments.

LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-

countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139; or (3) a program related to a program identified in
the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, published
pursuant to the Federal Program Information Act (Pub. L. No. 95–
220, as amended by Pub. L. No. 98–169).

structuring Act of 1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the Inter-
nal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a
tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all
legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the
House Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of con-
ference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indi-
rectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has widespread ap-
plicability to individuals or small businesses.
The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has determined
that there are no provisions that are of widespread applicability to
individuals or small businesses.

(a) GENERAL RULE.—In the case of any overpayment, the Sec-
retary, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit the
amount of such overpayment, including any interest allowed there-
on, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on
the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall, sub-
ject to subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), refund any balance to such
person.
(b) CREDITS AGAINST ESTIMATED TAX.—The Secretary is author-
ized to prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the
estimated income tax for any taxable year of the amount deter-
mined by the taxpayer or the Secretary to be an overpayment of
the income tax for a preceding taxable year.
(c) OFFSET OF PAST-DUE SUPPORT AGAINST OVERPAYMENTS.—The
amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making
the overpayment shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due
support (as defined in section 464(c) of the Social Security Act)
owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified by
a State in accordance with section 464 of such Act. The Secretary
shall remit the amount by which the overpayment is so reduced to
the State collecting such support and notify the person making the
overpayment that so much of the overpayment as was necessary to
satisfy his obligation for past-due support has been paid to the
State. The Secretary shall apply a reduction under this subsection
first to an amount certified by the State as past due support under
section 464 of the Social Security Act before any other reductions
allowed by law. This subsection shall be applied to an overpayment
prior to its being credited to a person’s future liability for an inter-
nal revenue tax. For purposes of this subsection, any reference to
a State shall include a reference to any Indian tribe or tribal orga-

nization receiving a grant under section 455(f) of the Social Secu-
rity Act.
(d) COLLECTION OF DEBTS OWED TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Upon receiving notice from any Federal
agency that a named person owes a past-due legally enforce-
able debt (other than past-due support subject to the provisions
of subsection (c)) to such agency, the Secretary shall—
(A) reduce the amount of any overpayment payable to
such person by the amount of such debt;
(B) pay the amount by which such overpayment is re-
duced under subparagraph (A) to such agency; and
(C) notify the person making such overpayment that
such overpayment has been reduced by an amount nec-
essary to satisfy such debt.
(2) PRIORITIES FOR OFFSET.—Any overpayment by a person
shall be reduced pursuant to this subsection after such over-
payment is reduced pursuant to subsection (c) with respect to
past-due support collected pursuant to an assignment under
section 408(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 608(a)(3))
and before such overpayment is reduced pursuant to sub-
sections (e) and (f) and before such overpayment is credited to
the future liability for tax of such person pursuant to sub-
section (b). If the Secretary receives notice from a Federal
agency or agencies of more than one debt subject to paragraph
(1) that is owed by a person to such agency or agencies, any
overpayment by such person shall be applied against such
debts in the order in which such debts accrued.
(3) TREATMENT OF OASDI OVERPAYMENTS.—
(A) REQUIREMENTS.—Paragraph (1) shall apply with re-
spect to an OASDI overpayment only if the requirements
of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 3720A(f) of title 31,
United States Code, are met with respect to such overpay-
ment.
(B) NOTICE; PROTECTION OF OTHER PERSONS FILING JOINT
RETURN.—
(i) NOTICE.—In the case of a debt consisting of an
OASDI overpayment, if the Secretary determines upon
receipt of the notice referred to in paragraph (1) that
the refund from which the reduction described in para-
graph (1)(A) would be made is based upon a joint re-
turn, the Secretary shall—
(I) notify each taxpayer filing such joint return
that the reduction is being made from a refund
based upon such return, and
(II) include in such notification a description of
the procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint
return, to protect the share of the refund which
may be payable to another person.
(ii) ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON PROTECTIONS GIVEN TO
OTHER TAXPAYERS ON JOINT RETURN.—If the other per-
son filing a joint return with the person owing the
OASDI overpayment takes appropriate action to se-
cure his or her proper share of the refund subject to
reduction under this subsection, the Secretary shall
pay such share to such other person. The Secretary

shall deduct the amount of such payment from
amounts which are derived from subsequent reduc-
tions in refunds under this subsection and are payable
to a trust fund referred to in subparagraph (C).

PRIATE TRUST FUND.—In lieu of payment, pursuant to
paragraph (1)(B), of the amount of any reduction under

Secretary shall deposit such amount in the Federal Old-
Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal
Disability Insurance Trust Fund, whichever is certified to
the Secretary as appropriate by the Commissioner of So-
cial Security.
(D) OASDI OVERPAYMENT.—For purposes of this para-
graph, the term ‘‘OASDI overpayment’’ means any over-
payment of benefits made to an individual under title II of
the Social Security Act.
(e) COLLECTION OF PAST-DUE, LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE STATE IN-
COME TAX OBLIGATIONS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Upon receiving notice from any State that
a named person owes a past-due, legally enforceable State in-
come tax obligation to such State, the Secretary shall, under
such conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary—
(A) reduce the amount of any overpayment payable to
such person by the amount of such State income tax obli-
gation;
(B) pay the amount by which such overpayment is re-
duced under subparagraph (A) to such State and notify
such State of such person’s name, taxpayer identification
number, address, and the amount collected; and
(C) notify the person making such overpayment that the
overpayment has been reduced by an amount necessary to
satisfy a past-due, legally enforceable State income tax ob-
ligation.
If an offset is made pursuant to a joint return, the notice under
subparagraph (B) shall include the names, taxpayer identifica-
tion numbers, and addresses of each person filing such return.
(2) OFFSET PERMITTED ONLY AGAINST RESIDENTS OF STATE
SEEKING OFFSET.—Paragraph (1) shall apply to an overpay-
ment by any person for a taxable year only if the address
shown on the Federal return for such taxable year of the over-
payment is an address within the State seeking the offset.
(3) PRIORITIES FOR OFFSET.—Any overpayment by a person
shall be reduced pursuant to this subsection—
(A) after such overpayment is reduced pursuant to—
(i) subsection (a) with respect to any liability for any
internal revenue tax on the part of the person who
made the overpayment;
(ii) subsection (c) with respect to past-due support;
and
(iii) subsection (d) with respect to any past-due, le-
gally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency; and

ability for any Federal internal revenue tax of such person
pursuant to subsection (b).

If the Secretary receives notice from one or more agencies of
the State of more than one debt subject to paragraph (1) or
subsection (f) that is owed by such person to such an agency,
any overpayment by such person shall be applied against such
debts in the order in which such debts accrued.
(4) NOTICE; CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENCE.—No State may
take action under this subsection until such State—
(A) notifies by certified mail with return receipt the per-
son owing the past-due State income tax liability that the
State proposes to take action pursuant to this section;
(B) gives such person at least 60 days to present evi-
dence that all or part of such liability is not past-due or
not legally enforceable;
(C) considers any evidence presented by such person and
determines that an amount of such debt is past-due and le-
gally enforceable; and
(D) satisfies such other conditions as the Secretary may
prescribe to ensure that the determination made under
subparagraph (C) is valid and that the State has made
reasonable efforts to obtain payment of such State income
tax obligation.
(5) PAST-DUE, LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE STATE INCOME TAX OB-
LIGATION.—For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘past-due,
legally enforceable State income tax obligation’’ means a debt—
(A)(i) which resulted from—
(I) a judgment rendered by a court of competent ju-
risdiction which has determined an amount of State
income tax to be due; or
(II) a determination after an administrative hearing
which has determined an amount of State income tax
to be due; and
(ii) which is no longer subject to judicial review; or
(B) which resulted from a State income tax which has
been assessed but not collected, the time for redetermina-
tion of which has expired, and which has not been delin-
quent for more than 10 years.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘State income tax’’ in-
cludes any local income tax administered by the chief tax ad-
ministration agency of the State.
(6) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary shall issue regulations pre-
scribing the time and manner in which States must submit no-
tices of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obliga-
tions and the necessary information that must be contained in
or accompany such notices. The regulations shall specify the
types of State income taxes and the minimum amount of debt
to which the reduction procedure established by paragraph (1)
may be applied. The regulations may require States to pay a
fee to reimburse the Secretary for the cost of applying such
procedure. Any fee paid to the Secretary pursuant to the pre-
ceding sentence shall be used to reimburse appropriations
which bore all or part of the cost of applying such procedure.
(7) ERRONEOUS PAYMENT TO STATE.—Any State receiving no-
tice from the Secretary that an erroneous payment has been
made to such State under paragraph (1) shall pay promptly to
the Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as the Sec-

(A) reduce the amount of any overpayment payable to
such person by the amount of such covered unemployment
compensation debt;
(B) pay the amount by which such overpayment is re-
duced under subparagraph (A) to such State and notify
such State of such person’s name, taxpayer identification
number, address, and the amount collected; and
(C) notify the person making such overpayment that the
overpayment has been reduced by an amount necessary to
satisfy a covered unemployment compensation debt.
If an offset is made pursuant to a joint return, the notice under
subparagraph (C) shall include information related to the
rights of a spouse of a person subject to such an offset.
(2) PRIORITIES FOR OFFSET.—Any overpayment by a person

made the overpayment;
(ii) subsection (c) with respect to past-due support;
and
(iii) subsection (d) with respect to any past-due, le-
gally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency; and
(B) before such overpayment is credited to the future li-
ability for any Federal internal revenue tax of such person
pursuant to subsection (b).
If the Secretary receives notice from a State or States of more
than one debt subject to paragraph (1) or subsection (e) that
is owed by a person to such State or States, any overpayment
by such person shall be applied against such debts in the order
in which such debts accrued.

dence that all or part of such liability is not legally en-
forceable or is not a covered unemployment compensation
debt;

able and is a covered unemployment compensation debt;

reasonable efforts to obtain payment of such covered un-
employment compensation debt.
(4) COVERED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION DEBT.—For pur-
poses of this subsection, the term ‘‘covered unemployment com-
pensation debt’’ means—
(A) a past-due debt for erroneous payment of unemploy-
ment compensation due to fraud or the person’s failure to
report earnings which has become final under the law of
a State certified by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to sec-
tion 3304 and which remains uncollected;

(5) REGULATIONS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may issue regulations
prescribing the time and manner in which States must
submit notices of covered unemployment compensation
debt and the necessary information that must be contained
in or accompany such notices. The regulations may specify
the minimum amount of debt to which the reduction proce-
dure established by paragraph (1) may be applied.
(B) FEE PAYABLE TO SECRETARY.—The regulations may
require States to pay a fee to the Secretary, which may be
deducted from amounts collected, to reimburse the Sec-
retary for the cost of applying such procedure. Any fee
paid to the Secretary pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be used to reimburse appropriations which bore all or
part of the cost of applying such procedure.
(C) SUBMISSION OF NOTICES THROUGH SECRETARY OF
LABOR.—The regulations may include a requirement that

tion debt to the Secretary via the Secretary of Labor in ac-
cordance with procedures established by the Secretary of
Labor. Such procedures may require States to pay a fee to
the Secretary of Labor to reimburse the Secretary of Labor
for the costs of applying this subsection. Any such fee shall
be established in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury. Any fee paid to the Secretary of Labor may be
deducted from amounts collected and shall be used to re-
imburse the appropriation account which bore all or part
of the cost of applying this subsection.
(6) ERRONEOUS PAYMENT TO STATE.—Any State receiving no-
tice from the Secretary that an erroneous payment has been
made to such State under paragraph (1) shall pay promptly to
the Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as the Sec-
retary may prescribe, an amount equal to the amount of such
erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other
amounts payable to such State under such paragraph have
been paid to such State).
(g) REVIEW OF REDUCTIONS.—No court of the United States shall
have jurisdiction to hear any action, whether legal or equitable,
brought to restrain or review a reduction authorized by subsection

the Secretary in an administrative proceeding. No action brought
against the United States to recover the amount of any such reduc-
tion shall be considered to be a suit for refund of tax. This sub-
section does not preclude any legal, equitable, or administrative ac-
tion against the Federal agency or State to which the amount of
such reduction was paid or any such action against the Commis-
sioner of Social Security which is otherwise available with respect
to recoveries of overpayments of benefits under section 204 of the
Social Security Act.

treated as a payment to the person or persons making the overpay-
ment.

cation of the Secretary, see section 3721 of title 31, United States

filiated group of corporations filing a consolidated return for any
taxable year and which is subject to a statutory or court-appointed
fiduciary, the Secretary may by regulation provide that any refund
for such taxable year may be paid on behalf of such insolvent cor-
poration to such fiduciary to the extent that the Secretary deter-
mines that the refund is attributable to losses or credits of such in-
solvent corporation.
(l) EXPLANATION OF REASON FOR REFUND DISALLOWANCE.—In the
case of a disallowance of a claim for refund, the Secretary shall
provide the taxpayer with an explanation for such disallowance.
(m) EARLIEST DATE FOR CERTAIN REFUNDS.—No credit or refund
of an overpayment for a taxable year shall be made to a taxpayer
before the 15th day of the second month following the close of such
taxable year if a credit is allowed to such taxpayer under section
24 (by reason of subsection (d) thereof) or 32 for such taxable year.
(n) MISDIRECTED DIRECT DEPOSIT REFUND.—Not later than the
date which is 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Tax-

to receive such amount by direct deposit in lieu of receiving such re-
placement paper check.
