PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations bill funds the Department of Defense’s activi-
ties related to military construction; family housing construction,
maintenance, and oversight; and environmental remediation at
closed military bases. The bill also funds the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, including programs to assist veterans, such as dis-
ability and pension benefits, education, healthcare, and insurance
and loan programs. The bill funds four related agencies that honor
and respect the Nation’s veterans including the American Battle
Monuments Commission; Cemeterial Expenses, Army (including
Arlington National Cemetery); the U.S. Court of Appeals for Vet-
erans Claims; and the Armed Forces Retirement Home.
SUMMARY OF COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $453,665,619,000 in total budget au-
thority for the fiscal year 2026 programs and activities funded in
the bill.
The bill includes $301,574,619,000 for mandatory programs and
$152,091,000,000 for discretionary programs.
The bill provides $17,989,000,000 for military construction and
family housing. This is an increase of $480,000,000 above the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.
The bill provides $435,333,099,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the
Department of Veterans Affairs, which is an increase of
$67,604,483,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of the
total, $301,574,619,000 is provided for mandatory benefit programs
and $133,758,480,000 is provided for discretionary programs, which
is a 13 percent increase above the fiscal year 2025 level. Of the
total for fiscal year 2026, $131,439,000,000 for veterans’ healthcare
was advanced in the fiscal year 2025 Full-Year Continuing Appro-
priations and Extensions Act, 2023 (P.L 119–4).
For fiscal year 2027, the Committee recommendation includes
$122,258,000,000 in advance appropriations for the four veterans’
medical care accounts and $262,103,337,000 in advance appropria-
tions for mandatory benefits programs.
The Committee recommendation provides a total of $324,101,000,
which is $178,209,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level for
the four Related Agencies: The American Battle Monuments Com-
mission, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Army
Cemeterial Expenses (including Arlington National Cemetery), and
the Armed Forces Retirement Home.
The Committee notes that the President’s Budget Request in-
cludes several important proposals to reform and reorganize the
Federal government. The Committee applauds these efforts to im-
prove efficiency while reducing waste, fraud and abuse. Such re-

forms are long overdue. The Committee notes that the authorizing
committees of jurisdiction have not yet had the opportunity to con-
sider these reorganizational proposals. Accordingly, the Commit-
tee’s bill and report reflect the current organizational structure of
the agencies funded herein. The Committee looks forward to work-
ing with the authorizing committees of jurisdictions as they act on
the President’s proposed organization reforms.
Advertising Contracts for Small Business.—The Committee un-
derstands that, as the largest advertiser in the United States, the
Federal government should work to ensure fair access to its adver-
tising contracts for small, disadvantaged businesses and businesses
owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs each de-
partment and agency to include the following information in its fis-
cal year 2026 budget justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2024
and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2026, respectively, for (1)
all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the ad-
vertising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged
small businesses concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women-and minority-
owned businesses.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $17,509,242,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 17,989,000,000
Military construction accounts provide funds for new construc-
tion, construction improvements, planning and design, and host na-
tion support. Projects funded by these accounts include facilities for
operations, training, readiness, maintenance, research and develop-
ment, supply, medical care, and force protection as well as unac-
companied housing, military-owned family housing, utilities infra-
structure, and land acquisition.
COMMITTEE DIRECTIVES
In addition to the notification and reporting requirements for
military construction programs contained in Title 10, United States
Code, the Committee’s recommendations include several provisions
requiring the Department of Defense to report on various aspects
of military construction programs and to provide notification to the
Committee when certain actions are taken. The Committee also re-
tains prior approval authority for any reprogramming of funds ex-
ceeding a specific threshold.
Reprogramming Guidelines.—The following reprogramming
guidelines apply for all military construction and family housing
projects. A project or account (including the sub-elements of an ac-
count) that has been specifically reduced by Congress in acting on
the budget request is considered to be a Congressional interest
item and as such, prior approval is required. Accordingly, no re-
programming to an item specifically reduced below the threshold
by Congress is permitted, except that the Department may seek re-
programming for appropriated increments.

The reprogramming criteria that applies to military construction
projects is 25 percent of the funded amount or $6,000,000 and in-
cludes new housing construction projects and improvements. To
provide the Services the flexibility to proceed with construction con-
tracts without disruption or delay, the costs associated with envi-
ronmental hazard remediation such as asbestos removal, radon
abatement, lead-based paint removal or abatement, and any other
legislated environmental hazard remediation may be excluded, if
such remediation requirements could not be reasonably anticipated
at the time of the budget submission. Reprogramming is a courtesy
provided to the Department by the Committee and can be taken
away if the authority is abused. This exclusion applies to projects
authorized in this budget year as well as projects authorized in
prior years for which construction has not been completed. Design
costs associated with military construction and family housing
projects may also be excluded from these guidelines. In instances
where prior approval for a reprogramming request for a project or
account has been received from the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress, the adjusted amount approved becomes
the new base for any future increase or decrease via below-thresh-
old reprogramming (provided that the project or account is not a
Congressional interest item as defined above).
In addition to these guidelines, the Services are directed to ad-
here to the guidance for military construction reprogramming ac-
tions and notifications, including the pertinent statutory authori-
ties contained in DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14–
R and relevant updates and policy memoranda. The Committee fur-
ther encourages the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
to use a format similar to that used by the Office of the Secretary
of Defense to submit reprogramming requests.
Bid Savings.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit 1002 reports on military construction bid savings not later
than 180 days after enactment of this Act, and biannually there-
after, to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress.
Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization
(FSRM).—The Department is directed to continue describing on
form 1390 the backlog of FSRM requirements at installations with
future construction projects. For troop housing requests, form 1391
should describe any FSRM conducted in the past two years. Like-
wise, future requirements for unaccompanied housing at the cor-
responding installation should be included. Additionally, the forms
should include English equivalent measurements for projects pre-
sented in metric measurement. Rules for funding repairs of facili-
ties under the operation and maintenance accounts are described
below:
(1) components of the facility may be repaired by replace-
ment. Such replacement can be up to current standards or
codes;
(2) interior arrangements and restorations may be included
as repair;
(3) additions and new facilities, may be done concurrently
with repair projects as long as the final conjunctively funded
project is a complete and usable facility; and

(4) the appropriate Service Secretary shall notify the appro-
priate committees 21 days prior to carrying out any repair
project with an estimated cost in excess of $7,500,000.
Quarterly Summary of Notifications.—The Committee directs the
Services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (on behalf of
itself and defense agencies) to continue to submit a quarterly re-
port listing all notifications that have been submitted to the Com-
mittees during the preceding three-month period.
Incremental Funding of Projects.—In general, the Committee
supports full funding for military construction projects if they are
executable. However, it continues to be the practice of the Com-
mittee to provide incremental funding for certain large projects to
enable the Services to more efficiently allocate military construc-
tion dollars among projects that can be executed in the year of ap-
propriation.
Transfer of Funds to and from the Foreign Currency Fluctua-
tions, Construction, Defense Account.—Committee directs the De-
partment of Defense to submit a quarterly report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the transfer
of funds from military construction and family housing accounts to
the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Construction, Defense account.
The report shall specify the amount transferred to the Foreign Cur-
rency account from each military construction and/or family hous-
ing account, and all other accounts for which an appropriation is
provided in this Act, during the preceding fiscal quarter, and the
amounts transferred from the Foreign Currency account to the
above accounts during the same period. This report shall be sub-
mitted no later than 30 days after the close of each fiscal quarter.
In addition, the Department shall notify the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress within 7 days of transferring
any amount in excess of $10,000,000 to or from the Foreign Cur-
rency account.
Unfunded Priority List (UPL) and Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP).—The Committee directs the Department of Defense and
Military Services, active and reserve components as well as Com-
batant Commanders, as required by law, to submit a UPL and
FYDP to the congressional defense committees for military con-
struction projects no later than 10 days and 5 days, respectively,
after the President’s budget is submitted to Congress.
Work in Progress or Planned (WIP) Curve.—The Committee di-
rects the Services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (on be-
half of itself and defense agencies) to submit a WIP curve for each
project requested in a budget submission above $90,000,000 with
the form 1391 justification to the congressional defense committees.
The Committee also directs the Secretary of Defense to report to
the congressional defense committees quarterly, beginning in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and each quarter thereafter, of
projects that remain unawarded from the current and prior fiscal
years and the reasons for delay.
ITEMS OF INTEREST
Additive Manufacturing.—The Committee recognizes that recent
advancements in additive manufacturing warrant continued re-
search into local material sourcing for autonomous construction.
The Department of Defense’s 2021 Additive Manufacturing (AM)

Strategy emphasizes AM’s potential to enhance operational readi-
ness by enabling rapid, on-site production of components, thereby
reducing reliance on extended supply chains. Additionally, aca-
demic studies have demonstrated that AM can decrease labor costs,
reduce material waste, and create customized complex geometries,
which are particularly beneficial in challenging construction envi-
ronments.
The Committee encourages the Department of Defense to further
explore and implement these innovative technologies in future in-
frastructure projects. Moreover, the Committee recommends
prioritizing applications in extreme weather environments that re-
quire enhanced protection from adversaries—such as Guam, where
military construction premiums are significantly higher due to geo-
graphic distance, and locations like Alaska and Poland, where se-
vere cold accelerates infrastructure deterioration.
Advanced Nuclear Power for Military Installations Program
(ANPI).—The Committee recognizes the need to expand energy re-
silience across the Department of Defense and notes the potential
for the ANPI program to improve installation level energy resil-
ience. The Committee encourages the Secretary of Defense to work
within the Department and with external partners to identify po-
tential infrastructure needs for the ANPI.
Barracks and Dormitories.—The Committee remains concerned
about the inadequate conditions of DOD unaccompanied housing
and continues to direct the Department to expeditiously address
the findings of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report
entitled, ‘‘Military Barracks: Poor Living Conditions Undermine
Quality of Life and Readiness’’ (GAO–23–105797). The Committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to report not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act of amounts utilized across the Depart-
ment of Defense to address the recommendations by GAO in prior
fiscal years and amounts required over the fiscal year 2026 to fiscal
2030 period for such purposes, and a long-term estimate of re-
sources needed to fully address the findings in the report and en-
sure long-term commitment to quality barracks and dormitories
across the Department of Defense.
Building Materials.—The Committee supports the use by the De-
partment of a diversity of building materials, and directs the De-
partment to ensure selected building materials are mature, cost ef-
fective, and advance the performance, sustainability, reliability,
and resiliency of DoD infrastructure. The Committee believes that
Federal resources are best utilized when all materials can compete
on their own merits, allowing for the best solutions to address our
infrastructure challenges. The Committee further notes the need
for building materials and heating systems to undergo rigorous
testing, including in extreme temperature and conditions.
Camp Bull Simons Child Development Center.—The Committee
is concerned with the lack of affordable and accessible childcare for
servicemembers stationed at Camp Bull Simons and Eglin Air
Force Base. The Army and the Air Force stood up a task force to
review and propose solutions to construct a child development cen-
ter that would meet the needs of affected families. The Committee
directs the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force to brief the
Committee within 30 days of enactment of this Act on their fund-
ing plans for fiscal year 2026 with respect to construction of a CDC

serving the families at these installations and what steps the Serv-
ices are taking to expeditiously provide for a permanent childcare
solution for families at Eglin Air Force Base and Camp Bull Si-
mons.
Child Development Centers.—The Committee continues to be con-
cerned about the chronic shortage of quality childcare at Depart-
ment of Defense installations. The Committee encourages the De-
partment of Defense and the Services to consider innovative solu-
tions to improve childcare delivery on military installations, includ-
ing programs similar to other successful public-private partner-
ships at the Department. The Secretary of Defense, in conjunction
with the Services, shall deliver to the Committees on Appropria-
tions a report on new potential solutions to the childcare chal-
lenges, including an evaluation of the feasibility of utilizing public-
private partnerships to deliver childcare at Department installa-
tions, no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act.
Demolition of Excess Infrastructure.—The bill includes
$75,000,000 for unspecified minor military construction for demoli-
tion across the active and reserve components. The Committee is
concerned about the amount of excess and obsolete infrastructure
found on installations. While the Committee understands the need
to balance demolition with other infrastructure needs, excess infra-
structure can be costly to maintain and divert resources away from
current requirements.
Diego Garcia.—The Committee notes the strategic importance of
Diego Garcia in current and future conflicts. To better understand
the Department of Defense’s needs to support the security and in-
frastructure of the installation, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide a report, not later than 180 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, summarizing the plans for
military construction and associated infrastructure needs to maxi-
mize the effectiveness of an enhanced posture in USINDOPACOM.
Specifically, this report should contain an assessment of how the
transfer of sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago from the United
Kingdom to Mauritius impacts the Department of Defense’s mili-
tary construction plans at the base.
Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense System on Guam.—
Not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Defense shall submit a report to the Committee on Appro-
priations of the deployment of the Enhanced Integrated Air Missile
Defense System on Guam detailing the impacts on public infra-
structure in Guam along with a plan to mitigate any negative ef-
fects. Not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of Defense shall consult with the Committee on the ele-
ments to be evaluated as part of the report.
Evan’s Law.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
report to the congressional defense committees not later than 90
days after enactment of this Act on the implementation of Evan’s
Law and the use of funds to retrofit or install fall prevention de-
vices in both privatized and military-owned housing. The report
shall include information on the use of funds for such purpose in
prior fiscal years and the planned use of funds for such purpose in
fiscal year 2026, and steps already taken and planned for fiscal
year 2026 by the Department to ensure consistent implementation
of Evan’s Law across both privatized and military-owning housing.

Guam Military Housing.—The Committee directs the Secretary
of Defense, in coordination with the Secretaries of the military de-
partments, to submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations
not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, detailing
the cost implications and feasibility of transitioning military hous-
ing on Guam to a Public-Private Partnership model. Not later than
30 days after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary is directed
to consult with the Committee on the elements to be evaluated as
part of the report.
Hydro-Vacuum Excavation.—The Committee is aware that, ac-
cording to construction industry reporting, 180,471 unique inci-
dents of damage to underground utilities occurred across the
United States during civilian infrastructure projects in 2023. The
Committee is concerned that such utility strikes contribute to
project delays, increased costs, and disruptions to essential services
in communities surrounding construction sites, particularly when
alternative excavation methods—such as hand-digging—are used.
The Committee is further concerned that utility strikes during
military construction projects present an additional risk, as result-
ing service interruptions could adversely impact military readiness
and operational continuity. Therefore, the Committee urges the De-
partment of Defense to incorporate hydro-vacuum excavation meth-
ods when locating underground utilities in advance of military con-
struction activities, to reduce the risk of accidental strikes and en-
sure continuity of operations.
Innovative Construction Methods.—The Committee is aware of
interest across the Department of Defense, including the U.S. Army
Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) in innovative con-
struction solutions to address the challenges of operating in remote
or disaster-prone locations. These challenges include limited access
to traditional construction materials, long logistical timelines, and
vulnerability to extreme weather or natural disasters.
The Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to prioritize and
support efforts by SMDC and other entities at the Department to
identify, evaluate, and pilot novel construction methods, such as
modular systems, additive manufacturing, and rapid-deployable
structures, that can enhance the resilience, speed, and sustain-
ability of infrastructure in austere environments.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the Committee within 90 days of the enactment of this
Act outlining current requirements, pilot projects under consider-
ation, and potential resourcing gaps.
Laboratory Infrastructure.—The Committee is concerned that
aging laboratory infrastructure threatens the ability of Services to
maintain the advanced technology necessary to keep ahead of U.S.
adversaries across all domains. Accordingly, the Committee pro-
vides an additional $105,000,000 for laboratory infrastructure
projects. The Services are directed to provide a spend plan not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act regarding the use of these
funds.
Linear Power Generation.—The Committee understands that fuel
agnostic linear generators can achieve over 50% net system effi-
ciency, are compatible with more than 22 fuel types, and can house
2 megawatts of power in a standard 20-foot shipping container.
These systems can shift between different fuel types in real-time

without depleting fuel tanks or requiring hardware changes. The
committee encourages the DoD to invest in scalable, fuel agnostic
linear power generation as a means of improving grid resiliency at
military installations.
Mass Timber.—The Committee is aware that the use of cross
laminated timber and other mass timber products as a building
material has the potential to reduce costs, limit environmental im-
pact, and increase functionality of various military structures. The
Committee encourages the Department of Defense to continue ex-
ploring the application of these innovative technologies in future
planning and design for military construction projects.
Military Construction Needs.—The Committee recognizes efforts
by the Military Services to explore innovative means by which to
meet military construction needs. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Assistant Secretaries for Energy, Installations, and Environ-
ment of each Military Service to submit a report, no later than 120
days after enactment, to include the following:
(a) A feasibility assessment on the potential application of Inter-
Governmental Support Agreements (IGSA) for Major Military Con-
struction Projects under a modified term agreement of up to 20
years; and
(b) An assessment of any further modifications to traditional
IGSA requirements that may be necessary to support the adminis-
tration and execution of Major Military Construction, as advisable.
Progressive Design Build.—The Committee is encouraged by the
Department of Defense’s ongoing evaluation of Progressive Design-
Build (PDB) as an alternative project delivery method for military
construction projects. PDB offers the potential to improve cost con-
trol, schedule certainty, and collaborative planning on complex or
large-scale efforts. The Committee commends the Department’s ef-
forts to explore innovative delivery models and encourages the use
of PDB where appropriate to achieve greater efficiency and effec-
tiveness in project execution.
Remote Pacific Locations.—The Committee is aware of the stra-
tegic importance of remote Pacific locations. While the committee
applauds the focus on modernizing and strengthening our
USINDOPACOM infrastructure through the Pacific Deterrence Ini-
tiative, the committee requests an update on the current projects
and future need. Specifically, the Committee is requesting a classi-
fied briefing on military construction needs at Wake Island, Mid-
way, Guam, Tinian, the Republic of Marshall Islands, the Fed-
erated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and other loca-
tions in the Pacific Islands. To better understand the Department
of Defense’s needs to support the security and infrastructure of
these installations, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense
to provide a report, not later than 180 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act, summarizing the plans for military construc-
tion and associated infrastructure needs to maximize the effective-
ness of an enhanced posture in USINDOPACOM.
Resilient Military Installations.—The Committee supports the
Department’s continued efforts to build lasting and resilient mili-
tary installations. These efforts include using methods that update
hurricane-resistant building codes for bases, barracks, hospitals,
and airfields and reviewing the effect of severe drought and
desertification and how these two hazards affect installations and

missions. The Committee encourages the Department to continue
investing in innovative infrastructure projects to increase infra-
structure resiliency and reduce costs.
Streamlining the Facilities Investment Plan Preparations.—The
Committee is aware of the Department of the Army’s Installation
Management Command’s (IMCOM) interest in leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) to improve infrastructure planning processes. The
Committee encourages the Department of Defense to explore and
implement AI tools to streamline data collection, standardize facil-
ity condition assessments, and enhance the efficiency and accuracy
of Facilities Investment Plan (FIP) preparations. AI-enabled sys-
tems can help prioritize projects based on mission impact, lifecycle
costs, and readiness needs, thereby supporting more informed and
timely investment decisions.

The Committee recommends $210,492,000 for the Air National
Guard (ANG) in fiscal year 2026.
The Committee supports the use of funding provided under this
heading for construction projects, including planning and design,
that enhance aircraft maintenance capabilities, mission effective-
ness, mission resilience, and military readiness. The Committee
further notes the need for additional investments in facilities with

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE ACCOUNT
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $489,174,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 489,174,000
The Committee recommends $489,174,000 for the Base Closure

The Committee continues to be concerned about the extent of
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) contamination at closed
U.S. military installations and the Committee recommendation in-
cludes not less than $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2026 budget
request for PFAS remediation. The Committee continues to recog-
nize the Navy’s efforts towards the demolition and removal of non-
historically designated buildings and structures under Navy control
where the sampling or remediation of radiologically contaminated
materials have been the subject of substantiated allegations of
fraud.

material zeolite is a promising tool for PFAS mitigation. As the De-
partment of Defense continues to address PFAS contamination on
military installations and other affected areas, the Committee

FAMILY HOUSING OVERVIEW
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $2,013,854,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 2,043,622,000
Family housing construction accounts provide funds for new con-
struction, construction improvements, the Federal government’s
costs for family housing privatization projects, and planning and
design. The operation and maintenance accounts provide funds to
pay for maintenance and repair, furnishings, management, serv-
ices, utilities, leasing, interest, mortgage insurance, and miscella-
neous expenses.
Housing Oversight.—The Committee provides an additional
$29,768,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level to expand
oversight of the entire housing portfolio, including government-
owned and controlled family housing and privatized family and un-
accompanied housing. The Committee requests an expenditure plan
detailing the planned use of these funds within 30 days of enact-
ment of this Act, including the specific, additional oversight activi-
ties these funds above the budget request will allow.
The Committee directs the Services to provide a briefing no later
than 120 days after enactment of this Act detailing steps being
taken to improve the conditions of each Service’s privatized housing
portfolio and an update on the efforts to expeditiously implement
the recommendations issued in GAO’s report, ‘‘DOD Can Further
Strengthen Oversight of Its Privatized Housing Program’’ (GAO–
23–105377), including the current backlog of maintenance requests;
a summary of all MHPI tenant complaints; and an updated per-
formance review of each MHPI management company.
Family Housing and CDC Heating and Air Conditioning.—The
Committee recognizes the Services’ efforts to improve energy effi-
ciency through scheduled seasonal deactivation of air conditioning
and heating systems at its facilities. Certain military installations,
deactivate these systems in family housing units and child develop-
ment centers (CDC). The Committee encourages the Department to
examine its energy conservation programs, including where family
housing units and CDCs may be excluded from air conditioning and
heating restrictions.

TITLE II
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ................................................... $367,728,616,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ........................... 435,333,099,000
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care for
9,000,000 veteran enrollees; disability compensation benefits to an
estimated 6,094,440 veterans and 562,448 survivors; pension bene-
fits for an estimated 136,678 veterans and 112,179 survivors; life
insurance for more than 5,600,000 veterans, servicemembers and
their families; educational assistance for nearly 820,000 students;
and interment of more than 140,000 veterans and eligible family
members in national cemeteries. To serve adequately the nation’s
veterans, VA employs more than 450,000 staff, making it one of the
largest Federal agencies in terms of employment.
Congressional Oversight of VA’s Actions on Abortion.—The bill
prohibits funding to implement, administer, or otherwise carry out
the actions in the interim final rule published September 9, 2022.
The interim final rule clearly violated Section 106 of the Veterans
Health Care Act of 1992 (P.L. 102–585; Title 38 U.S.C. 1710 note).
Contract Cancellations.—The Committee is concerned that the
Department cancelled many contracts and purported to reprogram
funding originally dedicated to these contracts without proper anal-
ysis on the impacts to the veteran community, or without trans-
parency about which contracts were ended, or proper notification to
Congress. If the Department seeks to reprogram previously appro-
priated funding, Congressional approval is required by law. The
Committee directs the Department to provide a report within 60
days of enactment of this Act with a list of the all cancelled con-
tracts since January 2025, the original purpose, recipient, location,
and dollar value of each contract, the date to which the contract
was originally entered into by the recipient and the Department,
and a detailed analysis of the decision-making process that led to
the cancellations.
Further, if funds were reprogrammed from cancelled contracts,
the report should list the accounts and purpose for which the funds
were reprogrammed.
Foreign Born Veterans.—The Committee supports VA’s role in
the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative and
urges VA to take steps to ensure non-citizen veterans are aware of
their options to naturalize as U.S. citizens and provide administra-
tive guidance and assistance with relevant applications and paper-
work. The Department is encouraged to continue coordination with
the Department of Homeland Security to develop methods that
allow the Department to maintain contact with immigrant and
non-citizen veterans and ensure that they can access immigration
related assistance and other VA assistance and benefits to which
they are entitled.
Oversight on Delays in Obtaining DD214s from National Ar-
chives.—The Committee is concerned about the prolonged delays

veterans face in obtaining their DD214 forms from the National Ar-
chives. DD214 is a critical document for veterans, required for ac-
cessing benefits, employment opportunities, and other essential
services. However, the current processing times for obtaining this
document often exceed several months, causing unnecessary hard-
ship and delays in veterans receiving the benefits and services they
are entitled to. The Committee directs the Department to work
closely with the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) to identify the root causes of these delays, improve the
process, and ensure that veterans receive their DD214s in a timely
manner. The Committee requests a brief within 90 days of enact-
ment, identifying reasons for the delays in processing DD214 re-
quests, steps being taken to streamline the request and delivery
process, including any improvements to digital record access and
electronic submission, and efforts to enhance communication with
veterans during the waiting period to keep them informed of the
status of their request.
Supporting Pay Transparency for VA Police Officers.—The Sec-
retary shall submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this
act to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and
Committee on Veterans Affairs in the House and Senate on the
compensation paid to Department police officers inclusive of their
salaries, availability pay under section 5545a of title 5, bonuses to
recruit or retain Department police officers, and any additional
compensation paid to Department police officers, including the
Chief of Police, Deputy Chief of Police, Supervisory Police Officer,
Criminal Investigator, Police Detective, Police Officer, Training Of-
ficer, Physical Security Specialist, Security Specialist Assistant,
Dispatcher, and Administrative Officer.
Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault Protections for VA Bene-
ficiaries and Employees.—The Committee directs the Secretary to
implement the recommendations laid out in GAO Report 20–387.
Veterans First Contracting Program.—The Committee recognizes
the tremendous value of the Veterans First Contracting Program in
assisting in the expansion and growth of service-disabled veteran
and veteran-owned small businesses. The Committee encourages
VA to continue to expand and make mandatory the training of con-
tracting officers in the requirements of the Veterans First Con-
tracting Program, with particular attention being paid to con-
ducting the market research necessary to ensure that service-dis-
abled veteran and veteran-owned small businesses, particularly
women and minority veteran-led small businesses, are awarded VA
contracts when appropriate.
Veterans in the Pacific.—The Committee directs the Department
to continue efforts to improve and expand access to benefits, men-
tal health, preventative and wellness programs, and telehealth,
among other programs. The Committee requests a report not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act on the progress made in
the prior fiscal year on improving access to such benefits and serv-
ices.

VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION
COMPENSATION AND PENSIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ..................................................... $177,020,200,000
Fiscal year 2026 advance appropriation (enacted) ...................... 227,240,071,000
Committee 2027 advance appropriation recommendation .......... 241,947,603,000
This appropriation provides funds for service-connected com-
pensation payments to an estimated 6,094,446 veterans and
562,448 survivors in fiscal year 2026. In addition, pension pay-
ments will be funded for an estimated 150,678 veterans and
112,179 survivors.
The appropriation includes authority to transfer funding not to
exceed $22,816,000 in fiscal year 2026 to General Operating Ex-
penses, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and Information
Technology Systems. These funds are for the administrative ex-
penses of implementing cost-saving provisions required by the Om-
nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101–508), the Vet-
erans’ Benefits Act of 1992 (P.L. 102–568), and the Veterans’ Bene-
fits Improvements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103–446). The bill also con-
tinues to include language permitting this appropriation to reim-
burse such sums as may be earned to the Medical Care Collections
Fund to help defray the operating expenses of individual medical
facilities for nursing home care provided to pensioners.
The Committee recommendation includes $227,240,071,000 for
fiscal year 2026. For fiscal year 2027, the Committee recommenda-
tion includes an advance appropriation of $241,947,603,000.
Customer Experience.—The Committee emphasizes the impor-
tance of implementing proper customer experience standards. Con-
tinued implementation of these standards includes providing sig-
nificant services directly to the public, identifying and surveying
target customers, establishing effective experience standards and
tracking internal performance against those standards. The Com-
mittee commends current efforts to implement improved customer
experience among agencies and directs all agencies funded by this
Act to continue developing standards to improve customer experi-
ence and incorporate the standards into the performance plans re-
quired under 31 U.S.C. 1115.
Ensuring VBA Access for Veterans.—The Committee is concerned
about closure of VBA offices in rural areas. Physical VBA offices
are crucial in rural areas as veterans have more limited broadband
access and transportation options. The Committee directs VA to re-
port VBA offices at risk of closure 180 days prior to VBA realign-
ment, including analysis used as justification of closure, necessary
resources needed to prevent closure and the projected realignment
of VBA staffers to nearby facilities to impacted congressional dis-
tricts, as well as VA’s corresponding efforts to ensure continued
services for impacted veterans in the area.
Signing of Veteran’s Death Certificates.—The Committee is con-
cerned that the Veterans Administration is not signing death cer-
tificates of all veterans who die of natural causes and who have as
their primary doctor a VA physician in a timely fashion. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to work in consultation with stake-
holders to prepare a report and submit it to the House and Senate

tificate for a veterans family upon notice of their passing, the aver-
age number of delays lasting longer than 72-hours over the last 5
years, the total number of refusals by VA to sign death certificates
and the reasoning behind any denial over the last 5 years, and so-
lutions to ensure that a speedy signature is done and received by
the family of our passed veterans.
Veterans Readiness & Employment Program (VR&E) Wait
Times.—The Committee is deeply concerned about staff shortages
and months-long wait times for the VR&E program. The Com-
mittee requests the Department brief both the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this
Act on the 15 Regional Offices with the longest VR&E wait times,
outlining steps that have been taken to date to reduce wait times,
and providing policy recommendations to address the problem.
READJUSTMENT BENEFITS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $13,317,066,000
Fiscal year 2026 advance appropriation (enacted) .......................... 20,372,030,000
Committee 2027 advance appropriation recommendation .............. 20,057,841,000
This appropriation finances the education and training of vet-
erans and servicemembers through the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the
All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program. In addition,
certain disabled veterans are provided with vocational rehabilita-
tion, specially adapted housing grants, and grants for automobiles
with approved adaptive equipment. This account also finances edu-
cational assistance allowances for eligible dependents of veterans
who died from service-connected causes or have a total and perma-
nent service-connected disability, as well as dependents of
servicemembers who were captured or are missing in action.
The Committee recommendation includes an advance appropria-
tion of $20,057,841,000 for fiscal year 2027.
Biomanufacturing Training.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to engage with an institution of higher education with ex-
pertise in and simulated Current Good Manufacturing Practice fa-
cilities for the provision of biomanufacturing training to consider
the establishment of a program to provide targeted, hands-on, in-
dustrial biomanufacturing training for veterans, transitioning serv-
ice members, and military spouses.
Financial Hardship and Bankruptcy.—The Committee continues
to support VA programs that combat the root causes of veteran and
dependent financial hardship, which is a known contributory factor
to negative outcomes such as mental health issues, substance use
disorder, and suicide. The Committee continues to be concerned by
an inequity in current bankruptcy law that results in the inclusion
of VA and DoD disability benefits in the calculation of a debtor’s
disposable income, while at the same time excluding Social Secu-
rity disability benefits for non-veterans.
GI Bill Comparison Tool.—The Committee emphasizes the im-
portance of providing veterans with the necessary information to
make informed decisions when selecting institutions of higher edu-

ing usage metrics, the frequency that caution flags are checked and
updated, and technical performance.
Post 9/11 GI Bill Books & Supplies Stipend.—The Committee ac-
knowledges the increasing need for technology for education as
coursework and class materials continue to shift from physical to
virtual. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that the books and
supply stipend has not been adjusted for inflation in 15 years. The
Committee encourages the Secretary to evaluate the need to in-
crease the books and supplies stipend from the current rate of
$1,000 per year to a higher inflation adjusted level.
Skills and Certifications.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of expanding job opportunities for veterans after their dis-
charge and encourages the Department to work with other Federal
agencies and State licensing bureaus, as appropriate, to evaluate
the transferability of DoD skills and certifications, including me-
chanical skills and certifications, to state certifications to aid in
transition to civilian employment.
Technology for Student Veterans.—The Committee understands
the importance of remote learning technologies, such as computers
and routers for internet access, were widely used so students could
continue their studies. House Report 118–122 directed a report
within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on the cost, feasibility,
and advisability of ensuring student veterans have access to the
technologies needed to be successful in school. The Committee is
looking forward to receiving this report.
Transition Coordination.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment in consultation with the Departments of Defense and
Labor, to coordinate efforts and resources to ensure veterans have
a successful transition to civilian life. This includes sharing infor-
mation on community resources, including nonprofits and Veterans
Service Organizations, that are available to veterans and their
families. The Committee also urges the Department to explore op-
tions for veterans to access hands-on job placement services that
connect them directly with employers, including those offered
through successful state and local programs.
Veteran Small Business Education.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of supporting veterans pursuing entrepreneurship
opportunities, and supports educating veterans on business owner-
ship, especially on how digital tools, including artificial intel-
ligence-enabled business software or cloud computing service that
facilitate business operations, processing, payment, or tracking of
payroll expenses, human resources, or sales and billing functions
can provide efficiencies and productivity enhancements to improve
their business success rate by saving time and money. As such, the
Committee encourages the Department, in consultation with the
Small Business Administration, to educate veterans on the growing
digital tools ecosystem to better prepare veterans for an increas-
ingly digital business environment.
Veteran Transition Assistance Grant Program (VTAG).—The
Committee continues to support VSTAGP program and its goal of
providing comprehensive employment-based resources, mentorship,
and professional development to recently separated members of the
Armed Forces and their spouses. The Committee encourages the
Department to consider small and mid-sized non-profits, that have

Dependent Education Assistance.—The Committee acknowledges
the work and dedication of the Veterans Affairs Survivors and De-
pendents Educational Assistance (DEA) program. The Committee
also recognizes that children of deceased or disabled veterans may
require additional tutoring or educational training to prepare for
college due to several unique challenges they face. The Committee
encourages the Department to explore utilizing DEA funding to as-
sist K–12 students in addressing these challenges to better tailor
their services to meet the specific needs of children of deceased or
disabled veterans, and ensuring these students their academic suc-
cess and college readiness. The Department shall brief the Com-
mittee 120 days following enactment of this Act on how it could ad-
dress assisting K–12 students.

VA Home Loan Program.—The Committee has been made aware
of the Department’s decision to abolish the ‘‘Participation Rule’’
which required listing agents to make an offer of compensation to
buyer brokers and could potentially disadvantage veterans utilizing
the home loan under current rules. The Committee urges the De-
partment to study its current policy of prohibiting borrowers from
paying fees or commissions to a real estate agent and determine
whether this policy negatively impacts veterans when buying a

The General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administra-
tion (VBA) account provides funding for VBA to administer entitle-
ment programs such as service-connected disability compensation,
education benefits, and vocational rehabilitation services.
The Committee recommendation includes $3,876,425,000 for fis-
cal year 2026 for General Operating Expenses, VBA. These re-
sources will improve VBA’s ability to address compensation and
benefit claims. The bill makes available through September 30,
2027, up to ten percent of these funds.
Benefits Usage.—The Committee encourages the Department to
include veteran benefit usage into its annual suicide prevention re-
port, including usage of disability compensation, education and em-
ployment, home loan and foreclosure assistance benefits, as well as

participation in housing and food security programs. Additional
data may enable a better understanding of the correlation between
benefit use and suicide and allow for more effective programs to as-
sist veterans.
Compensation and Pension Exams.—The Committee understands
the important role of contractors in providing medical disability
exams. These exams are necessary for Veterans to receive the ben-
efits that they have earned. The Committee urges the Department
to apply standard timeliness and quality performance metrics
across contract providers and VHA providers to ensure quality
exams for all Veterans. Further, VA is directed to report to the
Committee on the impact on VHA healthcare wait times before
committing additional VHA providers to the delivery of medical dis-
ability exams.
Digitizing Veteran Records.—The Committee commends the ef-
forts of VBA, in partnership with the National Archives and
Records Administration, to address the backlog of veterans’ records
requests by creating digital copies of records that currently exist
only in hardcopy form at the National Personnel Records Center
(NPRC). The Committee encourages VBA to continue its efforts to
create digital copies of veterans’ records housed at NPRC. The
Committee requests the Department update the analyses required
by House Report 117–391 on resources needed to digitize all hard
copy-only veteran records at NPRC not later than 90 days after en-
actment of this Act.
Equitable Relief.—The Committee understands the Department
is working to implement new systems and protocols to eliminate in-
stances of administrative error. However, as the Department en-
acts system-wide reforms, ending equitable relief for veterans who
were deemed eligible for benefits in error would place an unfair
burden on veterans and their families. The Secretary is encouraged
to continue to grant or extend equitable relief to eligible veterans
initially deemed eligible in instances of administrative error. Not
later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary
is directed to submit a report containing a statement as to the dis-
position of each case recommended to the Secretary for equitable
relief under section 503 of title 38, United States Code during the
preceding calendar year to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations.
Information for Toxic-Exposed Veterans.—The Committee encour-
ages VA to ensure resources and materials provided by VA to toxic-
exposed veterans be made available in the most commonly spoken
languages in the United States, as required by the Veterans and
Family Information Act (P.L. 117–62).
Mileage Reimbursements Kiosks.—The Committee is concerned
with the removal of mileage reimbursement kiosks and requests
the Department to report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the recent removal of mileage reimbursement ki-
osks from several VA facilities, which have been replaced by the
online Beneficiary Travel Self Service System. The Committee
urges the Department to reassess removing kiosks.
Military Sexual Trauma (MST).—The Committee is frustrated by
the findings of the August 2021 OIG Report titled ‘‘Improvements
Still Needed in Processing Military Sexual Trauma Claims’’ which
found VBA has failed to ensure all claims processors handling

MST-related claims have received specialized MST training. The
Committee urges VBA to prioritize specialized MST training for
claims processors, and to continue to involve MST survivors in the
development of specialized training.
Over-The-Counter-Hearing Aids.—The Committee notes that over

Section 34:
2.7 million veterans are compensated for hearing loss and tinnitus,
and noise exposure during military service being a major factor.
The Committee encourages VA to reassess its current model for
hearing aids. The lower cost of over the counter (OTC) hearing aids
has the potential to reduce financial strain on VA’s budget, freeing
up resources to invest in other critical areas of veteran care and
support.
Outreach to Veterans.—The Committee supports further outreach
efforts via States and Indian Tribes to carry out programs that im-
prove outreach and assistance to veterans and associated parties to
ensure individuals are fully informed about, and assisted in apply-
ing for, any veterans and veterans-related benefits and programs.
Of the funds provided under this heading, $4,000,000 may be used
for the purposes authorized under 38 U.S.C. 6307.
VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA)
The Department operates the largest integrated medical care de-
livery system in the United States, providing care at nearly 1,300
health care facilities, including 171 medical centers and more than
1,100 outpatient sites to more than 9,000,000 veterans enrolled in
VA health care program.
Funding for veterans’ health care, VA research, and the Veterans
Health Administration are provided through five discretionary ac-
counts and the mandatory Cost of War Toxic Exposure Fund. The
discretionary accounts are Medical Services, Medical Community
Care, Medical Support and Compliance, Medical Facilities, and
Medical and Prosthetic Research.
For fiscal year 2026, the Budget requested a total of
$134,439,000,000 for veterans’ medical care, including funding for
medical care for the treatment of conditions related to toxic expo-
sures.
In fiscal year 2026, VA will collect an estimated $4,580,000,000
in the Medical Care Collections Fund.
The Committee provides $943,000,000 for Medical and Prosthetic
Research for fiscal year 2026, equal to the requested level.
The Committee provides $122,258,000,000 in advance for fiscal
year 2027. The discretionary advance appropriations is in conjunc-
tion with the Toxic Exposures Fund (TEF) mandatory funding of
$52,676,000,000 in 2026.
CoPay Costs.—As part of the efforts to ensure that services deliv-
ered by the Veterans Health Administration remain affordable to
veterans, the Department is directed to provide the Committee an
update on trends in the number of veterans that are subject to
copays under the Veterans Health Administration over the last two
years, the annual average amount of copays paid by veterans sub-
ject to a copay for healthcare services, and the top ten services sub-
ject to a copay within 90 days of enactment of this Act.
Dispute Resolution.—The Committee urges VA to ensure that
veterans are advised of their rights to contest VA billing charges
and determinations and of the step-by-step process for disputes. VA

should ensure this information is available online and in publicly
accessible areas at each VA medical center, and that it is made
available in several commonly spoken languages.
Essential Medical Devices.—The United States’ manufacturing
capacity for essential medical devices is at serious risk due to orga-
nized efforts by Chinese manufacturers to enter the U.S. market in
response to inflationary pressures faced by U.S.-based manufactur-
ers, distributors, and providers. The current shift toward pur-
chasing Chinese-made medical devices is drastic and occurring at
a pace that will leave U.S. hospitals dependent on Chinese supplied
devices. The Committee urges VA to purchase essential medical de-
vices, like needles and syringes, from U.S. manufacturers or allied
trading partners. The Committee directs the Department to submit
a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on the percent-
age of Chinese made devices for the 96 device medical counter-
measures published by the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.
The report should also include specific recommendations on how
the Department can reduce its dependency on Chinese medical de-
vices, increase the domestic supply chain, while safeguarding
against shortages.
In-Vitro Diagnostic Testing for Veterans.—The Committee recog-
nizes that in-vitro diagnostics, tools used in health care to detect
diseases, infections, and other medical conditions by analyzing
specimens taken from the body, provide valuable information to
health care providers for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and monitoring of patients’ health.
Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and United States-Affiliated
Pacific Islander (NHPIUSAPI) Veterans Health.—The Committee
continues to support VA Center for NHPIUSAPIs. The Committee
encourages the Department to partner with universities in the Pa-
cific region focusing on issues unique to the NHPISAPI community.
Timeliness of Care at VA Facilities.—The Committee recognizes
the critical need for quality and timely health care for veterans.
The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a detailed report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of the enactment of this Act regarding the average waiting pe-
riods experienced by veterans seeking health care services through
VA hospitals. This report should encompass data collected from
various VA healthcare facilities nationwide, including to the extent
possible non-VHA operated clinics, analyzing both the duration vet-
erans wait from initial contact to their first appointment and any
subsequent waits for further medical treatments. The data pre-
sented in this report should be broken out by state to facilitate a
clear understanding of regional disparities and target improve-
ments effectively.
Equitable Care for Veterans.—As the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration considers policies that would disregard state anesthesia li-
censure and practice standards, the Committee requests the Under
Secretary of Health submit to the Committee within 180 days of
enactment a report on how the Under Secretary intends to ensure
that veterans who receive hospital care and medical services fur-
nished by the Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly vet-
erans who are eligible for such care and services under the PACT
Act (Public Law 117–168) and the amendments made by that Act,

Allocation of Health Funding.—The Committee continues to re-
quest a report each year, not later than 30 days after the Depart-
ment allocates the medical services appropriation to the VISNs,
that identifies: (1) the amount of general purpose funding that is
allocated to each VISN; (2) the amount of funding that is retained
by central headquarters for specific purposes, with amounts identi-
fied for each purpose; and (3) the amount of funding that is re-
tained by each VISN before allocating it to the medical centers,
identifying separately the amounts retained for purposes such as
network operations, network initiatives, and emergencies.
Changes in Funding Requirements Due to Modeling.—The Com-
mittee expects the Department to continue to include in the suffi-
ciency letter required by section 117(d) of title 38, United States
Code, which is due to the Congress on July 31 of each year, a de-
scription of any changes exceeding $250,000,000 in funding re-
quirements for the Medical Services account resulting from the
spring recalculation of the Enrollee Healthcare Projection Model.
Support for FAS Veterans.—Since the passage of the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–42), the Depart-
ment is no longer restricted from providing services to veterans re-
siding in the Freely Associated States (FAS), including, but not
limited to, direct care from VA providers, telehealth, and care
through contracts with community providers, and shipping medica-
tions to the FAS. The Committee requests a brief within 60 days
of enactment of this Act with the estimated cost and the plan for
implementing this law in fiscal year 2026.
Treatments for Hypertension.—The Committee is concerned by
the prevalence of hypertension, or high blood pressure, and uncon-
trolled hypertension across the veterans population. In light of re-
cent advancements in hypertension treatment, such as FDA-ap-
proved renal denervation technologies, the Committee is interested
in understanding the Department’s current initiatives and re-
sources allocated to addressing hypertension and uncontrolled hy-
pertension within the Veteran community. The Committee requests
a report be submitted to the House and Senate the Committees on
Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act regarding
programs and services VA has in place to ensure that veterans
with hypertension, including uncontrolled hypertension, receive
comprehensive and timely care, including access to specialist con-
sultations and the integration of innovative treatments within its
healthcare facilities nationwide.

CANCER AND RARE DISEASES
Advanced MRI-based Solutions.—The Committee recommends
that to ensure access to advanced care for all veterans, VA Innova-
tion Ecosystem (IE) include in its fiscal year 2026 portfolio activi-
ties expanding VA healthcare system’s infrastructural reach to en-
rolled veterans residing in geographically underserved areas, in-
cluding rural and highly rural. The Committee would like IE to en-
gage industry with community stakeholders to co-develop trans-
formative, highly deployable, mobile, and scalable advanced MRI-
based solutions to identify, stratify, and manage the highly preva-
lent metabolic disease burden in VA population.
Cancer Screening at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.—The De-
partment is encouraged to ensure its healthcare providers screen
for the numerous types of cancers that veterans experience so they
can receive the best possible care.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Monitoring.—The Committee
continues to urge the Department to utilize reference data from ex-
isting medical records of veterans to determine the percentage of
veterans who have more frequent or unexplained symptoms associ-
ated with CJD compared to the civilian population. This data could
be helpful in clarifying the extent and specifics of the medical
issues suffered by veterans from exposure to CJD.
Dermatological Care for Veterans.—The Committee is concerned
by recent research studies, including those by the National Insti-
tutes of Health and the Journal of American Academy of Derma-
tology, regarding the increased risk of skin cancers in Veterans.
Servicemembers’ increased UV radiation exposure, lack of sun pro-
tective measures, and over two decades of deployments to regions
in close equatorial proximity have placed veterans at higher risk
for melanoma and other skin cancers. Veterans are also more likely
to be diagnosed with advanced-stage skin cancers than the civilian
population due to less frequent skin checks and access to special-
ized care. The committee supports continued access dermatology
screening, dermatologic preventative care, and trained Mohs micro-
graphic surgeons.
Expanding Lung Cancer Screening for Veterans.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of early detection and timely diagnosis
of cancers and encourages the Department to review and update its
approach to lung cancer screening to optimize veterans’ access to
screenings given the unique risk factors and evolving demographics
for this patient population. As part of this update, the Committee
encourages the Department to issue a request for information and
corresponding public docket to receive information and rec-
ommendations regarding the latest lung cancer research, data, and
clinical best practices to inform the updates to the Department’s
lung cancer screening guidelines and update lung cancer screening
guidelines to address those exposed to toxic hazards.
Improving Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer for Veterans.—
The Committee recognizes that Veterans are four times as likely to
develop esophageal cancer, one of the deadliest and fastest-growing
cancers, and that early detection saves lives. Despite technological
advancements, the current standard of care for surveillance and di-
agnosis misses many cases due to its limited sample collection as
well as pathologist subjectivity. The Committee urges the Depart-

ment to implement enhanced sampling technology, utilizing a spe-
cialized brush, and accompanied by computer imaging with artifi-
cial intelligence, to identify abnormalities missed by the current
standard of care and as a result identify patients for treatment at
an earlier stage.
Low Helium MRI.—The Committee recognizes that our nation’s
helium stockpile is running dangerously low, jeopardizing Ameri-
cans’ access to diagnostic MRI exams, potentially leading to false
or missed readings and diagnosis, in addition to risks to other im-
portant technologies. The Committee recognizes technology ad-
vancement in the industry that has led to the development of low
helium machines (LH–MRI) to enable fast imaging for reduced cost
to taxpayers with high resolution for improved diagnosis. Con-
verting to LH–MRI reduces the amount of helium used by MRI ma-
chines by 95.5% and removes the need for helium refills and top
offs over the lifetime of the system. The Committee encourages the
use of LH–MRI machines to reduce our dependency on helium in
the medical field for access to and diagnosis with MRI.
Medical Companion Program.—The Committee has heard from
veterans about barriers to care for undergoing outpatient or ambu-
latory procedures using sedation or anesthesia that require a re-
sponsible adult available to assist in their care before and after the
procedure. The Committee encourages the Department to support
the development of more Medical Companion programs across the
VHA system.
Molecular Diagnostics and Precision Oncology.—The Committee
believes that every veteran with cancer deserves the highest qual-
ity and most medically advanced diagnosis and treatment avail-
able, and the Committee commends the Department’s on-going Pre-
cision Oncology Program. The Committee continues to support the
precision oncology clinical services, including molecular diagnostics
for Veterans and directs that not less than $30,300,000 be utilized
for molecular diagnostics, the Department to provide a report on its
progress within 120 days of enactment.
Reducing Health and Economic Burden of Chronic Liver Disease
Among Veterans.—The health and economic burden of chronic liver
disease is growing rapidly among veterans, fueled by the preva-
lence of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The Department
mandates liver biopsy to confirm diagnosis of metabolic dysfunc-
tion-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to authorize the use of new
drug therapies. The Committee urges the Department to evaluate
the impacts of therapy, including pharmaceutical and/or lifestyle
measures, with the use of new, clinically validated, FDA-cleared,
multiparametric MRI imaging solutions to diagnose, monitor, and
improve management of veterans with MASH, while avoiding the
need for biopsy in many patients.
Improvements to VA Support for Veterans With End Stage Lung
Disease.—The Committee recognizes the work of the VA to admin-
ister benefits expansion in accordance with the PACT Act to im-
prove services available for veterans who were exposed to certain
toxins during their time in service. The Committee also under-
stands that some veterans who suffered from toxic exposures may
have developed severe lung diseases that, in end stage, require
highflow oxygen support. Certain high flow oxygen support devices
for end stage lung disease may only be accessible for operation in

long-term acute care hospitals. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to submit a report, not
later than 120 days after enactment, to include the following: (a)

long-term, high flow oxygen support for veterans with service-re-
lated end-stage lung disease; (b) Steps the VHA may take to facili-
tate improvements to current treatments, community care models,
and coverage options, to include reimbursement policies, to support
long-term, high flow oxygen support for veterans with service-re-
lated end-stage lung disease; (c) A cost assessment to reflect total
funds the VA may require to support a change in policy to allow
long-term acute care hospitals to receive continued reimbursement,
such that they may be able to administer long-term high flow oxy-
gen treatment for veterans with service-related end stage lung dis-
ease who would otherwise require hospice home health services if
not for their unique oxygen support needs.
CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM
Caregivers Program.—The Committee provides not less than fis-
cal year 2005 for the caregivers program. The Committee continues
to require quarterly reporting on obligations for this program.
Caregiver Assistance Eligibility.—The Committee recognizes the
important role of family caregivers in supporting the health and
wellness of veterans. The Committee directs VA to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this Act on the feasibility, including cost estimates,
of expanding eligibility for the Program of Comprehensive Assist-
ance for Family Caregivers and the Program of General Caregiver
Support Services to include veterans with lower continuous care
needs and disability ratings.
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE
Epilepsy Center of Excellence.—The Committee encourages the
Department to ensure that all veterans with epilepsy are com-
prehensively evaluated at a VHA Epilepsy Center of Excellence to
identify drug-resistant epilepsy patients who may be candidates for
FDA-approved non-drug therapies.
Neurology Centers of Excellence.—The Committee recognizes the
increasing number of veterans affected by neurologic conditions, in-
cluding but not limited to epilepsy, headache, multiple sclerosis,
and Parkinson’s disease, and therefore provides $87,200,000 for the
Neurology Centers of Excellence. This includes $29,212,000 for the
Epilepsy Centers, $32,700,000 for the Headache Centers,
$6,540,000 for the Multiple Sclerosis Centers, and $17,440,000 for
the Parkinson’s Disease, Research, Education and Clinical Centers.
The Neurology Centers of Excellence provide essential innovative
clinical care, education, and research efforts focused on these condi-
tions. The Committee applauds the Department for recent invest-
ments into the headache, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s dis-
ease centers and acknowledges the advancement and expansion the
Centers have begun. The Committee encourages further invest-
ment and collaboration of the Centers across disciplines and urges
the Department to allocate robust funding for the Neurology Cen-
ters of Excellence for maintenance and expansion. The Committee

also directs the Department to report back the use and allocation
of funds for each Center within 120 of enactment of this Act.
COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS
Academic Collaborations at Community Based Outpatient Clinics
(CBOC).—The Committee encourages VA to expand academic col-
laborations with CBOCs, as they provide valuable patient care and
access to services that can be strengthened by collaboration with
educational institutions. Through clinical traineeships and research
fellowships, emerging health professionals can gain a better under-
standing of veterans’ specific healthcare needs, improve patient
outcomes, advance specialized research, and increase the talented
workforce pipeline. VA is encouraged to consider including public
academic medical centers in CBOC collaborations.
Increasing Veterans Enrollment in Medicare.—The Committee is
aware that information gaps exist for some veterans related to the
differences between hospital care and medical services available in
VA system versus coverage provided under Medicare. The informa-
tion gaps may have resulted in some veterans receiving late-enroll-
ment penalties through the Medicare program. The Committee en-
courages the Veterans Health Administration to work with the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of
Health and Human Services to ensure that veterans have accurate
information regarding the differences between VA system and
Medicare coverage, including for prescription drugs.
Private Sector Non-Profit Partnerships.—The Committee is aware
of the efforts of private non-profit organizations to support veterans
and their families in civilian life, lower veteran suicides, and make
them aware of the benefits they earned for their service. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to build upon its existing part-
nerships and seek opportunities to establish new ones. The Com-
mittee is interested in partnerships that seek to offer sustainable
solutions, improve the quality of civilian life, and seek to improve
veteran outreach to connect with those who may have slipped
through the cracks.
Veterans Access to Long-Term Care.—The Committee is aware of
the Department’s support for extending exemptions to providers,
including long-term care, operating pursuant to an agreement with
VA to improve veterans’ access to care. The Committee is con-
cerned that any additional requirements imposed on the Depart-
ment’s community care providers will make it more difficult to re-
cruit and retain these vital partners. The Committee encourages
the Department to work with the Department of Labor to seek ex-
emptions for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Providers from its
authority, similar to TRICARE providers, in order to increase vet-
erans’ access to care.
Whole Family Care Partnerships.—The Committee is aware of
the efforts of private organizations to support veterans and their
families and recognizes that they can sometimes provide services,
such as counseling and wellness programs, for the families of vet-
erans that the Department cannot. Recognizing that Congress, the
Department, and private organizations share the same goal of sup-
porting veterans, the Committee directs the Department to build
upon its existing partnerships and seek opportunities to establish
new ones. The Committee is particularly interested in partnerships

related to mental health, including the mental health of veterans’
families, and provides up to $2,500,000 to increase outreach to this
in-need underserved population.
DENTAL CARE
Dental Care.—The Committee directs that not less than fiscal
year 2025 enacted amounts be used to provide dental care for vet-
erans.
Dental Vans.—The Committee notes that many veterans residing
in rural areas must travel long distances to access quality dental
and oral care. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Com-
mittee requests the Department brief the Committee on the feasi-
bility of deploying mobile dental cleaning vans, in partnership with
any appropriate federal agencies, academic institutions, public, or
private organizations, to provide pop-up dental cleaning services
across rural, remote locations to reach veteran populations.
Veterans Oral Health.—The Committee understands that vet-
erans may experience a large oral disease burden, and therefore an
integrated and whole-person approach is needed to prevent and
manage oral disease in this population, which may also enable cost
savings in VA Health Care at large. The Committee looks forward
to receiving the report on the Department’s assessment of its oral
healthcare program and its ability to meet current and future
needs as required by House Report 118–122.
DIABETES CARE
Reducing Diabetes-Related Amputations in Veterans.—The Com-
mittee is encouraged by advancements in wound care technologies
aimed at addressing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), which present a
significant health risk and are the leading cause of lower-extremity
amputation in veterans. The Committee directs the Department to
explore methods that can be used for wounds such as diabetic ul-
cers, venous ulcers, burns, and pressure wounds and can lead to
improved outcomes while reducing long-term costs. The Committee
requests that VA provide a report within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on its findings and potential cost savings.
Reducing Type 2 Diabetes in Veterans.—The Committee com-
mends the Department for actively engaging with industry part-
ners in a study using telehealth to provide individualized ketogenic
nutrition programs and medical support to reduce the incidence of
diabetes in VA patients. The Committee applauds the effectiveness
of the study at reducing patient dependence on diabetes medication
and the clinical improvements achieved by Veterans engaged indi-
vidualized ketogenic nutrition programs. The Committee is aware
of existing plans within the Department to expand ketogenic diabe-
tes telehealth services beyond the pilot study to address the
healthcare needs of Veterans living with Type 2 diabetes. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to sustain and expand industry
partnerships and programs focused on ketogenic diabetes tele-
health services to support the health and quality of life of our Na-
tion’s Veterans.
Reducing Veteran Insulin-related Adverse Events.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to explore establishing a pilot
program to improve glycemic management in VA medical centers.
The pilot should target reductions in severe hyper- and hypo-

glycemia in hospitalized patients and consider existing commercial
technologies that are FDA-cleared and proven to reduce patient
length of stay and readmissions, integrate with existing electronic
health record systems, and reduce administrative burden on hos-
pital staff.
EMERGING AND NOTABLE HEALTHCARE ISSUES
Dialysis.—Over 18,000 veterans receive dialysis through the Na-
tional Dialysis Services Contract. The Committee appreciates the
Department’s commitment to ensure care is not disrupted or dimin-
ished for the veterans who receive treatment. The Committee looks
forward to working with the Department to utilize a value-based
dialysis payment model.
Diagnosing and Treating Sleep Disorders.—The Committee en-
courages the Department to require sleep disorder diagnosis and
treatment related study within the current Continuing Medical
Education (CME) requirements of VA physician workforce to en-
sure that veterans seeking treatment for sleep disorders are appro-
priately diagnosed and treated to prevent compounding mental
health disorders as well as to lower the high risk of cardiovascular
disease which is affiliated with sleep disorders.
Fall Prevention.—The Committee appreciates the work the Ad-
ministration has done to address and reduce fall risks in older vet-
erans. The Committee encourages the Administration to expand its
work on fall prevention.
Needle Stick Injuries.—The Committee remains interested in the
Department’s efforts to reduce or eliminate needlestick injury
among caregivers and staff at VA facilities. The Committee encour-
ages VA to use the most-up-to-date needle destruction technology.
Nuclear Medicine Quality Improvements.—The Committee notes
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has confirmed nu-
clear medicine extravasations can result in radiation-safety-signifi-
cant doses to patients and is engaged in rulemaking to require
medical event reporting of extravasations. The Committee encour-
ages VA nuclear medicine facilities to monitor injection quality,
image extravasations, conduct dosimetry, and notify patients when
large extravasations occur.
Supporting Elderly Veterans Through Geriatric Patient Aligned
Care Teams.—The Committee understands that there are currently
more than 11 million aging veterans across the United States,
making Geriatric Veterans the largest current demographic of
those who have served. The Committee urges the Department to
expand the Geriatrics Patient Aligned Care Team model to all med-
ical centers and community-based outpatient clinics deemed fea-
sible and needed.
Veterans Transportation.—The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s programs that provide veterans with transportation to VA
medical facilities and make it easier for veterans to receive medical
care and encourages VA to explore options to strengthen and sus-
tain the Volunteer Transportation Network, such as increased
funding to recruit and retain drivers and provide vehicle mainte-
nance.

HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES
Bioelectronic Medicine for Veterans.—The Committee recognizes
that Bioelectronic Medicine has the potential to harness the body’s
electrical signaling to advance treatments that save lives and lower
medical expenditures. Accelerating studies, additional data collec-
tion, and the development and adoption of novel applications for
Bioelectronic Medicine combined with machine learning and artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) can address challenging and expensive dis-
eases by personalizing treatments and improving therapy delivery.
The Committee encourages the Department to ensure that com-
bined Bioelectronic Medicine and AI technologies are available to
veterans.
Digital Quality Measures.—Health care quality measures cur-
rently rely on manual collection, exchange, management, and anal-
ysis that adds significant cost to VA health care. Digitizing health
care quality measures will lower health care costs, decrease pro-
vider burden, increase transparency, and improve patient out-
comes. The Department is encouraged to explore testing digital re-
porting methods for quality measures and consult with Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Medical Image Exchange.—The Committee applauds VA facilities
in 17 of 18 VISNs that have deployed a modern software platform
that supports bi-directional exchange of medical images, diagnostic
reports, and other clinical data between VA facilities, community
providers, and federal partners. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to expand this software’s connections to Indian and tribal
health clinics and work with the Department of Defense to expedite
connections with military treatment facilities.
PhAIMIS.—The Committee recognizes the opportunity that IT
modernization provides to realize cost savings and efficiency. Fur-
ther, the Committee appreciates efforts by the Department to mod-
ernize supply chains to achieve these goals. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to consider utilizing the Pharmacy Artificial
Intelligence Managed Inventory System’’ (PhAIMIS) program and
modernize the Supply Chain Master Catalog, utilizing commercial
solutions and competition to maximize the benefit to Veterans and
taxpayers.
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
The Committee provides $3,459,000,000 for VA homeless assist-
ance programs. An estimated $12,007,323,000 is provided for home-
less veterans treatment costs.
Programs to assist homeless veterans include the Homeless Pro-
viders Grant and Per Diem (GPD), Health Care for Homeless Vet-
erans (HCHV), the Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans, the
Supportive Services for Low Income Veterans and Families (SSVF),
Veterans Justice Outreach Homeless Prevention (VJO), Com-
pensated Work Therapy, and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development-Department of Veterans Affairs Supported
Housing (HUD–VASH) programs.
Cost of Care for Veterans’ Homes.—The Committee is concerned
with the current reimbursement rate for state and non-profit run
Veterans’ Homes. The Committee recognizes that the costs associ-
ated with Veterans’ Homes are substantial due to the high acuity

level of the veteran population served, and that current VHA rates
are inconsistent with the current cost of care. The Committee re-
quests a report, not later than 90 days following enactment of this
Act, outlining how current reimbursement rates are calculated,
how VHA makes locality adjustments, how the VHA works to re-
duce the cost of prescription drugs for veterans in homes, and rec-
ommended legislative changes for Congress to consider.
Healthcare for Homeless Veterans.—The Committee notes the
benefits of the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team (HPACT) pro-
gram and encourages VA to expand this program to additional
sites, including rural areas, and to consider additional services to
improve the program. The Committee urges the Department to ex-
plore options to expand this program to additional sites, including
cost estimates, with its fiscal year 2027 budget request.
Homeless Veterans in the Southwest.—The Committee continues
to direct VA to work with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to develop strategies and recommendations for ad-
dressing veteran homelessness including the Southwest and to take
into account undercounted veterans when awarding HUD–VASH
vouchers. The Committee appreciates VA’s efforts to implement
strategies to decrease veteran homelessness in the Southwest.
HUD–VASH Case Management.—The Committee recognizes the
value and impact of the HUD–VA Supportive Housing (VASH) pro-
gram, which serves veterans experiencing homelessness and pairs
each HUD affordable housing voucher designated for veterans with
intensive case management from VA to assist with benefits and in-
come, mental healthcare, recovery services, and permanent housing
stability. Case management services are critically important to the
function of the program, and public housing authorities rely on VA
Medical Centers’ referrals to house veterans. Existing requirements
mandate that a veteran must receive VA case management services
to receive a HUD–VASH voucher. The inadequacy of staff for case
management has contributed to the ongoing underutilization of
HUD–VASH vouchers. The Committee recommends an increase in
staffing for case management services to continue to improve the
rate of lease referrals and to account for increased staffing costs
and recent expansions in eligibility.
Legal Assistance for the Supportive Services for Veteran Families
Program.—The Committee continues to encourage the Supportive
Services for Veteran Families [SSVF] program to work with grant-
ees to expand their legal service offerings, particularly in rural
areas where access to private legal assistance can be limited.
Recovery-Oriented Care.—The health and well-being of the Na-
tion’s men and women who have served in uniform is the highest
priority for the Department. Mental health care at VA comprises
an unparalleled system of comprehensive treatments and services
to meet the needs of each Veteran and the family members who are
involved in the Veteran’s care. The Committee notes these services
support veteran resilience, identify and treat mental health condi-
tions at their earliest onset, address acute mental health crises,
and deliver recovery-oriented treatment.
SSVF–HVRP Coordination.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to coordinate with the Department of Labor to maximize the
impact of the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) pro-
gram and the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program (HVRP).

The Departments are encouraged to provide grants to eligible enti-
ties with capabilities for delivering services under both programs.
Tiny Homes.—The Committee notes the success of the tiny home
village model by multiple veterans service organizations (VSOs)
and encourages VA, in coordination with the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development to support this work and facilitate the
creation of additional villages of tiny homes villages within VA’s
existing Grant and Per-Diem (GPD) program.
Veterans At-Risk of Homelessness Data.—The Committee notes
that homelessness data may currently undercount women veterans
with children. The Committee encourages the Department to work
with the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Contin-
uums of Care to include data on veterans at-risk of homelessness
within Section 5: Veterans Experiencing Homelessness of the An-
nual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress.
INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Intimate Partner Violence Program (IPV).—The Committee con-
tinues to support the Department’s efforts to expand its IPV pro-
gram, which provides a holistic approach that involves under-
standing, recognizing and responding to the effects of all types of
trauma, with the ultimate goals to end violence, prevent further vi-
olence, and promote healthy relationships.
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS
The Committee provides $16,380,187,000 for mental health pro-
grams. Of the total, $3,161,426,000 is for suicide prevention and
treatment programs, including $698,000,000 for suicide prevention
outreach $311,683,000 for the Veterans Crisis Line, and $1,500,000
for the expansion of Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation
Treatment Programs.
The Committee continues to direct the Department to focus on
efforts to address parking lot suicides and connect veterans to care.
The Department is directed to provide a report to the Committee,
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, identifying a de-
tailed expenditure plan for all suicide outreach and treatment pro-
grams and how VA is meeting the Committee’s directives.
Agritherapy.—The Committee supports efforts to train veterans
in agricultural vocations, while also tending to behavioral and men-
tal health needs with behavioral healthcare services and treat-
ments from licensed providers. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to consider including agritherapy as a Complementary and
Alternative Medicine therapy.
Depression and Precision Medicine.—The Committee recognizes
that depression is one of the most common conditions associated
with military service and combat service. Further, the risk of sui-
cide increases with this diagnosis and each time a veteran tries
and fails a medication. The Committee is encouraged by ongoing
VA-sponsored genetic testing research to aid in depression treat-
ment selection; however, veterans still have less access than Medi-
care beneficiaries to precision medicine tools. The Committee urges
the Department to ensure the procurement of pharmacogenomic
tests for use in the treatment of depression if they have been
shown to improve health outcomes of veterans in clinical trials.

Faith Based Digital Applications Impact on Mental Health.—The
Committee understands that recent data has shown that the use
of digital, faith-based applications can have a measurable impact
on mental health and wellness. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to review the effectiveness of such applications and requests
a report on findings within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to research the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)
as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic
brain injury and should permit case-by-case referrals for veterans
to receive HBOT in the community.
Mental Health Treatment.—The Committee commends the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs for its innovative implementation of
immersive technology to improve Veterans’ health care experiences.
Immersive technology is currently being used in over 200 VA Med-
ical Centers and Facilities across all 50 states, American Samoa,
Guam, and Puerto Rico. Immersive technologies have proven effec-
tive in treating Veterans with difficult-to-treat post-traumatic
stress disorder, depression, stress, and anxiety. The Committee en-
courages the Department to consider how the use of immersive
technology can be used to expand veterans’ access to these critical
healthcare services.
Military Sexual Assault.—The Committee recommends that all
veterans seeking treatment services are screened for sexual assault
using an evidence-based screening tool to successfully treat those
who have experienced assault.
Patient Confidentiality.—The Committee recognizes that VA pro-
vides mental health services for posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), psychological effects of military sexual trauma (MST), de-
pression, grief, anxiety, and other needs. It is essential that mental
health clinicians employed or contracted by VA who are facing re-
turn-to-office directives be provided appropriate spaces to work and
provide care to patients where confidentiality will not be breached.
Peer Support.—The Committee recognizes the critical role that
peer support services play in helping veterans manage mental
health challenges, navigate the transition to civilian life, and build
community connections. The Committee urges the Department to
continue expanding access to peer support programs across VA and
to ensure that veterans are aware of the full range of available
services. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of enactment of this Act outlining existing peer support tools
and programs, including but not limited to Peer Specialist initia-
tives, Veteran Peer Support Networks, and VA-sponsored peer
mentoring efforts. The report should also identify any gaps in peer
support services and make recommendations for improving out-
reach, effectiveness, and veteran engagement.
Veterans Crisis Line (VCL).—The Committee is concerned about
the continued functionality, accessibility, and performance of the
VCL. The Committee recognizes the critical role of VCL personnel,
and the importance of uninterrupted crisis support for veterans.
The Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act. The report shall include:
(1) VCL staffing levels and service capacity; (2) performance

contingency plans developed or implemented to maintain contin-
uous crisis line functionality and workforce stability; and (4) steps
taken to ensure alternative access to support or follow-up care for
veterans who may have been unable to connect with VCL during
or after this period.
MILITARY TOXIC EXPOSURE RESEARCH PROGRAM
The bill provides resources for research on military environ-
mental exposures. The Committee supports efforts to improve diag-
nosis and treatment of conditions resulting from toxic exposures
and appreciates the work of the Health Outcomes Military Expo-
sures (HOME) program, the Office of Research and Development,
and other VA program offices to increase attention to this issue.
The Committee encourages the Department to continue research
on the effects of and treatments for veterans exposed to toxins,
such as Agent Orange, open burn pits, PFAS, radiation, and asbes-
tos, during the course of their active-duty service. The Committee
also urges the Department to utilize reference data from existing
medical records to determine how veterans who served in areas
where toxins were dispersed may have more frequent or unex-
plained diseases compared to the civilian population.
Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence.—The Com-
mittee provides $15,165,000 and continues to support the Airborne
Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence on diagnoses, mitiga-
tion, and treatment of conditions related to airborne hazards and
burn pits.
Colorectal Cancer Screening.—Colorectal cancer is the fourth
most common cancer diagnosis among our nation’s veterans. The
Committee recognizes that early detection with screening is the
most effective tool available to help prevent thousands of cancer
deaths and that detecting cancers in earlier stages when they are
most treatable saves lives, as well as providing cost savings for the
patient and the system. The Committee urges the Department to
review its policy related to colorectal cancer screening and take ac-
tion to align it with the nationally recognized guideline rec-
ommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF), National Comprehensive Care Network, and the
American Cancer Society and explore additional research on the
prevalence of colorectal cancer in those exposed to burn pits and
other environmental hazards.
Glioblastoma and Toxic Exposure.—The Committee recognizes
the urgency of improving research, early detection, and treatment
options for glioblastoma, a rare but aggressive brain cancer that
has increasingly affected our nation’s veterans, with growing evi-
dence suggesting a link to toxic exposures such as burn pits and
other environmental hazards. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to prioritize research on the incidence of glioblastoma among
veterans, particularly Vietnam War veterans and those with known
exposure to environmental toxins, and to evaluate whether existing
screening and care adequately reflect the needs of this population.
The Committee also encourages the Department to explore partner-
ships with academic and medical institutions to advance under-

OPIOID PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAM
The bill includes $232,000,000 for opioid treatment and preven-
tion efforts. Of the total, $254,487,000 is provided for activities au-
thorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016
(P.L. 114–198).
Nonaddictive Opioid Alternatives.—According to the National In-
stitute on Drug Abuse, a significant number of veterans take a
large amount of prescription drugs, often due to high rates of
chronic pain and mental health conditions stemming from their
military service. This can lead to over-prescribing of medications
like opioids, potentially causing addiction and other health com-
plications. The Committee encourages VA to assess policies and
procedures and to work with Congress on efforts to facilitate cov-
erage of non-addictive alternatives to opioids for pain treatment
and management. The Committee supports efforts by VA to edu-
cate veterans and physicians in VA health system on FDA-ap-
proved, non-addictive alternatives to opioids for pain management.
Therapeutic Massage Services.—The Committee recognizes the
growing body of evidence supporting therapeutic massage as an ef-
fective, non-opioid alternative for managing chronic pain and post-
traumatic stress disorder among veterans. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to expand access to certified therapeutic mas-
sage services within the Community Care Network, and to report
on outcomes related to opioid prescription rates, emergency room
visits, and veteran satisfaction. The Committee further urges VA
to collaborate with external stakeholders and VSOs to promote
education and awareness of non-pharmacologic pain management
options for veterans.
PHARMACEUTICAL ISSUES
Novel Program for Optimizing Pain Management.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the balance between supporting access to care for
veterans with pain and the veteran’s risk of developing dependency
for prescription pain medication. The Committee supports the im-
plementation of a process improvement initiative that will reduce
the risk of tolerance, dependence, misuse, addiction, and diversion
of prescription pain medication by establishing more precise and ef-
fective prescribing guidelines to ensure veterans receive appro-
priate care. The Committee expects VA to deploy an innovative
clinical decision support tool to evaluate and interpret the acute
and chronic pain management needs for military veterans, their de-
pendents, and/or employees of VA. The Committee supports the use
of a novel care model that is available to those receiving treatment
through traditional VHA hospitals/clinics and those utilizing Care
in the Community.
Prescription Drug Quality.—The availability of safe and effective
prescription drugs has significant implications for the health of vet-
erans, the workload of VHA personnel, and federal spending. The
U.S. experiences over three drug recalls a day, and production of
most drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) has shifted
to China and India. VHA is one of the largest purchasers of phar-

higher- and lower-quality pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cur-
rently, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences’
(USUHS) Center for Health Services Research (CHSR) is piloting
a system to evaluate the quality of drug products for essential
medicines and develop a scoring tool for potential use in Depart-
ment of Defense procurement. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to explore a potential partnership with USUHS and work
to develop a strategy for the use of drug quality scoring in VA pro-
curement. The Committee directs the Department to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations not later than
180 days after enactment of this Act and annually thereafter on
the progress of this effort.
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER CARE
National Center for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.—Recognizing
the importance of VA’s National Center for PTSD in promoting bet-
ter prevention, diagnoses and treatment of PTSD, the Committee
provides $42,000,000 for the Center.
New Treatments for PTSD.—The Committee is aware of privately
funded research regarding potential new treatments for PTSD, in-
cluding psychedelic-assisted-therapy and encourages the Depart-
ment to monitor these efforts and review the results of existing and
future clinical trials.
Service Dogs for Veterans’ Mental Health.—The Committee is
aware of the positive impact service dogs have on military veterans
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and those
who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST). The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to establish a pilot program to
provide grants to nonprofit organizations for the purpose of assist-
ing such organizations in carrying out programs to provide service
dogs to eligible veterans. The duties of such service dog programs
shall be to plan, design, establish, or operate one or more programs
that provide service dogs to eligible veterans. Within 180 days of
enactment of this Act, the Department shall update the Committee
on the feasibility of a program, including design, cost, and potential
partnerships that could provide service dogs to eligible veterans.
Women Veterans Network.—The Committee continues to support
the role of Women Veterans Network (WoVeN), a national peer
support network for women veterans managed by the National
Center for PTSD–Women’s Health Sciences Division.
RURAL HEALTH
Office of Rural Health (ORH).—The bill includes $342,000,000 for
rural health to improve access and quality of care for the more
than 3,000,000 enrolled veterans residing in rural and highly rural
areas.
Office of Rural Health Operating Plan.—The Committee directs
the Office of Rural Health to submit not later than 60 days after
enactment of this Act an operating plan for fiscal year 2026 fund-
ing, as well as for the fiscal year 2027 funding provided in advance
by this Act.
Rural Access Network for Growth Enhancement (RANGE).—The
RANGE Program provides case management and treatment serv-
ices to mentally ill veterans in rural areas. The bill includes suffi-
cient funding to maintain three new centers of the RANGE Pro-

gram, as authorized by the Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental
Health Act of 2021 (P.L. 117–21).
Rural and Tribal Healthcare Access.—The Committee recognizes
the shortage of healthcare providers in rural communities and trib-
al lands, where approximately 4.4 million veterans face significant
barriers to accessing care. The Northern Arizona VA Health Care
System (NAVAHCS) provides timely access to healthcare services
for Native American and other rural veterans through a program
that encompasses mobile medical clinics, telehealth technologies,
and clinical staffing services. The Committee supports the
NAVAHCS model and encourages the Department to expand this
model to ten VA Medical Centers. The Department shall submit a
report to House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on these
expansion efforts within 120 days after the date of enactment of
this Act.
Transportation Challenges.—The Committee encourages the Of-
fice of Rural Health to use $10,000,000 for the continued partner-
ship between the Veterans Transportation Program and the Office
of Rural Health to continue providing transportation to VA ap-
pointments for veterans who live in rural areas.
SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDER CARE
The bill includes $232,881,000 for Substance-Use Disorder (SUD)
efforts to ensure veterans can receive timely SUD specialty serv-
ices.
Medication-Assisted Treatments.—The Committee encourages VA
to expand clinical education among its primary care practitioners
on use of long-acting injectable medications (LAIs) that are FDA-
approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, opioid use dis-
order, and serious mental illnesses, as clinically indicated.
Substance Abuse Education and Outreach.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the ongoing work of the Department to reduce substance
use disorder among veterans. The Committee supports new and in-
novative solutions, including internet-based substance abuse edu-
cation programs, to intervene early with at-risk veterans and sup-
ports programs that provide veterans and their families with the
tools they need to meet these challenges. The Committee encour-
ages VA to increase education among its primary care practitioners
on the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorders with Food
and Drug Administration-approved medication-assisted treatment
and counseling, as clinically indicated.
Tobacco Harm Reduction.—The Committee is concerned that
smoking rates among U.S. military veterans is significantly higher
than among the civilian population. The Committee is aware of the
Department’s smoking cessation program but is concerned that
there is no publicly available information regarding the success of
the program. The Committee is also aware that if the success rate
of the tobacco cessation program reflects that of the civilian popu-
lation, then over 90% of veteran participants are likely to continue
using combustible cigarettes. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to coordinate with the Food and Drug Administration to
incorporate into the Department’s smoking cessation program.

SUICIDE PREVENTION
The bill includes $698,000,000 for suicide prevention outreach
programs.
Brandon Act.—The Committee encourages the Department to
further implement the Brandon Act which empowers service mem-
bers to get the help they need confidentially.
Collaboration on Gun Safety and Storage.—The Committee is
aware of the Administration’s new national strategy, ‘‘Reducing
Military and Veteran Suicide: Advancing a Comprehensive, Cross-
Sector, Evidence-Informed Approach’’, and commends the Strat-
egy’s focus on improving Lethal Means Safety education and train-
ing for veterans, including firearms safety. The Committee con-
tinues to support collaboration across public and private sectors to
end the national tragedy of suicide and encourages VA medical cen-
ters to focus particular efforts on collaboration with state and local
law enforcement and health officials in states that have adopted
gun safety laws to adopt programs and protocols on firearms safety
and storage regarding veterans who may be struggling with suici-
dal thoughts.
Firearm Lockbox Program.—The Committee supports VA’s efforts
to address veteran suicide prevention, and the firearm lockbox pro-
gram is a critical element. As VA implements this program, the
Committee is concerned that funding limitations may impact the
scope and reach of this initiative within the broader National
Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide. The Committee encour-
ages VA to ensure that access to firearms storage resources for Vet-
erans is included in training for employees of the Veterans Crisis
Line.
Guard and Reserve Components.—In House Report 118–122, the
Committee noted that since 2020 the National Veteran Suicide Pre-
vention Annual Reports have not included information regarding
former members of the Guard and Reserve Components who were
not activated for military service. The Committee encouraged the
Department to continue to collaborate with the Department of De-
fense to monitor and to ensure appropriate measures are available
to reduce suicide in this population. Within 180 days after the date
of the enactment of this act, the Committee directs the Department
to provide a report on efforts to reduce and monitor suicides
amongst this military population.
InTransition Program.—The Committee recognizes service
members are most vulnerable to dying from suicide in the first
three months following separation from military service. The Com-
mittee is concerned that the Defense Health Agency’s transition as-
sistance programs are not connecting with over 70% of its auto-
matically enrolled service members. The Committee believes that
by moving away from a rigid one-size-fits-all approach and embrac-
ing a data-driven, personalized, and multi-channel model, the
InTransition program can maximize engagement, improve mental
health outcomes, and ensure resources are allocated efficiently.
Lethal Means Safety Training.—To prevent suicide among Vet-
erans, VA has implemented mandatory lethal means safety train-
ing for clinical health care providers in VHA facilities, but the
training remains optional for other VA employees, and for all com-
munity care providers and family caregivers. To ensure that every

employee who regularly interacts with Veterans is prepared to
have a conversation that could save a Veteran’s life, the Committee
continues to urge VA to implement mandatory lethal means safety
training for all VHA and VBA employees who regularly interact
with Veterans.
Public-Private Upstream Veteran Suicide Prevention Initiative.—
The Committee supports funding of community-based organizations
that serve as part of a public-private partnership with the Depart-
ment to address upstream prevention needs of veterans. To better
support veterans, the Committee encourages the Department to
fund community based, non-profit organizations that serve in a
statewide capacity, and have and coordinate an extensive network
of public and private sector partners to increase access to critical
services for veterans with the goal of preventing suicide; increasing
access to care and services; and improving well-being outcomes for
veterans.
Predictive Modeling and Analytics for Veterans Suicide Preven-
tion.—The Committee remains supportive of VA’s efforts to con-
tinue to address the growing number of Veteran suicides but recog-
nizes that there is a significant need to improve early suicide indi-
cators and detection using artificial intelligence and machine learn-
ing technologies that improve operational efficiency and effective-
ness throughout veteran service delivery. To improve veteran serv-
ice delivery, the Committee encourages the Department to evaluate
the use of omnichannel technologies to improve identification of at-
risk veterans. The Department may consider using all government
service delivery channels with omnichannel capabilities and real-
time analytics to ensure that interactions with a veteran can be
used to gain appropriate insights that help the Department better
identify veterans at-risk in real time and allow for the proper use
of resources and decisive actions to be taken.
Suicide Prevention Coordinators.—The Committees recognize the
importance of suicide prevention coordinators and encourages the
Department to fully staff these positions and improve veterans’ ac-
cess to these coordinators.
Study on Leading Causes of Veteran Suicides.—The Committee
directs the Comptroller General of the United States (GAO) to con-
duct a study on the leading causes of suicides among veterans and
submit the completed report to the Committee within one year of
the enactment of this bill.
Suicide Prevention Reporting.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to incorporate full veteran benefit usage in its annual
suicide prevention report to demonstrate the relationship between
VA benefits and veterans who die by suicide. The report shall con-
tain detailed usage of benefits the same way VA reports on veteran
interactions with VHA. Additionally, the Committee directs VA to
provide annual utilization reports on community grants for suicide
prevention.
Veteran Resiliency, Suicide Prevention and Response.—The Com-
mittee notes that death by suicide in our veteran population re-
mains an alarming crisis. Tragically, 18 to 24 Veterans die by sui-
cide daily. The Department’s data demonstrates that veterans sui-
cide rates have increased over the last 20 years. The Committee di-
rects VA to modernize current suicide prevention models to better
ensure they are reaching at risk veterans.

TELEHEALTH AND CONNECTED CARE
The bill includes resources for telehealth and connected care,
which includes home telehealth, home telehealth prosthetics, and
clinic-based telehealth.
The Committee directs the Department to continue to expand
telehealth availability, including the facilitation of public private
partnerships, to include additional mental health, primary care,
and rehabilitation services as a means to deliver care in rural and
underserved communities.
The Department is encouraged to leverage newly gained tele-
health capacity to address backlogs for disability exams and
healthcare appointments when appropriate. The Committee further
directs VA to continue to implement plans to improve veteran and
provider satisfaction, increase awareness of the telehealth program,
and enhance adoption of telehealth by veterans and providers.
VA Telehealth Benefits.—VA Telehealth Services are trans-
forming how veterans access high-quality VA care by making it
easier for veterans to connect with health specialists from across
the country. Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the wait times for VA telehealth
services and the active public-private partnerships that enable and
enhance telehealth access to Veterans. The report shall include an
update on obligations of public-private partnerships (P3s) included
in the Mission Act of 2018.
Veteran Access to Telehealth.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to continue efforts to improve and expand access to telehealth
services. The Committee requests a report not later than 120 days
of enactment of this Act on the estimated number of veterans who
lack access to telehealth services according to the best available
data, including the number of Veterans who lack necessary access
to the internet.
WHOLE HEALTH
The Committee supports the Whole Health model of care and the
expansion of Whole Health to all VA facilities.
Adaptive Sports.—The Committee provides not less than fiscal
year 2025 enacted levels for National Veterans Sports Programs,
including resources for adaptive sports programs. The Committee
recognizes the significant improvements that adaptive sports and
recreational therapy have on veterans’ mental and physical health.
It applauds the efforts of community providers of these grants, es-
pecially in rural areas, who have been able to utilize this key pro-
gram in successfully reintegrating veterans back into their commu-
nities. The Committee is aware that community providers of adapt-
ive sports grants spend considerable time and effort in planning
and implementing their veteran service programs. The Committee
encourages the Adaptive Sports Grants Office to recognize that re-
cruitment and planning activities are not administrative in nature
and should not be considered as such in future grant solicitations.
Continued Support and Expansion of Whole Health.—Since FY
2021, the Committee has consistently praised the Veterans Admin-
istration (VA) Whole Health System, citing its ability to provide ef-
ficient and effective patient-centered, integrative care to veterans,

especially those who are struggling with opioid use disorder and
chronic pain. The Committee recognizes that Veterans who engage
in Whole Health services experience significantly greater reduc-
tions in opioid use compared to those receiving conventional care
alone. The Committee encourages continued investment in the ex-
pansion and integration of Whole Health services across the VA
system as a proactive, evidence-based strategy to address pain
management, reduce reliance on prescription opioids, and enhance
long-term Veteran health outcomes.
Creative Arts Therapies.—The Committee continues to acknowl-
edge the effective use of creative arts therapies and arts and hu-
manities partnerships in treating veterans with traumatic brain in-
juries and psychological health conditions.
Prescription Produce.—The Committee is concerned with food in-
security among the veteran population and requests the Office of
Nutrition & Food Services work with clinicians to determine the
feasibility of delivery and coverage work streams to facilitate inte-
gration of a local produce prescription service delivery. Within one
year of the enactment of this Act, the Department shall update the
Committee on this effort.
WOMEN VETERANS HEALTH CARE
The recommendation includes a total of $1,323,444,000 to sup-
port care for women, the Office of Women’s Health and pro-
grammatic efforts, including the childcare initiative. Within this
amount, VA is encouraged to continue hiring women primary care
providers and increase the number of peer support specialists for
women veterans.
Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines.—The Committee commends
VA’s decision to offer breast cancer screening and mammography
to eligible women veterans beginning at age 40. However, the De-
partment should be prepared to offer screening to eligible younger
women veterans, especially women at higher risk for breast cancer,
should a physician determine medical necessity, or risk factors
warrant, screening before age 40. The Committee supports this ef-
fort to ensure that women veterans have access to and receive ade-
quate and timely care and requests an update on the Department’s
implementation of this policy no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act.
Care for Women.—The Committee recognizes that women are
now the fastest growing cohort within the veteran community. The
increased number of women using VHA services necessitates a
greater investment of resources to provide and expand VA’s serv-
ices to women veterans and ensure women veterans’ health needs,
which often differ from men, are met. The Committee supports con-
tinued efforts to identify and address the unique issues experienced
by women veterans. VA is encouraged to continue redesigning its
women’s healthcare delivery system and improving its facilities to
ensure women receive equitable, timely, and high-quality
healthcare.
Copper Intrauterine Devices.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment VA to study the impacts of intrauterine devices (IUDs),
especially copper IUDs, on women Veterans receiving VA reproduc-
tive health services. The study should focus on physical and non-
physical side effects, such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, head-

aches, insomnia, and potential copper toxicity. The Committee
urges the Department to evaluate these effects, analyze clinical
data and patient outcomes, and submit a report to House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations on findings no later than 120 of
enactment of this Act.
Ensuring Access to Quality Care.—The Committee recognizes the
Deborah Sampson Act is the most comprehensive legislation for
women veterans in a decade that helps address barriers that
women veterans may face when accessing VA care and benefits.
The Committee encourages VA to continue to ensure women vet-
erans have access to high quality, well-coordinated care and robust
services as required by the law.
Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes for Women Veterans.—The
Committee directs the Department to provide a report within 180
days of enactment of this Act regarding the incidence of birth de-
fects, miscarriage, stillbirth, and maternal morbidity and mortality
that can be related to military service and provide recommenda-
tions to raise awareness and improve maternal and infant health
outcomes. The Committee encourages the VHA to publicly dissemi-
nate the information found in this report to aid in awareness and
prevention measures to improve maternal and infant health out-
comes.
Maternity Healthcare and Coordination Programs.—The Com-
mittee is pleased that the Department established maternity
healthcare and coordination programs to coordinate prenatal and
postpartum care provided in the community which have been suc-
cessful in ensuring that veterans can receive high-quality, appro-
priate care and robust support during and after pregnancy. The
Committee supports these programs and encourages the Depart-
ment to continue to ensure veterans have access to high-quality,
well-coordinated care, and robust services and directs the Depart-
ment to continue to implement the Protecting Moms Who Served
Act (P.L. 117–69).
Women’s Health Research and Innovation.—The Committee is
aware of a new joint collaborative to improve women’s health re-
search for service members and veterans that will develop a road-
map to close pressing research gaps specific to women who served
in the military. Of the areas of research that will benefit women
veterans, the Committee notes that 80 percent of patients diag-
nosed with an autoimmune disease are women. The Committee en-
courages VA to engage with experts who are researching auto-
immune diseases in women veterans, including myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and Gulf War Illness.
The Department requests a detailed report within 180 days of en-
actment of this Act on how the Department is addressing and
prioritizing research gaps and how it will engage with nationally
recognized experts on diseases that impact women veterans.
WORKFORCE AND STAFFING ISSUES
Expanding Recruitment.—The Committee recognizes the chal-
lenge the Department has in the recruitment and retention of clini-
cians. To help the Department better keep pace with other pro-
viders and continue to train its workforce to improve their service
to veterans, the Committee urges the Department to explore poten-
tial options to enhance recruitment and retention, such as expand-

ing benefits to relocate to underserved VA medical facilities and ex-
panding reimbursement to clinicians for Continuing Professional
Education, regardless of individual specialty or board certification.
Expedited Hiring Authority.—The Committee strongly encour-
ages the Department to focus hiring efforts on converting clinical
trainees to full VA employment immediately upon completion of
their residencies through the utilization of the expedited hiring au-
thority granted to VA by Title 38.
Staffing Report.—The Committee looks forward to the annual
comprehensive report required by the Joint Explanatory Statement
accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L.
117–103) on the Department’s plan to address critical workforce
issues.
Staffing at Richard A. Pittman Community-Based Outpatient
Clinic.—The Committee celebrates the recent opening of the Rich-
ard A. Pittman Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in San Joa-
quin County, California. The Committee recognizes the crucial role
this clinic has in expanding primary care and specialty health care
services to veterans across California’s Central Valley. The Com-
mittee urges the Department to continue meeting staffing require-
ments to ensure clinic operations are not interrupted.
Sterile Processing Medical Supply Technician Certification.—The
Committee is aware that the Veterans Health Administration re-
cently updated its training and certification requirements for cer-
tain Sterile Processing Services (SPS) staff, bringing them more in
line with those of leading civilians healthcare organizations. The
Committee is concerned that only those serving as a VA medical
facility’s SPS Chief, SPS Assistant Chief, and SPS supervisory po-
sitions must meet those updated requirements. The Committee en-
courages the Department to train and certify all SPS staff, espe-
cially those doing the day-to-day work of sterilization.
VA/HHS Collaboration on Health Workforce Shortages.—The
Committee understands that one of the biggest hurdles in retaining
health care professionals within VA health care system is the agen-
cy’s ability to compete with market pay rates. The Committee high-
lights the VA COMPETES Act, which became law as a part of the
Elizabeth Dole Act in 2025 and allows the Secretary of VA to waive
pay caps for physicians. The Committee urges the Department to
assess how pay caps are contributing to physician shortages for key
services and how adjusting pay caps may alleviate these shortages.
VHA Physician Salaries.—The Committee understands that one
of the biggest hurdles in retaining health care professionals within
the VA health care system is the agency’s ability to compete with
market pay rates. The Committee highlights the VA COMPETES
Act, which became law as a part of the Elizabeth Dole Act in 2025
and allows the Secretary to waive pay caps for physicians. The
Committee urges the Department to assess how pay caps are con-
tributing to physician shortages for key services and how adjusting
pay caps may alleviate these shortages.

Dystonia.—The Committee continues to note the connection be-
tween traumatic brain injury (TBI) and dystonia. The Committee
requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on efforts
to pursue collaborative opportunities with the dystonia stakeholder
community and related federal agencies.
Ground Ambulance Providers.—The Committee is concerned that
the Department is inadvertently disadvantaging veterans in con-
nection to reimbursement for ground ambulance services. Specifi-
cally, under the Community Care Program, ground ambulance pro-
viders are required to notify VA and seek approval for payment
within 72-hours. By contrast, veterans have a 30-day window to no-
tify VA of their receipt of emergency treatment in a non-VA facil-
ity. This results in ground ambulance provider claims being denied
and the burden falls upon the veterans to seek reimbursement. The
Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing within 90
days of enactment of this Act regarding how the Department and
its respective VISNs could reduce the financial burden on veterans
by reducing the number of ground ambulance service claims that
are denied for failure to meet the 72-hour notification requirement
but ultimately comply with VA’s coverage rules.
Long-Term Care for Veterans with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI).—The Committee continues to note the increasing prevalence
of deployment-related traumatic brain injuries. This increase con-
tinues to demonstrate the longstanding need for providing ade-
quate long-term specialty care for Veterans suffering from severe
TBIs. The Committee is encouraged by the Department’s progress
in using agreements with non-VA providers to ensure all Veterans
receive such long-term specialty care in their communities and en-
courages the Department to continue entering into such agree-
ments, to educate case managers on all tools available to provide
veterans with long-term specialty care outside the VA system.

Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Bakersfield, California.—
The Committee remains disappointed that the new Bakersfield
CBOC remains unbuilt more than a decade after Congress author-
ized this facility in fiscal year 2010 through Public Law 111–82.
The Committee directs the Secretary to expeditiously execute Lease
No. 36C10F20L0008 and, unless prevented by an order issued by
a federal or state court, commence construction of the CBOC by no
later than September 30, 2026, as provided in the lease. Further-
more, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide monthly re-
ports to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
the CBOC’s progress until completion and activation. The Com-
mittee also directs the Secretary to examine any lessons learned,
determine what additional actions can be taken by VA to complete
this project, and provide a briefing to the Committee focused on
what legislative remedies to the current situation exist and what
legislative actions are needed to ensure this situation never hap-
pens again.
Food Pantry Program.—The Committee recognizes the success of
the Department’s food pantry program in easing veteran access to
quality food and reducing stigma around veteran food insecurity.
The Committee understands the Department collaborates with non-
profit organizations to identify potential VA medical centers with
the need and capacity for enrolling in this program and encourages
VA to ensure that at least one VA medical center in a dense urban
area offers food on-site. The Committee directs VA to identify the
additional funds necessary to scale up the food pantry program.
Lactation Spaces at VA Facilities.—The Committee recognizes
the obstacles female veterans face when trying to nurse their chil-
dren in VA facilities. The Committee requests VA ensures that
each medical center contains a lactation space.
Medical Center Services.—The Committee reminds the Depart-
ment to ensure it consults with a wide variety of stakeholders re-
garding any changes to services, hours, and staffing prior to mak-
ing changes and to ensure veterans are not negatively affected.
Personal Protective Equipment.—The Committee encourages the
Department to prioritize the purchase of domestically manufac-
tured personal protective equipment in VA facilities.
Spend Plan.—The Committee expects the Department to provide,
not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, an expenditure
plan detailing the planned use of the funds provided. The Com-
mittee understands that some of the projects planned for fiscal year
2026 may not be ready within that timeframe, requiring an adjust-
ment to the spending plan. The Committee requests a quarterly
update of the plan if the funding for any single project changes by
more than $3,000,000 during that time period.
VA Healthcare System Patient Communication Platform Expan-
sion.—The Committee is concerned about gaps in patient commu-
nication and health education across the Department’s healthcare
system, which can hinder veterans’ access to timely, relevant
health information. The Committee encourages support for the ex-
pansion and implementation of a comprehensive digital commu-

nication platform at all VA facilities. This initiative will deploy
cloud-based content management systems deliver veteran-specific
health education, promote VA healthcare initiatives, and improve
patient engagement in real time.
Veterans Integrated Service Network Distribution.—The Com-
mittee is interested in learning how the Veterans Integrated Serv-
ices Network (VISN) (1) determines patient service catchment
areas (2) assesses where to build new VA medical centers, and (3)
plans the distribution of VA medical centers and outpatient clinics
compared to the number of veterans in each area. The Committee
requests an update within 180 days of enactment, that details the
criteria used to determine how various types of medical facilities
including VAMCs and CBOCs are distributed, and the distribution
of VA medical facilities given the number of veterans in each loca-
tion.
Zero Water Laboratory Diagnostic Systems.—The Committee re-
mains concerned about cost savings for VA hospital laboratories,
and the need to increase water conservation efforts as the U.S. con-
tinues to experience record-breaking national disasters. The Com-
mittee supports the adaptation of laboratory modernization by im-
plementing little to no water laboratory systems utilizing dry
chemistry solutions for VA Medical Centers and Community Based
OutpatienClinics where feasible.
Enhanced Transparency Requirements for Contractors of High-
Cost VA Hospital Projects.—The Committee is concerned about the
oversight and execution of select, high-cost construction projects of
VA Medical Facilities and VA Health Facilities, and the impacts
that lack of adequate contractor performance have had on veteran
patient experience at such facilities due to construction or utility
failures. The Committee therefore directs the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities Management
(OCFM) to compile and submit to the Committee, not later than
120 days after enactment, a standardized requirement for an En-
hanced Transparency and Community Engagement Plan, which
shall apply to major VA construction projects with a total cost of
or exceeding $500 million, and all contractors who support con-
struction elements of such projects shall comply with.
Timely Construction of VA Medical Facilities.—The Committee
recognizes the critical importance of timely completion of Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs medical facilities to ensure that veterans
have access to the highest quality of care possible. The Committee
is aware that rising construction costs have the potential to affect
project delivery nationwide and delay urgently needed infrastruc-
ture improvements. Notwithstanding these rising costs, the Com-
mittee strongly urges the Department to prioritize the expeditious
construction of all previously appropriated VA medical facility
projects. Accordingly, the Committee directs the Department to
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House
and Senate not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act.
The report shall include a detailed cost comparison between the
original budget and current projections, an explanation of cost in-
creases, and a summary of cost containment strategies imple-
mented to mitigate further escalation and ensure responsible stew-
ardship of taxpayer dollars.

Audie Murphy Veterans Hospital Reconstruction.—The Com-
mittee is aware that the Department of Veterans Affairs has com-
pleted a feasibility study and has initiated an Environmental Im-
pact Statement to evaluate options for replacing the Audie L. Mur-
phy Memorial Veterans Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. The Com-
mittee continues to encourage the Department to advance these ef-
forts and to expedite planning and development. Given the hos-
pital’s age, significant infrastructure limitations, and the increas-
ing demand for services in one of the nation’s largest veteran and
active-duty military populations, construction of a new, state-of-
the-art medical facility in San Antonio is critical. The Committee
directs the Department to submit a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act detailing: (1) the status and findings of the com-
pleted or ongoing feasibility study; (2) the anticipated timeline for
site selection; and (3) any anticipated resource requirements nec-
essary to support replacement of the existing hospital.
BRIDGING RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR VETERAN EMPOWERMENT
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $– – –
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 970,000,000
The Committee supports the Department’s effort to end veteran
homelessness and provides $970,000,000 for the Bridging Rental
Assistance for Veteran Empowerment (BRAVE). The Committee
recognizes legislative authority is required before this initiative can
get underway. The Committee directs monthly updates as BRAVE
moves towards implementation. Updates shall include, but are not
limited to, a spend plan on how resources will be utilized, status
of obtaining needed authorities, scope and operations of the pro-
gram, personnel needs to execute BRAVE and anticipated roll out
schedule.
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $943,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 943,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $950,000,000 for Med-
ical and Prosthetic Research, available through September 30,

Section 38:
2026. The Committee appreciates the Department’s plans to focus
on critical research areas that include environmental exposures,
traumatic brain injury, cancer and precision oncology, and mental
health.
In addition to this appropriation, resources from other sources,
including appropriations from the medical care accounts, reim-
bursements from DOD, grants from the National Institutes of
Health, private sources, and voluntary organizations, support the
Department’s researchers. The total amount estimated available for
fiscal year 2026 is $1,400,000,000.
Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center.—The Committee
recognizes the Department for progress being made to provide vet-
erans with new assistive and restorative technologies that address
sensory, motor, or cognitive deficits, as well as limb loss. The APT
Center has effectively utilized a partnership model to leverage local
and national research expertise to drive progress in diverse areas
including artificial lung development, wound healing, and neural

connected sensory prosthesis. The Committee continues to support
the APT Center’s efforts.
Endometriosis.—The Committee directs the Department to en-
sure its research program adequately addresses the unique needs
and concerns of veterans with endometriosis. The Committee en-
courages VA to prioritize endometriosis research to expand basic,
clinical, and translational research into the mechanics of endo-
metriosis, identify early diagnostic markets, and develop new treat-
ment methods.
Gulf War Illness Studies.—The Committee recommends the De-
partment continue to conduct epidemiological studies regarding the
prevalence of Gulf War Illness, morbidity, and mortality in Persian
Gulf War veterans and the development of effective treatments,
preventions, and cures. The Department is encouraged to make the
findings of all research conducted by or for the Executive Branch
publicly available as soon as possible and continue to publish dis-
ease-specific mortality data related specifically to Persian Gulf War
veterans.
Herbicide-Related Toxic Exposure Research.—To understand the
residual effects of Agent Orange, dioxins, and other herbicide-re-
lated toxic exposures, the Committee urges the Department to uti-
lize reference data from existing medical records of veterans who
served in Vietnam, Thailand, Guam, the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, America Samoa, and other geographic areas where these
toxic substances were dispersed to determine the percentage who
have frequent or unexplained diseases compared to the civilian
population.
Limb Loss.—The Committee commends the Department’s work
with veterans living with limb loss, particularly its support of pro-
grams that engage amputees to become certified peer visitors for
other veterans. However, the Committee continues to note that vet-
erans fall through the cracks, as highlighted in the House Veterans
Affairs Committee hearing ‘‘Life After Limb Loss: Examining VA
Amputee Prosthetics Care, due to a lack of specific resources pro-
vided for care coordination’’. The Committee supports the Depart-
ment expanding their efforts to reach all veteran amputees across
the country and to strengthen its current program by providing en-
hanced care coordination services.
Metastatic Cancer Research.—The Committee supports the De-
partment’s work to achieve therapeutic advances that extend the
life of metastatic cancer survivors, including through clinical trials
that treat patients with diverse types of cancer, demographics, and
genetics, and recognizes more studies are required to develop a
comprehensive understanding of this complex process. The 2018
Department of Defense report to Congress on the Metastatic Can-
cer Task Force noted there are few active duty servicemembers
with metastatic cancer because they are medically retired prior to
metastasis, while the Department’s FY25 budget justification notes
that there were more than 51,000 new cases of metastasis among
veterans in 2017. The Committee directs the Department to con-
duct a study assessing the correlation between service in the mili-
tary, including types of service and exposure to different toxins or
environments, and veterans’ likelihood of a metastatic cancer diag-
nosis, and directs the Department to continue to increase veterans’

participation. The Committee requests that the Fiscal Year 2027
budget justification include an update on its progress on the issue.
National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE).—The Committee
recognizes the high-quality mental health care and neurological re-
search being conducted at the NICoE and urges the Department to
expand its work with NICoE to strengthen VA’s research capacity.
The Committee continues to encourage the Department to pursue
new collaborative initiatives with NICoE, consider public academic
medical centers as partners in such efforts, and assist DOD-wide
efforts to optimize research to implement solutions and deliver bet-
ter health outcomes for veterans.
PFAS Research and Testing.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to employ the most accurate per-and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances (PFAS) testing methods to ensure comprehensive and reli-
able results in its scientific assessment of the relationship between
PFAS exposure during military service and kidney cancer among
veterans. As PFAS comprises over 12,000 chemicals and scientific
understanding of their health impact is growing, advanced blood
testing methods including additional analytes, more in line with
the CDC NHANES 18 analyte panel, would enable the Department
to detect a broader range of PFAS compounds that veterans en-
countered during service, providing more comprehensive data to
evaluate. Further, current clinical guidelines from the National
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine have identified 9
PFAS compounds that impact human health. Blood testing meth-
ods that include these 9 PFAS analytes must be the minimum
standard for VA to detect PFAS compounds that veterans encoun-
tered during service and evaluate establishing kidney cancer as a
presumptive condition.
Research Using Animals.—The Department is directed to include
in any report to Congress describing animal research approved
under section 247 in division A of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2024 (P.L. 118–42), submitted after the date of filing of this
report, details on the specific alternatives to animals that were con-
sidered, why those alternatives were not chosen, and an expla-
nation for why these animal subjects were the only viable option
for this research. The Committee looks forward to the Department
fully implementing its plan to curtail the research conducted using
canines, felines, or non-human primates by 2026 and directs the
Department to not approve any new animal research that would
not be complete before 2026.
Vietnam Veterans Liver Fluke Cancer.—The Committee urges the
Secretary to prioritize efforts to determine whether
cholangiocarcinoma diagnoses among Vietnam-era veterans are
connected to service-related exposure to liver fluke parasites. The
Committee recognizes that emerging research suggests a potential
link between liver fluke infection and the later development of
cholangiocarcinoma. The Committee directs the Department to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
180 days of enactment of this Act on steps taken to review existing
evidence, update claims adjudication guidance if necessary, and en-
hance outreach to potentially impacted Vietnam-era veterans.

MEDICAL CARE COLLECTIONS FUND
The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections
Fund (MCCF) was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
(P.L. 105–33). The Department deposits first-party and pharmacy
co-payments, third-party insurance payments and enhanced-use
collections, long-term care co-payments, Compensated Work Ther-
apy Program collections, Compensation and Pension Living Ex-
penses Program collections, and Parking Program fees into the
MCCF. The Department uses these funds for medical care and
services to veterans. The estimate of fees that will be collected in
fiscal year 2026 is $4,580,000,000.
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025. ........................................................ $480,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 497,000,000
The Committee recommends $497,000,000 for fiscal year 2026.
NCA should prioritize maintaining the current level of services at
existing cemeteries and activating new cemeteries to increase bur-
ial access. In addition, the bill includes language making ten per-
cent of the total available until September 30, 2027.
Assessing the National Cemetery Administration’s Population
Data Collection Methodology.—The Committee is concerned that
the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) may not be fully
leveraging all available data sources to effectively target under-
served veteran populations for cemetery services. To ensure under-
served veteran populations have access to cemetery services, the
Committee encourages NCA to explore utilizing U.S. Census Bu-
reau data into its methodologies for estimating and tracking served
and unserved veteran populations, as suggested in Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) Report GAO–19–121. The Committee re-
quests an update not later than 180 days of the enactment of this
Act on prospective new methodologies for collecting veteran popu-
lation data. The update should include an examination of the util-
ity and feasibility of incorporating U.S. Census Bureau data to ei-
ther replace or supplement the NCA’s current county-based meth-
odology and include calculated percentages of confidence levels for
all methodologies.
Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery Veterans Day Community
Remembrance.—The Committee reaffirms its unwavering commit-
ment to honoring the service and sacrifice of America’s veterans by
strongly supporting the upkeep and dignified maintenance of our
national cemeteries. These sacred grounds must be preserved not
only as final resting places but as enduring symbols of gratitude
where families and communities can reflect on the legacy of those
who served. The Committee recognizes the importance of maintain-
ing national traditions that honor veterans, including the annual
Veterans Day commemoration at Fort Sam Houston National Cem-
etery, a vital event that reinforces our nation’s promise to never
forget.
Identifying Unknown Remains of Veterans.—For eight decades,
unidentified remains of veterans have been interred at the Na-
tional Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (NMCP). Efforts to identify
these remains have been ongoing, including the collection of DNA
family reference samples. Advancements in forensic genetic gene-

alogy (FGG) analysis enable the identification of previously uniden-
tified human remains, even those dating back centuries. The Com-
mittee recognizes that the National Missing and Unidentified Per-
sons System (NamUs) at the Department of Justice, formally au-
thorized by the Help Find the Missing Act (P.L. 117–327), has suc-
cessfully identified hundreds of previously unidentified sets of
human remains by leveraging FGG DNA testing technology in
partnership with accredited private laboratories. The Committee
provides $1,500,000 to partner with a private laboratory to utilize
FGG sequencing technology to identify the remains of fallen sol-
diers buried at NMCP. The Committee further directs the Depart-
ment to produce an annual report to Congress that tracks the sam-
ples analyzed, the types of DNA technology deployed, and the time
elapsed to produce an identification.
DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION

(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $475,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 450,000,000
The General Administration account provides funds for the Office
of the Secretary, the General Counsel, six Assistant Secretaries,
and two Department-level staff offices.
The Committee recommendation includes $450,000,000 for Gen-
eral Administration.
The Committee has included bill language to make available
through September 30, 2027, up to ten percent of these funds and
to permit the transfer of funds in this account to the General Oper-
ating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration account.
Additional Budgetary Information.—The Committee continues its
request that items described in previous House reports continue to
be included in the budget justifications submitted each year. Fur-
ther, the Committee directs the Department to include in its budg-
et justification materials a table for each account that shows a five-
year funding history for requested and enacted levels.
Data Governance Analytics.—The Committee continues to sup-
port the work carried out by the Department’s Office of Enterprise
Integration for the continuous improvement of veterans’ access and
outcomes throughout their lifetimes, as outlined in VA Data Strat-
egy. VA, as a learning enterprise, should manage, integrate, and
consolidate its various data sources to ensure its data of highest
quality and is used to support operational decision making. As
such, the Committee encourages OEI to further coordinate enter-
prise-wide efforts to manage VA data as a strategic asset, in order
to enhance veterans’ insights and to strengthen VA’s delivery of
services and benefits to veterans, their families, survivors, and
caregivers.
Delays With Board of Veterans Appeals.—The Committee is con-
cerned about ongoing delays veterans and their families experience
before the Board of Veterans Appeals, often causing years-long wait
times for final adjudication and resolution of claims. Within the
funds provided, the Committee urges VA to prioritize hiring the

Modernization of Financial and Acquisition Systems.—The Com-
mittee is concerned that the Department’s current approach to
modernizing its financial and acquisition systems through the Fi-
nancial Management and Business Transformation (FMBT) pro-
gram has thus far yielded little progress and encourages evaluation
of a new approach. Therefore, the Committee directs the Depart-
ment to provide a report of the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this Act that in-
cludes an analysis to determine if a viable path forward exists to
procure and deploy a flexible, modernized acquisition system, inde-
pendent of the financial system modernization efforts and ensure
that any effort to move in this direction includes an analysis of al-
ternatives and the evaluation of secure FedRAMP authorized tech-
nologies.
Quarterly Financial Information Reports.—The bill includes an
administrative provision that extends the requirement for submis-
sion of the quarterly financial information required in the fiscal
year 2017 bill and conference report.
Staff Relocations Within VA.—The bill continues the administra-
tive provision requiring written notification 15 days prior to organi-
zational changes that result in the transfer of 25 or more full-time
equivalent staff from one organizational unit of the Department to
another.
BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $287,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 287,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $287,000,000 for the
Board of Veterans Appeals. Ten percent of this funding is available
through September 30, 2027.
VA Board of Appeals Backlog.—Congress has provided funding
increases to enable the Department to hire the staff, acquire the
technology, and change work processes necessary to significantly
reduce the appeals backlog. The Committee is concerned that de-
spite these investments, the Board of Veterans’ Appeals has not
adequately addressed the backlog of veterans waiting for a decision
and that the inventory of pending appeals cannot be depleted with
the Board of Veterans’ Appeals’ current policies and procedures.
The Committee directs the Department to prioritize the processing
of appeals and to submit a plan not later than 90 days after the
enactment of this Act detailing a strategy to clear the backlog of
cases within 36 months.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

The bill makes available three percent of pay and associated
costs and five percent of operations and maintenance funds until
September 30, 2027. All development funds are available until Sep-
tember 30, 2027.
The Committee continues to include bill language permitting the
transfer of funding among the three subaccounts upon approval of
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.
The bill also continues language allowing for the reprogramming
of funds among development projects upon approval by the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.
The Committee continues to include bill language limiting the
funds available for information technology systems development to
the projects and in the amounts specified in the report. The bill
limits the amount of funds that can be transferred into the IT ac-
count to ten percent of the total of either the source or destination
account. The bill contains language that permits the reprogram-
ming of funds among development projects upon prior notification
to, and approval by, the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress.
The Committee expects the Office of Information and Technology
(OIT) to continue to provide an IT expenditure report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on a monthly
basis. This report should include a comparison to the project costs
included in the development funding chart above and provide an
explanation for any differences in excess of $3,000,000.
Benefits Technology Platform.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of simplifying and accelerating the security of the im-
portant benefits veterans have earned. To improve this process, the
Committee directs the Secretary to adopt a technology platform
that assists veterans in the challenges faced when navigating avail-
able benefits. Of the funds provided under this heading, up to
$4,000,000 may be used to partner with an outside vendor to im-
plement a software solution that leverages artificial intelligence
and automation to assist veterans in navigating the benefits
lifecycle, including application, appeals, and service connection
processes.
Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) Commercial Pilot
Program.—The Committee understands the current IGA pilot has
failed to earn authority to operate. The Committee recommends the
Department explore alternative commercial IGA pilot programs,
interoperable with CISA’s CDM architecture with hybrid cloud fea-
tures.
IT Asset Management.—The Committee is aware of improve-
ments made by the Office of Information Technology to the Depart-
ment’s IT software and hardware asset management practices and
systems, which are producing significant annual cost savings, en-
suring more accurate baseline inventories of assets owned, and im-
proving the Department’s ability to measure the total cost of own-
ership of IT assets and applications. The Committee encourages the
Department to continue replicating this success across all software
and hardware portfolios, and to ensure all software and hardware
assets are accurately reflected in the system throughout their full
lifecycles, from the time of acquisition through final disposal.

VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $1,322,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 2,515,893,000
The bill includes $2,515,893,000 for Veterans Electronic Health
Record. This increase reflects additional deployments and focus on
current site optimization, sustaining infrastructure, and supporting
19 live sites. It also assumes costs for activities related to the de-
velopment and rollout of VA’s Electronic Health Record Moderniza-
tion (EHRM) initiative, the associated contractual costs, and the
salaries and expenses of employees hired under titles 5 and 38,
United States Code.
This account is intended to be the single source of funding within
VA for the electronic health record effort. No authority is provided
for funds from other VA accounts to be transferred into this ac-
count nor for funds from this account to be transferred out to other
accounts.
The bill continues language requiring the Secretary to submit a
quarterly report to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress detailing obligations, expenditures, and deploy-
ment strategy by facility. The Department is directed to continue
quarterly briefings on performance milestones, costs, and changes
to implementation and management plans, and to provide an accu-
rate up-to-date deployment schedule prior to each quarterly brief-
ing. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to provide
updates on plans and efforts to integrate community care providers
into the new EHR system. Such updates should be submitted con-
currently with the quarterly reports.
In addition, bill language is included that makes 25 percent of
the total funding available contingent upon the Secretary providing
notice to and receiving approval from the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress of any changes to the deploy-
ment schedule, as well as an updated plan outlining benchmarks
and measurable metrics for deployment and an updated plan for
addressing all required infrastructure upgrades. The Committee
also urges the Department to notify the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress if there are any staffing chal-
lenges in go-live preparation and implementation at VA medical
centers.
The Committee repeats the fiscal year 2019 directive for GAO to
perform quarterly performance reviews of the electronic health
record deployment. It is expected that this quarterly report will
provide the Committees and VA with timely information to prop-
erly oversee this effort and address important issues.
VistA as a Service.—As the Veterans Health Administration con-
tinues transitioning from the legacy Veterans Health Information
Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Electronic Health
Record (EHR) System to the Oracle Health/Cerner Millennium
EHR solution, the Department must continue to sustain, maintain,
and evolve the existing VistA infrastructure. Assuming no further
delays, the full deployment of the new EHR system is not expected
until 2031, leaving patient care, services and many Veterans Inte-
grated Service Networks (VISNs) on the later end of the implemen-
tation schedule reliant on the legacy VistA EHR several more
years.

Maintaining the legacy EHR while deployment of the new system
is ongoing has proven to be labor intensive, requiring significant
manpower and financial investment in a tight budgetary environ-
ment. The Committee believes the Department can reduce man-
power, costs, and streamline maintenance efforts by leveraging a
model similar to that used by Department of Defense in its EHR
modernization program. DoD is efficiently utilizing private sector
system integrators to maintain and sustain the legacy system as a
service while deployment of the new system is undertaken. In
doing so, the Department would also be able to divert much need-
ed, experienced Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) staff
to the Federal EHR deployment of the new system. The Committee
urges the Department to assess the feasibility of adopting and im-
plementing a ‘‘VistA as a Service’’ model for the maintenance and
sustainment of the legacy EHRM system.
Contractor Accountability.—The Committee expects the Depart-
ment to hold its contractors accountable. The Department is ex-
pected to work closely with Oracle Cerner to resolve usability prob-
lems and dramatically improve training to ensure that when de-
ployments restart the new system can be adopted easily by clini-
cians and healthcare staff.

The Committee continues to request robust oversight of the Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization initiative and medical commu-
nity care claims.
CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ..................................................... $961,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ............................. 1,750,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $1,750,000,000 for Con-
struction, Major Projects for fiscal year 2026 which shall remain
available until September 30, 2030. The Committee supports the
Department’s efforts for projects in St. Louis, MO and Riverside,
CA. While supportive, the Committee requests further information
on plans to utilize resources to support homeless affordable housing
in West Los Angeles and New Hampshire.
As required by language that is in permanent law, all major con-
struction projects costing more than $100,000,000 must be man-
aged by a non-VA government entity, such as the Army Corps of
Engineers. While the Committee no longer duplicates this lan-
guage, the Committee intends to continue its oversight of the qual-
ity of the outside entity management and expects to receive quar-
terly briefings on each of the large construction projects.
Construction Reports.—The Committee continues to request the
Department provide quarterly briefings on the progress and cost of
each facility managed by an outside entity. Several additional bill
language provisions are included to enhance the Committee’s ca-

pacity to conduct oversight of VA’s facility construction efforts in-
cluding: (1) no funding greater than $7,000,000 may be repro-
grammed between construction projects unless approved by the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress; (2) any
change to the scope of a construction project is prohibited without
the approval of the Committees; and (3) VA must report any bid
savings of $5,000,000 or more on projects as soon as they are iden-
tified.
The Committee does not provide transfer authority between
twelve VA appropriations and for funds to be transferred to major
or minor construction to be made available for five years.
To enhance the Committee’s capacity to conduct oversight on
VA’s facility construction efforts, several administrative provisions
are continued in the bill: (1) No funding amount greater than
$7,000,000 may be reprogrammed between construction projects
unless approved by the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress; (2) any change to the scope of a construction
project is not permitted without the approval of the Committees;
and (3) VA must report any bid savings of $5,000,000 or more on
projects as soon as they are identified.

Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System’s Master Plan.—The Com-
mittee continues to encourage the Department to engage with the
Principal Developer Team responsible for the Greater Los Angles
Health Care System’s Master Plan and support the
operationalization of the Master Plan.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $171,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 171,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $171,000,000 for fiscal
year 2026 for Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Fa-
cilities. A grant may not exceed 65 percent of the total cost of the
project. The bill makes this funding available until expended.
Cost of Care for Veterans’ Homes.—The Committee is concerned
with the current reimbursement rate for state and non-profit run
Veterans’ Homes. The Committee recognizes that the costs associ-
ated with Veterans’ Homes are substantial due to the high acuity
level of the veteran population served, and that current VHA rates
are inconsistent with the current cost of care. The Committee di-
rects VHA to submit a report, no later than 90 days following the
adoption of this bill, outlining how current reimbursement rates
are calculated, how VHA makes locality adjustments, how the VHA
works to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for veterans in
homes, and recommended legislative changes for Congress to con-
sider.

Duplicative State Veterans Home Surveys.—The Committee rec-
ognizes that State Veterans Homes undergo annual inspection sur-
veys from the Department of Veterans Affairs and that many un-
dergo an additional and separate, yet nearly identical, survey from
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This practice is dis-
ruptive to the veterans and financially inefficient. The Committee
encourages VA, in coordination with CMS, to review this practice
and provide a report on whether or not this process could be
streamlined by conducting only one survey.
Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Facilities Back-
log.—The Committee recognizes the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs is experiencing a nearly $2 billion backlog in identified pri-
ority grant projects, and that an increase in resources is required
to ensure that State Veterans Homes can continue to serve their
vital role for low-income veterans and those wishing to spend their
final years housed and cared for among fellow veterans. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to brief the Com-
mittee no later than August 31, 2025, on the criteria used to
prioritize backlogged projects and existing procedural challenges
that could impede the execution of funds required to clear the back-
log.

Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $60,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 60,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $60,000,000 for Grants
for Construction of Veterans Cemeteries. The bill makes this fund-
ing available until expended.
COST OF WAR TOXIC EXPOSURES FUND
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ..................................................... $28,800,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ............................. 52,676,000,000
The bill provides $52,676,000,000 for the Cost of War Toxic Expo-
sures Fund (TEF) veterans medical care related to toxic exposures.
Congressional Commitment to the PACT Act.—The enactment of
the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act
(PACT Act) resulted in the largest expansion of veterans benefits
in a generation, providing healthcare and benefits for veterans who
were exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxic sub-
stances during their military service. The PACT Act created the
Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund (TEF) which provides manda-
tory funding for the delivery of health care and benefits for im-
pacted veterans. The Committee remains committed to providing
full funding to the Department in order to ensure successful imple-
mentation the PACT Act.
PACT Act Incremental Costs.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to include in its fiscal year 2027 and all future budget
justification materials a detailed description of the incremental
costs for implementation of the PACT Act for all requested funds
on an account-by-account basis.
Advance Funding for Veterans Medical Care From the Cost of
War Toxic Exposures Fund.—For 15 years, the Committee has ful-
filled its commitment to fully fund veterans medical care in full
and to the best of the Committee’s ability, one full year in advance.

Three years ago, the PACT Act established the Cost of War Toxic
Exposures Fund (TEF) as a dedicated source of additional funding
to address the increased demand on services at and provided by VA
as a result of the promises made in that law, including but not lim-
ited to increases in the necessary resources for veterans medical
care. Consistent with the Committee’s historical commitment to
fully fund veterans medical care in advance and the promises made
in the PACT Act, the bill includes advance appropriations of
$51,742,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 in the TEF, which is intended
to be allocated consistent with the budget request for Medical Serv-
ices, Medical Community Care, and Medical Support and Compli-
ance.

MINORITY VIEWS
The fiscal year 2026 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and
Related Agencies (MilCon-VA) bill funds critical military construc-
tion, family housing, and quality of life improvements and enhance-
ments for our brave men and women in uniform and their families.
The bill also funds a wide variety of assistance programs for vet-
erans, including disability and pension benefits, healthcare serv-
ices, educational assistance, and home loan and insurance pro-
grams they have earned through their service to our country. It
also funds the American Battle Monuments Commission, Armed
Forces Retirement Home, Arlington National Cemetery, and the
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
As context for which this bill was written, since President
Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, our democracy has
been under assault. The President has challenged Congress’ Article
I authority by illegally freezing, withholding, and canceling funds
while allowing Elon Musk to run wild in the Executive Branch. The
creation of the so-called ‘‘Department of Government Efficiency’’
(DOGE) has led to mass layoffs of thousands of dedicated and non-
partisan federal employees, while canceling programs that millions
of Americans rely on, and weaponizing the federal government to
exact revenge on the President’s enemies. These actions are un-
precedented and have challenged our judicial system and our insti-
tutions as we know them. The chaos continues to disrupt our econ-
omy, increasing costs, while our allies and partners abroad have
started to look at alternative partnerships and ways to challenge
the increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran and other adver-
saries. Despite these historic times, Republicans have buried their
heads in the sand, pretending as if none of this is happening.
Six months into this Administration, Congress has yet to receive
a budget request with full justification materials consistent with
past years. Therefore, the bill was written without any analysis or
justification usually provided for by the budget request. In fact, the
bill could not be completed in its normal form. Since there was no
budget request, the majority was not able to produce state tables
and members were not able to request community project funding
based on current year needs. Similarly, the subcommittee only held
a total of two budget hearings, a significant drop from the five
hearings the subcommittee normally holds every year and these
hearings were held without seeing any budget request materials.
These hearings are necessary to hold the Administration account-
able while increasing transparency and public awareness. Further-
more, subcommittee allocations have not been determined, leaving
questions about how much discretionary funding will be available
to fund critical programs. Put simply, the process was a mess and
Americans deserve better.

For all these reasons, and many more, Democrats held firm and
demanded 29 changes through amendments in an eleven hour long
full committee markup. While common sense amendments, such as
requests for reports to inform the committee on tariff impacts,
staffing cut impacts, and language to cut problematic riders failed,
Democrats were successful in adopting three amendments. These
three amendments ensure that cuts are not made to the Veterans
Affairs Crisis Line, increases the Veterans Affairs Crisis Line by $5
million, and provides advance funding of $51.7 billion for the Toxic
Exposures Fund (TEF), a significant improvement to the bill.
While we appreciate the efforts made to accommodate Demo-
cratic priorities, the funding levels and significant policy riders in
the MilCon-V A bill are not workable and Democrats are unable to
support this bill. The bill inadequately funds military construction
and quality of life programs for our servicemembers by almost $1
billion and prioritizes privatized medical care for veterans which
will only serve to increase costs to taxpayers while allowing for
substandard care for our heroes. Finally, the bill includes eight
egregious policy riders that limit women’s health care, constrain
suicide prevention efforts, and supports bad policy. These riders
should have no place in this bill.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
So far in his first six months as Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth
prioritized culture war issues while ignoring the things that really
matter, such as the quality of life of our troops. Secretary Hegseth
has renamed installations and warships, banned the pride flag, and
blocked qualified transgender troops from serving because he is of-
fended by diversity. He also requested a $50,000 emergency paint
job for his government furnished house while spending appro-
priated funds to build a make-up booth in the Pentagon. Mean-
while, our troops live in substandard housing, suicide and sexual
assault prevention remains a challenge, and servicemembers con-
tinue to struggle with access to affordable and high-quality
childcare. The Department has no plans to address these issues or
any other quality of life issues, except to transfer hundreds of mil-
lions out of these programs to fund a pointless border wall.
To address these quality-of-life issues, the bill includes Ranking
Member Wasserman Schultz’s request to provide $30 million in
dedicated funding to expand the oversight of the housing portfolio
at the Department of Defense, including government-owned and
controlled family housing and privatized family and unaccompanied
housing. The well-being of service members and their families is of
utmost importance, and we continue to hear unacceptable reports
of poor housing conditions, slow response times, and indifference
towards requests for assistance.
Although the bill provides $50 million in dedicated funding for
PF AS remediation and cleanup, it does not include additional,
dedicated funding for military installation climate change and re-
siliency projects, leaving our installations vulnerable to climate
change. The bill also underfunds the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation Security Investment Program (NSIP), by $188 million,
underfunding installations that our troops and allies in Europe rely

on, and especially as Russia’s illegal invasion into Ukraine ap-
proaches its fourth year.
To address the military construction shortfalls in the bill, Demo-
crats offered seven amendments to increase NSIP funding and re-
quire spend plans and approvals for the Department’s redirection
of funding to the border wall. Unfortunately, these amendments
were not adopted.
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
In the first six months of this Administration, the Department of
Veterans Affairs led by Secretary Collins, has plummeted into dis-
array with morale nosediving, threatening the ability of the De-
partment to provide benefits and high-quality care to our deserving
veterans. So far, Secretary Collins has not produced a comprehen-
sive or sensible plan for VA to improve wait times, process claims
quicker, hire qualified medical professionals, or address the mental
health crisis, all real challenges facing our veterans today. Instead,
Secretary Collins is focused on cutting the workforce by fifteen per-
cent, or over 80,000 dedicated public servants, canceling hundreds
of important contracts that provide services to our veterans, and
addressing culture war issues that only Republicans believe are a
high priority. DOGE has been allowed to access private veteran in-
formation including their social security numbers and disability
status. The Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase (VASP) Program,
designed to help veterans avoid foreclosure, has been shuttered.
Twenty-four staffers for the VA suicide crisis line were needlessly
fired, leaving calls unanswered. When asked for details or informa-
tion to better understand these serious concerns, VA has refused
to answer any questions. The Department of Veterans Affairs is in
disarray and veterans will suffer as a result.
The majority’s bill does nothing to address the legitimate con-
cerns raised above. Instead, the majority’s bill included a sixty
seven percent increase to medical community care, representing
the largest ever shift towards VA medical care privatization. A pri-
ority straight out of Project 2025. This decision was made without
any justification materials from the Administration. Democrats
support the ability for veterans to seek care where they can, but
multiple studies have shown the best care veterans can receive is
at VA facilities. We should be dedicating funding to expanding
services and hiring more medical professionals at VA, not shifting
funding to private hospitals and clinics. Furthermore, the base bill
failed to provide the $51.7 billion in advance funding for the TEF
requested by the President. Veterans were being denied the cer-
tainty they deserve, certainty that if they were exposed to toxic
substances, they would be guaranteed health care indefinitely. The
bill also included eight harmful riders, for example, blocking abor-
tion and VA from reporting veterans to the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check system who were determined to be a poten-
tial danger to themselves or others.
To fix these issues, Democrats offered 22 amendments that fo-
cused on ascertaining reports and information regarding the staff-
ing cuts, the closure of the VASP program, increasing funding for
vital programs like the crisis line and healthy food programs, and
advance fund the TEF. Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz was

successful in negotiating a deal to advance fund TEF for two years,
ensuring that $51.7 billion would be available for toxic exposed vet-
erans. This success was coupled with guaranteed protections and
increased funding for the VA crisis line as amendments from Con-
gresswoman Underwood and Congresswoman Dean were adopted.
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
This bill has been considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since trucing office in January 2025, the
executive branch has been engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and
unconstitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular, the Of-
fice of Management and Budget has been at the center of a govern-
ment-wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s laws in
its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the agency’s
legally binding budget decisions (known as apportionments) in con-
travention of an unambiguous and constitutionally sound assertion
of the Congress’s authority to impose transparency requirements
upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all but one Democrat on the Com-
mittee, the debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just
as former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
William Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney
General with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has a con-
stitutional power to decline to spend appropriated funds, we
must conclude that existence of such a broad power is sup-
ported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any purpose in the bill, so too does the Committee de-
cide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear in-
tent to be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
This subcommittee has a long-standing tradition of bipartisan-
ship, and we will work in good faith with our colleagues as we pro-
ceed through the appropriations process with the hope of restoring
bipartisan priorities in this bill. By working together, we can best
address the needs of our Nation’s military and its veterans and
reach an agreement on the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,
and Related Agencies bill for FY 2026.

PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations bill funds the Department of Defense’s activi-
ties related to military construction; family housing construction,
maintenance, and oversight; and environmental remediation at
closed military bases. The bill also funds the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, including programs to assist veterans, such as dis-
ability and pension benefits, education, healthcare, and insurance
and loan programs. The bill funds four related agencies that honor
and respect the Nation’s veterans including the American Battle
Monuments Commission; Cemeterial Expenses, Army (including
Arlington National Cemetery); the U.S. Court of Appeals for Vet-
erans Claims; and the Armed Forces Retirement Home.
SUMMARY OF COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $453,665,619,000 in total budget au-
thority for the fiscal year 2026 programs and activities funded in
the bill.
The bill includes $301,574,619,000 for mandatory programs and
$152,091,000,000 for discretionary programs.
The bill provides $17,989,000,000 for military construction and
family housing. This is an increase of $480,000,000 above the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.
The bill provides $435,333,099,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the
Department of Veterans Affairs, which is an increase of
$67,604,483,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of the
total, $301,574,619,000 is provided for mandatory benefit programs
and $133,758,480,000 is provided for discretionary programs, which
is a 13 percent increase above the fiscal year 2025 level. Of the
total for fiscal year 2026, $131,439,000,000 for veterans’ healthcare
was advanced in the fiscal year 2025 Full-Year Continuing Appro-
priations and Extensions Act, 2023 (P.L 119–4).
For fiscal year 2027, the Committee recommendation includes
$122,258,000,000 in advance appropriations for the four veterans’
medical care accounts and $262,103,337,000 in advance appropria-
tions for mandatory benefits programs.
The Committee recommendation provides a total of $324,101,000,
which is $178,209,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level for
the four Related Agencies: The American Battle Monuments Com-
mission, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Army
Cemeterial Expenses (including Arlington National Cemetery), and
the Armed Forces Retirement Home.
The Committee notes that the President’s Budget Request in-
cludes several important proposals to reform and reorganize the
Federal government. The Committee applauds these efforts to im-
prove efficiency while reducing waste, fraud and abuse. Such re-

forms are long overdue. The Committee notes that the authorizing
committees of jurisdiction have not yet had the opportunity to con-
sider these reorganizational proposals. Accordingly, the Commit-
tee’s bill and report reflect the current organizational structure of
the agencies funded herein. The Committee looks forward to work-
ing with the authorizing committees of jurisdictions as they act on
the President’s proposed organization reforms.
Advertising Contracts for Small Business.—The Committee un-
derstands that, as the largest advertiser in the United States, the
Federal government should work to ensure fair access to its adver-
tising contracts for small, disadvantaged businesses and businesses
owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs each de-
partment and agency to include the following information in its fis-
cal year 2026 budget justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2024
and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2026, respectively, for (1)
all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the ad-
vertising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged
small businesses concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women-and minority-
owned businesses.

Code, the Committee’s recommendations include several provisions
requiring the Department of Defense to report on various aspects
of military construction programs and to provide notification to the
Committee when certain actions are taken. The Committee also re-
tains prior approval authority for any reprogramming of funds ex-
ceeding a specific threshold.
Reprogramming Guidelines.—The following reprogramming
guidelines apply for all military construction and family housing
projects. A project or account (including the sub-elements of an ac-
count) that has been specifically reduced by Congress in acting on
the budget request is considered to be a Congressional interest
item and as such, prior approval is required. Accordingly, no re-
programming to an item specifically reduced below the threshold
by Congress is permitted, except that the Department may seek re-
programming for appropriated increments.

The reprogramming criteria that applies to military construction
projects is 25 percent of the funded amount or $6,000,000 and in-
cludes new housing construction projects and improvements. To
provide the Services the flexibility to proceed with construction con-
tracts without disruption or delay, the costs associated with envi-
ronmental hazard remediation such as asbestos removal, radon
abatement, lead-based paint removal or abatement, and any other
legislated environmental hazard remediation may be excluded, if
such remediation requirements could not be reasonably anticipated
at the time of the budget submission. Reprogramming is a courtesy
provided to the Department by the Committee and can be taken
away if the authority is abused. This exclusion applies to projects
authorized in this budget year as well as projects authorized in
prior years for which construction has not been completed. Design
costs associated with military construction and family housing
projects may also be excluded from these guidelines. In instances
where prior approval for a reprogramming request for a project or
account has been received from the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress, the adjusted amount approved becomes
the new base for any future increase or decrease via below-thresh-
old reprogramming (provided that the project or account is not a
Congressional interest item as defined above).
In addition to these guidelines, the Services are directed to ad-
here to the guidance for military construction reprogramming ac-
tions and notifications, including the pertinent statutory authori-
ties contained in DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14–
R and relevant updates and policy memoranda. The Committee fur-
ther encourages the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
to use a format similar to that used by the Office of the Secretary
of Defense to submit reprogramming requests.
Bid Savings.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit 1002 reports on military construction bid savings not later
than 180 days after enactment of this Act, and biannually there-
after, to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress.
Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization
(FSRM).—The Department is directed to continue describing on
form 1390 the backlog of FSRM requirements at installations with
future construction projects. For troop housing requests, form 1391
should describe any FSRM conducted in the past two years. Like-
wise, future requirements for unaccompanied housing at the cor-
responding installation should be included. Additionally, the forms
should include English equivalent measurements for projects pre-
sented in metric measurement. Rules for funding repairs of facili-
ties under the operation and maintenance accounts are described
below:
(1) components of the facility may be repaired by replace-
ment. Such replacement can be up to current standards or
codes;
(2) interior arrangements and restorations may be included
as repair;
(3) additions and new facilities, may be done concurrently
with repair projects as long as the final conjunctively funded
project is a complete and usable facility; and

(4) the appropriate Service Secretary shall notify the appro-
priate committees 21 days prior to carrying out any repair
project with an estimated cost in excess of $7,500,000.
Quarterly Summary of Notifications.—The Committee directs the
Services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (on behalf of
itself and defense agencies) to continue to submit a quarterly re-
port listing all notifications that have been submitted to the Com-
mittees during the preceding three-month period.
Incremental Funding of Projects.—In general, the Committee
supports full funding for military construction projects if they are
executable. However, it continues to be the practice of the Com-
mittee to provide incremental funding for certain large projects to
enable the Services to more efficiently allocate military construc-
tion dollars among projects that can be executed in the year of ap-
propriation.
Transfer of Funds to and from the Foreign Currency Fluctua-
tions, Construction, Defense Account.—Committee directs the De-
partment of Defense to submit a quarterly report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the transfer
of funds from military construction and family housing accounts to
the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Construction, Defense account.
The report shall specify the amount transferred to the Foreign Cur-
rency account from each military construction and/or family hous-
ing account, and all other accounts for which an appropriation is
provided in this Act, during the preceding fiscal quarter, and the
amounts transferred from the Foreign Currency account to the
above accounts during the same period. This report shall be sub-
mitted no later than 30 days after the close of each fiscal quarter.
In addition, the Department shall notify the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress within 7 days of transferring
any amount in excess of $10,000,000 to or from the Foreign Cur-
rency account.
Unfunded Priority List (UPL) and Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP).—The Committee directs the Department of Defense and
Military Services, active and reserve components as well as Com-
batant Commanders, as required by law, to submit a UPL and
FYDP to the congressional defense committees for military con-
struction projects no later than 10 days and 5 days, respectively,
after the President’s budget is submitted to Congress.
Work in Progress or Planned (WIP) Curve.—The Committee di-
rects the Services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (on be-
half of itself and defense agencies) to submit a WIP curve for each
project requested in a budget submission above $90,000,000 with
the form 1391 justification to the congressional defense committees.
The Committee also directs the Secretary of Defense to report to
the congressional defense committees quarterly, beginning in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and each quarter thereafter, of
projects that remain unawarded from the current and prior fiscal
years and the reasons for delay.

Strategy emphasizes AM’s potential to enhance operational readi-
ness by enabling rapid, on-site production of components, thereby
reducing reliance on extended supply chains. Additionally, aca-
demic studies have demonstrated that AM can decrease labor costs,
reduce material waste, and create customized complex geometries,
which are particularly beneficial in challenging construction envi-
ronments.
The Committee encourages the Department of Defense to further
explore and implement these innovative technologies in future in-
frastructure projects. Moreover, the Committee recommends
prioritizing applications in extreme weather environments that re-
quire enhanced protection from adversaries—such as Guam, where
military construction premiums are significantly higher due to geo-
graphic distance, and locations like Alaska and Poland, where se-
vere cold accelerates infrastructure deterioration.
Advanced Nuclear Power for Military Installations Program
(ANPI).—The Committee recognizes the need to expand energy re-
silience across the Department of Defense and notes the potential
for the ANPI program to improve installation level energy resil-
ience. The Committee encourages the Secretary of Defense to work
within the Department and with external partners to identify po-
tential infrastructure needs for the ANPI.

partment of a diversity of building materials, and directs the De-
partment to ensure selected building materials are mature, cost ef-
fective, and advance the performance, sustainability, reliability,
and resiliency of DoD infrastructure. The Committee believes that
Federal resources are best utilized when all materials can compete
on their own merits, allowing for the best solutions to address our
infrastructure challenges. The Committee further notes the need
for building materials and heating systems to undergo rigorous
testing, including in extreme temperature and conditions.
Camp Bull Simons Child Development Center.—The Committee
is concerned with the lack of affordable and accessible childcare for
servicemembers stationed at Camp Bull Simons and Eglin Air
Force Base. The Army and the Air Force stood up a task force to
review and propose solutions to construct a child development cen-
ter that would meet the needs of affected families. The Committee
directs the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force to brief the
Committee within 30 days of enactment of this Act on their fund-
ing plans for fiscal year 2026 with respect to construction of a CDC

cerned about the chronic shortage of quality childcare at Depart-
ment of Defense installations. The Committee encourages the De-
partment of Defense and the Services to consider innovative solu-
tions to improve childcare delivery on military installations, includ-
ing programs similar to other successful public-private partner-
ships at the Department. The Secretary of Defense, in conjunction
with the Services, shall deliver to the Committees on Appropria-
tions a report on new potential solutions to the childcare chal-
lenges, including an evaluation of the feasibility of utilizing public-
private partnerships to deliver childcare at Department installa-
tions, no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act.
Demolition of Excess Infrastructure.—The bill includes
$75,000,000 for unspecified minor military construction for demoli-
tion across the active and reserve components. The Committee is
concerned about the amount of excess and obsolete infrastructure
found on installations. While the Committee understands the need
to balance demolition with other infrastructure needs, excess infra-
structure can be costly to maintain and divert resources away from
current requirements.
Diego Garcia.—The Committee notes the strategic importance of
Diego Garcia in current and future conflicts. To better understand
the Department of Defense’s needs to support the security and in-
frastructure of the installation, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide a report, not later than 180 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, summarizing the plans for
military construction and associated infrastructure needs to maxi-
mize the effectiveness of an enhanced posture in USINDOPACOM.

Guam Military Housing.—The Committee directs the Secretary
of Defense, in coordination with the Secretaries of the military de-
partments, to submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations
not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, detailing
the cost implications and feasibility of transitioning military hous-
ing on Guam to a Public-Private Partnership model. Not later than
30 days after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary is directed
to consult with the Committee on the elements to be evaluated as
part of the report.
Hydro-Vacuum Excavation.—The Committee is aware that, ac-
cording to construction industry reporting, 180,471 unique inci-
dents of damage to underground utilities occurred across the
United States during civilian infrastructure projects in 2023. The
Committee is concerned that such utility strikes contribute to
project delays, increased costs, and disruptions to essential services
in communities surrounding construction sites, particularly when
alternative excavation methods—such as hand-digging—are used.
The Committee is further concerned that utility strikes during
military construction projects present an additional risk, as result-
ing service interruptions could adversely impact military readiness
and operational continuity. Therefore, the Committee urges the De-
partment of Defense to incorporate hydro-vacuum excavation meth-
ods when locating underground utilities in advance of military con-
struction activities, to reduce the risk of accidental strikes and en-
sure continuity of operations.
Innovative Construction Methods.—The Committee is aware of
interest across the Department of Defense, including the U.S. Army
Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) in innovative con-
struction solutions to address the challenges of operating in remote
or disaster-prone locations. These challenges include limited access
to traditional construction materials, long logistical timelines, and
vulnerability to extreme weather or natural disasters.
The Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to prioritize and
support efforts by SMDC and other entities at the Department to
identify, evaluate, and pilot novel construction methods, such as
modular systems, additive manufacturing, and rapid-deployable
structures, that can enhance the resilience, speed, and sustain-
ability of infrastructure in austere environments.

ment of each Military Service to submit a report, no later than 120
days after enactment, to include the following:
(a) A feasibility assessment on the potential application of Inter-
Governmental Support Agreements (IGSA) for Major Military Con-
struction Projects under a modified term agreement of up to 20
years; and
(b) An assessment of any further modifications to traditional
IGSA requirements that may be necessary to support the adminis-
tration and execution of Major Military Construction, as advisable.
Progressive Design Build.—The Committee is encouraged by the
Department of Defense’s ongoing evaluation of Progressive Design-
Build (PDB) as an alternative project delivery method for military
construction projects. PDB offers the potential to improve cost con-
trol, schedule certainty, and collaborative planning on complex or
large-scale efforts. The Committee commends the Department’s ef-
forts to explore innovative delivery models and encourages the use
of PDB where appropriate to achieve greater efficiency and effec-
tiveness in project execution.
Remote Pacific Locations.—The Committee is aware of the stra-
tegic importance of remote Pacific locations. While the committee
applauds the focus on modernizing and strengthening our
USINDOPACOM infrastructure through the Pacific Deterrence Ini-
tiative, the committee requests an update on the current projects
and future need. Specifically, the Committee is requesting a classi-
fied briefing on military construction needs at Wake Island, Mid-
way, Guam, Tinian, the Republic of Marshall Islands, the Fed-
erated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and other loca-
tions in the Pacific Islands. To better understand the Department
of Defense’s needs to support the security and infrastructure of
these installations, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense
to provide a report, not later than 180 days after the date of the

The Committee directs the Services to provide a briefing no later
than 120 days after enactment of this Act detailing steps being
taken to improve the conditions of each Service’s privatized housing
portfolio and an update on the efforts to expeditiously implement
the recommendations issued in GAO’s report, ‘‘DOD Can Further
Strengthen Oversight of Its Privatized Housing Program’’ (GAO–
23–105377), including the current backlog of maintenance requests;
a summary of all MHPI tenant complaints; and an updated per-
formance review of each MHPI management company.
Family Housing and CDC Heating and Air Conditioning.—The
Committee recognizes the Services’ efforts to improve energy effi-
ciency through scheduled seasonal deactivation of air conditioning
and heating systems at its facilities. Certain military installations,
deactivate these systems in family housing units and child develop-
ment centers (CDC). The Committee encourages the Department to
examine its energy conservation programs, including where family
housing units and CDCs may be excluded from air conditioning and
heating restrictions.

TITLE II
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ................................................... $367,728,616,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ........................... 435,333,099,000
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care for
9,000,000 veteran enrollees; disability compensation benefits to an
estimated 6,094,440 veterans and 562,448 survivors; pension bene-
fits for an estimated 136,678 veterans and 112,179 survivors; life
insurance for more than 5,600,000 veterans, servicemembers and
their families; educational assistance for nearly 820,000 students;
and interment of more than 140,000 veterans and eligible family
members in national cemeteries. To serve adequately the nation’s
veterans, VA employs more than 450,000 staff, making it one of the
largest Federal agencies in terms of employment.
Congressional Oversight of VA’s Actions on Abortion.—The bill
prohibits funding to implement, administer, or otherwise carry out
the actions in the interim final rule published September 9, 2022.
The interim final rule clearly violated Section 106 of the Veterans
Health Care Act of 1992 (P.L. 102–585; Title 38 U.S.C. 1710 note).
Contract Cancellations.—The Committee is concerned that the
Department cancelled many contracts and purported to reprogram
funding originally dedicated to these contracts without proper anal-
ysis on the impacts to the veteran community, or without trans-
parency about which contracts were ended, or proper notification to
Congress. If the Department seeks to reprogram previously appro-
priated funding, Congressional approval is required by law. The
Committee directs the Department to provide a report within 60
days of enactment of this Act with a list of the all cancelled con-
tracts since January 2025, the original purpose, recipient, location,
and dollar value of each contract, the date to which the contract
was originally entered into by the recipient and the Department,
and a detailed analysis of the decision-making process that led to
the cancellations.
Further, if funds were reprogrammed from cancelled contracts,
the report should list the accounts and purpose for which the funds
were reprogrammed.
Foreign Born Veterans.—The Committee supports VA’s role in
the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative and
urges VA to take steps to ensure non-citizen veterans are aware of
their options to naturalize as U.S. citizens and provide administra-
tive guidance and assistance with relevant applications and paper-
work. The Department is encouraged to continue coordination with
the Department of Homeland Security to develop methods that
allow the Department to maintain contact with immigrant and
non-citizen veterans and ensure that they can access immigration
related assistance and other VA assistance and benefits to which
they are entitled.
Oversight on Delays in Obtaining DD214s from National Ar-
chives.—The Committee is concerned about the prolonged delays
VerDate Sep 11 2014 09:32 Jun 13, 2025 Jkt 060679 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6659 Sfmt 6602 E:\HR\OC\HR161.XXX HR161

26
veterans face in obtaining their DD214 forms from the National Ar-
chives. DD214 is a critical document for veterans, required for ac-
cessing benefits, employment opportunities, and other essential
services. However, the current processing times for obtaining this
document often exceed several months, causing unnecessary hard-
ship and delays in veterans receiving the benefits and services they
are entitled to. The Committee directs the Department to work
closely with the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) to identify the root causes of these delays, improve the
process, and ensure that veterans receive their DD214s in a timely
manner. The Committee requests a brief within 90 days of enact-
ment, identifying reasons for the delays in processing DD214 re-
quests, steps being taken to streamline the request and delivery
process, including any improvements to digital record access and
electronic submission, and efforts to enhance communication with
veterans during the waiting period to keep them informed of the
status of their request.
Supporting Pay Transparency for VA Police Officers.—The Sec-
retary shall submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this
act to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and
Committee on Veterans Affairs in the House and Senate on the
compensation paid to Department police officers inclusive of their
salaries, availability pay under section 5545a of title 5, bonuses to
recruit or retain Department police officers, and any additional
compensation paid to Department police officers, including the
Chief of Police, Deputy Chief of Police, Supervisory Police Officer,
Criminal Investigator, Police Detective, Police Officer, Training Of-
ficer, Physical Security Specialist, Security Specialist Assistant,
Dispatcher, and Administrative Officer.
Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault Protections for VA Bene-
ficiaries and Employees.—The Committee directs the Secretary to
implement the recommendations laid out in GAO Report 20–387.
Veterans First Contracting Program.—The Committee recognizes
the tremendous value of the Veterans First Contracting Program in
assisting in the expansion and growth of service-disabled veteran
and veteran-owned small businesses. The Committee encourages
VA to continue to expand and make mandatory the training of con-
tracting officers in the requirements of the Veterans First Con-
tracting Program, with particular attention being paid to con-
ducting the market research necessary to ensure that service-dis-
abled veteran and veteran-owned small businesses, particularly
women and minority veteran-led small businesses, are awarded VA
contracts when appropriate.
Veterans in the Pacific.—The Committee directs the Department
to continue efforts to improve and expand access to benefits, men-
tal health, preventative and wellness programs, and telehealth,
among other programs. The Committee requests a report not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act on the progress made in
the prior fiscal year on improving access to such benefits and serv-
ices.

VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION
COMPENSATION AND PENSIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ..................................................... $177,020,200,000
Fiscal year 2026 advance appropriation (enacted) ...................... 227,240,071,000
Committee 2027 advance appropriation recommendation .......... 241,947,603,000
This appropriation provides funds for service-connected com-
pensation payments to an estimated 6,094,446 veterans and
562,448 survivors in fiscal year 2026. In addition, pension pay-
ments will be funded for an estimated 150,678 veterans and
112,179 survivors.
The appropriation includes authority to transfer funding not to
exceed $22,816,000 in fiscal year 2026 to General Operating Ex-
penses, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and Information
Technology Systems. These funds are for the administrative ex-
penses of implementing cost-saving provisions required by the Om-
nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101–508), the Vet-
erans’ Benefits Act of 1992 (P.L. 102–568), and the Veterans’ Bene-
fits Improvements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103–446). The bill also con-
tinues to include language permitting this appropriation to reim-
burse such sums as may be earned to the Medical Care Collections
Fund to help defray the operating expenses of individual medical
facilities for nursing home care provided to pensioners.
The Committee recommendation includes $227,240,071,000 for
fiscal year 2026. For fiscal year 2027, the Committee recommenda-
tion includes an advance appropriation of $241,947,603,000.
Customer Experience.—The Committee emphasizes the impor-
tance of implementing proper customer experience standards. Con-
tinued implementation of these standards includes providing sig-
nificant services directly to the public, identifying and surveying
target customers, establishing effective experience standards and
tracking internal performance against those standards. The Com-
mittee commends current efforts to implement improved customer
experience among agencies and directs all agencies funded by this
Act to continue developing standards to improve customer experi-
ence and incorporate the standards into the performance plans re-
quired under 31 U.S.C. 1115.
Ensuring VBA Access for Veterans.—The Committee is concerned
about closure of VBA offices in rural areas. Physical VBA offices
are crucial in rural areas as veterans have more limited broadband
access and transportation options. The Committee directs VA to re-
port VBA offices at risk of closure 180 days prior to VBA realign-
ment, including analysis used as justification of closure, necessary
resources needed to prevent closure and the projected realignment
of VBA staffers to nearby facilities to impacted congressional dis-
tricts, as well as VA’s corresponding efforts to ensure continued
services for impacted veterans in the area.
Signing of Veteran’s Death Certificates.—The Committee is con-
cerned that the Veterans Administration is not signing death cer-
tificates of all veterans who die of natural causes and who have as
their primary doctor a VA physician in a timely fashion. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to work in consultation with stake-
holders to prepare a report and submit it to the House and Senate

Act on the average time the Department takes to sign a death cer-
tificate for a veterans family upon notice of their passing, the aver-
age number of delays lasting longer than 72-hours over the last 5
years, the total number of refusals by VA to sign death certificates
and the reasoning behind any denial over the last 5 years, and so-
lutions to ensure that a speedy signature is done and received by
the family of our passed veterans.
Veterans Readiness & Employment Program (VR&E) Wait
Times.—The Committee is deeply concerned about staff shortages
and months-long wait times for the VR&E program. The Com-
mittee requests the Department brief both the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this
Act on the 15 Regional Offices with the longest VR&E wait times,
outlining steps that have been taken to date to reduce wait times,
and providing policy recommendations to address the problem.
READJUSTMENT BENEFITS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $13,317,066,000
Fiscal year 2026 advance appropriation (enacted) .......................... 20,372,030,000
Committee 2027 advance appropriation recommendation .............. 20,057,841,000
This appropriation finances the education and training of vet-
erans and servicemembers through the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the
All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program. In addition,
certain disabled veterans are provided with vocational rehabilita-
tion, specially adapted housing grants, and grants for automobiles
with approved adaptive equipment. This account also finances edu-
cational assistance allowances for eligible dependents of veterans
who died from service-connected causes or have a total and perma-
nent service-connected disability, as well as dependents of
servicemembers who were captured or are missing in action.
The Committee recommendation includes an advance appropria-
tion of $20,057,841,000 for fiscal year 2027.
Biomanufacturing Training.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to engage with an institution of higher education with ex-
pertise in and simulated Current Good Manufacturing Practice fa-
cilities for the provision of biomanufacturing training to consider
the establishment of a program to provide targeted, hands-on, in-
dustrial biomanufacturing training for veterans, transitioning serv-
ice members, and military spouses.
Financial Hardship and Bankruptcy.—The Committee continues
to support VA programs that combat the root causes of veteran and
dependent financial hardship, which is a known contributory factor
to negative outcomes such as mental health issues, substance use
disorder, and suicide. The Committee continues to be concerned by
an inequity in current bankruptcy law that results in the inclusion
of VA and DoD disability benefits in the calculation of a debtor’s
disposable income, while at the same time excluding Social Secu-
rity disability benefits for non-veterans.
GI Bill Comparison Tool.—The Committee emphasizes the im-
portance of providing veterans with the necessary information to
make informed decisions when selecting institutions of higher edu-
cation. The Committee urges the Department to continue to mon-
itor and assess the effectiveness of the GI comparison tool, includ-

ing usage metrics, the frequency that caution flags are checked and
updated, and technical performance.
Post 9/11 GI Bill Books & Supplies Stipend.—The Committee ac-
knowledges the increasing need for technology for education as
coursework and class materials continue to shift from physical to
virtual. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that the books and
supply stipend has not been adjusted for inflation in 15 years. The
Committee encourages the Secretary to evaluate the need to in-
crease the books and supplies stipend from the current rate of
$1,000 per year to a higher inflation adjusted level.
Skills and Certifications.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of expanding job opportunities for veterans after their dis-
charge and encourages the Department to work with other Federal
agencies and State licensing bureaus, as appropriate, to evaluate
the transferability of DoD skills and certifications, including me-
chanical skills and certifications, to state certifications to aid in
transition to civilian employment.
Technology for Student Veterans.—The Committee understands
the importance of remote learning technologies, such as computers
and routers for internet access, were widely used so students could
continue their studies. House Report 118–122 directed a report
within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on the cost, feasibility,
and advisability of ensuring student veterans have access to the
technologies needed to be successful in school. The Committee is
looking forward to receiving this report.
Transition Coordination.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment in consultation with the Departments of Defense and
Labor, to coordinate efforts and resources to ensure veterans have
a successful transition to civilian life. This includes sharing infor-
mation on community resources, including nonprofits and Veterans
Service Organizations, that are available to veterans and their
families. The Committee also urges the Department to explore op-
tions for veterans to access hands-on job placement services that
connect them directly with employers, including those offered
through successful state and local programs.
Veteran Small Business Education.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of supporting veterans pursuing entrepreneurship
opportunities, and supports educating veterans on business owner-
ship, especially on how digital tools, including artificial intel-
ligence-enabled business software or cloud computing service that
facilitate business operations, processing, payment, or tracking of
payroll expenses, human resources, or sales and billing functions
can provide efficiencies and productivity enhancements to improve
their business success rate by saving time and money. As such, the
Committee encourages the Department, in consultation with the
Small Business Administration, to educate veterans on the growing
digital tools ecosystem to better prepare veterans for an increas-
ingly digital business environment.
Veteran Transition Assistance Grant Program (VTAG).—The
Committee continues to support VSTAGP program and its goal of
providing comprehensive employment-based resources, mentorship,
and professional development to recently separated members of the
Armed Forces and their spouses. The Committee encourages the
Department to consider small and mid-sized non-profits, that have

a strong professional network in their region, when reviewing ap-

Dependent Education Assistance.—The Committee acknowledges
the work and dedication of the Veterans Affairs Survivors and De-
pendents Educational Assistance (DEA) program. The Committee
also recognizes that children of deceased or disabled veterans may
require additional tutoring or educational training to prepare for
college due to several unique challenges they face. The Committee
encourages the Department to explore utilizing DEA funding to as-
sist K–12 students in addressing these challenges to better tailor
their services to meet the specific needs of children of deceased or
disabled veterans, and ensuring these students their academic suc-
cess and college readiness. The Department shall brief the Com-
mittee 120 days following enactment of this Act on how it could ad-
dress assisting K–12 students.
VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES

The Veterans Insurance and Indemnities appropriation is made
up of the former appropriations for military and naval insurance,
applicable to World War I veterans; national service life insurance
(NSLI), applicable to certain World War II veterans;
servicemember’s indemnities, applicable to Korean Conflict vet-
erans; and veterans mortgage life insurance, applicable to individ-
uals who have received a grant for specially adapted housing.
For fiscal year 2027, the Committee recommendation includes an
advance appropriation of $97,893,000.

programs.
The Committee recommendation includes $266,736,892 for fiscal

Housing Loan Program.
VA Home Loan Program.—The Committee has been made aware
of the Department’s decision to abolish the ‘‘Participation Rule’’
which required listing agents to make an offer of compensation to
buyer brokers and could potentially disadvantage veterans utilizing
the home loan under current rules. The Committee urges the De-
partment to study its current policy of prohibiting borrowers from
paying fees or commissions to a real estate agent and determine
whether this policy negatively impacts veterans when buying a

The General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administra-
tion (VBA) account provides funding for VBA to administer entitle-
ment programs such as service-connected disability compensation,
education benefits, and vocational rehabilitation services.
The Committee recommendation includes $3,876,425,000 for fis-
cal year 2026 for General Operating Expenses, VBA. These re-
sources will improve VBA’s ability to address compensation and
benefit claims. The bill makes available through September 30,
2027, up to ten percent of these funds.
Benefits Usage.—The Committee encourages the Department to
include veteran benefit usage into its annual suicide prevention re-
port, including usage of disability compensation, education and em-
ployment, home loan and foreclosure assistance benefits, as well as

participation in housing and food security programs. Additional
data may enable a better understanding of the correlation between
benefit use and suicide and allow for more effective programs to as-
sist veterans.
Compensation and Pension Exams.—The Committee understands
the important role of contractors in providing medical disability
exams. These exams are necessary for Veterans to receive the ben-
efits that they have earned. The Committee urges the Department
to apply standard timeliness and quality performance metrics
across contract providers and VHA providers to ensure quality
exams for all Veterans. Further, VA is directed to report to the
Committee on the impact on VHA healthcare wait times before
committing additional VHA providers to the delivery of medical dis-
ability exams.
Digitizing Veteran Records.—The Committee commends the ef-
forts of VBA, in partnership with the National Archives and
Records Administration, to address the backlog of veterans’ records
requests by creating digital copies of records that currently exist
only in hardcopy form at the National Personnel Records Center
(NPRC). The Committee encourages VBA to continue its efforts to
create digital copies of veterans’ records housed at NPRC. The
Committee requests the Department update the analyses required
by House Report 117–391 on resources needed to digitize all hard
copy-only veteran records at NPRC not later than 90 days after en-
actment of this Act.
Equitable Relief.—The Committee understands the Department
is working to implement new systems and protocols to eliminate in-
stances of administrative error. However, as the Department en-
acts system-wide reforms, ending equitable relief for veterans who
were deemed eligible for benefits in error would place an unfair
burden on veterans and their families. The Secretary is encouraged
to continue to grant or extend equitable relief to eligible veterans
initially deemed eligible in instances of administrative error. Not
later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary
is directed to submit a report containing a statement as to the dis-
position of each case recommended to the Secretary for equitable
relief under section 503 of title 38, United States Code during the
preceding calendar year to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations.
Information for Toxic-Exposed Veterans.—The Committee encour-
ages VA to ensure resources and materials provided by VA to toxic-
exposed veterans be made available in the most commonly spoken
languages in the United States, as required by the Veterans and
Family Information Act (P.L. 117–62).
Mileage Reimbursements Kiosks.—The Committee is concerned
with the removal of mileage reimbursement kiosks and requests
the Department to report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the recent removal of mileage reimbursement ki-
osks from several VA facilities, which have been replaced by the
online Beneficiary Travel Self Service System. The Committee
urges the Department to reassess removing kiosks.
Military Sexual Trauma (MST).—The Committee is frustrated by
the findings of the August 2021 OIG Report titled ‘‘Improvements
Still Needed in Processing Military Sexual Trauma Claims’’ which
found VBA has failed to ensure all claims processors handling

MST-related claims have received specialized MST training. The
Committee urges VBA to prioritize specialized MST training for
claims processors, and to continue to involve MST survivors in the
development of specialized training.
Over-The-Counter-Hearing Aids.—The Committee notes that over
2.7 million veterans are compensated for hearing loss and tinnitus,
and noise exposure during military service being a major factor.
The Committee encourages VA to reassess its current model for
hearing aids. The lower cost of over the counter (OTC) hearing aids
has the potential to reduce financial strain on VA’s budget, freeing
up resources to invest in other critical areas of veteran care and
support.
Outreach to Veterans.—The Committee supports further outreach
efforts via States and Indian Tribes to carry out programs that im-
prove outreach and assistance to veterans and associated parties to
ensure individuals are fully informed about, and assisted in apply-
ing for, any veterans and veterans-related benefits and programs.
Of the funds provided under this heading, $4,000,000 may be used
for the purposes authorized under 38 U.S.C. 6307.
VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA)
The Department operates the largest integrated medical care de-
livery system in the United States, providing care at nearly 1,300
health care facilities, including 171 medical centers and more than
1,100 outpatient sites to more than 9,000,000 veterans enrolled in
VA health care program.
Funding for veterans’ health care, VA research, and the Veterans
Health Administration are provided through five discretionary ac-
counts and the mandatory Cost of War Toxic Exposure Fund. The
discretionary accounts are Medical Services, Medical Community
Care, Medical Support and Compliance, Medical Facilities, and
Medical and Prosthetic Research.
For fiscal year 2026, the Budget requested a total of
$134,439,000,000 for veterans’ medical care, including funding for
medical care for the treatment of conditions related to toxic expo-
sures.
In fiscal year 2026, VA will collect an estimated $4,580,000,000
in the Medical Care Collections Fund.
The Committee provides $943,000,000 for Medical and Prosthetic
Research for fiscal year 2026, equal to the requested level.
The Committee provides $122,258,000,000 in advance for fiscal
year 2027. The discretionary advance appropriations is in conjunc-
tion with the Toxic Exposures Fund (TEF) mandatory funding of
$52,676,000,000 in 2026.
CoPay Costs.—As part of the efforts to ensure that services deliv-
ered by the Veterans Health Administration remain affordable to
veterans, the Department is directed to provide the Committee an
update on trends in the number of veterans that are subject to
copays under the Veterans Health Administration over the last two
years, the annual average amount of copays paid by veterans sub-
ject to a copay for healthcare services, and the top ten services sub-
ject to a copay within 90 days of enactment of this Act.
Dispute Resolution.—The Committee urges VA to ensure that
veterans are advised of their rights to contest VA billing charges
and determinations and of the step-by-step process for disputes. VA

should ensure this information is available online and in publicly
accessible areas at each VA medical center, and that it is made
available in several commonly spoken languages.
Essential Medical Devices.—The United States’ manufacturing
capacity for essential medical devices is at serious risk due to orga-
nized efforts by Chinese manufacturers to enter the U.S. market in
response to inflationary pressures faced by U.S.-based manufactur-
ers, distributors, and providers. The current shift toward pur-
chasing Chinese-made medical devices is drastic and occurring at
a pace that will leave U.S. hospitals dependent on Chinese supplied
devices. The Committee urges VA to purchase essential medical de-
vices, like needles and syringes, from U.S. manufacturers or allied
trading partners. The Committee directs the Department to submit
a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on the percent-
age of Chinese made devices for the 96 device medical counter-
measures published by the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.
The report should also include specific recommendations on how
the Department can reduce its dependency on Chinese medical de-
vices, increase the domestic supply chain, while safeguarding
against shortages.
In-Vitro Diagnostic Testing for Veterans.—The Committee recog-
nizes that in-vitro diagnostics, tools used in health care to detect
diseases, infections, and other medical conditions by analyzing
specimens taken from the body, provide valuable information to
health care providers for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and monitoring of patients’ health.
Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and United States-Affiliated
Pacific Islander (NHPIUSAPI) Veterans Health.—The Committee
continues to support VA Center for NHPIUSAPIs. The Committee
encourages the Department to partner with universities in the Pa-
cific region focusing on issues unique to the NHPISAPI community.
Timeliness of Care at VA Facilities.—The Committee recognizes
the critical need for quality and timely health care for veterans.
The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a detailed report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of the enactment of this Act regarding the average waiting pe-
riods experienced by veterans seeking health care services through
VA hospitals. This report should encompass data collected from
various VA healthcare facilities nationwide, including to the extent
possible non-VHA operated clinics, analyzing both the duration vet-
erans wait from initial contact to their first appointment and any
subsequent waits for further medical treatments. The data pre-
sented in this report should be broken out by state to facilitate a
clear understanding of regional disparities and target improve-
ments effectively.
Equitable Care for Veterans.—As the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration considers policies that would disregard state anesthesia li-
censure and practice standards, the Committee requests the Under
Secretary of Health submit to the Committee within 180 days of
enactment a report on how the Under Secretary intends to ensure
that veterans who receive hospital care and medical services fur-
nished by the Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly vet-
erans who are eligible for such care and services under the PACT
Act (Public Law 117–168) and the amendments made by that Act,

The bill includes $59,858,000,000 for advance fiscal year 2027
funding for Medical Services. The Committee has included bill lan-
guage to make $2,000,000,000 of the Medical Services advance ap-
propriation for fiscal year 2026 available through September 30,
2027.
Allocation of Health Funding.—The Committee continues to re-
quest a report each year, not later than 30 days after the Depart-
ment allocates the medical services appropriation to the VISNs,
that identifies: (1) the amount of general purpose funding that is
allocated to each VISN; (2) the amount of funding that is retained
by central headquarters for specific purposes, with amounts identi-
fied for each purpose; and (3) the amount of funding that is re-
tained by each VISN before allocating it to the medical centers,
identifying separately the amounts retained for purposes such as
network operations, network initiatives, and emergencies.
Changes in Funding Requirements Due to Modeling.—The Com-
mittee expects the Department to continue to include in the suffi-
ciency letter required by section 117(d) of title 38, United States
Code, which is due to the Congress on July 31 of each year, a de-
scription of any changes exceeding $250,000,000 in funding re-
quirements for the Medical Services account resulting from the
spring recalculation of the Enrollee Healthcare Projection Model.
Support for FAS Veterans.—Since the passage of the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–42), the Depart-
ment is no longer restricted from providing services to veterans re-
siding in the Freely Associated States (FAS), including, but not
limited to, direct care from VA providers, telehealth, and care
through contracts with community providers, and shipping medica-
tions to the FAS. The Committee requests a brief within 60 days
of enactment of this Act with the estimated cost and the plan for
implementing this law in fiscal year 2026.
Treatments for Hypertension.—The Committee is concerned by
the prevalence of hypertension, or high blood pressure, and uncon-
trolled hypertension across the veterans population. In light of re-
cent advancements in hypertension treatment, such as FDA-ap-
proved renal denervation technologies, the Committee is interested
in understanding the Department’s current initiatives and re-
sources allocated to addressing hypertension and uncontrolled hy-
pertension within the Veteran community. The Committee requests
a report be submitted to the House and Senate the Committees on
Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act regarding
programs and services VA has in place to ensure that veterans
with hypertension, including uncontrolled hypertension, receive
comprehensive and timely care, including access to specialist con-
sultations and the integration of innovative treatments within its
healthcare facilities nationwide.

CANCER AND RARE DISEASES
Advanced MRI-based Solutions.—The Committee recommends
that to ensure access to advanced care for all veterans, VA Innova-
tion Ecosystem (IE) include in its fiscal year 2026 portfolio activi-
ties expanding VA healthcare system’s infrastructural reach to en-
rolled veterans residing in geographically underserved areas, in-
cluding rural and highly rural. The Committee would like IE to en-
gage industry with community stakeholders to co-develop trans-
formative, highly deployable, mobile, and scalable advanced MRI-
based solutions to identify, stratify, and manage the highly preva-
lent metabolic disease burden in VA population.
Cancer Screening at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.—The De-
partment is encouraged to ensure its healthcare providers screen
for the numerous types of cancers that veterans experience so they
can receive the best possible care.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Monitoring.—The Committee
continues to urge the Department to utilize reference data from ex-
isting medical records of veterans to determine the percentage of
veterans who have more frequent or unexplained symptoms associ-
ated with CJD compared to the civilian population. This data could
be helpful in clarifying the extent and specifics of the medical
issues suffered by veterans from exposure to CJD.
Dermatological Care for Veterans.—The Committee is concerned
by recent research studies, including those by the National Insti-
tutes of Health and the Journal of American Academy of Derma-
tology, regarding the increased risk of skin cancers in Veterans.
Servicemembers’ increased UV radiation exposure, lack of sun pro-
tective measures, and over two decades of deployments to regions
in close equatorial proximity have placed veterans at higher risk
for melanoma and other skin cancers. Veterans are also more likely
to be diagnosed with advanced-stage skin cancers than the civilian
population due to less frequent skin checks and access to special-
ized care. The committee supports continued access dermatology
screening, dermatologic preventative care, and trained Mohs micro-
graphic surgeons.
Expanding Lung Cancer Screening for Veterans.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of early detection and timely diagnosis
of cancers and encourages the Department to review and update its
approach to lung cancer screening to optimize veterans’ access to
screenings given the unique risk factors and evolving demographics
for this patient population. As part of this update, the Committee
encourages the Department to issue a request for information and
corresponding public docket to receive information and rec-
ommendations regarding the latest lung cancer research, data, and
clinical best practices to inform the updates to the Department’s
lung cancer screening guidelines and update lung cancer screening
guidelines to address those exposed to toxic hazards.
Improving Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer for Veterans.—
The Committee recognizes that Veterans are four times as likely to
develop esophageal cancer, one of the deadliest and fastest-growing
cancers, and that early detection saves lives. Despite technological
advancements, the current standard of care for surveillance and di-
agnosis misses many cases due to its limited sample collection as
well as pathologist subjectivity. The Committee urges the Depart-

ment to implement enhanced sampling technology, utilizing a spe-
cialized brush, and accompanied by computer imaging with artifi-
cial intelligence, to identify abnormalities missed by the current
standard of care and as a result identify patients for treatment at
an earlier stage.
Low Helium MRI.—The Committee recognizes that our nation’s
helium stockpile is running dangerously low, jeopardizing Ameri-
cans’ access to diagnostic MRI exams, potentially leading to false
or missed readings and diagnosis, in addition to risks to other im-
portant technologies. The Committee recognizes technology ad-
vancement in the industry that has led to the development of low
helium machines (LH–MRI) to enable fast imaging for reduced cost
to taxpayers with high resolution for improved diagnosis. Con-
verting to LH–MRI reduces the amount of helium used by MRI ma-
chines by 95.5% and removes the need for helium refills and top
offs over the lifetime of the system. The Committee encourages the
use of LH–MRI machines to reduce our dependency on helium in
the medical field for access to and diagnosis with MRI.
Medical Companion Program.—The Committee has heard from
veterans about barriers to care for undergoing outpatient or ambu-
latory procedures using sedation or anesthesia that require a re-
sponsible adult available to assist in their care before and after the
procedure. The Committee encourages the Department to support
the development of more Medical Companion programs across the
VHA system.
Molecular Diagnostics and Precision Oncology.—The Committee
believes that every veteran with cancer deserves the highest qual-
ity and most medically advanced diagnosis and treatment avail-
able, and the Committee commends the Department’s on-going Pre-
cision Oncology Program. The Committee continues to support the
precision oncology clinical services, including molecular diagnostics
for Veterans and directs that not less than $30,300,000 be utilized
for molecular diagnostics, the Department to provide a report on its
progress within 120 days of enactment.
Reducing Health and Economic Burden of Chronic Liver Disease
Among Veterans.—The health and economic burden of chronic liver
disease is growing rapidly among veterans, fueled by the preva-
lence of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The Department
mandates liver biopsy to confirm diagnosis of metabolic dysfunc-
tion-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to authorize the use of new
drug therapies. The Committee urges the Department to evaluate
the impacts of therapy, including pharmaceutical and/or lifestyle
measures, with the use of new, clinically validated, FDA-cleared,
multiparametric MRI imaging solutions to diagnose, monitor, and
improve management of veterans with MASH, while avoiding the
need for biopsy in many patients.
Improvements to VA Support for Veterans With End Stage Lung
Disease.—The Committee recognizes the work of the VA to admin-
ister benefits expansion in accordance with the PACT Act to im-
prove services available for veterans who were exposed to certain
toxins during their time in service. The Committee also under-
stands that some veterans who suffered from toxic exposures may
have developed severe lung diseases that, in end stage, require
highflow oxygen support. Certain high flow oxygen support devices
for end stage lung disease may only be accessible for operation in

long-term acute care hospitals. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to submit a report, not
later than 120 days after enactment, to include the following: (a)
An overview of current treatments, community care models, and
coverage options, to include reimbursement policies, that support
long-term, high flow oxygen support for veterans with service-re-
lated end-stage lung disease; (b) Steps the VHA may take to facili-
tate improvements to current treatments, community care models,
and coverage options, to include reimbursement policies, to support
long-term, high flow oxygen support for veterans with service-re-
lated end-stage lung disease; (c) A cost assessment to reflect total
funds the VA may require to support a change in policy to allow
long-term acute care hospitals to receive continued reimbursement,
such that they may be able to administer long-term high flow oxy-
gen treatment for veterans with service-related end stage lung dis-
ease who would otherwise require hospice home health services if
not for their unique oxygen support needs.
CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM
Caregivers Program.—The Committee provides not less than fis-
cal year 2005 for the caregivers program. The Committee continues
to require quarterly reporting on obligations for this program.
Caregiver Assistance Eligibility.—The Committee recognizes the
important role of family caregivers in supporting the health and
wellness of veterans. The Committee directs VA to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this Act on the feasibility, including cost estimates,
of expanding eligibility for the Program of Comprehensive Assist-
ance for Family Caregivers and the Program of General Caregiver
Support Services to include veterans with lower continuous care
needs and disability ratings.
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE
Epilepsy Center of Excellence.—The Committee encourages the
Department to ensure that all veterans with epilepsy are com-
prehensively evaluated at a VHA Epilepsy Center of Excellence to
identify drug-resistant epilepsy patients who may be candidates for
FDA-approved non-drug therapies.
Neurology Centers of Excellence.—The Committee recognizes the
increasing number of veterans affected by neurologic conditions, in-
cluding but not limited to epilepsy, headache, multiple sclerosis,
and Parkinson’s disease, and therefore provides $87,200,000 for the
Neurology Centers of Excellence. This includes $29,212,000 for the
Epilepsy Centers, $32,700,000 for the Headache Centers,
$6,540,000 for the Multiple Sclerosis Centers, and $17,440,000 for
the Parkinson’s Disease, Research, Education and Clinical Centers.
The Neurology Centers of Excellence provide essential innovative
clinical care, education, and research efforts focused on these condi-
tions. The Committee applauds the Department for recent invest-
ments into the headache, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s dis-
ease centers and acknowledges the advancement and expansion the
Centers have begun. The Committee encourages further invest-
ment and collaboration of the Centers across disciplines and urges
the Department to allocate robust funding for the Neurology Cen-
ters of Excellence for maintenance and expansion. The Committee

also directs the Department to report back the use and allocation
of funds for each Center within 120 of enactment of this Act.
COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS
Academic Collaborations at Community Based Outpatient Clinics
(CBOC).—The Committee encourages VA to expand academic col-
laborations with CBOCs, as they provide valuable patient care and
access to services that can be strengthened by collaboration with
educational institutions. Through clinical traineeships and research
fellowships, emerging health professionals can gain a better under-
standing of veterans’ specific healthcare needs, improve patient
outcomes, advance specialized research, and increase the talented
workforce pipeline. VA is encouraged to consider including public
academic medical centers in CBOC collaborations.
Increasing Veterans Enrollment in Medicare.—The Committee is
aware that information gaps exist for some veterans related to the
differences between hospital care and medical services available in
VA system versus coverage provided under Medicare. The informa-
tion gaps may have resulted in some veterans receiving late-enroll-
ment penalties through the Medicare program. The Committee en-
courages the Veterans Health Administration to work with the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of
Health and Human Services to ensure that veterans have accurate
information regarding the differences between VA system and
Medicare coverage, including for prescription drugs.
Private Sector Non-Profit Partnerships.—The Committee is aware
of the efforts of private non-profit organizations to support veterans
and their families in civilian life, lower veteran suicides, and make
them aware of the benefits they earned for their service. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to build upon its existing part-
nerships and seek opportunities to establish new ones. The Com-
mittee is interested in partnerships that seek to offer sustainable
solutions, improve the quality of civilian life, and seek to improve
veteran outreach to connect with those who may have slipped
through the cracks.
Veterans Access to Long-Term Care.—The Committee is aware of
the Department’s support for extending exemptions to providers,
including long-term care, operating pursuant to an agreement with
VA to improve veterans’ access to care. The Committee is con-
cerned that any additional requirements imposed on the Depart-
ment’s community care providers will make it more difficult to re-
cruit and retain these vital partners. The Committee encourages
the Department to work with the Department of Labor to seek ex-
emptions for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Providers from its
authority, similar to TRICARE providers, in order to increase vet-
erans’ access to care.
Whole Family Care Partnerships.—The Committee is aware of
the efforts of private organizations to support veterans and their
families and recognizes that they can sometimes provide services,
such as counseling and wellness programs, for the families of vet-
erans that the Department cannot. Recognizing that Congress, the
Department, and private organizations share the same goal of sup-
porting veterans, the Committee directs the Department to build
upon its existing partnerships and seek opportunities to establish
new ones. The Committee is particularly interested in partnerships

related to mental health, including the mental health of veterans’
families, and provides up to $2,500,000 to increase outreach to this
in-need underserved population.
DENTAL CARE
Dental Care.—The Committee directs that not less than fiscal
year 2025 enacted amounts be used to provide dental care for vet-
erans.
Dental Vans.—The Committee notes that many veterans residing
in rural areas must travel long distances to access quality dental
and oral care. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Com-
mittee requests the Department brief the Committee on the feasi-
bility of deploying mobile dental cleaning vans, in partnership with
any appropriate federal agencies, academic institutions, public, or
private organizations, to provide pop-up dental cleaning services
across rural, remote locations to reach veteran populations.
Veterans Oral Health.—The Committee understands that vet-
erans may experience a large oral disease burden, and therefore an
integrated and whole-person approach is needed to prevent and
manage oral disease in this population, which may also enable cost
savings in VA Health Care at large. The Committee looks forward
to receiving the report on the Department’s assessment of its oral
healthcare program and its ability to meet current and future
needs as required by House Report 118–122.
DIABETES CARE
Reducing Diabetes-Related Amputations in Veterans.—The Com-
mittee is encouraged by advancements in wound care technologies
aimed at addressing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), which present a
significant health risk and are the leading cause of lower-extremity
amputation in veterans. The Committee directs the Department to
explore methods that can be used for wounds such as diabetic ul-
cers, venous ulcers, burns, and pressure wounds and can lead to
improved outcomes while reducing long-term costs. The Committee
requests that VA provide a report within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on its findings and potential cost savings.
Reducing Type 2 Diabetes in Veterans.—The Committee com-
mends the Department for actively engaging with industry part-
ners in a study using telehealth to provide individualized ketogenic
nutrition programs and medical support to reduce the incidence of
diabetes in VA patients. The Committee applauds the effectiveness
of the study at reducing patient dependence on diabetes medication
and the clinical improvements achieved by Veterans engaged indi-
vidualized ketogenic nutrition programs. The Committee is aware
of existing plans within the Department to expand ketogenic diabe-
tes telehealth services beyond the pilot study to address the
healthcare needs of Veterans living with Type 2 diabetes. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to sustain and expand industry
partnerships and programs focused on ketogenic diabetes tele-
health services to support the health and quality of life of our Na-
tion’s Veterans.
Reducing Veteran Insulin-related Adverse Events.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to explore establishing a pilot

glycemia in hospitalized patients and consider existing commercial
technologies that are FDA-cleared and proven to reduce patient
length of stay and readmissions, integrate with existing electronic
health record systems, and reduce administrative burden on hos-
pital staff.
EMERGING AND NOTABLE HEALTHCARE ISSUES
Dialysis.—Over 18,000 veterans receive dialysis through the Na-
tional Dialysis Services Contract. The Committee appreciates the
Department’s commitment to ensure care is not disrupted or dimin-
ished for the veterans who receive treatment. The Committee looks
forward to working with the Department to utilize a value-based
dialysis payment model.
Diagnosing and Treating Sleep Disorders.—The Committee en-
courages the Department to require sleep disorder diagnosis and
treatment related study within the current Continuing Medical
Education (CME) requirements of VA physician workforce to en-
sure that veterans seeking treatment for sleep disorders are appro-
priately diagnosed and treated to prevent compounding mental
health disorders as well as to lower the high risk of cardiovascular
disease which is affiliated with sleep disorders.
Fall Prevention.—The Committee appreciates the work the Ad-
ministration has done to address and reduce fall risks in older vet-
erans. The Committee encourages the Administration to expand its
work on fall prevention.
Needle Stick Injuries.—The Committee remains interested in the
Department’s efforts to reduce or eliminate needlestick injury
among caregivers and staff at VA facilities. The Committee encour-
ages VA to use the most-up-to-date needle destruction technology.
Nuclear Medicine Quality Improvements.—The Committee notes
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has confirmed nu-
clear medicine extravasations can result in radiation-safety-signifi-
cant doses to patients and is engaged in rulemaking to require
medical event reporting of extravasations. The Committee encour-
ages VA nuclear medicine facilities to monitor injection quality,
image extravasations, conduct dosimetry, and notify patients when
large extravasations occur.
Supporting Elderly Veterans Through Geriatric Patient Aligned
Care Teams.—The Committee understands that there are currently
more than 11 million aging veterans across the United States,
making Geriatric Veterans the largest current demographic of
those who have served. The Committee urges the Department to
expand the Geriatrics Patient Aligned Care Team model to all med-
ical centers and community-based outpatient clinics deemed fea-
sible and needed.
Veterans Transportation.—The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s programs that provide veterans with transportation to VA
medical facilities and make it easier for veterans to receive medical
care and encourages VA to explore options to strengthen and sus-
tain the Volunteer Transportation Network, such as increased
funding to recruit and retain drivers and provide vehicle mainte-
nance.

HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES
Bioelectronic Medicine for Veterans.—The Committee recognizes
that Bioelectronic Medicine has the potential to harness the body’s
electrical signaling to advance treatments that save lives and lower
medical expenditures. Accelerating studies, additional data collec-
tion, and the development and adoption of novel applications for
Bioelectronic Medicine combined with machine learning and artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) can address challenging and expensive dis-
eases by personalizing treatments and improving therapy delivery.
The Committee encourages the Department to ensure that com-
bined Bioelectronic Medicine and AI technologies are available to
veterans.
Digital Quality Measures.—Health care quality measures cur-
rently rely on manual collection, exchange, management, and anal-
ysis that adds significant cost to VA health care. Digitizing health
care quality measures will lower health care costs, decrease pro-
vider burden, increase transparency, and improve patient out-
comes. The Department is encouraged to explore testing digital re-
porting methods for quality measures and consult with Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Medical Image Exchange.—The Committee applauds VA facilities
in 17 of 18 VISNs that have deployed a modern software platform
that supports bi-directional exchange of medical images, diagnostic
reports, and other clinical data between VA facilities, community
providers, and federal partners. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to expand this software’s connections to Indian and tribal
health clinics and work with the Department of Defense to expedite
connections with military treatment facilities.
PhAIMIS.—The Committee recognizes the opportunity that IT
modernization provides to realize cost savings and efficiency. Fur-
ther, the Committee appreciates efforts by the Department to mod-
ernize supply chains to achieve these goals. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to consider utilizing the Pharmacy Artificial
Intelligence Managed Inventory System’’ (PhAIMIS) program and
modernize the Supply Chain Master Catalog, utilizing commercial
solutions and competition to maximize the benefit to Veterans and
taxpayers.
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
The Committee provides $3,459,000,000 for VA homeless assist-
ance programs. An estimated $12,007,323,000 is provided for home-
less veterans treatment costs.
Programs to assist homeless veterans include the Homeless Pro-
viders Grant and Per Diem (GPD), Health Care for Homeless Vet-
erans (HCHV), the Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans, the
Supportive Services for Low Income Veterans and Families (SSVF),
Veterans Justice Outreach Homeless Prevention (VJO), Com-
pensated Work Therapy, and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development-Department of Veterans Affairs Supported
Housing (HUD–VASH) programs.
Cost of Care for Veterans’ Homes.—The Committee is concerned
with the current reimbursement rate for state and non-profit run
Veterans’ Homes. The Committee recognizes that the costs associ-
ated with Veterans’ Homes are substantial due to the high acuity

level of the veteran population served, and that current VHA rates
are inconsistent with the current cost of care. The Committee re-
quests a report, not later than 90 days following enactment of this
Act, outlining how current reimbursement rates are calculated,
how VHA makes locality adjustments, how the VHA works to re-
duce the cost of prescription drugs for veterans in homes, and rec-
ommended legislative changes for Congress to consider.
Healthcare for Homeless Veterans.—The Committee notes the
benefits of the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team (HPACT) pro-
gram and encourages VA to expand this program to additional
sites, including rural areas, and to consider additional services to
improve the program. The Committee urges the Department to ex-
plore options to expand this program to additional sites, including
cost estimates, with its fiscal year 2027 budget request.
Homeless Veterans in the Southwest.—The Committee continues
to direct VA to work with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to develop strategies and recommendations for ad-
dressing veteran homelessness including the Southwest and to take
into account undercounted veterans when awarding HUD–VASH
vouchers. The Committee appreciates VA’s efforts to implement
strategies to decrease veteran homelessness in the Southwest.
HUD–VASH Case Management.—The Committee recognizes the
value and impact of the HUD–VA Supportive Housing (VASH) pro-
gram, which serves veterans experiencing homelessness and pairs
each HUD affordable housing voucher designated for veterans with
intensive case management from VA to assist with benefits and in-
come, mental healthcare, recovery services, and permanent housing
stability. Case management services are critically important to the
function of the program, and public housing authorities rely on VA
Medical Centers’ referrals to house veterans. Existing requirements
mandate that a veteran must receive VA case management services
to receive a HUD–VASH voucher. The inadequacy of staff for case
management has contributed to the ongoing underutilization of
HUD–VASH vouchers. The Committee recommends an increase in
staffing for case management services to continue to improve the
rate of lease referrals and to account for increased staffing costs
and recent expansions in eligibility.
Legal Assistance for the Supportive Services for Veteran Families
Program.—The Committee continues to encourage the Supportive
Services for Veteran Families [SSVF] program to work with grant-
ees to expand their legal service offerings, particularly in rural
areas where access to private legal assistance can be limited.
Recovery-Oriented Care.—The health and well-being of the Na-
tion’s men and women who have served in uniform is the highest
priority for the Department. Mental health care at VA comprises
an unparalleled system of comprehensive treatments and services
to meet the needs of each Veteran and the family members who are
involved in the Veteran’s care. The Committee notes these services
support veteran resilience, identify and treat mental health condi-
tions at their earliest onset, address acute mental health crises,
and deliver recovery-oriented treatment.
SSVF–HVRP Coordination.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to coordinate with the Department of Labor to maximize the
impact of the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) pro-
gram and the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program (HVRP).

The Departments are encouraged to provide grants to eligible enti-
ties with capabilities for delivering services under both programs.
Tiny Homes.—The Committee notes the success of the tiny home
village model by multiple veterans service organizations (VSOs)
and encourages VA, in coordination with the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development to support this work and facilitate the
creation of additional villages of tiny homes villages within VA’s
existing Grant and Per-Diem (GPD) program.
Veterans At-Risk of Homelessness Data.—The Committee notes
that homelessness data may currently undercount women veterans
with children. The Committee encourages the Department to work
with the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Contin-
uums of Care to include data on veterans at-risk of homelessness
within Section 5: Veterans Experiencing Homelessness of the An-
nual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress.
INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Intimate Partner Violence Program (IPV).—The Committee con-
tinues to support the Department’s efforts to expand its IPV pro-
gram, which provides a holistic approach that involves under-
standing, recognizing and responding to the effects of all types of
trauma, with the ultimate goals to end violence, prevent further vi-
olence, and promote healthy relationships.
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS
The Committee provides $16,380,187,000 for mental health pro-
grams. Of the total, $3,161,426,000 is for suicide prevention and
treatment programs, including $698,000,000 for suicide prevention
outreach $311,683,000 for the Veterans Crisis Line, and $1,500,000
for the expansion of Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation
Treatment Programs.
The Committee continues to direct the Department to focus on
efforts to address parking lot suicides and connect veterans to care.
The Department is directed to provide a report to the Committee,
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, identifying a de-
tailed expenditure plan for all suicide outreach and treatment pro-
grams and how VA is meeting the Committee’s directives.
Agritherapy.—The Committee supports efforts to train veterans
in agricultural vocations, while also tending to behavioral and men-
tal health needs with behavioral healthcare services and treat-
ments from licensed providers. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to consider including agritherapy as a Complementary and
Alternative Medicine therapy.
Depression and Precision Medicine.—The Committee recognizes
that depression is one of the most common conditions associated
with military service and combat service. Further, the risk of sui-
cide increases with this diagnosis and each time a veteran tries
and fails a medication. The Committee is encouraged by ongoing
VA-sponsored genetic testing research to aid in depression treat-
ment selection; however, veterans still have less access than Medi-
care beneficiaries to precision medicine tools. The Committee urges
the Department to ensure the procurement of pharmacogenomic
tests for use in the treatment of depression if they have been
shown to improve health outcomes of veterans in clinical trials.

Faith Based Digital Applications Impact on Mental Health.—The
Committee understands that recent data has shown that the use
of digital, faith-based applications can have a measurable impact
on mental health and wellness. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to review the effectiveness of such applications and requests
a report on findings within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to research the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)
as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic
brain injury and should permit case-by-case referrals for veterans
to receive HBOT in the community.
Mental Health Treatment.—The Committee commends the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs for its innovative implementation of
immersive technology to improve Veterans’ health care experiences.
Immersive technology is currently being used in over 200 VA Med-
ical Centers and Facilities across all 50 states, American Samoa,
Guam, and Puerto Rico. Immersive technologies have proven effec-
tive in treating Veterans with difficult-to-treat post-traumatic
stress disorder, depression, stress, and anxiety. The Committee en-
courages the Department to consider how the use of immersive
technology can be used to expand veterans’ access to these critical
healthcare services.
Military Sexual Assault.—The Committee recommends that all
veterans seeking treatment services are screened for sexual assault
using an evidence-based screening tool to successfully treat those
who have experienced assault.
Patient Confidentiality.—The Committee recognizes that VA pro-
vides mental health services for posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), psychological effects of military sexual trauma (MST), de-
pression, grief, anxiety, and other needs. It is essential that mental
health clinicians employed or contracted by VA who are facing re-
turn-to-office directives be provided appropriate spaces to work and
provide care to patients where confidentiality will not be breached.
Peer Support.—The Committee recognizes the critical role that
peer support services play in helping veterans manage mental
health challenges, navigate the transition to civilian life, and build
community connections. The Committee urges the Department to
continue expanding access to peer support programs across VA and
to ensure that veterans are aware of the full range of available
services. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of enactment of this Act outlining existing peer support tools
and programs, including but not limited to Peer Specialist initia-
tives, Veteran Peer Support Networks, and VA-sponsored peer
mentoring efforts. The report should also identify any gaps in peer
support services and make recommendations for improving out-
reach, effectiveness, and veteran engagement.
Veterans Crisis Line (VCL).—The Committee is concerned about
the continued functionality, accessibility, and performance of the
VCL. The Committee recognizes the critical role of VCL personnel,
and the importance of uninterrupted crisis support for veterans.
The Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act. The report shall include:
(1) VCL staffing levels and service capacity; (2) performance

wait times, and referrals to suicide prevention coordinators; (3) any
contingency plans developed or implemented to maintain contin-
uous crisis line functionality and workforce stability; and (4) steps
taken to ensure alternative access to support or follow-up care for
veterans who may have been unable to connect with VCL during
or after this period.
MILITARY TOXIC EXPOSURE RESEARCH PROGRAM
The bill provides resources for research on military environ-
mental exposures. The Committee supports efforts to improve diag-
nosis and treatment of conditions resulting from toxic exposures
and appreciates the work of the Health Outcomes Military Expo-
sures (HOME) program, the Office of Research and Development,
and other VA program offices to increase attention to this issue.
The Committee encourages the Department to continue research
on the effects of and treatments for veterans exposed to toxins,
such as Agent Orange, open burn pits, PFAS, radiation, and asbes-
tos, during the course of their active-duty service. The Committee
also urges the Department to utilize reference data from existing
medical records to determine how veterans who served in areas
where toxins were dispersed may have more frequent or unex-
plained diseases compared to the civilian population.
Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence.—The Com-
mittee provides $15,165,000 and continues to support the Airborne
Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence on diagnoses, mitiga-
tion, and treatment of conditions related to airborne hazards and
burn pits.
Colorectal Cancer Screening.—Colorectal cancer is the fourth
most common cancer diagnosis among our nation’s veterans. The
Committee recognizes that early detection with screening is the
most effective tool available to help prevent thousands of cancer
deaths and that detecting cancers in earlier stages when they are
most treatable saves lives, as well as providing cost savings for the
patient and the system. The Committee urges the Department to
review its policy related to colorectal cancer screening and take ac-
tion to align it with the nationally recognized guideline rec-
ommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF), National Comprehensive Care Network, and the
American Cancer Society and explore additional research on the
prevalence of colorectal cancer in those exposed to burn pits and
other environmental hazards.
Glioblastoma and Toxic Exposure.—The Committee recognizes
the urgency of improving research, early detection, and treatment
options for glioblastoma, a rare but aggressive brain cancer that
has increasingly affected our nation’s veterans, with growing evi-
dence suggesting a link to toxic exposures such as burn pits and
other environmental hazards. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to prioritize research on the incidence of glioblastoma among
veterans, particularly Vietnam War veterans and those with known
exposure to environmental toxins, and to evaluate whether existing
screening and care adequately reflect the needs of this population.
The Committee also encourages the Department to explore partner-
ships with academic and medical institutions to advance under-

OPIOID PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAM
The bill includes $232,000,000 for opioid treatment and preven-
tion efforts. Of the total, $254,487,000 is provided for activities au-
thorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016
(P.L. 114–198).
Nonaddictive Opioid Alternatives.—According to the National In-
stitute on Drug Abuse, a significant number of veterans take a
large amount of prescription drugs, often due to high rates of
chronic pain and mental health conditions stemming from their
military service. This can lead to over-prescribing of medications
like opioids, potentially causing addiction and other health com-
plications. The Committee encourages VA to assess policies and
procedures and to work with Congress on efforts to facilitate cov-
erage of non-addictive alternatives to opioids for pain treatment
and management. The Committee supports efforts by VA to edu-
cate veterans and physicians in VA health system on FDA-ap-
proved, non-addictive alternatives to opioids for pain management.
Therapeutic Massage Services.—The Committee recognizes the
growing body of evidence supporting therapeutic massage as an ef-
fective, non-opioid alternative for managing chronic pain and post-
traumatic stress disorder among veterans. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to expand access to certified therapeutic mas-
sage services within the Community Care Network, and to report
on outcomes related to opioid prescription rates, emergency room
visits, and veteran satisfaction. The Committee further urges VA
to collaborate with external stakeholders and VSOs to promote
education and awareness of non-pharmacologic pain management
options for veterans.
PHARMACEUTICAL ISSUES
Novel Program for Optimizing Pain Management.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the balance between supporting access to care for
veterans with pain and the veteran’s risk of developing dependency
for prescription pain medication. The Committee supports the im-
plementation of a process improvement initiative that will reduce
the risk of tolerance, dependence, misuse, addiction, and diversion
of prescription pain medication by establishing more precise and ef-
fective prescribing guidelines to ensure veterans receive appro-
priate care. The Committee expects VA to deploy an innovative
clinical decision support tool to evaluate and interpret the acute
and chronic pain management needs for military veterans, their de-
pendents, and/or employees of VA. The Committee supports the use
of a novel care model that is available to those receiving treatment
through traditional VHA hospitals/clinics and those utilizing Care
in the Community.
Prescription Drug Quality.—The availability of safe and effective
prescription drugs has significant implications for the health of vet-
erans, the workload of VHA personnel, and federal spending. The
U.S. experiences over three drug recalls a day, and production of
most drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) has shifted
to China and India. VHA is one of the largest purchasers of phar-
maceuticals in the U.S. but has no way to distinguish between

higher- and lower-quality pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cur-
rently, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences’
(USUHS) Center for Health Services Research (CHSR) is piloting
a system to evaluate the quality of drug products for essential
medicines and develop a scoring tool for potential use in Depart-
ment of Defense procurement. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to explore a potential partnership with USUHS and work
to develop a strategy for the use of drug quality scoring in VA pro-
curement. The Committee directs the Department to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations not later than
180 days after enactment of this Act and annually thereafter on
the progress of this effort.
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER CARE
National Center for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.—Recognizing
the importance of VA’s National Center for PTSD in promoting bet-
ter prevention, diagnoses and treatment of PTSD, the Committee
provides $42,000,000 for the Center.
New Treatments for PTSD.—The Committee is aware of privately
funded research regarding potential new treatments for PTSD, in-
cluding psychedelic-assisted-therapy and encourages the Depart-
ment to monitor these efforts and review the results of existing and
future clinical trials.
Service Dogs for Veterans’ Mental Health.—The Committee is
aware of the positive impact service dogs have on military veterans
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and those
who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST). The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to establish a pilot program to
provide grants to nonprofit organizations for the purpose of assist-
ing such organizations in carrying out programs to provide service
dogs to eligible veterans. The duties of such service dog programs
shall be to plan, design, establish, or operate one or more programs
that provide service dogs to eligible veterans. Within 180 days of
enactment of this Act, the Department shall update the Committee
on the feasibility of a program, including design, cost, and potential
partnerships that could provide service dogs to eligible veterans.
Women Veterans Network.—The Committee continues to support
the role of Women Veterans Network (WoVeN), a national peer
support network for women veterans managed by the National
Center for PTSD–Women’s Health Sciences Division.
RURAL HEALTH
Office of Rural Health (ORH).—The bill includes $342,000,000 for
rural health to improve access and quality of care for the more
than 3,000,000 enrolled veterans residing in rural and highly rural
areas.
Office of Rural Health Operating Plan.—The Committee directs
the Office of Rural Health to submit not later than 60 days after
enactment of this Act an operating plan for fiscal year 2026 fund-
ing, as well as for the fiscal year 2027 funding provided in advance
by this Act.

Health Act of 2021 (P.L. 117–21).
Rural and Tribal Healthcare Access.—The Committee recognizes
the shortage of healthcare providers in rural communities and trib-
al lands, where approximately 4.4 million veterans face significant
barriers to accessing care. The Northern Arizona VA Health Care
System (NAVAHCS) provides timely access to healthcare services
for Native American and other rural veterans through a program
that encompasses mobile medical clinics, telehealth technologies,
and clinical staffing services. The Committee supports the
NAVAHCS model and encourages the Department to expand this
model to ten VA Medical Centers. The Department shall submit a
report to House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on these
expansion efforts within 120 days after the date of enactment of
this Act.
Transportation Challenges.—The Committee encourages the Of-
fice of Rural Health to use $10,000,000 for the continued partner-
ship between the Veterans Transportation Program and the Office
of Rural Health to continue providing transportation to VA ap-
pointments for veterans who live in rural areas.
SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDER CARE
The bill includes $232,881,000 for Substance-Use Disorder (SUD)
efforts to ensure veterans can receive timely SUD specialty serv-
ices.
Medication-Assisted Treatments.—The Committee encourages VA
to expand clinical education among its primary care practitioners
on use of long-acting injectable medications (LAIs) that are FDA-
approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, opioid use dis-
order, and serious mental illnesses, as clinically indicated.
Substance Abuse Education and Outreach.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the ongoing work of the Department to reduce substance
use disorder among veterans. The Committee supports new and in-
novative solutions, including internet-based substance abuse edu-
cation programs, to intervene early with at-risk veterans and sup-
ports programs that provide veterans and their families with the
tools they need to meet these challenges. The Committee encour-
ages VA to increase education among its primary care practitioners
on the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorders with Food
and Drug Administration-approved medication-assisted treatment
and counseling, as clinically indicated.
Tobacco Harm Reduction.—The Committee is concerned that
smoking rates among U.S. military veterans is significantly higher
than among the civilian population. The Committee is aware of the
Department’s smoking cessation program but is concerned that
there is no publicly available information regarding the success of
the program. The Committee is also aware that if the success rate
of the tobacco cessation program reflects that of the civilian popu-
lation, then over 90% of veteran participants are likely to continue
using combustible cigarettes. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to coordinate with the Food and Drug Administration to
incorporate into the Department’s smoking cessation program.

SUICIDE PREVENTION
The bill includes $698,000,000 for suicide prevention outreach
programs.
Brandon Act.—The Committee encourages the Department to
further implement the Brandon Act which empowers service mem-
bers to get the help they need confidentially.
Collaboration on Gun Safety and Storage.—The Committee is
aware of the Administration’s new national strategy, ‘‘Reducing
Military and Veteran Suicide: Advancing a Comprehensive, Cross-
Sector, Evidence-Informed Approach’’, and commends the Strat-
egy’s focus on improving Lethal Means Safety education and train-
ing for veterans, including firearms safety. The Committee con-
tinues to support collaboration across public and private sectors to
end the national tragedy of suicide and encourages VA medical cen-
ters to focus particular efforts on collaboration with state and local
law enforcement and health officials in states that have adopted
gun safety laws to adopt programs and protocols on firearms safety
and storage regarding veterans who may be struggling with suici-
dal thoughts.
Firearm Lockbox Program.—The Committee supports VA’s efforts
to address veteran suicide prevention, and the firearm lockbox pro-
gram is a critical element. As VA implements this program, the
Committee is concerned that funding limitations may impact the
scope and reach of this initiative within the broader National
Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide. The Committee encour-
ages VA to ensure that access to firearms storage resources for Vet-
erans is included in training for employees of the Veterans Crisis
Line.
Guard and Reserve Components.—In House Report 118–122, the
Committee noted that since 2020 the National Veteran Suicide Pre-
vention Annual Reports have not included information regarding
former members of the Guard and Reserve Components who were
not activated for military service. The Committee encouraged the
Department to continue to collaborate with the Department of De-
fense to monitor and to ensure appropriate measures are available
to reduce suicide in this population. Within 180 days after the date
of the enactment of this act, the Committee directs the Department
to provide a report on efforts to reduce and monitor suicides
amongst this military population.
InTransition Program.—The Committee recognizes service
members are most vulnerable to dying from suicide in the first
three months following separation from military service. The Com-
mittee is concerned that the Defense Health Agency’s transition as-
sistance programs are not connecting with over 70% of its auto-
matically enrolled service members. The Committee believes that
by moving away from a rigid one-size-fits-all approach and embrac-
ing a data-driven, personalized, and multi-channel model, the
InTransition program can maximize engagement, improve mental
health outcomes, and ensure resources are allocated efficiently.
Lethal Means Safety Training.—To prevent suicide among Vet-
erans, VA has implemented mandatory lethal means safety train-
ing for clinical health care providers in VHA facilities, but the
training remains optional for other VA employees, and for all com-
munity care providers and family caregivers. To ensure that every

employee who regularly interacts with Veterans is prepared to
have a conversation that could save a Veteran’s life, the Committee
continues to urge VA to implement mandatory lethal means safety
training for all VHA and VBA employees who regularly interact
with Veterans.
Public-Private Upstream Veteran Suicide Prevention Initiative.—
The Committee supports funding of community-based organizations
that serve as part of a public-private partnership with the Depart-
ment to address upstream prevention needs of veterans. To better
support veterans, the Committee encourages the Department to
fund community based, non-profit organizations that serve in a
statewide capacity, and have and coordinate an extensive network
of public and private sector partners to increase access to critical
services for veterans with the goal of preventing suicide; increasing
access to care and services; and improving well-being outcomes for
veterans.
Predictive Modeling and Analytics for Veterans Suicide Preven-
tion.—The Committee remains supportive of VA’s efforts to con-
tinue to address the growing number of Veteran suicides but recog-
nizes that there is a significant need to improve early suicide indi-
cators and detection using artificial intelligence and machine learn-
ing technologies that improve operational efficiency and effective-
ness throughout veteran service delivery. To improve veteran serv-
ice delivery, the Committee encourages the Department to evaluate
the use of omnichannel technologies to improve identification of at-
risk veterans. The Department may consider using all government
service delivery channels with omnichannel capabilities and real-
time analytics to ensure that interactions with a veteran can be
used to gain appropriate insights that help the Department better
identify veterans at-risk in real time and allow for the proper use
of resources and decisive actions to be taken.
Suicide Prevention Coordinators.—The Committees recognize the
importance of suicide prevention coordinators and encourages the
Department to fully staff these positions and improve veterans’ ac-
cess to these coordinators.
Study on Leading Causes of Veteran Suicides.—The Committee
directs the Comptroller General of the United States (GAO) to con-
duct a study on the leading causes of suicides among veterans and
submit the completed report to the Committee within one year of
the enactment of this bill.
Suicide Prevention Reporting.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to incorporate full veteran benefit usage in its annual
suicide prevention report to demonstrate the relationship between
VA benefits and veterans who die by suicide. The report shall con-
tain detailed usage of benefits the same way VA reports on veteran
interactions with VHA. Additionally, the Committee directs VA to
provide annual utilization reports on community grants for suicide
prevention.
Veteran Resiliency, Suicide Prevention and Response.—The Com-
mittee notes that death by suicide in our veteran population re-
mains an alarming crisis. Tragically, 18 to 24 Veterans die by sui-
cide daily. The Department’s data demonstrates that veterans sui-
cide rates have increased over the last 20 years. The Committee di-
rects VA to modernize current suicide prevention models to better
ensure they are reaching at risk veterans.

TELEHEALTH AND CONNECTED CARE
The bill includes resources for telehealth and connected care,
which includes home telehealth, home telehealth prosthetics, and
clinic-based telehealth.
The Committee directs the Department to continue to expand
telehealth availability, including the facilitation of public private
partnerships, to include additional mental health, primary care,
and rehabilitation services as a means to deliver care in rural and
underserved communities.
The Department is encouraged to leverage newly gained tele-
health capacity to address backlogs for disability exams and
healthcare appointments when appropriate. The Committee further
directs VA to continue to implement plans to improve veteran and
provider satisfaction, increase awareness of the telehealth program,
and enhance adoption of telehealth by veterans and providers.
VA Telehealth Benefits.—VA Telehealth Services are trans-
forming how veterans access high-quality VA care by making it
easier for veterans to connect with health specialists from across
the country. Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the wait times for VA telehealth
services and the active public-private partnerships that enable and
enhance telehealth access to Veterans. The report shall include an
update on obligations of public-private partnerships (P3s) included
in the Mission Act of 2018.
Veteran Access to Telehealth.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to continue efforts to improve and expand access to telehealth
services. The Committee requests a report not later than 120 days
of enactment of this Act on the estimated number of veterans who
lack access to telehealth services according to the best available
data, including the number of Veterans who lack necessary access
to the internet.
WHOLE HEALTH
The Committee supports the Whole Health model of care and the
expansion of Whole Health to all VA facilities.
Adaptive Sports.—The Committee provides not less than fiscal
year 2025 enacted levels for National Veterans Sports Programs,
including resources for adaptive sports programs. The Committee
recognizes the significant improvements that adaptive sports and
recreational therapy have on veterans’ mental and physical health.
It applauds the efforts of community providers of these grants, es-
pecially in rural areas, who have been able to utilize this key pro-
gram in successfully reintegrating veterans back into their commu-
nities. The Committee is aware that community providers of adapt-
ive sports grants spend considerable time and effort in planning
and implementing their veteran service programs. The Committee
encourages the Adaptive Sports Grants Office to recognize that re-
cruitment and planning activities are not administrative in nature
and should not be considered as such in future grant solicitations.
Continued Support and Expansion of Whole Health.—Since FY
2021, the Committee has consistently praised the Veterans Admin-
istration (VA) Whole Health System, citing its ability to provide ef-
ficient and effective patient-centered, integrative care to veterans,

especially those who are struggling with opioid use disorder and
chronic pain. The Committee recognizes that Veterans who engage
in Whole Health services experience significantly greater reduc-
tions in opioid use compared to those receiving conventional care
alone. The Committee encourages continued investment in the ex-
pansion and integration of Whole Health services across the VA
system as a proactive, evidence-based strategy to address pain
management, reduce reliance on prescription opioids, and enhance
long-term Veteran health outcomes.
Creative Arts Therapies.—The Committee continues to acknowl-
edge the effective use of creative arts therapies and arts and hu-
manities partnerships in treating veterans with traumatic brain in-
juries and psychological health conditions.
Prescription Produce.—The Committee is concerned with food in-
security among the veteran population and requests the Office of
Nutrition & Food Services work with clinicians to determine the
feasibility of delivery and coverage work streams to facilitate inte-
gration of a local produce prescription service delivery. Within one
year of the enactment of this Act, the Department shall update the
Committee on this effort.
WOMEN VETERANS HEALTH CARE
The recommendation includes a total of $1,323,444,000 to sup-
port care for women, the Office of Women’s Health and pro-
grammatic efforts, including the childcare initiative. Within this
amount, VA is encouraged to continue hiring women primary care
providers and increase the number of peer support specialists for
women veterans.
Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines.—The Committee commends
VA’s decision to offer breast cancer screening and mammography
to eligible women veterans beginning at age 40. However, the De-
partment should be prepared to offer screening to eligible younger
women veterans, especially women at higher risk for breast cancer,
should a physician determine medical necessity, or risk factors
warrant, screening before age 40. The Committee supports this ef-
fort to ensure that women veterans have access to and receive ade-
quate and timely care and requests an update on the Department’s
implementation of this policy no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act.
Care for Women.—The Committee recognizes that women are
now the fastest growing cohort within the veteran community. The
increased number of women using VHA services necessitates a
greater investment of resources to provide and expand VA’s serv-
ices to women veterans and ensure women veterans’ health needs,
which often differ from men, are met. The Committee supports con-
tinued efforts to identify and address the unique issues experienced
by women veterans. VA is encouraged to continue redesigning its
women’s healthcare delivery system and improving its facilities to
ensure women receive equitable, timely, and high-quality
healthcare.
Copper Intrauterine Devices.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment VA to study the impacts of intrauterine devices (IUDs),
especially copper IUDs, on women Veterans receiving VA reproduc-
tive health services. The study should focus on physical and non-
physical side effects, such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, head-

aches, insomnia, and potential copper toxicity. The Committee
urges the Department to evaluate these effects, analyze clinical
data and patient outcomes, and submit a report to House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations on findings no later than 120 of
enactment of this Act.
Ensuring Access to Quality Care.—The Committee recognizes the
Deborah Sampson Act is the most comprehensive legislation for
women veterans in a decade that helps address barriers that
women veterans may face when accessing VA care and benefits.
The Committee encourages VA to continue to ensure women vet-
erans have access to high quality, well-coordinated care and robust
services as required by the law.
Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes for Women Veterans.—The
Committee directs the Department to provide a report within 180
days of enactment of this Act regarding the incidence of birth de-
fects, miscarriage, stillbirth, and maternal morbidity and mortality
that can be related to military service and provide recommenda-
tions to raise awareness and improve maternal and infant health
outcomes. The Committee encourages the VHA to publicly dissemi-
nate the information found in this report to aid in awareness and
prevention measures to improve maternal and infant health out-
comes.
Maternity Healthcare and Coordination Programs.—The Com-
mittee is pleased that the Department established maternity
healthcare and coordination programs to coordinate prenatal and
postpartum care provided in the community which have been suc-
cessful in ensuring that veterans can receive high-quality, appro-
priate care and robust support during and after pregnancy. The
Committee supports these programs and encourages the Depart-
ment to continue to ensure veterans have access to high-quality,
well-coordinated care, and robust services and directs the Depart-
ment to continue to implement the Protecting Moms Who Served
Act (P.L. 117–69).
Women’s Health Research and Innovation.—The Committee is
aware of a new joint collaborative to improve women’s health re-
search for service members and veterans that will develop a road-
map to close pressing research gaps specific to women who served
in the military. Of the areas of research that will benefit women
veterans, the Committee notes that 80 percent of patients diag-
nosed with an autoimmune disease are women. The Committee en-
courages VA to engage with experts who are researching auto-
immune diseases in women veterans, including myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and Gulf War Illness.
The Department requests a detailed report within 180 days of en-
actment of this Act on how the Department is addressing and
prioritizing research gaps and how it will engage with nationally
recognized experts on diseases that impact women veterans.
WORKFORCE AND STAFFING ISSUES
Expanding Recruitment.—The Committee recognizes the chal-
lenge the Department has in the recruitment and retention of clini-
cians. To help the Department better keep pace with other pro-
viders and continue to train its workforce to improve their service
to veterans, the Committee urges the Department to explore poten-
tial options to enhance recruitment and retention, such as expand-

ing benefits to relocate to underserved VA medical facilities and ex-
panding reimbursement to clinicians for Continuing Professional
Education, regardless of individual specialty or board certification.
Expedited Hiring Authority.—The Committee strongly encour-
ages the Department to focus hiring efforts on converting clinical
trainees to full VA employment immediately upon completion of
their residencies through the utilization of the expedited hiring au-
thority granted to VA by Title 38.
Staffing Report.—The Committee looks forward to the annual
comprehensive report required by the Joint Explanatory Statement
accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L.
117–103) on the Department’s plan to address critical workforce
issues.
Staffing at Richard A. Pittman Community-Based Outpatient
Clinic.—The Committee celebrates the recent opening of the Rich-
ard A. Pittman Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in San Joa-
quin County, California. The Committee recognizes the crucial role
this clinic has in expanding primary care and specialty health care
services to veterans across California’s Central Valley. The Com-
mittee urges the Department to continue meeting staffing require-
ments to ensure clinic operations are not interrupted.
Sterile Processing Medical Supply Technician Certification.—The
Committee is aware that the Veterans Health Administration re-
cently updated its training and certification requirements for cer-
tain Sterile Processing Services (SPS) staff, bringing them more in
line with those of leading civilians healthcare organizations. The
Committee is concerned that only those serving as a VA medical
facility’s SPS Chief, SPS Assistant Chief, and SPS supervisory po-
sitions must meet those updated requirements. The Committee en-
courages the Department to train and certify all SPS staff, espe-
cially those doing the day-to-day work of sterilization.
VA/HHS Collaboration on Health Workforce Shortages.—The
Committee understands that one of the biggest hurdles in retaining
health care professionals within VA health care system is the agen-
cy’s ability to compete with market pay rates. The Committee high-
lights the VA COMPETES Act, which became law as a part of the
Elizabeth Dole Act in 2025 and allows the Secretary of VA to waive
pay caps for physicians. The Committee urges the Department to
assess how pay caps are contributing to physician shortages for key
services and how adjusting pay caps may alleviate these shortages.
VHA Physician Salaries.—The Committee understands that one
of the biggest hurdles in retaining health care professionals within
the VA health care system is the agency’s ability to compete with
market pay rates. The Committee highlights the VA COMPETES
Act, which became law as a part of the Elizabeth Dole Act in 2025
and allows the Secretary to waive pay caps for physicians. The
Committee urges the Department to assess how pay caps are con-
tributing to physician shortages for key services and how adjusting
pay caps may alleviate these shortages.

Dystonia.—The Committee continues to note the connection be-
tween traumatic brain injury (TBI) and dystonia. The Committee
requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on efforts
to pursue collaborative opportunities with the dystonia stakeholder
community and related federal agencies.
Ground Ambulance Providers.—The Committee is concerned that
the Department is inadvertently disadvantaging veterans in con-
nection to reimbursement for ground ambulance services. Specifi-
cally, under the Community Care Program, ground ambulance pro-
viders are required to notify VA and seek approval for payment
within 72-hours. By contrast, veterans have a 30-day window to no-
tify VA of their receipt of emergency treatment in a non-VA facil-
ity. This results in ground ambulance provider claims being denied
and the burden falls upon the veterans to seek reimbursement. The
Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing within 90
days of enactment of this Act regarding how the Department and
its respective VISNs could reduce the financial burden on veterans
by reducing the number of ground ambulance service claims that
are denied for failure to meet the 72-hour notification requirement
but ultimately comply with VA’s coverage rules.
Long-Term Care for Veterans with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI).—The Committee continues to note the increasing prevalence
of deployment-related traumatic brain injuries. This increase con-
tinues to demonstrate the longstanding need for providing ade-
quate long-term specialty care for Veterans suffering from severe
TBIs. The Committee is encouraged by the Department’s progress
in using agreements with non-VA providers to ensure all Veterans
receive such long-term specialty care in their communities and en-
courages the Department to continue entering into such agree-
ments, to educate case managers on all tools available to provide
veterans with long-term specialty care outside the VA system.

Identity Governance and Administration (IGA).—The Committee
recognizes that the current IGA pilot has failed to earn authority
to operate, therefore the Committee encourages the Department ex-
plore alternative commercial IGA programs, interoperable with
CISA’s CDM architecture with hybrid cloud features.

Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Bakersfield, California.—
The Committee remains disappointed that the new Bakersfield
CBOC remains unbuilt more than a decade after Congress author-
ized this facility in fiscal year 2010 through Public Law 111–82.
The Committee directs the Secretary to expeditiously execute Lease
No. 36C10F20L0008 and, unless prevented by an order issued by
a federal or state court, commence construction of the CBOC by no
later than September 30, 2026, as provided in the lease. Further-
more, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide monthly re-
ports to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
the CBOC’s progress until completion and activation. The Com-
mittee also directs the Secretary to examine any lessons learned,
determine what additional actions can be taken by VA to complete
this project, and provide a briefing to the Committee focused on
what legislative remedies to the current situation exist and what
legislative actions are needed to ensure this situation never hap-
pens again.
Food Pantry Program.—The Committee recognizes the success of
the Department’s food pantry program in easing veteran access to
quality food and reducing stigma around veteran food insecurity.
The Committee understands the Department collaborates with non-
profit organizations to identify potential VA medical centers with
the need and capacity for enrolling in this program and encourages
VA to ensure that at least one VA medical center in a dense urban
area offers food on-site. The Committee directs VA to identify the
additional funds necessary to scale up the food pantry program.
Lactation Spaces at VA Facilities.—The Committee recognizes
the obstacles female veterans face when trying to nurse their chil-
dren in VA facilities. The Committee requests VA ensures that
each medical center contains a lactation space.
Medical Center Services.—The Committee reminds the Depart-
ment to ensure it consults with a wide variety of stakeholders re-
garding any changes to services, hours, and staffing prior to mak-
ing changes and to ensure veterans are not negatively affected.
Personal Protective Equipment.—The Committee encourages the
Department to prioritize the purchase of domestically manufac-
tured personal protective equipment in VA facilities.
Spend Plan.—The Committee expects the Department to provide,
not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, an expenditure
plan detailing the planned use of the funds provided. The Com-
mittee understands that some of the projects planned for fiscal year
2026 may not be ready within that timeframe, requiring an adjust-
ment to the spending plan. The Committee requests a quarterly
update of the plan if the funding for any single project changes by
more than $3,000,000 during that time period.
VA Healthcare System Patient Communication Platform Expan-
sion.—The Committee is concerned about gaps in patient commu-
nication and health education across the Department’s healthcare
system, which can hinder veterans’ access to timely, relevant
health information. The Committee encourages support for the ex-
pansion and implementation of a comprehensive digital commu-

nication platform at all VA facilities. This initiative will deploy
cloud-based content management systems deliver veteran-specific
health education, promote VA healthcare initiatives, and improve
patient engagement in real time.
Veterans Integrated Service Network Distribution.—The Com-
mittee is interested in learning how the Veterans Integrated Serv-
ices Network (VISN) (1) determines patient service catchment
areas (2) assesses where to build new VA medical centers, and (3)
plans the distribution of VA medical centers and outpatient clinics
compared to the number of veterans in each area. The Committee
requests an update within 180 days of enactment, that details the
criteria used to determine how various types of medical facilities
including VAMCs and CBOCs are distributed, and the distribution
of VA medical facilities given the number of veterans in each loca-
tion.
Zero Water Laboratory Diagnostic Systems.—The Committee re-
mains concerned about cost savings for VA hospital laboratories,
and the need to increase water conservation efforts as the U.S. con-
tinues to experience record-breaking national disasters. The Com-
mittee supports the adaptation of laboratory modernization by im-
plementing little to no water laboratory systems utilizing dry
chemistry solutions for VA Medical Centers and Community Based
OutpatienClinics where feasible.
Enhanced Transparency Requirements for Contractors of High-
Cost VA Hospital Projects.—The Committee is concerned about the
oversight and execution of select, high-cost construction projects of
VA Medical Facilities and VA Health Facilities, and the impacts
that lack of adequate contractor performance have had on veteran
patient experience at such facilities due to construction or utility
failures. The Committee therefore directs the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Office of Construction and Facilities Management
(OCFM) to compile and submit to the Committee, not later than
120 days after enactment, a standardized requirement for an En-
hanced Transparency and Community Engagement Plan, which
shall apply to major VA construction projects with a total cost of
or exceeding $500 million, and all contractors who support con-
struction elements of such projects shall comply with.
Timely Construction of VA Medical Facilities.—The Committee
recognizes the critical importance of timely completion of Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs medical facilities to ensure that veterans
have access to the highest quality of care possible. The Committee
is aware that rising construction costs have the potential to affect
project delivery nationwide and delay urgently needed infrastruc-
ture improvements. Notwithstanding these rising costs, the Com-
mittee strongly urges the Department to prioritize the expeditious
construction of all previously appropriated VA medical facility
projects. Accordingly, the Committee directs the Department to
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House
and Senate not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act.
The report shall include a detailed cost comparison between the
original budget and current projections, an explanation of cost in-
creases, and a summary of cost containment strategies imple-
mented to mitigate further escalation and ensure responsible stew-
ardship of taxpayer dollars.

Audie Murphy Veterans Hospital Reconstruction.—The Com-
mittee is aware that the Department of Veterans Affairs has com-
pleted a feasibility study and has initiated an Environmental Im-
pact Statement to evaluate options for replacing the Audie L. Mur-
phy Memorial Veterans Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. The Com-
mittee continues to encourage the Department to advance these ef-
forts and to expedite planning and development. Given the hos-
pital’s age, significant infrastructure limitations, and the increas-
ing demand for services in one of the nation’s largest veteran and
active-duty military populations, construction of a new, state-of-
the-art medical facility in San Antonio is critical. The Committee
directs the Department to submit a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act detailing: (1) the status and findings of the com-
pleted or ongoing feasibility study; (2) the anticipated timeline for
site selection; and (3) any anticipated resource requirements nec-
essary to support replacement of the existing hospital.
BRIDGING RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR VETERAN EMPOWERMENT
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $– – –
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 970,000,000
The Committee supports the Department’s effort to end veteran
homelessness and provides $970,000,000 for the Bridging Rental
Assistance for Veteran Empowerment (BRAVE). The Committee
recognizes legislative authority is required before this initiative can
get underway. The Committee directs monthly updates as BRAVE
moves towards implementation. Updates shall include, but are not
limited to, a spend plan on how resources will be utilized, status
of obtaining needed authorities, scope and operations of the pro-
gram, personnel needs to execute BRAVE and anticipated roll out
schedule.
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $943,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 943,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $950,000,000 for Med-
ical and Prosthetic Research, available through September 30,
2026. The Committee appreciates the Department’s plans to focus
on critical research areas that include environmental exposures,
traumatic brain injury, cancer and precision oncology, and mental
health.
In addition to this appropriation, resources from other sources,
including appropriations from the medical care accounts, reim-
bursements from DOD, grants from the National Institutes of
Health, private sources, and voluntary organizations, support the
Department’s researchers. The total amount estimated available for
fiscal year 2026 is $1,400,000,000.

Endometriosis.—The Committee directs the Department to en-
sure its research program adequately addresses the unique needs
and concerns of veterans with endometriosis. The Committee en-
courages VA to prioritize endometriosis research to expand basic,
clinical, and translational research into the mechanics of endo-
metriosis, identify early diagnostic markets, and develop new treat-
ment methods.
Gulf War Illness Studies.—The Committee recommends the De-
partment continue to conduct epidemiological studies regarding the
prevalence of Gulf War Illness, morbidity, and mortality in Persian
Gulf War veterans and the development of effective treatments,
preventions, and cures. The Department is encouraged to make the
findings of all research conducted by or for the Executive Branch
publicly available as soon as possible and continue to publish dis-
ease-specific mortality data related specifically to Persian Gulf War
veterans.
Herbicide-Related Toxic Exposure Research.—To understand the
residual effects of Agent Orange, dioxins, and other herbicide-re-
lated toxic exposures, the Committee urges the Department to uti-
lize reference data from existing medical records of veterans who
served in Vietnam, Thailand, Guam, the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, America Samoa, and other geographic areas where these
toxic substances were dispersed to determine the percentage who
have frequent or unexplained diseases compared to the civilian
population.
Limb Loss.—The Committee commends the Department’s work
with veterans living with limb loss, particularly its support of pro-
grams that engage amputees to become certified peer visitors for
other veterans. However, the Committee continues to note that vet-
erans fall through the cracks, as highlighted in the House Veterans
Affairs Committee hearing ‘‘Life After Limb Loss: Examining VA
Amputee Prosthetics Care, due to a lack of specific resources pro-
vided for care coordination’’. The Committee supports the Depart-
ment expanding their efforts to reach all veteran amputees across
the country and to strengthen its current program by providing en-
hanced care coordination services.
Metastatic Cancer Research.—The Committee supports the De-
partment’s work to achieve therapeutic advances that extend the
life of metastatic cancer survivors, including through clinical trials
that treat patients with diverse types of cancer, demographics, and
genetics, and recognizes more studies are required to develop a
comprehensive understanding of this complex process. The 2018
Department of Defense report to Congress on the Metastatic Can-
cer Task Force noted there are few active duty servicemembers
with metastatic cancer because they are medically retired prior to
metastasis, while the Department’s FY25 budget justification notes
that there were more than 51,000 new cases of metastasis among
veterans in 2017. The Committee directs the Department to con-
duct a study assessing the correlation between service in the mili-
tary, including types of service and exposure to different toxins or
environments, and veterans’ likelihood of a metastatic cancer diag-
nosis, and directs the Department to continue to increase veterans’

participation. The Committee requests that the Fiscal Year 2027
budget justification include an update on its progress on the issue.
National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE).—The Committee
recognizes the high-quality mental health care and neurological re-
search being conducted at the NICoE and urges the Department to
expand its work with NICoE to strengthen VA’s research capacity.
The Committee continues to encourage the Department to pursue
new collaborative initiatives with NICoE, consider public academic
medical centers as partners in such efforts, and assist DOD-wide
efforts to optimize research to implement solutions and deliver bet-
ter health outcomes for veterans.
PFAS Research and Testing.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to employ the most accurate per-and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances (PFAS) testing methods to ensure comprehensive and reli-
able results in its scientific assessment of the relationship between
PFAS exposure during military service and kidney cancer among
veterans. As PFAS comprises over 12,000 chemicals and scientific
understanding of their health impact is growing, advanced blood
testing methods including additional analytes, more in line with
the CDC NHANES 18 analyte panel, would enable the Department
to detect a broader range of PFAS compounds that veterans en-
countered during service, providing more comprehensive data to
evaluate. Further, current clinical guidelines from the National
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine have identified 9
PFAS compounds that impact human health. Blood testing meth-
ods that include these 9 PFAS analytes must be the minimum
standard for VA to detect PFAS compounds that veterans encoun-
tered during service and evaluate establishing kidney cancer as a
presumptive condition.
Research Using Animals.—The Department is directed to include
in any report to Congress describing animal research approved
under section 247 in division A of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2024 (P.L. 118–42), submitted after the date of filing of this
report, details on the specific alternatives to animals that were con-
sidered, why those alternatives were not chosen, and an expla-
nation for why these animal subjects were the only viable option
for this research. The Committee looks forward to the Department
fully implementing its plan to curtail the research conducted using
canines, felines, or non-human primates by 2026 and directs the
Department to not approve any new animal research that would
not be complete before 2026.
Vietnam Veterans Liver Fluke Cancer.—The Committee urges the
Secretary to prioritize efforts to determine whether
cholangiocarcinoma diagnoses among Vietnam-era veterans are
connected to service-related exposure to liver fluke parasites. The
Committee recognizes that emerging research suggests a potential
link between liver fluke infection and the later development of
cholangiocarcinoma. The Committee directs the Department to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
180 days of enactment of this Act on steps taken to review existing
evidence, update claims adjudication guidance if necessary, and en-
hance outreach to potentially impacted Vietnam-era veterans.

MEDICAL CARE COLLECTIONS FUND
The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections
Fund (MCCF) was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
(P.L. 105–33). The Department deposits first-party and pharmacy
co-payments, third-party insurance payments and enhanced-use
collections, long-term care co-payments, Compensated Work Ther-
apy Program collections, Compensation and Pension Living Ex-
penses Program collections, and Parking Program fees into the
MCCF. The Department uses these funds for medical care and
services to veterans. The estimate of fees that will be collected in
fiscal year 2026 is $4,580,000,000.
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025. ........................................................ $480,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 497,000,000
The Committee recommends $497,000,000 for fiscal year 2026.
NCA should prioritize maintaining the current level of services at
existing cemeteries and activating new cemeteries to increase bur-
ial access. In addition, the bill includes language making ten per-
cent of the total available until September 30, 2027.
Assessing the National Cemetery Administration’s Population
Data Collection Methodology.—The Committee is concerned that
the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) may not be fully
leveraging all available data sources to effectively target under-
served veteran populations for cemetery services. To ensure under-
served veteran populations have access to cemetery services, the
Committee encourages NCA to explore utilizing U.S. Census Bu-
reau data into its methodologies for estimating and tracking served
and unserved veteran populations, as suggested in Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) Report GAO–19–121. The Committee re-
quests an update not later than 180 days of the enactment of this
Act on prospective new methodologies for collecting veteran popu-
lation data. The update should include an examination of the util-
ity and feasibility of incorporating U.S. Census Bureau data to ei-
ther replace or supplement the NCA’s current county-based meth-
odology and include calculated percentages of confidence levels for
all methodologies.
Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery Veterans Day Community
Remembrance.—The Committee reaffirms its unwavering commit-
ment to honoring the service and sacrifice of America’s veterans by
strongly supporting the upkeep and dignified maintenance of our
national cemeteries. These sacred grounds must be preserved not
only as final resting places but as enduring symbols of gratitude
where families and communities can reflect on the legacy of those
who served. The Committee recognizes the importance of maintain-
ing national traditions that honor veterans, including the annual
Veterans Day commemoration at Fort Sam Houston National Cem-
etery, a vital event that reinforces our nation’s promise to never
forget.
Identifying Unknown Remains of Veterans.—For eight decades,
unidentified remains of veterans have been interred at the Na-
tional Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (NMCP). Efforts to identify
these remains have been ongoing, including the collection of DNA
family reference samples. Advancements in forensic genetic gene-

alogy (FGG) analysis enable the identification of previously uniden-
tified human remains, even those dating back centuries. The Com-
mittee recognizes that the National Missing and Unidentified Per-
sons System (NamUs) at the Department of Justice, formally au-
thorized by the Help Find the Missing Act (P.L. 117–327), has suc-
cessfully identified hundreds of previously unidentified sets of
human remains by leveraging FGG DNA testing technology in
partnership with accredited private laboratories. The Committee
provides $1,500,000 to partner with a private laboratory to utilize
FGG sequencing technology to identify the remains of fallen sol-
diers buried at NMCP. The Committee further directs the Depart-
ment to produce an annual report to Congress that tracks the sam-
ples analyzed, the types of DNA technology deployed, and the time
elapsed to produce an identification.
DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $475,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 450,000,000
The General Administration account provides funds for the Office
of the Secretary, the General Counsel, six Assistant Secretaries,
and two Department-level staff offices.
The Committee recommendation includes $450,000,000 for Gen-
eral Administration.
The Committee has included bill language to make available
through September 30, 2027, up to ten percent of these funds and
to permit the transfer of funds in this account to the General Oper-
ating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration account.
Additional Budgetary Information.—The Committee continues its
request that items described in previous House reports continue to
be included in the budget justifications submitted each year. Fur-
ther, the Committee directs the Department to include in its budg-
et justification materials a table for each account that shows a five-
year funding history for requested and enacted levels.
Data Governance Analytics.—The Committee continues to sup-
port the work carried out by the Department’s Office of Enterprise
Integration for the continuous improvement of veterans’ access and
outcomes throughout their lifetimes, as outlined in VA Data Strat-
egy. VA, as a learning enterprise, should manage, integrate, and
consolidate its various data sources to ensure its data of highest
quality and is used to support operational decision making. As
such, the Committee encourages OEI to further coordinate enter-
prise-wide efforts to manage VA data as a strategic asset, in order
to enhance veterans’ insights and to strengthen VA’s delivery of
services and benefits to veterans, their families, survivors, and
caregivers.
Delays With Board of Veterans Appeals.—The Committee is con-
cerned about ongoing delays veterans and their families experience
before the Board of Veterans Appeals, often causing years-long wait
times for final adjudication and resolution of claims. Within the
funds provided, the Committee urges VA to prioritize hiring the

staff necessary to allow the efficient process of the Board’s current
inventory of cases.
Modernization of Financial and Acquisition Systems.—The Com-
mittee is concerned that the Department’s current approach to
modernizing its financial and acquisition systems through the Fi-
nancial Management and Business Transformation (FMBT) pro-
gram has thus far yielded little progress and encourages evaluation
of a new approach. Therefore, the Committee directs the Depart-
ment to provide a report of the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this Act that in-
cludes an analysis to determine if a viable path forward exists to
procure and deploy a flexible, modernized acquisition system, inde-
pendent of the financial system modernization efforts and ensure
that any effort to move in this direction includes an analysis of al-
ternatives and the evaluation of secure FedRAMP authorized tech-
nologies.
Quarterly Financial Information Reports.—The bill includes an
administrative provision that extends the requirement for submis-
sion of the quarterly financial information required in the fiscal
year 2017 bill and conference report.
Staff Relocations Within VA.—The bill continues the administra-
tive provision requiring written notification 15 days prior to organi-
zational changes that result in the transfer of 25 or more full-time
equivalent staff from one organizational unit of the Department to
another.
BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $287,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 287,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $287,000,000 for the
Board of Veterans Appeals. Ten percent of this funding is available
through September 30, 2027.
VA Board of Appeals Backlog.—Congress has provided funding
increases to enable the Department to hire the staff, acquire the
technology, and change work processes necessary to significantly
reduce the appeals backlog. The Committee is concerned that de-
spite these investments, the Board of Veterans’ Appeals has not
adequately addressed the backlog of veterans waiting for a decision
and that the inventory of pending appeals cannot be depleted with
the Board of Veterans’ Appeals’ current policies and procedures.
The Committee directs the Department to prioritize the processing
of appeals and to submit a plan not later than 90 days after the
enactment of this Act detailing a strategy to clear the backlog of
cases within 36 months.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $6,401,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 5,882,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $5,882,000,000 for In-
formation Technology Systems. Within the account total, the Com-
mittee allocates $1,350,000,000 for pay and associated costs;
$4,413,000,000 for operations and maintenance; and $118,900,000
for activations.

The bill makes available three percent of pay and associated
costs and five percent of operations and maintenance funds until
September 30, 2027. All development funds are available until Sep-
tember 30, 2027.
The Committee continues to include bill language permitting the
transfer of funding among the three subaccounts upon approval of
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.
The bill also continues language allowing for the reprogramming
of funds among development projects upon approval by the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.
The Committee continues to include bill language limiting the
funds available for information technology systems development to
the projects and in the amounts specified in the report. The bill
limits the amount of funds that can be transferred into the IT ac-
count to ten percent of the total of either the source or destination
account. The bill contains language that permits the reprogram-
ming of funds among development projects upon prior notification
to, and approval by, the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress.
The Committee expects the Office of Information and Technology
(OIT) to continue to provide an IT expenditure report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on a monthly
basis. This report should include a comparison to the project costs
included in the development funding chart above and provide an
explanation for any differences in excess of $3,000,000.
Benefits Technology Platform.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of simplifying and accelerating the security of the im-
portant benefits veterans have earned. To improve this process, the
Committee directs the Secretary to adopt a technology platform
that assists veterans in the challenges faced when navigating avail-
able benefits. Of the funds provided under this heading, up to
$4,000,000 may be used to partner with an outside vendor to im-
plement a software solution that leverages artificial intelligence
and automation to assist veterans in navigating the benefits
lifecycle, including application, appeals, and service connection
processes.
Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) Commercial Pilot
Program.—The Committee understands the current IGA pilot has
failed to earn authority to operate. The Committee recommends the
Department explore alternative commercial IGA pilot programs,
interoperable with CISA’s CDM architecture with hybrid cloud fea-
tures.
IT Asset Management.—The Committee is aware of improve-
ments made by the Office of Information Technology to the Depart-
ment’s IT software and hardware asset management practices and
systems, which are producing significant annual cost savings, en-
suring more accurate baseline inventories of assets owned, and im-
proving the Department’s ability to measure the total cost of own-
ership of IT assets and applications. The Committee encourages the
Department to continue replicating this success across all software
and hardware portfolios, and to ensure all software and hardware
assets are accurately reflected in the system throughout their full
lifecycles, from the time of acquisition through final disposal.

VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $1,322,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 2,515,893,000
The bill includes $2,515,893,000 for Veterans Electronic Health
Record. This increase reflects additional deployments and focus on
current site optimization, sustaining infrastructure, and supporting
19 live sites. It also assumes costs for activities related to the de-
velopment and rollout of VA’s Electronic Health Record Moderniza-
tion (EHRM) initiative, the associated contractual costs, and the
salaries and expenses of employees hired under titles 5 and 38,
United States Code.
This account is intended to be the single source of funding within
VA for the electronic health record effort. No authority is provided
for funds from other VA accounts to be transferred into this ac-
count nor for funds from this account to be transferred out to other
accounts.
The bill continues language requiring the Secretary to submit a
quarterly report to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress detailing obligations, expenditures, and deploy-
ment strategy by facility. The Department is directed to continue
quarterly briefings on performance milestones, costs, and changes
to implementation and management plans, and to provide an accu-
rate up-to-date deployment schedule prior to each quarterly brief-
ing. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to provide
updates on plans and efforts to integrate community care providers
into the new EHR system. Such updates should be submitted con-
currently with the quarterly reports.
In addition, bill language is included that makes 25 percent of
the total funding available contingent upon the Secretary providing
notice to and receiving approval from the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress of any changes to the deploy-
ment schedule, as well as an updated plan outlining benchmarks
and measurable metrics for deployment and an updated plan for
addressing all required infrastructure upgrades. The Committee
also urges the Department to notify the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress if there are any staffing chal-
lenges in go-live preparation and implementation at VA medical
centers.
The Committee repeats the fiscal year 2019 directive for GAO to
perform quarterly performance reviews of the electronic health
record deployment. It is expected that this quarterly report will
provide the Committees and VA with timely information to prop-
erly oversee this effort and address important issues.
VistA as a Service.—As the Veterans Health Administration con-
tinues transitioning from the legacy Veterans Health Information
Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Electronic Health
Record (EHR) System to the Oracle Health/Cerner Millennium
EHR solution, the Department must continue to sustain, maintain,
and evolve the existing VistA infrastructure. Assuming no further
delays, the full deployment of the new EHR system is not expected
until 2031, leaving patient care, services and many Veterans Inte-
grated Service Networks (VISNs) on the later end of the implemen-
tation schedule reliant on the legacy VistA EHR several more
years.

Maintaining the legacy EHR while deployment of the new system
is ongoing has proven to be labor intensive, requiring significant
manpower and financial investment in a tight budgetary environ-
ment. The Committee believes the Department can reduce man-
power, costs, and streamline maintenance efforts by leveraging a
model similar to that used by Department of Defense in its EHR
modernization program. DoD is efficiently utilizing private sector
system integrators to maintain and sustain the legacy system as a
service while deployment of the new system is undertaken. In
doing so, the Department would also be able to divert much need-
ed, experienced Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) staff
to the Federal EHR deployment of the new system. The Committee
urges the Department to assess the feasibility of adopting and im-
plementing a ‘‘VistA as a Service’’ model for the maintenance and
sustainment of the legacy EHRM system.
Contractor Accountability.—The Committee expects the Depart-
ment to hold its contractors accountable. The Department is ex-
pected to work closely with Oracle Cerner to resolve usability prob-
lems and dramatically improve training to ensure that when de-
ployments restart the new system can be adopted easily by clini-
cians and healthcare staff.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $296,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 295,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $295,000,000 for fiscal
year 2026 for the Office of the Inspector General. The bill makes
up to ten percent of this funding available until September 30,
2027.
The Committee continues to request robust oversight of the Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization initiative and medical commu-
nity care claims.
CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ..................................................... $961,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ............................. 1,750,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $1,750,000,000 for Con-
struction, Major Projects for fiscal year 2026 which shall remain
available until September 30, 2030. The Committee supports the
Department’s efforts for projects in St. Louis, MO and Riverside,
CA. While supportive, the Committee requests further information
on plans to utilize resources to support homeless affordable housing
in West Los Angeles and New Hampshire.
As required by language that is in permanent law, all major con-
struction projects costing more than $100,000,000 must be man-
aged by a non-VA government entity, such as the Army Corps of
Engineers. While the Committee no longer duplicates this lan-
guage, the Committee intends to continue its oversight of the qual-
ity of the outside entity management and expects to receive quar-
terly briefings on each of the large construction projects.
Construction Reports.—The Committee continues to request the
Department provide quarterly briefings on the progress and cost of
each facility managed by an outside entity. Several additional bill
language provisions are included to enhance the Committee’s ca-

pacity to conduct oversight of VA’s facility construction efforts in-
cluding: (1) no funding greater than $7,000,000 may be repro-
grammed between construction projects unless approved by the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress; (2) any
change to the scope of a construction project is prohibited without
the approval of the Committees; and (3) VA must report any bid
savings of $5,000,000 or more on projects as soon as they are iden-
tified.
The Committee does not provide transfer authority between
twelve VA appropriations and for funds to be transferred to major
or minor construction to be made available for five years.
To enhance the Committee’s capacity to conduct oversight on
VA’s facility construction efforts, several administrative provisions
are continued in the bill: (1) No funding amount greater than
$7,000,000 may be reprogrammed between construction projects
unless approved by the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress; (2) any change to the scope of a construction
project is not permitted without the approval of the Committees;
and (3) VA must report any bid savings of $5,000,000 or more on
projects as soon as they are identified.
CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $692,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 232,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $232,000,000 for Con-
struction, Minor Project for fiscal year 2026, of which $200,000,000
shall remain available until September 30, 2030, and $32,000,000
shall remain available until expended.
Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System’s Master Plan.—The Com-
mittee continues to encourage the Department to engage with the
Principal Developer Team responsible for the Greater Los Angles
Health Care System’s Master Plan and support the
operationalization of the Master Plan.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $171,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 171,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $171,000,000 for fiscal
year 2026 for Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Fa-
cilities. A grant may not exceed 65 percent of the total cost of the
project. The bill makes this funding available until expended.
Cost of Care for Veterans’ Homes.—The Committee is concerned
with the current reimbursement rate for state and non-profit run
Veterans’ Homes. The Committee recognizes that the costs associ-
ated with Veterans’ Homes are substantial due to the high acuity
level of the veteran population served, and that current VHA rates
are inconsistent with the current cost of care. The Committee di-
rects VHA to submit a report, no later than 90 days following the
adoption of this bill, outlining how current reimbursement rates
are calculated, how VHA makes locality adjustments, how the VHA
works to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for veterans in
homes, and recommended legislative changes for Congress to con-
sider.

Duplicative State Veterans Home Surveys.—The Committee rec-
ognizes that State Veterans Homes undergo annual inspection sur-
veys from the Department of Veterans Affairs and that many un-
dergo an additional and separate, yet nearly identical, survey from
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This practice is dis-
ruptive to the veterans and financially inefficient. The Committee
encourages VA, in coordination with CMS, to review this practice
and provide a report on whether or not this process could be
streamlined by conducting only one survey.
Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Facilities Back-
log.—The Committee recognizes the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs is experiencing a nearly $2 billion backlog in identified pri-
ority grant projects, and that an increase in resources is required
to ensure that State Veterans Homes can continue to serve their
vital role for low-income veterans and those wishing to spend their
final years housed and cared for among fellow veterans. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to brief the Com-
mittee no later than August 31, 2025, on the criteria used to
prioritize backlogged projects and existing procedural challenges
that could impede the execution of funds required to clear the back-
log.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF VETERANS CEMETERIES
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $60,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ................................. 60,000,000
The Committee recommendation includes $60,000,000 for Grants
for Construction of Veterans Cemeteries. The bill makes this fund-
ing available until expended.
COST OF WAR TOXIC EXPOSURES FUND
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ..................................................... $28,800,000,000
Committee recommendation, fiscal year 2026 ............................. 52,676,000,000
The bill provides $52,676,000,000 for the Cost of War Toxic Expo-
sures Fund (TEF) veterans medical care related to toxic exposures.
Congressional Commitment to the PACT Act.—The enactment of
the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act
(PACT Act) resulted in the largest expansion of veterans benefits
in a generation, providing healthcare and benefits for veterans who

MINORITY VIEWS
The fiscal year 2026 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and
Related Agencies (MilCon-VA) bill funds critical military construc-
tion, family housing, and quality of life improvements and enhance-
ments for our brave men and women in uniform and their families.
The bill also funds a wide variety of assistance programs for vet-
erans, including disability and pension benefits, healthcare serv-
ices, educational assistance, and home loan and insurance pro-
grams they have earned through their service to our country. It
also funds the American Battle Monuments Commission, Armed
Forces Retirement Home, Arlington National Cemetery, and the
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
As context for which this bill was written, since President
Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, our democracy has
been under assault. The President has challenged Congress’ Article
I authority by illegally freezing, withholding, and canceling funds
while allowing Elon Musk to run wild in the Executive Branch. The
creation of the so-called ‘‘Department of Government Efficiency’’
(DOGE) has led to mass layoffs of thousands of dedicated and non-
partisan federal employees, while canceling programs that millions
of Americans rely on, and weaponizing the federal government to
exact revenge on the President’s enemies. These actions are un-
precedented and have challenged our judicial system and our insti-
tutions as we know them. The chaos continues to disrupt our econ-
omy, increasing costs, while our allies and partners abroad have
started to look at alternative partnerships and ways to challenge
the increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran and other adver-
saries. Despite these historic times, Republicans have buried their
heads in the sand, pretending as if none of this is happening.
Six months into this Administration, Congress has yet to receive
a budget request with full justification materials consistent with
past years. Therefore, the bill was written without any analysis or
justification usually provided for by the budget request. In fact, the
bill could not be completed in its normal form. Since there was no
budget request, the majority was not able to produce state tables
and members were not able to request community project funding
based on current year needs. Similarly, the subcommittee only held
a total of two budget hearings, a significant drop from the five
hearings the subcommittee normally holds every year and these
hearings were held without seeing any budget request materials.
These hearings are necessary to hold the Administration account-
able while increasing transparency and public awareness. Further-
more, subcommittee allocations have not been determined, leaving
questions about how much discretionary funding will be available
to fund critical programs. Put simply, the process was a mess and
Americans deserve better.

For all these reasons, and many more, Democrats held firm and
demanded 29 changes through amendments in an eleven hour long
full committee markup. While common sense amendments, such as
requests for reports to inform the committee on tariff impacts,
staffing cut impacts, and language to cut problematic riders failed,
Democrats were successful in adopting three amendments. These
three amendments ensure that cuts are not made to the Veterans
Affairs Crisis Line, increases the Veterans Affairs Crisis Line by $5
million, and provides advance funding of $51.7 billion for the Toxic
Exposures Fund (TEF), a significant improvement to the bill.
While we appreciate the efforts made to accommodate Demo-
cratic priorities, the funding levels and significant policy riders in
the MilCon-V A bill are not workable and Democrats are unable to
support this bill. The bill inadequately funds military construction
and quality of life programs for our servicemembers by almost $1
billion and prioritizes privatized medical care for veterans which
will only serve to increase costs to taxpayers while allowing for
substandard care for our heroes. Finally, the bill includes eight
egregious policy riders that limit women’s health care, constrain
suicide prevention efforts, and supports bad policy. These riders
should have no place in this bill.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
So far in his first six months as Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth
prioritized culture war issues while ignoring the things that really
matter, such as the quality of life of our troops. Secretary Hegseth
has renamed installations and warships, banned the pride flag, and
blocked qualified transgender troops from serving because he is of-
fended by diversity. He also requested a $50,000 emergency paint
job for his government furnished house while spending appro-
priated funds to build a make-up booth in the Pentagon. Mean-
while, our troops live in substandard housing, suicide and sexual
assault prevention remains a challenge, and servicemembers con-
tinue to struggle with access to affordable and high-quality
childcare. The Department has no plans to address these issues or
any other quality of life issues, except to transfer hundreds of mil-
lions out of these programs to fund a pointless border wall.
To address these quality-of-life issues, the bill includes Ranking
Member Wasserman Schultz’s request to provide $30 million in
dedicated funding to expand the oversight of the housing portfolio
at the Department of Defense, including government-owned and
controlled family housing and privatized family and unaccompanied
housing. The well-being of service members and their families is of
utmost importance, and we continue to hear unacceptable reports
of poor housing conditions, slow response times, and indifference
towards requests for assistance.
Although the bill provides $50 million in dedicated funding for
PF AS remediation and cleanup, it does not include additional,
dedicated funding for military installation climate change and re-
siliency projects, leaving our installations vulnerable to climate
change. The bill also underfunds the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation Security Investment Program (NSIP), by $188 million,
underfunding installations that our troops and allies in Europe rely

on, and especially as Russia’s illegal invasion into Ukraine ap-
proaches its fourth year.
To address the military construction shortfalls in the bill, Demo-
crats offered seven amendments to increase NSIP funding and re-
quire spend plans and approvals for the Department’s redirection
of funding to the border wall. Unfortunately, these amendments
were not adopted.
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
In the first six months of this Administration, the Department of
Veterans Affairs led by Secretary Collins, has plummeted into dis-
array with morale nosediving, threatening the ability of the De-
partment to provide benefits and high-quality care to our deserving
veterans. So far, Secretary Collins has not produced a comprehen-
sive or sensible plan for VA to improve wait times, process claims
quicker, hire qualified medical professionals, or address the mental
health crisis, all real challenges facing our veterans today. Instead,
Secretary Collins is focused on cutting the workforce by fifteen per-
cent, or over 80,000 dedicated public servants, canceling hundreds
of important contracts that provide services to our veterans, and
addressing culture war issues that only Republicans believe are a
high priority. DOGE has been allowed to access private veteran in-
formation including their social security numbers and disability
status. The Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase (VASP) Program,
designed to help veterans avoid foreclosure, has been shuttered.
Twenty-four staffers for the VA suicide crisis line were needlessly
fired, leaving calls unanswered. When asked for details or informa-
tion to better understand these serious concerns, VA has refused
to answer any questions. The Department of Veterans Affairs is in
disarray and veterans will suffer as a result.
The majority’s bill does nothing to address the legitimate con-
cerns raised above. Instead, the majority’s bill included a sixty
seven percent increase to medical community care, representing
the largest ever shift towards VA medical care privatization. A pri-
ority straight out of Project 2025. This decision was made without
any justification materials from the Administration. Democrats
support the ability for veterans to seek care where they can, but
multiple studies have shown the best care veterans can receive is
at VA facilities. We should be dedicating funding to expanding
services and hiring more medical professionals at VA, not shifting
funding to private hospitals and clinics. Furthermore, the base bill
failed to provide the $51.7 billion in advance funding for the TEF
requested by the President. Veterans were being denied the cer-
tainty they deserve, certainty that if they were exposed to toxic
substances, they would be guaranteed health care indefinitely. The
bill also included eight harmful riders, for example, blocking abor-
tion and VA from reporting veterans to the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check system who were determined to be a poten-
tial danger to themselves or others.
To fix these issues, Democrats offered 22 amendments that fo-
cused on ascertaining reports and information regarding the staff-
ing cuts, the closure of the VASP program, increasing funding for
vital programs like the crisis line and healthy food programs, and
advance fund the TEF. Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz was

successful in negotiating a deal to advance fund TEF for two years,
ensuring that $51.7 billion would be available for toxic exposed vet-
erans. This success was coupled with guaranteed protections and
increased funding for the VA crisis line as amendments from Con-
gresswoman Underwood and Congresswoman Dean were adopted.
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
This bill has been considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since trucing office in January 2025, the
executive branch has been engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and
unconstitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular, the Of-
fice of Management and Budget has been at the center of a govern-
ment-wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s laws in
its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the agency’s
legally binding budget decisions (known as apportionments) in con-
travention of an unambiguous and constitutionally sound assertion
of the Congress’s authority to impose transparency requirements
upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all but one Democrat on the Com-
mittee, the debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just
as former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
William Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney
General with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has a con-
stitutional power to decline to spend appropriated funds, we
must conclude that existence of such a broad power is sup-
ported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any purpose in the bill, so too does the Committee de-
cide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear in-
tent to be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
This subcommittee has a long-standing tradition of bipartisan-
ship, and we will work in good faith with our colleagues as we pro-
ceed through the appropriations process with the hope of restoring
bipartisan priorities in this bill. By working together, we can best
address the needs of our Nation’s military and its veterans and
reach an agreement on the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,
and Related Agencies bill for FY 2026.
