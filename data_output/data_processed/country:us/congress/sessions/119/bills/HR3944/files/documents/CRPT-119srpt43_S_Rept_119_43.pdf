TITLE I
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
HEARING
The Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,
and Related Agencies held one hearing related to the fiscal year
2026 military construction budget request. Witnesses included rep-
resentatives of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space
Force, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
SUMMARY OF COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The fiscal year 2026 budget request for military construction and
family housing totals $18,892,743,000. The Committee recommends
$19,837,000,000.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The following reprogramming guidelines apply for all military
construction and family housing projects. A project or account (in-
cluding the sub-elements of an account) which has been specifically
reduced by the Congress in acting on the budget request is consid-
ered to be a congressional interest item and as such, prior approval
is required. Accordingly, no reprogrammings to an item specifically
reduced below the threshold by the Congress are permitted.
Recognizing the increased cost and complexity of military con-
struction projects, the Committee supports increasing the re-
programming threshold to enable the Department to be more agile
and reduce delays associated with cost overruns. The reprogram-
ming criteria that apply to military construction projects, as well
as new housing construction projects and improvements, is
$10,000,000 or 25 percent of the funded amount, whichever is less.
To provide the Services the flexibility to proceed with construction
contracts without disruption or delay, the costs associated with en-
vironmental hazard remediation such as asbestos removal, radon
abatement, lead-based paint removal or abatement, and any other
legislated environmental hazard remediation may be excluded, pro-
vided that such remediation requirements could not be reasonably
anticipated at the time of the budget submission. This exclusion
applies to projects authorized in this budget year, as well as
projects authorized in prior years for which construction has not
been completed.
Furthermore, in instances where prior approval of a reprogram-
ming request for a project or account has been received from the
Committee, the adjusted amount approved becomes the new base
for any future increase or decrease via below-threshold
reprogrammings (provided that the project or account is not a con-
gressional interest item as defined above).

In addition to these guidelines, the Services are directed to ad-
here to the guidance for military construction reprogrammings and
notifications, including the pertinent statutory authorities con-
tained in Department of Defense [DoD] Financial Management
Regulation 7000.14—R and relevant updates and policy memo-
randa.
Facility Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization [FSRM].—
The Department of Defense is directed to continue describing on
form 1390 the backlog of FSRM requirements at installations with
future construction projects. For troop housing requests, form 1391
should describe any FSRM conducted in the past 2 years. Likewise,
future requirements for unaccompanied housing at the cor-
responding installation should be included. Additionally, the forms
should include English equivalent measurements for projects pre-
sented in metric measurement. Rules for funding repairs of facili-
ties under the Operation and Maintenance accounts are described
below:
(1) components of the facility may be repaired by replace-
ment. Such replacement can be up to current standards or
codes;
(2) interior arrangements and restorations may be included
as repair;
(3) additions and new facilities may be done concurrently
with repair projects, as long as the final conjunctively funded
project is a complete and usable facility; and
(4) the appropriate Service Secretary shall notify the appro-
priate committees prior to carrying out any repair project with
an estimated cost in excess of $7,500,000.
Design Funding.—The Committee acknowledges that the Depart-
ment has clarified what construction activities fall under advanced
planning, which is funded through the Operation and Maintenance
accounts, and which are tied to facility design, which is funded
under ‘‘planning and design’’ in the Military Construction accounts.
To more appropriately reflect DoD activities being appropriated for
within this bill, the Committee will now refer to ‘‘design’’ funding
instead of ‘‘planning and design’’.
Incremental Funding.—In general, the Committee supports full
funding for military construction projects. However, it continues to
be the practice of the Committee to provide incremental funding for
certain large projects to enable the services to more efficiently allo-
cate military construction dollars among projects that can be exe-
cuted in the year of appropriation. Therefore, the Committee has
recommended incremental funding for four projects.
Indo-Pacific Command [INDOPACOM].—The Committee is en-
couraged by the Department’s request of more than $2,800,000,000
in military construction investments in direct support of the Pacific
Deterrence Initiative. The Committee continues to support efforts
to address emergent requirements and accelerate construction in-
vestments in the INDOPACOM region, and includes $432,102,000,
as requested, for the INDOPACOM Military Construction Pilot Pro-
gram to enhance flexibility and enable the rapid execution of cer-
tain projects. The Committee encourages the Department to con-
tinue to prioritize investment that support INDOPACOM objectives
in the region.

6
Space Force Indo-Pacific Infrastructure Needs.—The Committee
is aware of concerns raised by United States Space Command
[USSPACECOM] and Space Forces-IndoPacific regarding logistical
support and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, including Ha-
waii. Recognizing the importance of coordinated planning across
Services, the Committee directs the Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force (Energy, Installations, and Environment), in close coordina-
tion with USSPACECOM, Space Forces-IndoPacific, and other rel-
evant entities, to conduct a joint study and submit a report within
1 year of enactment of this act. This report shall outline a com-
prehensive Indo-Pacific plan that integrates the requirements of
both Air Force and Space Force missions, with particular attention
to critical Space Forces-IndoPacific locations. The study should as-
sess existing infrastructure and capabilities, identify operational
and logistical gaps, and recommend solutions to enhance long-term
mission readiness, joint force integration, and operational resilience
across the Air Force.
Child Development Centers [CDCs].—The Committee continues to
recognize the importance of access to childcare in improving both
readiness and quality of life for servicemembers and their families.
Due to high utilization across military installations all over the
world, the Committee supports DoD efforts to seek opportunities to
invest in new CDCs, and to expand and renovate existing CDCs.
In order to help address the capacity shortfall and construct mod-
ern facilities, in addition to providing $347,880,000 for the CDC
projects included in the President’s request, the bill provides an ad-
ditional $30,900,000 in design and major construction funding for
three additional projects.
Defense Resources.—The Committee directs the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later than 90 days after enactment of this
act detailing military construction funding previously expended or
currently planned for in support of DHS missions.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—The Committee includes
Congressionally Directed Spending for design, unspecified minor
construction, and major construction in accordance with Senate
Rule XLIV. DoD is directed to carry out funding for projects as
identified in tables under each relevant account header.

White Sands Missile Range Energy Infrastructure.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges that power outages at White Sands Missile
Range [WSMR] lead to training delays and impact range mission
readiness. The Committee encourages U.S. Army Headquarters to
work with WSMR to find a mutually agreeable solution to the en-
ergy infrastructure needs on the installation. The Committee also
directs the U.S. Army to provide a report on mutually agreed upon

8
solution(s) to the energy infrastructure needs of WSMR no later
than 120 days after the enactment of this act.
Army Chemical Biological Center [CBC].—The Committee is
aware that existing laboratories within the Army CBC at Aberdeen
Proving Ground are inadequate and urgently need to be replaced,
particularly the Applied Science Center. The CBC is the Nation’s
leading research and development center for chemical and biologi-
cal defense and the Committee encourages the Army to accelerate
modernization projects at the CBC. The Committee directs the
Army to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress on future plans for the CBC no later than
90 days after enactment of this act.

the State table at the end of this report.
Naval Shipyard Modernization.—The Navy’s four public ship-
yards, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Puget
Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility
[PSNS], and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Main-
tenance Facility, perform a vital role in national defense by exe-
cuting maintenance on submarines and aircraft carriers to ensure
that they are combat-ready. The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan [SIOP] and be-
lieves the restoration of deferred maintenance availabilities along

9
with the public shipyard dry dock investments identified under the
plan are critical. The Committee urges the Secretary of the Navy
to prioritize the timely funding of public shipyard infrastructure, in
particular, the dry dock and shore infrastructure necessary to sup-
port critical maintenance of surface and submarine fleets. Further,
as SIOP continues to refine requirements and synchronize con-
struction activities, the Committee encourages the Department of
the Navy to make timely decisions to ensure future maintenance
schedules are not interrupted. In particular, as the Navy considers
the way forward on the Multi-Mission Dry Dock at PSNS, the Com-
mittee encourages the Department to consider opportunities to pull
forward elements of the project which can be responsibly separated
out into complete and usable facilities. In support of these efforts,
the Committee includes an additional $9,000,000 in unspecified
minor military construction funding to advance planned demolition
projects as authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2805.
Red Hill Water Treatment.—The Committee remains supportive
of remediation efforts at Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility and
the impacted surrounding areas. The Committee includes
$141,650,000 for the Water Treatment Plant project at Joint Base
Pearl Harbor-Hickam and encourages the Navy to continue work-
ing closely with local governments and communities to accelerate
remediation efforts.
Navy Minor Construction.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to leverage minor military construction funding to en-
hance the security of military installations and to prioritize projects
that improve the safety and security of personnel residing in mili-
tary housing located near installation boundaries, particularly
those vulnerable to criminal activity that has occurred outside the
installation perimeter.

Further detail of the Committee’s recommendation is provided in
the State table at the end of this report.
Power Projection Wing at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.—The
Committee recognizes that the Air Force is in the process of stand-
ing up the Special Operations Command 492nd Power Projection
Wing at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The Air Force has com-
mitted to Congress that the Wing basing will begin in fiscal year
2026 and continue through fiscal year 2031, immediately following
the divestiture of the A–10. The Committee is concerned that the
Air Force is behind in meeting that timeline as military construc-
tion requirements necessary to support the standup have not yet
been identified. The Committee encourages the Air Force, in col-
laboration with Special Operations Command, to expeditiously in-
form the Committee of additional funding requirements needed for
design, construction, or other related activities in support of the
transition. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Air Force to
brief the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 90 days after enactment of this act on any require-
ments identified after submission of the fiscal year 2026 budget re-
quest for operational or base support infrastructure.
Hypersonic Labs.—The Committee continues to recognize the im-
portance of Air Force hypersonic test range facilities and that in-
vestment is needed in testing infrastructure to support critical
hypersonic weapons development. The Committee encourages the

11
Department to make investments in its testing infrastructure, in-
cluding basic water and energy capacity, turbine propulsion cycles,
and laboratory infrastructure, in order to advance existing capabili-
ties and develop a wide range of new capabilities to compete with
advanced adversaries.
Global Strike Command Entry Control Points.—The Committee
encourages Air Force Global Strike Command to leverage minor
military construction funding to enhance efficiency and decrease
operational risk at the entry points to weapons storage areas.
B–21 Infrastructure.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of environmental protection shelters that help protect aircraft from
extreme weather but is concerned about the suitability of open-
sided shelters for B–21 bomber aircraft operating out of installa-
tions that are at-risk of severe weather events. The Committee sup-
ports developing and incorporating design elements to address se-
vere weather resiliency, specifically to protect the safety of airmen,
protect the lifespan of the B–21 aircraft and its low-observable
coating, and promote high mission capable rates. The Committee
encourages the Air Force to consider additional elements beyond
overhead protection that could be used in environmental protection
shelters to protect aircraft and airmen in extreme weather events.
Air Force Civil Engineer Center.—The Committee is aware that
the Air Force is evaluating options to improve engineering super-
vision and oversight and budgeting for overseas projects where it
serves as the designated DoD Construction Agent. The Committee
supports this effort and, accordingly, has included provisions in the
bill to grant additional authorities to Air Force activities when act-
ing in such a capacity.
Sentinel Schedule.—The Committee believes that the Nunn-
McCurdy review of the Sentinel program presents an opportunity
to identify cost-saving measures and explore options to accelerate
deployment of the new missile. As part of that effort, the Com-
mittee recognizes the potential benefits of a revised schedule that
allows for concurrent construction of Sentinel launch facilities
across the three missile bases and supports further evaluation of
that approach. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of
the Air Force to submit a report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress within 180 days of enactment of
this act that includes (1) the updated schedule for construction of
all Sentinel launch facilities, (2) a comparison between the current
schedule and the schedule in place prior to the Nunn-McCurdy re-
view that illustrates the extent to which concurrent construction
may occur across the three missile bases, and (3) a year-by-year es-
timate of the construction budget required to execute the concur-
rent schedule.

the State table at the end of this report.
Linear Generators.—The Committee is aware of linear generator
technology as a potential means to enhance grid resilience and en-
ergy efficiency. The Committee encourages the Department to ex-
plore the applicability of this technology and directs the Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment to
brief the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 120 days after enactment of this act detailing the po-
tential use of linear generators on military installations, limita-
tions to integrating this technology into existing or new energy sys-
tems, and any other relevant considerations.
Innovative Construction Materials.—The Joint Explanatory
Statement accompanying Public Law 117–328 included a reporting
requirement directing the Assistant Secretary of Defense for En-
ergy, Installations, and Environment to provide a report to the
Committees on its efforts to incorporate sustainable products into
the Unified Facilities Criteria [UFC] and Unified Facilities Guide
Specifications, integrate these materials into project designs, and
identify the resources needed to accomplish these efforts. The Com-
mittee notes that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a re-
port in October 2024 outlining near- and long-term updates to the
UFC required to accomplish these goals. The Committee supports
continued work on this initiative and directs the Department to
provide an updated report within 180 days of enactment of this act
detailing efforts to implement the Corps’ recommendations, along
with relevant findings from the Department’s implementation of
the sustainable building construction pilot program, as authorized
by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
Wood Products Integration.—The Department of Defense is en-
couraged to work with the U.S. Forest Service’s Research Stations
and Forest Products Laboratory to develop and utilize innovative
wood-based technologies and products, such as mass timber,
biochar, and nanoparticles for building materials, that will further
the Department’s mission. The Department is directed to brief the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on these
potential partnering efforts within 180 days of enactment of this
act.

Lodging Facilities.—The Committee remains concerned about
lodging shortages at Army National Guard regional centers that
support training and readiness activities, as well as support train-
ing for external local, State, Federal and Tribal agencies. The Com-
mittee encourages the Army National Guard to allocate adequate
funding to address such lodging shortfalls, particularly at installa-
tions with new training and readiness requirements and for
projects that have completed design.
42nd Infantry Division Armory Headquarters.—The Committee is
concerned about the lack of progress made by the Army in final-
izing the required renovation and modernization of the 42nd Infan-
try Division Headquarters in Troy, New York. The Committee un-
derstands that the State of New York has already provided signifi-
cant contributions to the critical project, which will meet essential

14
requirements while allowing Watervliet Arsenal to advance
planned construction. In order to avoid additional delays and un-
necessary leasing costs, the Committee urges the Secretary of the
Army to prioritize the execution of the 42nd Infantry Division
Headquarters project and directs the Department to brief the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the plans
for doing so within 90 days of enactment of this act.

mittee remains concerned that the MHPI management companies
are not consistently fulfilling responsibilities outlined in their part-
nership agreements with the Services. The Committee continues to
receive evidence of poor housing conditions, inadequate mainte-
nance response times, and mishandling of claims. Therefore, the
Committee provides an additional $30,000,000 for increased over-
sight of DoD’s privatized family housing program.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
HEARING
The Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,
and Related Agencies held one hearing related to the Department
of Veterans Affairs’ budget request for fiscal year 2026 and fiscal
year 2027 advance appropriations. The subcommittee heard testi-
mony from the Honorable Douglas A. Collins, Secretary of Veterans
Affairs.
SUMMARY OF COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommendation includes $433,697,754,000 for
the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] for fiscal year 2026, in-
cluding $300,419,619,000 in mandatory spending and
$133,278,135,000 in discretionary spending. The Committee also
recommends $262,103,337,000 in advance appropriations for man-
datory benefits and $122,258,000,000 in advance appropriations for
veterans medical care for fiscal year 2027.
DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW
The Veterans Administration was established on July 21, 1930,
as an independent agency by Executive Order 5398, in accordance
with the act of July 3, 1930 (46 Stat. 1016). This act authorized the
President to consolidate and coordinate Federal agencies specially
created for or concerned with the administration of laws providing
benefits to veterans, including the Veterans’ Bureau, the Bureau of
Pensions, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.
On March 15, 1989, the Veterans Administration was elevated to
Cabinet level status as the Department of Veterans Affairs.
VA’s mission is to serve America’s veterans and their families as
their principal advocate in ensuring they receive the care, support,
and recognition they have earned in service to the Nation. As of
September 30, 2024, there were an estimated 17.9 million living
veterans residing in the United States, American Samoa, Guam,
the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands. There were an estimated 10.2 million dependents (spouses
and dependent children) of living veterans. Thus, approximately
28.1 million people, or 8.2 percent of the total estimated resident
population of the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Island Areas and
U.S. citizens living abroad were recipients or potential recipients of
veterans benefits from the Federal Government. VA’s operating
units include the Veterans Benefits Administration, Veterans
Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration, and
staff support offices.

and net worth, age and/or disability requirements; vocational reha-
bilitation assistance; educational and training assistance; home
buying assistance; estate protection services for veterans under
legal disability; information and assistance through personalized
contacts; and 11 life insurance programs.
The Veterans Health Administration [VHA] develops, maintains,
and operates a national healthcare delivery system for eligible vet-
erans; carries out a program of education and training of
healthcare personnel; conducts medical research and development;

pitals; 12 Health Care Centers; 327 Multi-Specialty Community-
Based Outpatient Clinics; 428 Primary Care Community-Based
Outpatient Clinics; 433 Outpatient Services Sites; 136 Community
Living Centers; 126 Mental Health Residential rehabilitation treat-
ment programs; 303 readjustment counseling Vet Centers; and 85
Mobile Vet Centers is maintained to meet VA’s medical mission.
The National Cemetery Administration [NCA] provides for the
interment of the remains of eligible deceased servicemembers and
discharged veterans in any national cemetery with available grave
space; permanently maintains these graves; provides headstones
and markers for the graves of eligible persons in national and pri-
vate cemeteries; administers the grant program for aid to States in
establishing, expanding, or improving State veterans cemeteries;
and provides certificates to families of deceased veterans recog-
nizing their contributions and service to the Nation. In 2026, ceme-
tery activities will encompass 158 national cemeteries and 35
cemeterial installations and their maintenance as national shrines.
Staff support offices include the Office of Inspector General,
Board of Veterans Appeals, and General Administration offices,
which support the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary
for Benefits, Under Secretary for Health, Under Secretary for Me-
morial Affairs, and General Counsel.

non-service-connected disabilities that render them permanently
and totally disabled. The Veterans Education and Benefits Expan-
sion Act of 2001 (Public Law 107–103), restored the automatic pre-
sumption of permanent and total non-service-connected disability
for purposes of awarding a pension to veterans age 65 and older,
subject to the income limitations that apply to all pensioners.
Death pensions are payable to certain surviving spouses and chil-
dren of deceased wartime veterans. The rate payable for both dis-

24
ability and death pensions is determined on the basis of the annual
income of the veteran or their survivors. In fiscal year 2026, the
Department estimates that the pensions program will provide ben-
efits to 116,873 veterans and 83,331 survivors totaling
$3,100,000,000.
The Compensation and Pensions program funds certain burial
benefits on behalf of eligible deceased veterans. These benefits pro-
vide the purchase and transportation costs for headstones and
markers, graveliners, and pre-placed crypts; and provide partial re-
imbursement for privately purchased outer burial receptacles. In
fiscal year 2026, the Department estimates the Compensation and
Pensions program will obligate $363,200,000 providing burial bene-
fits. This funding will provide 46,055 burial allowances, 50,866 bur-
ial plot allowances, 65,748 service-connected death awards, 403,896
burial flags, 279,429 headstones or markers, 23,299 graveliners or
reimbursement for privately purchased outer burial receptacles,
235 caskets and urns for the internment of the remains of veterans
without next of kin, and 950 cremation urns and commemorative
plaques in lieu of furnishing a headstone or marker for an eligible
deceased individual not already buried who served in the Armed
Forces.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $227,240,071,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the Compensa-
tion and Pensions account.
The Committee recommendation includes an advance appropria-
tion of $241,947,603,000 for the Compensation and Pensions ac-
count for fiscal year 2027.
Oversight of Compensation and Pension [C&P] Exams.—The
Committee is aware that the Department has increasingly relied on
outside providers to conduct C&P exams. Additional oversight is
necessary to ensure veterans are receiving quality exams and that
they are easily accessible. The Department should apply consistent
standards for timeliness and quality performance for both contract
providers and VHA providers. Additionally, VA should maintain
statistics regarding the rate and frequency with which contract
providers and VA render negative opinions regarding C&P exams
to monitor for trends. At a minimum, such statistics should contain
provider name, facility, contractor or Federal employee status, and
list of conditions (with corresponding rate of diagnosis) for which
the provider performs C&P exams.
Further, the Department should utilize the terms of these con-
tracts to institute more robust oversight mechanisms, including
setting up a process by which veterans can lodge complaints with
VBA that the agency then can resolve directly with the contractor.
Additionally, the Committee directs VA to report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on steps it will
take to implement the recommendations in the VA Office of Inspec-
tor General’s report ‘‘The Medical Disability Examination Office
Needs to Better Monitor Mileage Requirements for Contract
Exams’’ dated April 20, 2023.
Unaccredited Claims Agents.—The Committee is concerned with
the proliferation of unaccredited entities, some of whom are aggres-

25
sively marketing representational services to veterans using preda-
tory tactics, often resulting in veterans paying exorbitant fees for
representation for disability compensation claims. The Committee
suggests that the Department consider instituting a system of re-
porting the conduct of unaccredited attorneys to the appropriate
bar associations as another means of policing bad conduct. While
the Department lacks the authority to do more than send cease and
desist letters to entities engaged in these activities, VA is directed
to report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress on the steps VA plans to take on instituting a system of
reporting the conduct of unaccredited attorneys, the steps it has
undertaken to both inform veterans about unaccredited claims rep-
resentatives and to educate veterans on the risks of sharing their
VA account log in credentials and bank account information with
such actors.
Claims and Appeals Backlogs.—The Committee is concerned
about service delays, processing backlogs, and accuracy rates of de-
cisions. The Department is directed to provide a report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress within 180
days of enactment of this act to identify where in the current
claims and appeals processes delays and inaccuracies in decisions
are occurring, potential personnel shortfalls, and employee training
that could be improved upon to increase accuracy and efficiency in
claims decisions. The Department is further directed to include in-
formation about the average time for processing claims requested
for ‘‘Higher-Level Review’’ and what efforts could be undertaken to
decrease these timelines.
Timely Access to Survivor Benefits.—VA provides certain benefits
to surviving spouses after the death of certain veterans which are
often critical for these surviving spouses. However, it takes too long
for spouses to learn whether or not they are eligible for survivor
benefits. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses
of Congress within 90 days of enactment of this act, on the feasi-
bility, advisability, and cost of VBA establishing a pathway for vet-
eran spouses to apply for survivor benefits in advance of a vet-
eran’s death, such that VBA could pre-approve applications to
make a final determination following the spouse’s death, and if ap-
proved, deliver benefits to the surviving spouse within 30 days of
notification to VBA of the veteran’s death.
Military Sexual Trauma [MST].—Data from VA screenings show
that about one in three women veterans experienced MST at some
point during their service. In 2018, an OIG report found that when
women veterans file claims for MST, nearly half of them are denied
disability benefits. Since then, Congress enacted legislation to re-
quire specialized teams at VBA to process MST-related claims.
Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to determine
whether it is possible to further streamline the claims process for
veterans who reported sexual assault that occurred during military
service to limit the number of engagements with claims processors
that require such veterans to repeat their experience multiple
times. Further, the Committee encourages the Secretary to evalu-
ate, as available, the service-connected disability application and
claims process for veterans who reported sexual assault that oc-

26
curred during military services to identify and mitigate potential
barriers. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Secretary to
examine, as available, the potential differences between rating out-
comes for veterans who reported their sexual assault while in serv-
ice and those who did not. The Secretary should report its findings
to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 120 days after enactment.
READJUSTMENT BENEFITS

Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... ...........................
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 20,057,841,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Readjustment Benefits appropriation finances the education
and training of veterans and servicemembers under chapters 21,
30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 41, 51, 53, 55, and 61 of title 38, United
States Code. These benefits include the All-Volunteer Force Edu-
cational Assistance Program (Montgomery GI bill) and the Post-9/
11 Educational Assistance Program, including changes through the
Forever GI bill. Basic benefits are funded through appropriations
made to the readjustment benefits account and by transfers from
the Department of Defense [DoD]. This account also finances voca-
tional rehabilitation, specially adapted housing grants, specially
adapted automobile grants for certain disabled veterans, and edu-
cational assistance allowances for eligible dependents of those vet-
erans who died from service-connected causes or who have a total
permanent service-connected disability, as well as dependents of
servicemembers who were captured or missing in action.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $20,372,030,000 for the Readjustment Benefits account
for fiscal year 2026.
The Committee recommendation includes an advance appropria-
tion of $20,057,841,000 for Readjustment Benefits for fiscal year
2027.
Excess Leave Program [ELP].—The Committee is aware that VA
stopped providing the Military Housing Allowance benefit for a co-
hort of active duty service men and women attending university
under the ELP. The Committee urges the Department to consider
utilizing discretionary authority to begin providing this housing
benefit to participants in this program.
Postsecondary Credential among Veterans.—The Committee di-
rects the Comptroller General to report on the prevalence of high-
quality postsecondary credentials among veterans. The report shall
include the number of veterans who hold a high-quality postsec-
ondary credential, the number of those veterans who obtained such
a credential during their military service, the number of those vet-
erans who obtained such a credential after their military service,
an earning comparison between veterans with and without such
credentials who are working in similar industries and occupations,
the rate of business ownership among veterans with and without

27
such credentials, the average cost and time needed for veterans to
obtain such credentials, and recommendations for how to increase
veterans’ access to such credentials. The Comptroller General shall
consider credentials that are: (i) included on a State list described
in section 122(d) of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
(29 U.S.C. 3152(d)); (ii) in compliance with the quality assurance
requirements for a credentialing program under 10 U.S.C. 2015(c)
(i.e., the COOL directory); (iii) approved by the State approving
agency according to the Department of Veterans Affairs WEAMS
database; (iv) accredited by the Institute for Credentialing Excel-
lence, the National Commission on Certifying Agencies, the Amer-
ican National Standards Institute, or other reputable accrediting
bodies; and (v) meet other standards for quality determined by the
Departments. The Comptroller General shall provide a report to
the Committees on Appropriations of both houses of Congress no
later than 1 year after the enactment of this act.
Veteran Readiness and Employment [VR&E] Case Managers.—
Veterans report experiencing difficulty in contacting a case man-
ager for help related to VR&E programs. The Department must
provide access to assistance needed in a timely manner. Therefore,
the Department is directed to provide the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress a report on wait times for a
veteran to reach a case manager, and what resources the Depart-
ment needs to bring wait times within a timeframe the Secretary
deems satisfactory. The report should be provided within 180 days
of enactment of this act, and discuss the VR&E staff ratio, if the
current requirement of 1 FTE to 125 veterans is sufficient, the geo-
graphical spread of VR&E counselors and its impact on serving vet-
erans, and constraints on access to VR&E counselors in rural com-
munities.
Educating Student Veterans on Debt.—The Committee encour-
ages the Department to share additional detailed information with
students and Institutions of Higher Learning [IHL] on student
debt, including debt incurred against IHL for overpayments to the
student for tuition and fees or Yellow Ribbon payments, for the
purposes of working with such students and institutions to elimi-
nate the debt.
GI Bill Requirements for Flight Training.—In 2015 VA issued
guidance requiring all GI Bill-approved Institutions of Higher
Learning [IHL] to establish a specific number of training hours re-
quired for completion of educational objectives for all students. The
required number of training hours must be stated as a specific
number and may not be presented as a range or a maximum or
minimum. The Committee is concerned that this requirement may
not allow for necessary flexibility in a competency-based cur-
riculum and could force veterans to retake the course using their
VA educational benefit. The Committee directs the Department to
consider increasing flexibility so that flight schools affiliated with
IHL are not mandated to fail students who complete coursework
before or after the specific training hours requirement as well as
establishing a standard based on an allotted dollar amount per stu-
dent rather than an hour-based requirement. The Department
shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of both

28
Houses of Congress on the advisability, feasibility, and cost of tak-
ing such actions no later than 180 days after enactment of this act.
Biomanufacturing Training.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to consider engaging with an institution of higher education
for the provision of biomanufacturing training to provide targeted,
hands-on, industrial biomanufacturing training for veterans and
transitioning service members.
Technology Education Programs.—The Committee is encouraged
by the success of the VET TEC program and encourages the De-
partment to take any steps available to provide veterans with simi-
lar technology education programs, particularly in areas of the
country where such initiatives have not been previously available.
Referral Management System.—The Committee notes that
servicemembers transitioning to civilian life often experience dif-
ficulties getting connected to both State and Federal benefits that
they earned through their service. The Committee therefore directs
the Department to consider the feasibility and advisability of cre-
ating a cloud-based technological platform that links state, na-
tional, and community veteran service organizations through one
network.
VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $135,119,422
Advance Appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 131,518,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 97,893,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Veterans Insurance and Indemnities appropriation consists
of the former appropriations for military and naval insurance, ap-
plicable to World War I veterans; National Service Life Insurance,
applicable to certain World War II veterans; servicemen’s indem-
nities, applicable to Korean conflict veterans; and veterans mort-
gage life insurance to individuals who have received a grant for
specially adapted housing.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $131,518,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the Veterans Insur-
ance and Indemnities account. In addition, the Committee rec-
ommendation includes an advance appropriation of $97,893,000 for
Veterans Insurance and Indemnities for fiscal year 2027.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund provides for all
costs associated with VA’s direct and guaranteed housing loan pro-

29
grams, with the exception of the Native American Veteran Housing
Loan Program.
VA loan guaranties are made to servicemembers, veterans, re-
servists, and unremarried surviving spouses for the purchase of
homes, condominiums, and manufactured homes, and for refi-
nancing loans. VA guarantees part of the total loan, permitting the
purchaser to obtain a mortgage with a competitive interest rate,
even without a downpayment, if the lender agrees. VA requires a
downpayment be made for a manufactured home. With a VA guar-
anty, the lender is protected against loss up to the amount of the
guaranty if the borrower fails to repay the loan.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends such sums as may be necessary,
currently estimated to be $2,089,000,000, for funding subsidy pay-
ments, and $266,736,842 for administrative expenses for fiscal year
2026. Bill language limits gross obligations for direct loans for spe-
cially adapted housing to $500,000.
Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase [VASP] Program.—The
VASP program was a critical tool for veterans facing foreclosure on
their VA-backed home loans, but the program was terminated on
May 1, 2025. The Committee supports programs and efforts that
prevent veterans from foreclosing on their VA-backed home loans.
The Department is directed to provide a report to the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress which includes: the
number of VASP applicants who were awaiting VASP approval as
of May 1, 2025 and the average amount of home loan they were
applying for; a detailed description and timeline of past, present,
and ongoing efforts to assist these applicants; the estimated wait
time for VASP application decisions; the process and analysis uti-
lized by the Department to reach the decision to terminate the pro-
gram; a detailed description of efforts VA is considering employing
to mitigate the impact VASP termination has had on veterans and
their families, the number of VA loans that were foreclosed on be-
tween May 1, 2025 and the writing of the report, and the lifetime
revenue, costs, and profits or losses to the Department for the
VASP program from creation to the creation of the report.

Appropriations, 2025....................................................................................................... $78,337 $460,698
Committee recommendation, 2026................................................................................. 45,428 507,254
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Vocational Rehabilitation Loans Program account covers the
cost of direct loans for vocational rehabilitation of eligible veterans
and, in addition, includes administrative expenses necessary to
carry out the direct loan program. Loans of up to $1,530 (based on
the indexed chapter 31 subsistence allowance rate) are currently
available to service-connected disabled veterans enrolled in voca-
tional rehabilitation programs, as provided under 38 U.S.C. chapter
31, when the veteran is temporarily in need of additional assist-

30
ance. Repayment is made in monthly installments, without inter-
est, through deductions from future payments of compensation,
pension, subsistence allowance, educational assistance allowance,
or retirement pay. Virtually all loans are repaid in full and most
in less than 1 year.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $45,428 for program costs and
$507,254 for administrative expenses for the Vocational Rehabilita-
tion Loans Program account. The administrative expenses may be
paid to the General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Admin-
istration account. Bill language is included limiting program direct
loans to $1,394,442. It is estimated VA will make 718 loans in fis-
cal year 2026, with an average amount of $1,941.
NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,718,546
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 5,845,241
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program is author-
ized by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, section 3761 to provide direct loans
to Native American veterans living on trust lands. The loans are
available to purchase, construct, or improve homes to be occupied
as veteran residences or to refinance a loan previously made under
this program in order to lower the interest rate.
Veterans pay a funding fee of 1.25 percent of the loan amount,
although veterans with a service-connected disability are exempt
from paying the fee. Before a direct loan can be made, the veteran’s
Tribal organization must sign a memorandum of understanding
with VA regarding the terms and conditions of the loan. The Na-
tive American Veteran Housing Loan Program began as a pilot pro-
gram in 1993 and was made permanent by the Veterans’ Housing
Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of 2006 (Public Law
109–233).
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $5,845,241 for administrative ex-
penses associated with this program.
Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that there is a tremendous need for safe and af-
fordable housing in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native
Hawaiian communities. Native American Community Development
Financial Institutions [NCDFIs] have deep ties to the local commu-
nities they serve, and are uniquely equipped to reach potential
homebuyers. The Secretary should consider allowing Tribally Des-
ignated Housing Authorities and NCDFIs to act as intermediary
lenders in Tribal communities and for the program to collaborate
with these entities to provide greater homebuyer education. The
Secretary is directed to conduct meaningful and periodic outreach
to Tribes, Alaska Native entities, and Native Hawaiian entities to
increase geographic diversity of awards and increase awareness
and enrollment among Native American veterans.

GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES, VETERANS BENEFITS
ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,899,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 3,879,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The General Operating Expenses [GOE], VBA account provides
funding for VBA to administer entitlement programs such as serv-
ice-connected disability compensation, education benefits, and voca-
tional rehabilitation services.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $3,879,000,000 for the GOE, VBA
account. The Committee included bill language to make available
through September 30, 2027, up to 10 percent of the GOE, VBA ac-
count.
In addition, VA estimates to use $1,401,000,000 from the Toxic
Exposures Fund to support GOE, VBA-related activities in fiscal
year 2026.
Availability of GI Bill Benefits.—The Committee notes that VA
policy determinations have restricted the ability of veterans to ac-
cess their earned benefits, including GI Bill Benefits. In particular,
the Committee is aware of the VA Policy Advisory, dated Sep-
tember 2, 2022 and entitled ‘‘State-Legalized Cannabis Training
and GI Bill Benefits and Related Addendum,’’ which changed VA
policy to no longer allow the use of GI Bill Benefits for courses of
study determined to ‘‘have the objective to prepare someone to par-
ticipate in the cultivation, sale, or distribution of marijuana.’’ The
Advisory came despite the offering of such courses in States in
which either the recreational or medicinal use of marijuana is le-
gally permissible. The Committee directs VA to submit a report to
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no
later than 90 days after enactment of this act regarding the num-
ber of veterans who this effected.
VA Apprenticeship and On-the-Job-Training [OJT].—The Com-
mittee notes that the fiscal year 2023 Joint Explanatory Statement
accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 directed
VA to ‘‘take additional actions to promote awareness and increased
utilization of apprenticeships and OJT programs’’ available to vet-
erans, including, in coordination with the Department of Labor, the
establishment of a user-friendly website on which veterans could
find information about apprenticeship programs approved under
the GI Bill. Additionally, VA was encouraged to continue coordina-
tion with State Approving Agencies [SAA] on programs which may
incentivize increased participation by employers. Within 180 days
of enactment of this act, the Department is directed to provide an
update to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress regarding its efforts to develop the website and actions it has
taken with SAAs for the purpose of increasing awareness and utili-
zation of apprenticeships and OJT.
Outreach to Upgrade-Eligible Veterans.—The Committee sup-
ports efforts to ensure that veterans can access the benefits to
which they are entitled following their service to our Nation. In

32
particular, the Committee recognizes the importance of ensuring
that veterans who were given a less than honorable discharge from
the military due to behaviors resulting from traumas such as
PTSD, TBI, or MST are aware of the opportunity to upgrade their
service discharge status via petitioning of a Discharge Review
Board, which each military service operates. The Department is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress within 180 days regarding efforts already
underway by the Department to conduct outreach towards veterans
who may be eligible for a discharge upgrade to ensure they are
aware of the review board petition process. Such report shall also
include recommendations regarding opportunities for additional
and more effective outreach to veterans, including, but not limited
to, efforts that could be effectuated via the VA–DoD Joint Execu-
tive Committee to enhance coordination between VA and DoD to
ensure both veterans and those soon to leave the service are aware
of the Discharge Review Board process and the requirement of lib-
eral consideration under Public Law 114–328, Section 535.
Support to County, Tribal, and Equivalent Governmental Vet-
erans Service Officers.—The Committee recognizes the crucial role
of County, Tribal and equivalent governmental veterans service of-
ficers in ensuring veterans receive the benefits and care they de-
serve. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Department to
move expeditiously to implement the Commitment to Veteran Sup-
port and Outreach Act enacted in 2024, to facilitate collaboration
between County, State, and Tribal veterans service officers, VHA
facilities, and VBA offices to increase outreach to veterans. Within
90 days of enactment of this act, the Department is directed to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses
of Congress on the progress made on implementation of Section 302
of the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare
and Benefits Improvement Act, including a plan to obligate the full
authorized funding level in support of this program.
Military Sexual Trauma Operations Center.—VBA has a dedi-
cated team for processing disability claims related to military sex-
ual trauma experienced by our Nation’s veterans. A significant
number of this staff work remotely on a large volume of highly sen-
sitive cases. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Depart-
ment is directed to submit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress detailing recruitment and re-
tention issues facing the Military Sexual Trauma Operations Cen-
ter, including the impacts of the reduction in telework agreements.
Further, the report should detail the impact that changes in
telework policies, or other changes in accommodations for the Cen-
ter’s staff, will have on the processing of military sexual trauma
claims at large, including any related privacy concerns. Finally, the
report should detail any additional challenges experienced by staff
at this Center given the nature of their work, as well as any areas
where further support may be required.
AI Support for Navigating Veterans Benefits.—The Department
should evaluate the feasibility and advisability of leveraging artifi-
cial intelligence and automation to assist veterans in navigating
the benefits lifecycle, including applications, appeals, and service
connection processes.

33
Dystonia.—The Committee recognizes that many veterans suffer
from several forms of dystonia due to traumatic brain injury. The
Committee urges VHA to utilize ongoing scientific progress and en-
gage with community stakeholders to improve care and modernize
the Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities to reflect the
severity of dystonia symptoms and the effect it has on veterans’
quality of life.
Dependents Educational Assistance.—The Committee notes that
children of deceased or disabled veterans may require additional
tutoring or educational training to prepare for college. Therefore,
the Committee directs VA to submit a report no later than 180
days after enactment of this act detailing the advisability, feasi-
bility, and cost of establishing a program to assist primary school-
aged children of deceased or disabled veterans to achieve academic
success and college readiness.
VetSuccess on Campus Program.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the VetSuccess on Campus program and its role in
ensuring success in post-secondary education for veterans, service
members, and qualified dependents. The Committee directs the
agency to seek opportunities for program expansion, including loca-
tions that serve multiple institutions and in States that currently
do not benefit from the program.

ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW
The Veterans Health Administration [VHA] is home to the
United States’ largest integrated healthcare system.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections
Fund [MCCF] was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
(Public Law 105–33). In fiscal year 2004, the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2004 (Public Law 108–199) allowed the Department
to deposit first-party and pharmaceutical co-payments, third-party
insurance payments and enhanced-use collections, long-term care
co-payments, Compensated Work Therapy Program collections,
Compensation and Pension Living Expenses Program collections,
and Parking Program fees into the MCCF.
The Parking Program provides funds for the construction, alter-
ation, and acquisition (by purchase or lease) of parking garages at
VA medical facilities authorized by 38 U.S.C. 8109. The Secretary
is required under certain circumstances to establish and collect fees
for the use of such garages and parking facilities. Receipts from the
parking fees are to be deposited into the MCCF and are used for
medical services activities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided $131,439,000,000 in
advance appropriations for VA’s medical care accounts for fiscal
year 2026. This included $75,039,000,000 for Medical Services,
$34,000,000,000 for Medical Community Care, $12,700,000,000 for

34
Medical Support and Compliance, and $9,700,000,000 for Medical
Facilities. VA proposed a rescission of $16,499,000,000 from med-
ical care accounts in fiscal year 2026 as well as a transfer of
$2,030,000,000 between Medical Care accounts, which the Com-
mittee recommendation includes.
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee provides a total of
$114,943,000,000 for VA medical care. Additionally, the Committee
recommendation includes $943,000,000 for Medical and Prosthetic
Research. Medical Care Collections are estimated to be
$4,580,000,000 in fiscal year 2026. The Committee recommendation
also provides $122,258,000,000 in advance appropriations for VA’s
medical care accounts for fiscal year 2027.
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee provides $52,676,000,000 for
the Toxic Exposures Fund, of which $49,800,000,000 is estimated
to be for medical care, for a total of $164,743,000,000 in medical
care funding in fiscal year 2026.
The Committee recognizes the invaluable role of VA, the Nation’s
largest integrated healthcare system, in serving the unique needs
of veterans. The Committee recognizes that a strong and fully
resourced VHA is necessary to effectively serve our Nation’s vet-
erans.
Childcare Infrastructure.—The Committee provides $3,000,000
for costs associated with infrastructure supporting the Depart-
ment’s childcare initiative and requires a spend plan to be sub-
mitted to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress within 90 days of enactment of this act for these funds.
Child Care Assistance.—The Committee continues to support the
expansion of child care assistance to veterans receiving healthcare
at all VA medical facilities, and is disappointed by the lack of
progress made thus far. The Department is reminded of the statu-
tory deadline of January 5, 2026, as required by the Johnny Isak-
son and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Im-
provement Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–315), and thus is directed
to expeditiously publish regulations as necessary, and to provide a
briefing to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress within 120 days after enactment of this act, regarding the
projected timeline for implementation of this program, including its
efforts to inform veterans of these services.
Support for Veterans in the Freely Associated States [FAS].—The
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–42) re-
quires VA to conduct outreach with the FAS, assess options for the
delivery of hospital care and medical services in the FAS, and enter
into agreements with the governments of the FAS before delivering
hospital care and medical services. In line with Congressional in-
tent, the Department is directed to provide these services before
the end of fiscal year 2026, to include direct care from VA pro-
viders, telehealth, and care through contracts with community pro-
viders; shipping medications to the FAS; and reimbursing veterans
for travel from their home countries to the United States. The
Committee further directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of State, to advance the Circular 175
process and enter into agreements with the governments of the
FAS, to facilitate the furnishing of health services pursuant to and
in order to carry out section 209(a) of the Compact of Free Associa-

35
tion Amendments Act of 2024 before the end of fiscal year 2026.
To determine how VA will provide the resources needed to imple-
ment these new obligations, the Committee directs VA within 60
days of enactment of this act to provide the Committee with the es-
timated cost and the plan for implementing this law in fiscal year
2026.
Vet Centers.—The Department is directed to submit to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, within 90
days of enactment of this act, a report detailing its progress in
meeting the statutory deadlines under the Vet Center Improve-
ment Act (Public Law 117–263), including the electronic database
for systemic feedback from readjustment counselors, and if addi-
tional funds are required to support full implementation.
Records Management.—The Committee directs VA to assess op-
tions for modernizing medical records storage at the VA Records
Management Center, and urges the Department to make available
options to send copies of records other than on compact discs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Medical Services account provides for medical services for el-
igible enrolled veterans and other beneficiaries in VA healthcare
facilities, including VA medical centers and VA outpatient clinics.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $75,039,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the Medical
Services account. The Committee recommendation includes the pro-
posed $15,889,000,000 rescission of fiscal year 2026 advance appro-
priations, bringing the total to $59,150,000,000. In addition, VA es-
timates to use $35,370,000,000 from the Toxic Exposures Fund to
support medical services in fiscal year 2026. VA also has the au-
thority to retain co-payments and third-party collections.
The Committee recommendation also includes an advance appro-
priation of $59,858,000,000 for Medical Services for fiscal year
2027.
PREVENTING VETERAN HOMELESSNESS
The Committee remains strongly supportive of VA’s homeless-
ness prevention programs. As such the recommendation includes
$3,459,121,000 to support these programs. This total includes
$702,821,000 for the Supportive Services for Veterans Families
[SSVF] Program; $670,900,000 for Housing and Urban Develop-
ment-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing [HUD–VASH] Program
case management, $323,100,000 for the Grant and Per Diem [GPD]
Program; and $139,843,000 for the Veterans Justice Outreach
[VJO] Program and Legal Services for Veterans grants.

36
The Committee recognizes the Department’s efforts to reduce the
number of veterans experiencing homelessness, and the goal of put-
ting 46,000 veterans experiencing homelessness into long term
housing in calendar year 2025.
HUD–VASH Vouchers and Case Managers.—The Committee rec-
ognizes HUD–VASH as an important tool to house homeless vet-
erans. However, the overall eligibility and referral processes can
vary due to local coordination and resource availability. The Com-
mittee therefore directs the Department, in coordination with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, to provide a re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress no later than 180 days after enactment of this act detailing
how the Departments are developing a coordinated entry system,
including allocations of yearly vouchers, and how the Departments
plan to reduce the number of unused vouchers. The Committee fur-
ther directs VA to provide quarterly updates on the number of
HUD–VASH case managers directly employed by the Department,
the number of contracted positions, and the average caseload of
each case manager by VISN.
Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program [SSVF].—The
Committee urges VA to take steps to ensure that the SSVF pro-
gram continues to meet the needs of veterans, including the impact
of rising costs for household goods. The Department should con-
sider increasing the cap on Tenant Incentives and to consistently
cover costs associated with pet deposits, rent, utility deposits, and
car repairs.
Connected Care Program.—The Connected Care Program pro-
vides valuable resources, such as smartphones and tablets that
help to ensure that homeless veterans have access to telehealth
and other online services. Based on a 2022 Inspector General re-
port, however, the Committee is concerned that the program is not
effectively utilizing its resources. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Secretary to provide a report to Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress no later than 120 days after enactment
of this act identifying the steps taken by the Department to im-
prove and expand the program to better serve homeless veterans.
Elizabeth Dole Act Implementation.—The Department is expected
to implement Public Law 118–210 consistent with timelines in-
tended by Congress and outlined in law, including providing in-
creased per diem rates for GPD providers and the continuation of
the Section 4201 Assistance program. Within 90 days of enactment
of this act, the Department is directed to provide the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report to include
a cost estimate and an outline of any barriers to implement these
provisions as intended.
TELEHEALTH SERVICES
The Committee recommendation includes $6,356,035,000, to sus-
tain and increase telehealth capacity, including in rural and highly
rural areas. VA and DoD have long been leaders in the field of
emerging technology and medicine. For VA, telehealth creates a
bridge between rural and urban centers, allowing the Department
to expand access to care in areas where services are limited. Tele-
health also allows care to be provided more effectively and effi-

37
ciently for veterans closer to home and through direct in-home ac-
cess to providers. While VA continues to lead the healthcare indus-
try in the expansion of in-home telehealth and remote patient mon-
itoring services, these services are often limited by the lack of
broadband service in remote and rural areas. The Committee notes
that telehealth is an important point of access to care for veterans,
with about 40 percent of patients in the VA healthcare system hav-
ing at least one virtual medical appointment. The Committee sup-
ports VHA’s rulemaking to eliminate copays for telehealth appoint-
ments of any type, and encourages the Administration to finalize,
sustain, and expand upon such efforts.
Innovative Telehealth Services.—The Committee understands
that telehealth has been a successful tool in helping veterans ac-
cess healthcare through VA. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to continue increasing the reach of VA providers to vet-
erans in rural areas through the use of telehealth, especially for
primary care and preventative care services. Within 90 days of en-
actment of this act, the Department shall provide a spend plan to
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress for
the funding provided in support of telehealth initiatives, including
an overview of innovative efforts to reach veterans in rural areas
with telehealth.
Ketogenic Nutrition Programs.—The Committee understands the
Department is using telehealth services as a means to provide indi-
vidualized ketogenic nutrition programs and medical support to re-
duce the incidence of diabetes in VA patients. The Committee en-
courages the Department to consider expanding such efforts to ad-
dress the healthcare needs of Veterans living with Type 2 diabetes.
MENTAL HEALTH/PREVENTING VETERANS SUICIDE
The Committee provides $18,886,195,000 for mental health pro-
grams, consistent with VA’s estimate, including $3,651,718,000 for
suicide prevention outreach and treatment programs, of which
$697,760,000 is for suicide prevention outreach.
Lethal Means Safety and Suicide Prevention.—The Committee is
deeply concerned by recent increases in suicide rates and the prev-
alence of firearm-related suicides across the veteran community-
particularly striking among women veterans. To combat these
trends, the Committee supports VA’s efforts related to lethal means
safety and safe storage programming. The Committee directs the
Department to expand these efforts as part of the National Strat-
egy for Preventing Veteran Suicide, to enable greater distribution
of firearms safe storage devices. Further, the Committee directs VA
to ensure that access to firearms storage resources for veterans is
included in training for employees of the Veterans Crisis Line. The
Secretary is directed to submit an annual report to the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, disclosing the num-
ber of veterans making requests for safe storage devices, the num-
ber of safe storage devices distributed, the funding needs for the
continued operation of the program, and an assessment of the cost
of educating all veterans who receive care at VA facilities about the
availability of safe storage devices as a means of suicide prevention
and harm reduction.

38
Predictive Modeling and Analytics for Veterans Suicide Preven-
tion.—Suicide is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive
and innovative solution. VA has already started to tackle this by
creating Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health-Vet-
erans Enhanced Treatment [REACH VET], an identification and
intervention program that uses predictive analytics to identify at-
risk veterans. The Committee is aware of additional predictive data
analytics and machine learning tools that may help at-risk vet-
erans before a crisis arises. The Committee encourages VA to use
predictive data analytics and machine learning more broadly across
the system to identify veterans with suicidal ideations and better
deliver treatment.
Improving Veteran Access to Suicide Prevention Services.—The
Committee encourages the Department to enhance the geographic
distribution of suicide prevention grants under the Staff Sergeant
Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program. The Com-
mittee understands that a significant number of veterans reside in
areas that have not yet benefited from such programs and urges
the Department to take steps to ensure grant opportunities are
available to States which have not received funding, or where cov-
erage gaps exist.
Suicide Research.—Suicide among veterans is a complex issue
that requires more deep and technical understanding regarding the
factors and potential causes, including for overdose deaths and all
non-accidental, non-natural deaths. The committee encourages VA
to partner with academic research institutions currently conducting
research that seeks to understand the individual and community
factors contributing to death by suicide among veterans.
Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy.—The Committee understands that
VA and other relevant Federal agencies are undertaking research
to evaluate the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies in treating
PTSD, major depressive disorder, and other conditions. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to submit a report no later than 180
days after enactment of this act to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress, on current research and activities
related to these therapies, as well as estimated costs of staffing,
training, equipment, facility, and other needs to expand use of
these treatments.
Further, the Department is directed to initiate a longitudinal
study of veterans participating in such therapies and track out-
comes over a period of 5 years. The study should include: the num-
ber of individuals receiving psychedelic-assisted therapies treat-
ment in the last year, the average number of months such individ-
uals served on active duty if available, the distribution of disability
ratings of such individuals, the gender distribution of individuals
receiving treatment, the number of individuals receiving psyche-
delic-assisted therapies treatment who suspended participation in
such treatment, the average number of treatment sessions and dos-
ages each individual received, the percentage of individuals who ex-
perienced a clinically significant reduction in symptoms, and the
number of such individuals who experienced a recurrence of their
diagnosis after previously receiving this treatment. The Depart-
ment is directed to report annually on the progress of the study

39
and provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress on outcomes, at the conclusion of the study.
Veterans Crisis Line [VCL].—The Committee notes that engage-
ment with VCL has increased, and is concerned that some veterans
seeking crisis intervention services may not have received the care
or connection to local providers that they needed. It is critical that
the VCL has the oversight and training necessary to support a sub-
stantial rise in call volume. Therefore, the Committee directs the
Secretary to report within 90 days of enactment of this act to the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the
implementation of the VA Office of the Inspector General rec-
ommendations included in the September 13, 2023, VA OIG report,
22–00507–211.
Natural Language Speech.—The Committee encourages the Sec-
retary to implement ‘‘Natural Language Speech’’ selection capa-
bility for contact center solutions across VA Health Contact Cen-
ters including the Veteran’s Crisis Line and the Community Care
Enterprise Contact Center, as practicable.
Reconciliation Council Effectiveness.—The Department is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress within 180 days of enactment of this act
containing an update on actions taken and recommendations made
by the VISN 10 Interagency Reconciliation Council, including any
additional resources or authorities that may be needed for the IRC
to fully effectuate the purposes leading to its formation.
Geriatric Mental Health.—The Committee notes that as the vet-
eran population continues to age, more veterans will experience
unique mental health challenges which require tailored services
that address the specific needs of older veterans. To better under-
stand the scope and effectiveness of current geriatric mental health
services, the Committee directs the Department to provide a com-
prehensive report on the availability and utilization of such serv-
ices. The report, due to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress no later 180 days after the enactment of this
act, should include: (1) a detailed account of geriatric mental health
programs, including inpatient, outpatient, telehealth, and commu-
nity-based options, currently available within the VA system; (2) an
analysis of service distribution, with attention to disparities affect-
ing rural and underserved areas; (3) statistics on veteran enroll-
ment and use of geriatric mental health programs over the past 5
years; (4) information on the availability of trained geriatric mental
health providers and ongoing professional development initiatives;
(5) identification of critical gaps in service delivery and barriers to
access, including transportation, stigma, or resource limitations;
and (6) proposals for expanding and improving geriatric mental
healthcare, including legislative or funding requirements.
Farming and Recovery Mental Health Services.—The Committee
recognizes that the Department’s Farming and Recovery Mental
Health Services program has been effective in training veterans in
agricultural vocations while also addressing behavioral and mental
health needs. However, only six of the original 10 sites of the pilot
program are still active today. The Committee therefore encourages
the Department to reevaluate the program and to consider expan-
sion.

40
Public-Private Veteran Suicide Prevention Initiative.—The De-
partment is directed to assess the feasibility of expanding efforts
to directly funding community based organizations in a public-pri-
vate partnership to address needs of veterans, specifically with the
goal of preventing suicide; increasing access to care and services;
and improving well-begin outcomes for veterans.
OPIOID SAFETY INITIATIVES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE
To continue to build upon opioid reduction efforts and safety ini-
tiatives, the Committee recommendation includes $709,573,000 for
Opioid Prevention and Treatment programs at VA, consistent with
VA’s estimate. This includes $454,086,000 for treatment programs
and $254,487,000 to continue implementation of the Jason
Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act, as part of the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–198).
Non-Addictive Opioid Alternatives.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the continued use of opioids in the veteran popu-
lation. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report
to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 60 days after enactment of this act on veterans’ ac-
cess to non-opioid pain relief medications. The report should in-
clude steps the Department will take to ensure that coverage, cost-
sharing, and access are not an impediment to veterans receiving
these medications, what actions need to be taken to ensure enrolled
veterans have access to prescriptions for nonaddictive opioid alter-
natives for both acute and chronic pain, and how the Department
will support continued and expanded education to providers on
non-addictive opioid alternatives.
Training and Medication Access.—The Committee is concerned
that veterans experiencing substance use disorder are not able to
access treatments, such as buprenorphine. The Committee directs
VA to expand training and education for providers on the use of
FDA-approved medication assisted treatments for substance use
disorder, and to coordinate with provider organizations to ensure
that veterans are able to access the medications for substance use
disorder in inpatient and emergency settings.
Pain Management Decision Support Tool.—The Committee recog-
nizes the balance between supporting access to care for veterans
with pain and the veteran’s risk of developing dependency for pre-
scription pain medication. The Committee supports efforts to estab-
lish more precise and effective prescribing guidelines to ensure vet-
erans receive appropriate care, and encourages VA to consider de-
ploying a clinical decision support tool to evaluate and interpret the
acute and chronic pain management needs for eligible veterans.
The Department is directed to provide a report within 180 days on
the feasibility, advisability, and cost estimates for implementing
such a tool.
Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment.—The Committee notes the
report language in the fiscal year 2023 Joint Explanatory State-
ment requiring the Department to track the use of osteopathic ma-
nipulative treatment to treat back and other pain. The Committee
continues to encourage VA to expand the use of alternative treat-
ments for pain management, such as acupuncture, in its delivery
of healthcare services. The Department is directed to provide a re-

41
port to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress on utilization rates on alternative pain management broken
out by treatment and denial rates for each treatment, and provide
the report no later than 180 days after enactment of this act.
Pharmacy Benefits Management Services.—The Committee is
aware of new pain management drugs that are less addictive than
opioids. VA is encouraged to provide veterans with as many options
for pain management besides opioid analgesics therapeutics, in-
cluding new FDA approved drugs that are proven to be safe and
effective.
Opiate-Free Pain Therapy.—The Secretary is encouraged to con-
sider implementing a research project evaluating the efficacy of
thermal, shortwave diathermy on patients with chronic pain that
improves blood flow and provides non-opioid pain relief. The De-
partment is directed to provide a report to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress on the feasibility, advis-
ability, and cost estimates of operating such a program.
Long-Acting Injectable Medications [LAI].—The Committee en-
courages VA to consider expanding clinical education among its pri-
mary care practitioners on use of LAIs that are FDA-approved for
the treatment of alcohol use disorder, opioid use disorder, and seri-
ous mental illnesses, as clinically indicated.
Jason’s Law Implementation.—The Committee acknowledges the
2025 Office of Inspector General report finding that 67 percent of
VHA facilities were fully in compliance with Jason’s Law as of Oc-
tober 2024. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop a plan
to increase compliance and identify resources required to do so. The
Secretary shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress a report and briefing on such plan no
later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
LONG–TERM CARE
The Committee provides $21,859,792,000 for institutional and
non-institutional care consistent with VA’s estimate. The Com-
mittee is aware of the aging veteran population and supports long-
term care that focuses on facilitating veteran independence, en-
hancing quality of life, and supporting the family members of vet-
erans. As such, the Committee supports the Department’s efforts to
broaden veterans’ options regarding non-institutional long-term
care support and services, and to accommodate veterans’ pref-
erences in how and where they receive care and other services.
Veterans Access to Long-Term Care.—The Committee under-
stands the importance of recruiting and retaining vital partners
who provide long term care services to veterans. Therefore, the De-
partment should consider working with the Department of Labor to
seek exemptions for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Providers
from its authority, to the extent allowable in law.
Community Living Center Beds.—Within 90 days of enactment,
the Department is directed to report to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress on the feasibility, advisability
and costs of increasing the number of operating Community Living
Center beds in order to adequately meet the needs of veterans dis-
charged from inpatient care who no longer require acute inpatient

42
care but would benefit from short-term post-discharge stays at a
nursing facility.
Mobility Rehabilitation in State Veterans Homes.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the critical need for mobility rehabilitation
among aging and disabled veterans residing in state-run veterans
homes. The use of unweighted walking devices has shown promise
in improving rehabilitation outcomes, reducing fall risks, and en-
hancing veterans’ quality of life. The Committee supports efforts to
expand access to mobility rehabilitation technologies for veterans
in state-run veterans homes and urges VA to work with state facili-
ties so that veterans have access to devices and therapies that en-
able veterans to regain mobility.
RURAL HEALTHCARE
Veterans residing in rural and remote areas face unique barriers
to receiving high-quality mental health, primary healthcare, and
specialty care services. While enhanced community care programs
offer veterans increased flexibility to obtain care close to home,
there are often gaps in services in rural and remote communities,
even among private providers. The Office of Rural Health [ORH]
and its Rural Health Initiative have played a critical role in assist-
ing VA in its efforts to increase access to care. Therefore the Com-
mittee recommendation includes $342,455,000 for ORH and the
Rural Health Initiative, consistent with VA’s estimate.
Veterans Transportation Service [VTS].—The Committee under-
stands that transportation to appointments can be a significant
barrier to accessing healthcare for veterans, especially in rural
areas. The Department is encouraged to require all VA Medical
Centers to continue to pursue options to expand partnerships with
State and local transportation services, eligible non-profits, and
veterans service organizations under the VTS. The Department is
directed to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of
both Houses of Congress no later than 270 days after the enact-
ment of this act detailing the VTS services offered by each VISN,
whether existing VTS services are adequate to meet the needs of
the veterans served, and opportunities for expanding partnerships
with State and local transportation providers, the requirements set
by the Department for volunteer drivers to attain and maintain
their volunteer driver status, how long on average it takes for a
volunteer to be approved after they submit initial paperwork, an
assessment of the time it takes for the Department to complete its
requirements for new drivers and vehicles such as gas cards and
identification production, the number of vehicles out of service for
at least 90 days due to repairs needed, the number of hours total
driven by volunteers to get veterans to and from medical appoint-
ments, and the estimated cost to the Department if those hours
needed to be covered by a Department employee.
Highly Rural Transportation Grants Program.—The Committee
recognizes the need to address the care of veterans living in rural
communities across the United States in order to prevent long term
disparities in health outcomes. The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to work with Congress to expand and improve transportation
access to and from facilities that serve rural veterans by expanding

43
the definition of ‘‘Highly Rural’’ and increasing funds supporting
the Highly Rural Transportation Grants Program accordingly.
Transportation Service Technologies.—New technologies are
being developed and becoming increasingly available in both rural
and urban locations throughout the United States which could im-
prove the overall efficiency and coverage of the Veterans Transpor-
tation Program. The Committee directs VA to submit a report no
later than 180 days after the enactment of this act with an anal-
ysis of available data on the impact on homeless veterans from
ending the expanded use of the ridesharing program at VA that
took place during the COVID–19 pandemic, an estimate of the cost
to reinstate the expanded use of the ridesharing program and an
identification of any barriers associated with doing so, and an anal-
ysis of VA’s existing statutory authority for provisions that would
enable the agency to restart this program absent legislation from
Congress.
Outreach to Highly Rural Veterans.—The Department is directed
to conduct outreach to highly rural veterans who lack direct road
access to inform them of their eligibility for benefits. Further, the
Committee urges the VA Innovation Ecosystem to consider how to
expand VA healthcare system’s infrastructural reach to enrolled
veterans residing in geographically underserved areas, including
rural and highly rural veterans.
CAREGIVERS
The Committee recommendation includes $3,500,000,000 for VA’s
Caregivers Program.
The Caregivers Program was enhanced as part of the John S.
McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Main-
taining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside
Networks [MISSION] Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–182).
The Committee recognizes the importance of the Program of
Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers [PCAFC] to allow
disabled veterans to receive the daily care they need at home with-
out placing a financial and mental burden on their families. The
Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that all veterans and
families currently enrolled in the program are not removed or in-
voluntarily discharged from the program as a result of administra-
tive eligibility reassessments or policy changes that reduce access
or narrow criteria, absent a clear case of fraud, abuse, or voluntary
withdrawal.
Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers
[PCAFC].—The Committee recognizes the importance of the Pro-
gram of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers [PCAFC]
to allow disabled veterans to receive the daily care they need at
home without placing a financial and mental burden on their fami-
lies. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that all vet-
erans and families currently enrolled in the program are not re-
moved or involuntarily discharged from the program as a result of
administrative eligibility reassessments or policy changes that re-
duce access or narrow criteria, absent a clear case of fraud, abuse,
or voluntary withdrawal. Additionally, within 30 days of any
changes to the program, the Committee directs VA to provide an

44
estimate of increases or decreases to the number of veterans and
caregivers in the program based on those changes.
WOMEN VETERANS HEALTHCARE
The women veteran population is the fastest growing demo-
graphic within VA and is anticipated to grow from 944,000 enrolled
in 2023 to over 1.3 million by 2030. As a result of the PACT Act,
27 percent of all new enrollees are expected to be women. VA must
enhance its services and access to gender-specific care, including
primary care providers, gynecologists, maternity care, mammog-
raphy services, and mental health providers, including care related
to experiences of military sexual trauma. Enhancing capacity to
support pregnant and postpartum women veterans must also be a
priority, which should include expansion of maternity care and lac-
tation support for women veterans.
Toward this end, the Committee recommendation includes
$1,429,181,000 for fiscal year 2026 to support gender-specific
healthcare services, as well as the program office and initiatives.
VA is encouraged to use this funding to continue to expand this
care so that all women veterans, including those in rural areas,
have the access to care they deserve.
VA Menopause Center of Excellence Feasibility Study.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that the Department provides excellent care to
women veterans, however specific care for those experiencing
menopause and perimenopause may be more difficult to find and
the Department must continue to do more research in this area as
women are the fastest growing veteran population. The Committee
directs the Department to prepare a feasibility study and brief the
Committee no later than 180 days after enactment on the ability
of the Department to create one or more Centers of Excellence in
Menopause.
Menopause and Mid-life Women’s Health.—The Committee di-
rects the Department to submit a report to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress no later than 120 days
after enactment of this act on the care available to women veterans
for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of perimenopause and
menopausal symptoms. The report should include any efforts to ad-
vance care coordination and expand access to quality primary care
and specialty care services with referrals or at VA facilities.
Mammogram Access at VA Facilities.—The Committee is con-
cerned by reports of limited access to mammograms at VA facilities
across the country. While VA has expanded eligibility for clinically
appropriate mammograms in recent years, the Committee remains
concerned that not enough has been done to increase access to
mammography screenings and breast cancer risk assessments
among women veterans, who may have an elevated risk of breast
cancer due to toxic exposure. Therefore, the Secretary is directed
to conduct a review of VA’s mammography equipment, breast can-
cer screening capacity, and the demand for screenings among
women veterans. Based on those findings, the Secretary shall de-
velop a plan to better meet the needs of women veterans by pro-
viding expanded access to mammograms and breast cancer
screenings with the VA system of care. The Secretary is directed
to provide a report with full findings and recommendations to the

45
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress within
270 days of enactment of this act.
CLINICAL WORKFORCE
The Committee appreciates the Department’s efforts to address
long-standing challenges in recruiting and retaining physicians,
physician assistants, nurses, mental health providers, other
healthcare professionals, and related support staff. The Committee
reminds the Department of the annual requirement for a report on
workforce issues outlined in the Joint Explanatory Statement ac-
companying Public Law 116–260.
VHA Staffing.—The Committee is concerned about existing em-
ployee vacancies within VHA and the potential impact on veterans
of the elimination of thousands of full-time staff from the agency.
Beginning 90 days after enactment of this act, the Department is
directed to provide quarterly updates to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress on staffing goals and current
staffing levels by VISN, including the number of positions filled or
removed in each of these categories: physicians, dentists, registered
nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse assistants, non-physician
providers, medical support assistants, and HUD–VASH case man-
agers, and the number of contracted positions in each of these cat-
egories nationwide.
Clinical Care Vacancies.—The Department is directed to provide
to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
a report outlining healthcare vacancies, by facility and specialty, as
of January 1, 2025, June 1, 2025, and 60 days after enactment of
this act; as well as the number of clinical positions necessary by
facility and specialty for each clinician to have panel sizes that
comply with current VHA policy and directives.
Rural and Tribal Healthcare Access.—The Committee recognizes
there is a shortage of healthcare providers in rural communities
and Tribal lands, and that a successful initiative has addressed
these issues by providing mobile medical clinics, telehealth tech-
nologies, and staff augmentation services to deliver primary and
specialty care services to Native American and other veterans liv-
ing in underserved locations. The Department is directed to assess
and report on the feasibility and cost of expanding an integrated
rural healthcare delivery model aligned with this initiative, and
provide it to the Committee on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress no later than 180 days after enactment of this act.
Sterile Processing Medical Supply Technician Certification.—The
Committee is aware that VHA recently updated its training and
certification requirements for certain Sterile Processing Services
[SPS] leadership staff, and directs the Department to report back
within 90 days of enactment of this act on the cost of requiring all
SPS staff, including those doing the day-to-day work of steriliza-
tion, to meet these updated training and certification requirements.
OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST
VA Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program [IPVAP].—Of
the amounts made available to the Department, the Committee
recommendation includes $36,879,000 for the IPVAP for fiscal year
2026 and the Department is directed to include it as a program of

46
interest with budget detail in the justifications accompanying fu-
ture year budget submissions. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to report on its plans to expand the IPVAP within 180 days
of enactment.
Accessibility of Rape Kits.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to update all relevant policies and directives to require that
VHA emergency departments and urgent care clinics maintain a
consistent supply of rape kits, to annually audit the validity of
those kits, and to preserve any evidence collected as part of a pa-
tient’s initial evaluation and stabilization following a sexual as-
sault. The Department is directed to report to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress within 180 days regard-
ing any barriers or limitations of the Department in doing so.
Access to Sexual Assault Forensic/Nurse Examiners [SAFEs/
SANEs].—The Committee is concerned about the inconsistent
availability of treatment by SAFEs/SANEs across VHA emergency
departments and urgent care clinics. This lack of reliability can
pose an impediment to patients in need of timely medical care and
evidence collection following a sexual assault. The Committee di-
rects VHA, not later than 180 days after the enactment of this act,
to maintain information on publicly available websites as to where
in VA patients may obtain SAFE/SANE services. Such website
shall include the facility name, address, and contact information for
all VHA facilities where SAFE/SANE services are provided. Within
90 days of enactment, the Committee also directs VA to report to
Congress on steps it will take to ensure VA facilities have plans to
provide sexual assault forensic examinations to veterans who come
to VA facilities after a sexual assault, including those facilities
lacking SAFE/SANE resources.
Colorectal Cancer.—The Committee is concerned about colorectal
cancer screening for veterans, particularly among those eligible
under the PACT Act. The Committee recognizes the value of
colorectal cancer screening and notes the growing availability of
non-invasive screening tests and their potential to improve vet-
erans’ health. An essential component of non-invasive colorectal
cancer screening tests is ensuring patients receive a follow-up
colonoscopy when initial testing indicate one is needed. The Com-
mittee encourages VA to consider public-private partnerships to
provide veterans with non-invasive colorectal cancer testing, cou-
pled with patient navigation to follow-up colonoscopy to improve
health outcomes.
Competition in Contracting for Medical Products.—The Com-
mittee understands there have been instances where VA has
awarded sole source contracts. The Committee notes VA has an ob-
ligation to maximize competition when evaluating new tech-
nologies, as required under VA and Federal acquisition policies. As
such, the Committee encourages the Department to consider con-
ducting market analyses prior to issuing a sole source contract to
evaluate comparable technologies available in the market. Not
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act, the De-
partment shall submit a report detailing its enterprise-wide efforts
to maximize competition.
Medical Equipment.—The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to efficiently acquire its medical equipment and supplies, to

47
include ventilators, by prioritizing domestically owned and manu-
factured products that are safe, effective, and provide cost savings.
Precision Oncology Program for Cancer of the Prostate
[POPCaP].—The Committee is disappointed that the Department
has not yet expanded the number of POPCaP sites as required by
the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–42.
As such, the Committee directs the Department to submit a report
within 30 days after the enactment of this act detailing how it will
maintain the 21 current POPCaP sites and expand to additional lo-
cations. Additionally, the Committee directs VA to provide a spend
plan for how it allocated funding to the current sites in fiscal years
2024 and 2025, including how it spent the additional funds pro-
vided in the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
118–42 specifically for the expansion of POPCaP, as directed, as
well as a spend plan for maintaining and expanding POPCaP sites
in fiscal year 2026 and beyond.
Kidney Cancer.—The Committee encourages VA to employ the
most accurate per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS] testing
methods to ensure comprehensive and reliable results in its sci-
entific assessment of the relationship between PFAS exposure dur-
ing military service and kidney cancer among veterans. New blood
testing methods would enable VA to detect a broader range of
PFAS compounds veterans encountered during service, providing
more comprehensive data to evaluate. New blood tests could help
VA evaluate whether kidney cancer should be a presumptive condi-
tion.
Veteran Family Resource Program.—The Department is directed
to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress, no later than 90 days after enactment of this
act, on the status of the Veteran Family Resource Program rollout,
including a summary of engagements to date, locations and next
steps on expanding the program in 2026, and authorities and fund-
ing needed to ensure a successful rollout. As part of the Family Re-
source Program, the Department is encouraged to include informa-
tion about resources that reduce rates of child abuse and neglect
among families with veterans.
Adaptive Sports.—The Committee provides $29,072,000 for Na-
tional Veterans Sports Programs, including $16,000,000 for adapt-
ive sports programs. The Committee recognizes the significant im-
provements that adaptive sports and recreational therapy have on
veterans’ mental and physical health, and that veterans have ex-
pressed their desire for these activities to be included in the serv-
ices VA offers. The Committee also recognizes that adaptive sports
and recreational therapy can provide a low-cost alternative to other
healthcare services that produce similar health outcomes. Many
community providers of these grants have been able to utilize this
key program in successfully reintegrating veterans back into their
communities. The Department is directed to consider the feasi-
bility, advisability, and cost required for the Adaptive Sports
Grants Office to recognize that recruitment and planning activities
are not administrative in nature and should not be considered as
such in future grant solicitations.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea.—The Department should consider the
advisability and feasibility of establishing a treatment program for

48
veterans suffering from obstructive sleep apnea using an innova-
tive oral appliance that expands the airway.
Center for Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and United States-
Affiliated Pacific Islander [NHPIUSAPI] Veterans Health.—The
Committee continues to support VA’s Center for NHPIUSAPIs to
advance efforts to address the unique healthcare needs of this com-
munity. The Center is provided funding consistent with amounts
provided in fiscal year 2024. The Committee also encourages VA to
partner with universities in the Pacific region focusing on issues
unique to this community, including extending the use of telehealth
and telepharmacy to reach remote and isolated areas, using multi-
disciplinary teams that incorporate community outreach workers,
integrating clinical pharmacists into primary care practices, incor-
porating local and indigenous cultural practices, leveraging data
analytics to analyze gaps and healthcare disparities, and improving
language access.
Produce Prescription Program.—The Committee recognizes that
VHA has the potential to play an important role in alleviating diet-
related disease through Produce Prescriptions. The Committee pro-
vides funding consistent with VA’s estimate for facilities to imple-
ment local VA Produce Prescription programs and pursue strate-
gies for patient education and outreach.
Diabetes Center of Excellence.—The Committee encourages VA to
consider establishing a Diabetes Center of Excellence to focus on
improving treatment and outcomes for veterans with diabetes. The
Center would conduct and support research, including health serv-
ices research, and other activities to develop and disseminate best
practices with respect to treatment (including modalities to induce
remission or reversal) and prevention within VHA.
Diabetic Foot Ulcers.—The Committee commends VA’s work to
eliminate diabetes-related foot amputations and supports the De-
partment’s continued investment in programs used to treat vet-
erans with diabetic foot ulcers. Further, the Committee encourages
the Department to develop the Remote Temperature Monitoring
Program, and to the extent practicable, expand its use of clinically
validated remote monitoring technology. The Department is di-
rected to provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress a report identifying its plans to support ex-
panding the Remote Temperature Monitoring Program, and any
barriers to doing so, including staffing levels no later than 120 days
after the enactment of this act. The Department is further encour-
aged to consider the feasibility and advisability of evaluating new
treatment modalities, including FDA-cleared skin substitutes and
other tissue-regeneration technologies.
Service Dogs.—The Department is directed to produce a report
for the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
on the feasibility, advisability and cost of operating a program to
provide grants to nonprofit organizations for the purpose of assist-
ing qualified organizations in carrying out programs to provide
service dogs to eligible veterans. The Department should provide
the report to the Committees no later than 1 year after enactment
of this act.
Neurology Centers of Excellence.—The Committee recognizes the
increasing number of veterans affected by neurologic conditions, in-

49
cluding but not limited to: epilepsy, headache, multiple sclerosis,
and Parkinson’s disease. The Neurology Centers of Excellence pro-
vide essential innovative clinical care, education, and research ef-
forts focused on these conditions. The Committee encourages fur-
ther investment in, and collaboration between the Centers across
disciplines and directs the Department to allocate $70,000,000 for
the Neurology Centers of Excellence, including $25,000,000 for the
Epilepsy Centers, $24,000,000 for the Headache Centers,
$6,500,000 for the MS Centers, and $14,500,000 for the
PADRECCs. The Committee also directs the Department to report
to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
the use and allocation of funds for each Center within 120 days of
enactment.
Dental Services.—The Committee encourages the Department to
offer veterans robust support to address their oral health needs
using a whole-person approach, especially for veterans with addi-
tional medical needs including diabetes and heart disease. The De-
partment is reminded of the report required in S. Rept. 118–43 re-
quiring an assessment on the state of veterans’ oral healthcare pro-
grams and these programs’ ability to adequately serve the current
and future oral health needs of veterans. The Committee looks for-
ward to reviewing this report. The Department is further encour-
aged to consider increasing the Department’s direct care capacity
through expansions in dental treatment rooms and hiring of addi-
tional dentists and other clinicians.
Medical Marijuana.—The Committee recognizes that the Depart-
ment of Justice’s Drug Enforcement Agency has concurred with the
Department of Health and Human Services’ 2023 recommendation
to reschedule cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act from its
current placement in Schedule I to the less restrictive Schedule III.
Should cannabis be rescheduled to a lower Schedule, VA should
consider issuing guidance allowing VHA doctors and other per-
sonnel to discuss, recommend, and facilitate access to medical
marijuana in States with state-legal medical marijuana programs
to the extent allowable under Federal law.
Dialysis Services.—As the Department reaches the end of the
current Nationwide Dialysis Services contract period, VA should
ensure that care is not disrupted or diminished for the veterans
currently receiving treatment for dialysis services. The Committee
remains interested in value-based dialysis payment models and di-
rects VA to submit the feasibility report, due December 2022, no
later than 3 months after the date of the enactment of this act to
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.
Neuromodulation Research and Trials.—The Committee under-
stands neuromodulation research and treatment have shown abil-
ity to improve stroke recovery among veterans. The Secretary is en-
couraged to consider further supporting this work and expanding
the availability of neuromodulation treatment to veterans, insofar
as it proves effective in supporting stroke recovery and generally
improving veteran health.
Peer Visitors.—The Committee commends the Department’s work
with veterans living with limb loss, particularly its support of pro-
grams that engage amputees to become certified peer visitors for
other veterans. The Committee encourages the Department to con-

50
sider expanding its certified peer visitor program to meet the needs
of all veterans.
VA Amputation System of Care.—The Committee commends the
Department’s work with veterans living with limb loss, particularly
its support of programs that engage amputees to become certified
peer visitors for other veterans. However, these veterans often fall
through the cracks, and could benefit from care coordination. The
Committee encourages the Department to consider strengthening
its system of care by providing enhanced care coordination services.
Public/Private Partnerships.—The Committee encourages VA to
examine existing barriers or limitations to the expansion and/or
promotion of public/private partnerships and to report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress proposals to
mitigate these barriers.
Veteran Access.—The Department is directed to provide to the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress monthly
updates, by facility, on the average number of days it takes for vet-
erans to receive appointments at VA and in the community, from
file entry date to first scheduled and file entry date to appointment,
beginning 30 days after enactment of this act.
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy [HBOT].—The Committee urges the
Department to consider continuing to research the efficacy of
HBOT as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and trau-
matic brain injury, and should permit case-by-case referrals for vet-
erans to receive HBOT in the community.
Neuroimaging for Brain Health.—Neuroimaging for precision
brain health is critical for veterans’ healthcare. The Committee was
discouraged to learn of contract cancellations related to
electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing. The Committee encourages VA to partner with academic re-
search institutions to restore the neuroimaging capacity of the De-
partment.
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Studies.—VA has taken sig-
nificant steps to expand therapies for treatment-resistant mental
health conditions, including multi-site research and care utilizing
transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Committee encourages VA
to expand on the Department’s existing transcranial magnetic stim-
ulation capacity.
Essential Medical Devices.—The Committee urges VA to pur-
chase essential medical devices, like needles and syringes, from
U.S. manufacturers or allied trading partners, to the extent pos-
sible. The Committee directs VA to submit a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later than 90
days after enactment of this act on any utilization of Chinese made
devices among the 96 medical countermeasures published by FDA
in 2020. The report should also include specific recommendations
on how VA can reduce its dependency on Chinese medical devices
and increase the domestic supply chain, while safeguarding against
shortages.
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Exposure.—The Committee is
encouraged by the Department’s review of the National Academies
of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendations related to
the utility of blood testing, and its collaboration with Federal and
academic partners, to better understand the health implications of

51
per- and polyfluoralkyl [PFAS] exposure related to military service.
The Committee directs VA to provide a report within 180 days of
enactment of this act to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress on the outcomes of VA’s Health Outcomes Mili-
tary Exposures [HOME] intra-agency Technical Working Group
[TWG] on improved clinical care decisions in terms of screening,
care, and compensation policies for veterans impacted by PFAS ex-
posure during their military service, especially firefighters, includ-
ing costs associated with the Secretary’s decision. The report
should include TWG’s final course of action and feedback provided
by key veteran stakeholders on VA’s planned way forward.
In Vitro Diagnostics.—The Committee notes that in vitro
diagnostics provide valuable information to healthcare providers for
accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of patients’
health.
Single-Use Devices.—The Department should consider updating
VHA Directive 1116(2), or any substantially similar directive which
prohibits or restricts the use of FDA-cleared or -approved commer-
cially reprocessed single-use devices. Initiation of a comprehensive
reprocessing program may result in cost savings, waste reduction
metrics, and an impact on supply chain resiliency.
CMS Ratings.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rating system for hos-
pitals and nursing homes across the country, including VA facili-
ties. These ratings are a critical tool for veterans to compare their
options and identify which hospital best fits their needs. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to work with CMS to ensure that VA
hospitals remain in the CMS rating system.
Strengthening Fall Prevention Efforts for Veterans.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to continue to expand its work
to address and reduce fall risks in older veterans. The Department
is directed to submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this
act to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress on the status of VA’s work to reduce fall risks in veterans
over 65 years old.
Liver Disease.—The Committee is aware that fatty liver disease
is an increasing challenge for the Veterans Health System, with up
to 30 percent of VA patients having this condition. About 70 per-
cent of people with type 2 diabetes or who experience obesity have
fatty liver disease. Therefore, the Committee encourages VA to
take steps to increase efforts to screen, diagnose and treat veterans
with fatty liver disease using non-invasive diagnostics and FDA-ap-
proved treatments, similar to Tricare for active-duty military, and
provide a briefing to the Committee on these efforts.
Graduate Medical Education Reimbursement.—The Committee
recognizes that joint medical residency programs between VA and
DoD provide comprehensive surgical training and prepare medical
residents for independent practice, while ensuring patient safety
and quality of care. The Committee directs VA to submit a report
to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 180 days after enactment of this act detailing the ad-
visability, feasibility, and cost of reimbursing travel costs for resi-
dents participating in joint DoD/VA medical residency programs.

52
Visitor Management System.—The Committee is aware of hos-
pital management tools that help protect patients, employees, and
visitors while also streamlining visitor management processes. The
Committee encourages VA to evaluate currently available software
visitor management systems comparing costs, capabilities, and
interoperability and report the results to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress within 180 days of enactment
of this act.
MEDICAL COMMUNITY CARE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $20,382,000,000
Advance appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 34,000,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... ......................
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 38,700,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Medical Community Care account provides for medical serv-
ices for eligible enrolled veterans and other beneficiaries that is
purchased from and provided by non-Department of Veterans Af-
fairs facilities and providers, including contract hospitals, State
homes, and outpatient services.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $34,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the Medical
Community Care account. In addition, VA estimates to use
$14,030,000,000 from the Toxic Exposures Fund to support medical
community care in fiscal year 2026, for a total of $48,030,000,000.
The Committee recommendation also includes an advance appro-
priation of $38,700,000,000 for Medical Community Care for fiscal
year 2027.
Standard Episode of Care.—Within 90 days of enactment, the
Committee directs VA to perform an analysis of how the Depart-
ment could better leverage its Third Party Administrators [TPA] to
inform VA when an enrolled veteran has been stabilized and may
require inpatient admission or a high-dollar procedure that could
be accommodated via the direct care system. Further, the analysis
should consider whether such follow on care could be separated
from the emergency care Standard Episode of Care.
Third Party Administrators [TPA] Accountability.—The Depart-
ment should ensure CCN providers are held to the same access
standards as those required for the Department by also requiring
CCN providers to report real-time appointment wait times as a
condition of their participation in the CCN. The Department should
establish care quality, training, and screening standards in line
with those required of VA clinical staff that ensure veterans receive
private care at facilities as good as or better than VA facilities. Ad-
ditionally, the Department should require TPAs to submit metrics
for appointment wait times per category of healthcare to the Sec-
retary at an interval determined by the Secretary.
Community Care Authorizations.—The Committee is concerned
about reports of veterans having authorizations for community care
revoked. As such, the Department shall provide a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress out-

53
lining in aggregate the number of instances where existing commu-
nity care authorizations were rescinded and provide examples of
the rationale by which such a decision would be made. The report
shall be provided within 270 days of enactment of this act.
External Provider Scheduling [EPS] System.—The Committee
understands the Department’s EPS system has decreased appoint-
ment scheduling time, administrative burden, and improved overall
efficiencies in the scheduling process for veterans receiving care in
the community. The Committee directs the Department to provide
a report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act, with
information on the impacts of the EPS system on veteran access to
care, barriers to increased implementation, and recommendations
on how to increase community provider participation.
MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $11,800,000,000
Advance appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 12,700,000,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 12,000,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Medical Support and Compliance account provides funds for
management, security, and administrative expenses within the VA
healthcare system, in addition to providing costs associated with
the operation of VA medical centers and clinics, VISN offices, and
the VHA Central Office in Washington, DC. This appropriation also
covers Chief of Staff and Facility Director operations, quality of
care oversight, legal services, billing and coding activities, procure-
ment, financial management, security, and human resource man-
agement.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $12,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the Medical
Support and Compliance account. The Committee recommendation
includes the proposed $610,000,000 rescission of fiscal year 2026
advance appropriations, bringing the total to $12,090,000,000.
The Committee recommendation includes an advance appropria-
tion of $12,000,000,000 for Medical Support and Compliance for fis-
cal year 2027.
Health Care Quality Measures.—The Secretary is encouraged to
consider the feasibility and advisability of utilizing digital reporting
methods for quality measures. Within 180 days of enactment of
this act, the Department is directed to provide a report on the find-
ings to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress.
IT Asset Management.—The Committee is aware of efforts made
by the Office of Information Technology to VA’s software and hard-
ware asset management practices and systems to produce cost sav-
ings, ensure more accurate baseline inventories of assets owned,
and improve VA’s ability to measure the total cost of ownership of
IT assets and applications. The Committee encourages VA to con-
tinue replicating this effort across all software and hardware port-
folios, and to ensure all assets are accurately reflected in the sys-

54
tem throughout their full lifecycles, from the time of acquisition
through final disposal.
Asset Management.—The Committee encourages the Department
to improve operational efficiency and patient care within VHA by
implementing cost-effective asset and location tracking tech-
nologies. These systems should enhance asset visibility, provide
real-time location data, reduce staff time searching for equipment,
streamline clinical workflows, and improve patient outcomes. By
minimizing equipment loss and over-purchasing, automated track-
ing could address staffing shortages and supply chain deficiencies
identified in the 2024 VA Office of Inspector General report, ‘‘VISN
Oversight of Medical Facility Supply Chain Management.’’
Progress on Data Sharing with State Cancer Registries.—The De-
partment is directed to provide an update on its progress in shar-
ing qualifying cancer related data with the State cancer registry of
each state as directed in the report accompanying Public Law 118–
42. The report should be provided to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress within 90 days of enactment of
this act, and include information on communication with registrars
and the level of information exchange taking place in each state.
MEDICAL FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,549,485,000
Advance appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 9,700,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 3,000,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 11,700,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Medical Facilities account provides funds for the operation
and maintenance of the VA healthcare system’s vast capital infra-
structure. This appropriation provides for costs associated with
utilities, engineering, capital planning, leases, laundry,
groundskeeping, housekeeping, facility repair, and property disposi-
tion and acquisition.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
In fiscal year 2025, the Committee provided an advance appro-
priation of $9,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the Medical Fa-
cilities account. The recommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes
an additional $3,000,000 to support expansion of child care centers
at VA medical facilities, which coupled with the advance appropria-
tion provided for fiscal year 2026 provides the Department with
total budget authority of $9,703,000,000.
The Committee recommendation also includes an advance appro-
priation of $11,700,000,000 for Medical Facilities for fiscal year
2027.
Prohibition on Smoking.—The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s efforts to make VA facilities smoke-free and encourages full
implementation and enforcement of VHA Directives 1085 and
1085.1, which prohibit the use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and any
other combustion or heating of tobacco, and the use of any elec-
tronic nicotine delivery system, including electronic or e-cigarettes,
vape pens, and e-cigars by any person on the premises of any VA
facility.

55
Water Management Policies.—Given the concern related to levels
of water use in hospitals and hospital laboratories, especially when
dealing with water scarcity in States with constrained resources,
VA is urged to consider water efficiency and zero water systems
when feasible. The Department is further urged to consider imple-
menting laboratory systems utilizing dry chemistry solutions which
have little to no impact on the water supply in the communities
where they reside.
Veteran Access to DoD Bases.—The Committee notes that Con-
gress greatly expanded base access to a range of veterans and their
caregivers, including Medal of Honor and Purple Heart recipients.
However, this expansion of base access is limited and not all vet-
erans, survivors, and caregivers may access DoD facilities. Within
180 days, the Committee directs the Department to provide esti-
mates of the total number of veterans, survivors and caregivers
and to report on the issues and challenges presented by expanding
the Department’s issuance of the Veteran Health Identification
Card that the DoD accepts for base access.
VA Non-Recurring Maintenance.—The Committee is concerned
that repeated maintenance issues related to air conditioning out-
ages and poor facility conditions can lead to interruption in vet-
erans’ care. The Department should make every effort to pursue
timely, and permanent solutions to facility maintenance issues to
avoid disruption to care. Further, the Committee directs VA to as-
sess its facilities where there have been repeated instances of poor
facility or maintenance conditions with relation to air conditioning
or failures over the past 5 years and analyze the timelines in which
such maintenance issues were fixed, and whether any additional
issues arose following the maintenance fixes. Additionally, VA shall
examine the data processes utilized to determine if the systems
were adequately fixed and assess whether such processes could be
improved. VA should focus this assessment on facilities that have
had a high proportion of new veteran patients in recent years, to
assess the impact of changing veteran demographics on VA infra-
structure.
PACT Act Implementation.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of VA authority to enter into long-term leases through the
authorities established by section 704 of the PACT Act. These
leases provide VA with the ability to expand access and provide
critical facility updates to continue providing the best possible care
to veterans. The Committee strongly encourages the VA to continue
implementation of Section 704 of the PACT Act.
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $943,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 943,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Medical and Prosthetic Research account provides funds for
medical, rehabilitative, and health services research. Medical re-
search supports basic and clinical studies that advance knowledge
leading to improvements in the prevention, diagnosis, and treat-
ment of diseases and disabilities. Rehabilitation research focuses
on rehabilitation engineering problems in the fields of prosthetics,

56
orthotics, adaptive equipment for vehicles, sensory aids, and re-
lated areas. Health services research focuses on improving the ef-
fectiveness and economy of the delivery of health services.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $943,000,000 for the Medical and
Prosthetic Research account. In addiction, VA estimates to use
$57,000,000 from the Toxic Exposures Fund to support medical re-
search in fiscal year 2026, for a total of $1,000,000,000.
The Committee remains highly supportive of this program, and
recognizes its importance both in improving healthcare services to
veterans and recruiting and retaining high quality medical profes-
sionals in the Veterans Health Administration. The Department’s
efforts to help veterans, and the general population, fight against
chronic illnesses, addiction, mental health disorders, limb loss, and
more, are commended. The Department is directed to provide to
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a re-
port by June 1, 2026 which shall include a comprehensive list of
clinical trials paused or terminated between October 1, 2025 and
May 15, 2026, including justification for each action; the number
of research personnel whose employment contracts were not re-
newed or had their term limits shortened during the same period;
how many veterans have had their entry into VA clinical trials can-
celled or delayed since January 1, 2025; and a detailed explanation
of steps taken to ensure continuity of critical research operations.
Reducing Opioid Use Through Medical Marijuana.—The Com-
mittee encourages VA to conduct a study on the relationship be-
tween treatment programs involving medical marijuana that are
approved by States, the access of veterans to such programs, and
a reduction in opioid use and abuse among veterans, as data is
available to do so. Findings should be provided to the Committee
on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress within 1 year of en-
actment of this act.
Women Veterans Health Research.—The Committee encourages
VA to advance and expand the inclusion of women veterans in clin-
ical research conducted by the Department by utilizing the provi-
sions outlined in Public Law 100–322 related to discovery and data
collaboration between VA and its partnering entities.
Aviator Cancers Examination Study.—The Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to coordinate with the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study on the
prevalence and mortality of cancer among individuals who served
as active-duty aircrew of fixed-wing aircraft in the U.S. Armed
Forces. The study should leverage findings in existing literature, to
include the Air Force and Department of Defense studies. The Sec-
retary should report on any findings of this study within 3 months
of its completion to the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress.
Million Veterans Program.—The Committee supports the con-
tinuation of this program and includes VA’s estimated level for this
effort, including for genomic sequencing of biological samples, for
fiscal year 2026.

erans Affairs to deposit first-party and pharmacy co-payments;
third-party insurance payments and enhanced-use collections; long-
term care co-payments; Compensated Work Therapy Program col-
lections; and Parking Program fees into the MCCF. The Secretary
of Veterans Affairs has the authority to transfer funds from the
MCCF to the Medical Services and Medical Community Care ac-
counts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes the authority to retain
co-payments and third-party collections, estimated to total
$4,279,000,000 in fiscal year 2026.
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $480,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 497,000,000
ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW
The National Cemetery Administration [NCA] was established in
accordance with the National Cemeteries Act of 1973 (Public Law
93–43). It has a four-fold mission: to provide for the interment in
any national cemetery of the remains of eligible deceased
servicemembers and discharged veterans, together with their
spouses and certain dependents, and permanently maintain their
graves; to provide headstones for, and to mark graves of, eligible
persons in national, State, and private cemeteries; to administer
the grant program for aid to States in establishing, expanding, or
improving State veterans cemeteries; and to administer the Presi-
dential Memorial Certificate Program.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $497,000,000 for the National Cem-
etery Administration.
The Committee has included bill language to make available
through September 30, 2027, up to 10 percent of the National Cem-
etery Administration appropriation.
National Cemetery Administration Access.—The Committee di-
rects VA to work in collaboration with DoD to allow veterans and
their families to gain access at cemeteries that are located on DoD

58
installations. Access should be granted in a way that maintains se-
curity, while allowing appropriate access for grieving families, in-
cluding those without military identification.
Rural Initiative Cemetery Infrastructure.—The Committee sup-
ports the National Cemetery Administration’s efforts to construct
additional infrastructure at its Rural Initiative national cemeteries.
The Committee encourages the Department to continue working
with State and local entities, including non-profit organizations, in-
terested in constructing and donating VA-approved facilities to
meet the location-specific needs of veterans, visitors, and volun-
teers. Furthermore, the Committee is aware of state legislature ef-
forts to help fund the construction of Rural Initiative national cem-
etery facilities and urges the Department to provide similar invest-
ment.
Identifying Unidentified Remains of Veterans Interred at the Na-
tional Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific [NMCP].—For eight dec-
ades, unidentified remains of veterans have been interred at the
NMCP. Efforts to identify these remains have been ongoing, includ-
ing the collection of DNA family reference samples. Today, ad-
vancements in forensic genetic genealogy [FGG] analysis enable
the identification of previously unidentified human remains, even
those dating back centuries. As such, the Committee encourages
the Department to consider partnering with private entities uti-
lizing FGG technology to identify the remains of fallen soldiers bur-
ied at NMCP.
Synthetic Flags.—The Department is encouraged to publish infor-
mation to all VA cemeteries and state veterans cemeteries about
non-synthetic flag materials that cemeteries can use in lieu of syn-
thetic materials; and flag disposal methods for synthetic material
flags, other than incineration or burial, that are less likely to cause
airborne toxic exposure or ground or water contamination.
DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $10,644,861,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 12,743,000,000
ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW
Departmental Administration provides for the administration of
veterans benefits through VBA, the executive direction of the De-
partment, several top level supporting offices, and the Board of
Veterans Appeals.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $12,743,000,000 for Departmental
Administration. The amount is composed of $440,000,000 for Gen-
eral Administration; $277,000,000 for the Board of Veterans Ap-
peals; $5,908,000,000 for Information Technology Systems;
$3,488,000,000 for the Veterans Electronic Health Record;
$296,000,000 for the Office of Inspector General; $1,394,000,000 for
Construction, Major Projects; $709,000,000 for Construction, Minor
Projects; $171,000,000 for Grants for Construction of State Ex-
tended Care Facilities; and $60,000,000 for Grants for the Con-
struction of State Veterans Cemeteries.

59
In addition, funds are available from the Recurring Expenses
Transformational Fund [Transformational Fund]. Established in
the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–113),
the Transformational Fund consists of unobligated balances of ex-
pired discretionary appropriations, following the fifth fiscal year
after the last fiscal year funds were originally available. These
funds shall be available until expended for facilities infrastructure
improvements, including nonrecurring maintenance, at existing VA
hospitals and clinics, and for information technology systems im-
provements and sustainment. For fiscal year 2026, VA proposed to
allocate $900,000,000 of the anticipated Transformational Fund
balance for major construction projects.

1The Office of Acquisition, Logistics & Construction and the Veterans Experience Office are funded solely with reimbursable authority.
Unobligated Balances of Expired Discretionary Funds.—The
Committee directs the Secretary to submit to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress quarterly reports detail-
ing all unobligated balances of expired discretionary funds by fiscal
year.
Access to High-Quality Affordable Childcare for Federal Employ-
ees.—The Committee applauds the Department for increasing the
childcare subsidy for employees through the VA Childcare Subsidy
Program [CCSP], but is concerned that the subsidy the Department

60
is providing employees may not have kept pace with the rising
costs of childcare. Within 180 days of enactment, the Committee di-
rects the Department to provide a report to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress on the number of employ-
ees using the subsidy in each tier of the CCSP, the percentage of
childcare costs the CCSP covers for those employees that opt to use
the program, a breakdown of the percentage of the funds spent on
CCSP for center-based care, home care, and before/after care re-
spectively, how many eligible employees forgo the subsidy and how
the maximum monthly subsidy compares to the average cost of
childcare in high cost and rural markets.
Executive Order Activities.—The Department is directed to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses
of Congress within 90 days of enactment of this act, related to Ex-
ecutive Orders [EO] 14168 and 14151. The briefing should include:
budget for the activity, personnel involved, agency actions taken re-
lated to each EO including staffing and programs terminated, the
cost of those actions and specific information about how any cost
savings have been re-allocated within the Department.
Protection of Religious Freedoms.—The Committee affirms the
importance of safeguarding the religious freedom of all veterans
and VA employees, including the right to express and practice their
faith. The Department must ensure all policies related to religious
expression are applied in a viewpoint-neutral manner and do not
single out any specific faith tradition for special restriction or scru-
tiny. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department is
directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress a briefing related to VA’s new Anti-Christian
Bias Task Force, including staffing, budget, and actions taken.
Staffing.—The Department is directed to ensure staffing levels
facilitate the Department’s own goals, including that benefits
claims are adjudicated according to the 125 day goal, and that
healthcare appointments and service are provided in the time-
frames required by statute and regulation. The Department is fur-
ther directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress with data regarding former employees of the
Department who have left in calendar year 2025, delineated by po-
sition, departure circumstances, and whether or not that position
was backfilled by an employee performing those same duties.
Office of Congressional & Legislative Affairs.—The Committee
notes the increase in time the Department, through the Office of
Congressional & Legislative Affairs, has taken in fulfilling the
casework and other requests submitted by Congressional offices, in-
cluding its Oversight Committees. The Committee directs the Of-
fice of Congressional & Legislative Affairs to provide a briefing to
the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, no
later than 60 days after enactment of this act, on the target goals
for responding to inquiries from Congress, including casework re-
quests, and the approval process for such requests.
Communications with Congress.—The Department is reminded of
Section 713 in Division B of P.L 118–47, prohibiting the use of Fed-
eral funds to prevent Federal employees from communicating with
Congress.

61
Budget Office Liaison Support to the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee.—The Department is directed to maintain a budget and ap-
propriations liaison office within the Office of Management, sepa-
rate and apart from the Office of Congressional and Legislative Af-
fairs. Funding has been reallocated among the General Administra-
tion Offices to reflect the return to standard process. The Appro-
priations Subcommittees rely heavily on this office to conduct its
oversight responsibilities and make funding recommendations for
the Department. The Committee notes that while the separate of-
fice of Congressional and Legislative affairs offer assistance to the
authorizing committees and Member Offices of the Congress, such
assistance is provided on a parallel and separate track from the as-
sistance provided to this Committee and its members by the budget
or appropriations liaison office. As the offices of legislative affairs
do not possess the expertise and direct relationship to the Financial
Management and Budget organizations, which are essential to the
effective communication between the Department and the Commit-
tees on Appropriations, it is critical that the budget or appropria-
tions liaison offices remain independent from the legislative liaison
offices, and retain the authority to respond directly and promptly
with the information required by the Committee and its members.
Financial Management.— The Department is reminded that
there is no inherent transfer ability within accounts, other than
that which is granted by Congress on an annual basis in appropria-
tions legislation. In order to retain these transfer provisions and
maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with the Committee,
the Department is directed to comply with all statutory require-
ments related to financial management, as consistent with long-
standing bipartisan tradition.
BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $287,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 277,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
As set forth in section 7101(a) of title 38 United States Code, the
Board of Veterans Appeals [BVA] is responsible for making final
decisions on claims for veterans benefits presented to the Board for
appellate review. The vast majority of the Board’s workload derives
from benefit claims initiated by the Veterans Benefits Administra-
tion’s Regional Offices. The appellate process has multiple steps,
most of which occur at the local Regional Office level. If a veteran
is not satisfied with the Regional Office determination, he or she
may appeal to the Board for a final agency decision. The Board ad-
judicates appeals covering all areas of veterans benefits, including
service connection, increased disability ratings, total disability rat-
ings, pensions, insurance benefits, educational benefits, home loan
guaranties, vocational rehabilitation, waivers of indebtedness, fee
basis medical care, and dependency and indemnity compensation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $277,000,000 for the Board of Vet-
erans Appeals. The Committee has included bill language to make

62
available through September 30, 2027, up to 10 percent of BVA’s
appropriation.
Appeals Backlog.—The Committee is concerned with the large
backlog of cases at the Board of Veterans Appeals. The Department
is directed to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations
of both Houses of Congress no later than 90 days after enactment
of this act about its plans to eliminate the backlog.
Staffing.—The Committee supports the Board of Veterans Ap-
peals’ goal to process an increased number of appeals in fiscal year
2026. To accomplish this goal, the Committee encourages the Board
to use all resources available to hire additional staff and judges to
keep pace with the expected increased workload of appeals from
toxic-exposed veterans.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,401,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 5,908,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Information Technology [IT] Systems appropriation, along
with reimbursements, funds the costs of all IT staff salaries and
expenses, the operations and maintenance of all existing informa-
tion technology systems, and the development of new projects and
programs designed to improve the delivery of service to veterans.
This appropriation also funds the costs associated with the Office
of Information and Technology which oversees the functions high-
lighted above.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $5,908,000,000 for the Information
Technology Systems account. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $1,418,416,000 for staff salaries and expenses,
$4,488,829,000 for operation and maintenance of existing pro-
grams, including $118,900,000 for activations, and $755,000 for
program development. In addition, VA estimates to use
$1,385,000,000 from the Toxic Exposures Fund to support the infor-
mation technology systems activities related to toxic exposures in
fiscal year 2026.
The Committee has appropriated the Information Technology
Systems account as three subaccounts. This funding structure en-
hances the Committee’s ability to ensure funds are executed in a
manner consistent with the Department’s budget submission. The
Committee has provided sufficient flexibility within the sub-
accounts by way of authorized carryover amounts and reprogram-
ming authority to give the Office of Information Technology as
much flexibility as possible to accomplish its mission and goals,
while ensuring proper accountability and oversight.
Artificial Intelligence [AI] Digital Service Improvements.—The
Department is encouraged to utilize AI to improve digital service
and user experience at the Department of Veterans Affairs. To that
end, the Department is directed to provide a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later than
180 days after enactment of this act, on the areas in which the De-
partment identifies positive use cases for AI integrations in ways

63
that enhance the existing VA mission, workforce, and digital serv-
ice offerings. Specifically, the report should assess whether the De-
partment would benefit from the establishment of an AI Governing
Council. Additionally, the report should make recommendations re-
lated to leveraging commercially-available technology to improve
customer-facing applications and websites, including benefits appli-
cations and interfaces; hiring; and onboarding processes. The report
should further recommend effective and responsible AI governance
practices that uphold high standards for data privacy and cyberse-
curity; support the training and upskilling of VA employees while
retaining talent and, as appropriate, legacy customer service offer-
ings; employ best practices for website accessibility; and employ
best practices for effective government website rollouts in the de-
velopment and deployment of any AI tools. The report should also
include ways to reduce the administrative burden of clinicians and
administrative staff, and to improve interfaces which reduce the
difficulty of scheduling appointments, receiving reimbursement of
covered veteran expenses, the billing of services, and other efforts
that serve veterans.
IT Infrastructure Readiness Program.—VA must avoid the poten-
tial ‘‘catastrophic failure’’ of systems that rely upon legacy network
infrastructure that is approaching end-of-life in order to continue
to reliably deliver care and benefits to our Nation’s veterans. To
avoid such failure, the Department should consider making invest-
ments in capabilities to access, aggregate, and optimize critical net-
work traffic to feed cybersecurity and performance tools.
Identity Governance.—The Committee recognizes that digital
identity is the primary pillar of zero trust cybersecurity architec-
ture. The Committee encourages VA to consider an Identity Gov-
ernance and Administration solution for the Department. The De-
partment shall provide a report within 90 days of enactment of this
act on the advisability, feasibility, and cost of such a solution.
Data Privacy.—The Department is directed to ensure strict com-
pliance with all privacy laws and to prohibit access to any data sys-
tems of the Department containing veteran or employee informa-
tion, except by employees whose job to provide care or benefits to
veterans requires such access, and such access is limited to the in-
formation necessary to provide such care or benefits.
VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,321,642,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 3,488,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Veterans Electronic Health Record [EHR] account funds all
activities related to the acquisition, implementation, preparation,
development, interface, management, rollout, and maintenance of a
new EHR. The EHR solution and implementation will include pro-
gram management; an enterprise-wide EHR system; change man-
agement; training; testing; deployment services; sustainment; and
other solutions encompassing the entire range of EHR require-
ments.

64
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $3,488,000,000 for the Veterans
EHR, equal to the budget request. The Committee remains sup-
portive of replacing VA’s current EHR with the same system ac-
quired by DoD, and supports the Department’s current effort to re-
sume the initiative and schedule new deployments as soon as is
safe.
Given the schedules and costs associated with any acquisition of
this size and magnitude, it is important for the Department to pro-
vide regular implementation updates. Therefore, the bill continues
the strict quarterly reporting requirements of obligations, expendi-
tures, and any upcoming deployment schedule by facility. The De-
partment is directed to continue quarterly briefings to review
timelines, performance milestones, costs, implementation, and
change management progress. In addition, the Committee includes
a statutory proviso that makes 25 percent of funding contingent
upon the Secretary providing: an updated life-cycle cost for the pro-
gram, a facility-by-facility deployment schedule, certification on
healthcare performance baseline metrics for facilities where the
EHR has already been deployed, and projected staffing levels nec-
essary to support the schedule proposed.
The Committee continues to direct GAO to perform quarterly
performance reviews of the VA EHR deployment to keep the Com-
mittees on Appropriations and Veteran’s Affairs of both Houses of
Congress apprised of VA’s progress.
EHRM–IO Communication.—The Committee recognizes the mod-
ernization of VA’s EHR system is central to improving care deliv-
ery, interoperability with the Department of Defense, and the over-
all efficiency of health services for veterans, despite continuing to
face challenges with the implementation. To improve this process,
the Committee encourages the Department to increase the involve-
ment of the Office of Information and Technology [OIT] in the over-
sight process of the EHRM system, and to increase communications
between OIT and VA facilities that are operating EHRM. The De-
partment is directed to provide to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of both Houses of Congress, no later than 180 days after the
enactment of this act, a report outlining what steps OIT is taking
to increase oversight of the Department’s EHR’s implementation
and increase its communication with VA sites that currently have
the new EHR.
Medical Image Exchange.—The Committee understands that
there are VA facilities that have deployed a modern software plat-
form that supports bi-directional exchange of medical images, diag-
nostic reports, and other clinical data between VA facilities, com-
munity providers, and Federal partners. VA is encouraged to ex-
pand this software’s connections to Indian and Tribal health clinics
and work with DoD to expedite connections with military treat-
ment facilities. Further, VA should consider making this software
platform available in the new Electronic Health Record system, the
VA Enterprise Cloud and the anticipated national Enterprise Imag-
ing initiative to build on the care quality, efficiency and produc-
tivity gains.

65
VistA as a Service.—As VA continues transitioning from the leg-
acy Electronic Health Record [EHR] System to the new EHR, it
must continue to sustain, maintain, and evolve its existing VistA
infrastructure. The Committee believes VA can improve efficiency
by leveraging a system integration model similar to that used by
DoD in its EHR modernization program.
As such, the Committee directs the Department to assess the fea-
sibility of adopting and implementing a ‘‘VistA as a Service’’ model
for the maintenance and sustainment of its legacy EHR system and
to provide the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of
Congress a report detailing its findings within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $296,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 296,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Inspector General [OIG] was established by the In-
spector General Act of 1978 and is responsible for the audit, inves-
tigation, and inspection of all Department of Veterans Affairs pro-
grams and operations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $296,000,000 for OIG. The Com-
mittee has included bill language to make available through Sep-
tember 30, 2027, up to 10 percent of the OIG appropriation. The
Committee continues to support OIG work related to implementa-
tion of PACT Act (Public Law 117–168).
OIG continues to sustain an extremely high performance level,
and the Committee continues to support OIG’s essential oversight
of VA’s programs and operations, and maintains a provision to sup-
port timely access to any records, documents, or other materials
available to the Department. Similarly, the Committee believes
that a non-partisan, objective Inspector General is a crucial part of
oversight and must undertake non-partisan activities. The Com-
mittee strongly encourages OIG to undertake and complete inves-
tigations in a timely manner, including sharing information with
the Department, the Department of Justice, or other entities as ap-
propriate.
CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $961,219,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 1,394,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Construction, Major Projects account provides funds for con-
structing, altering, extending, and improving any of the facilities
(including parking projects) under the jurisdiction or for the use of
VA, including planning, architectural and engineering services,
needs assessment, and site acquisition where the estimated cost of
a project is more than the amount set forth in 38 U.S.C.
8104(a)(3)(A). Proceeds realized from enhanced use lease activities

66
may be deposited into the Construction, Major Projects and Con-
struction, Minor Projects accounts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,394,000,000
for the construction of major projects. In addition, the Committee
supports the Department’s allocation of $900,000,000 from the
Transformational Fund to support the construction of major
projects bringing the Department’s total resources for Major Con-
struction to $2,294,000,000. The Committee notes Executive Order
14296, particularly the language on a full-service medical center in
New Hampshire. The Department is directed to submit both a fea-
sibility study and resulting action plan to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of both Houses of Congress within 1 year of enactment
of this act.
The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for
major construction projects.

Parking Assessment for the Spark M. Matsunaga Veterans Affairs
Medical Center.—The Tripler Army Medical Center [TAMC] and
the adjacent Spark M. Matsunaga VA Medical Center in Hawaii is
lacking 2,200 parking stalls. To assess if the new Daniel K. Akaka
VA Clinic provided any relief to TAMC’s parking shortfall, the VA
Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction, in coordination
with the Department of the Army, is directed to submit a report
to the Committee not later than 90 days after enactment of this act
detailing: (1) the current parking requirements and shortfalls at

67
TAMC and (2) the estimated cost of constructing a new parking fa-
cility at TAMC based on any parking shortfall.
Vulnerable Infrastructure.—The Committee continues to encour-
age the Department to evaluate its infrastructure and construction
needs taking into account the stress that recent historic weather
trends have placed on aging or inadequate buildings and infra-
structure. The Committee looks forward to receiving a report as re-
quested in S. Rept. 118–43 on extreme weather preparation.
CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $692,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 709,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Construction, Minor Projects account provides for con-
structing, altering, extending, and improving any of the facilities
(including parking) under the jurisdiction or for the use of VA, in-
cluding planning, assessment of needs, architectural and engineer-
ing services, and site acquisition, where the estimated cost of a
project is equal to or less than $30,000,000. The Veterans Millen-
nium Health Care and Benefits Act (Public Law 106–117) gave VA
authority to make capital contributions from minor construction in
enhanced-use leases. Proceeds realized from enhanced-use lease ac-
tivities may be deposited into the Construction, Major Projects and
Construction, Minor Projects accounts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $709,000,000 for minor construc-
tion.
The Department is directed to provide an expenditure plan to the
Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later

priated for minor construction.
Permanent Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Unit.—The
Committee recognizes the importance of long-term residential reha-
bilitation treatment unit beds for veterans suffering from substance
use disorders, particularly in rural areas. The Department is en-

GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $171,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 171,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account is used to provide grants to assist States in acquir-
ing or constructing State home facilities for furnishing domiciliary
or nursing home care to veterans, and to expand, remodel, or alter
existing buildings for furnishing domiciliary, nursing home, or hos-
pital care to veterans in State homes. The grant may not exceed
65 percent of the total cost of the project. Public Law 102–585
granted permanent authority for this program, and Public Law
106–117 provided greater specificity in directing VA to prescribe
regulations for the number of beds for which grant assistance may

68
be furnished. This program has been a successful partnership be-
tween States and VA in meeting the long-term care needs of elder-
ly veterans for decades.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $171,000,000 for Grants for Con-
struction of State Extended Care Facilities.
Grant Eligibility.—The Secretary is urged to consider additional
factors when reviewing and prioritizing grant applications, includ-
ing whether a State has only one State Extended Care facility, the
geographic diversity among grant recipients, whether a facility has
an industry-standard Facility Condition Index maximum rating of
poor, and whether veterans would have access to other providers
who can appropriately meet their needs.
State Home Construction.—The Department is directed to
prioritize construction of State Veterans Home projects according to
statute and regulation. Any regulatory changes in prioritization
must be provided to the Committee in advance.
Infection Prevention.—The Committee understands there are
state-proposed projects that will improve infection prevention and
control capabilities at state run veterans homes, which will also in-
crease the number of single-occupancy rooms. Therefore, the De-
partment is encouraged to consider investing in projects in high
density regions that propose such improvements to facilities.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF VETERANS CEMETERIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $60,000,000
Committee recommendation, 2026 ....................................................... 60,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Public Law 105–368 amended title 38 U.S.C. 2408 and estab-
lished authority to provide aid to States for establishment, expan-
sion, and improvement of State veterans cemeteries, which are op-
erated and permanently maintained by the States. This statutory
change increased the maximum Federal share from 50 percent to
100 percent in order to fund construction costs and initial equip-
ment expenses when the cemetery is established. States remain re-
sponsible for providing the land and for paying all costs related to
operation and maintenance of the cemeteries, including the costs
for subsequent equipment purchases.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $60,000,000 for Grants for Con-
struction of State Veterans Cemeteries.

to providing veterans and their families the benefits and care asso-
ciated with eligibility expansion included in the Honoring Our

Exposures Fund for investment in the delivery of veterans
healthcare associated with exposure to environmental hazards in
service, expenses incident to the delivery of veterans healthcare
and benefits associated with exposure to environmental hazards in
service, and medical and other research related to exposures to en-
vironmental hazards in service.
The Committee includes a provision requiring quarterly report-
ing on the status of the Toxic Exposures Fund. Further, the Com-
mittee continues to expect a consolidated section in budget requests
outlining the proposed spending from the Toxic Exposures Fund,
consistent with requirements in Public Law 117–168.
Kosovo Veterans Toxic Exposures.—As the Department undergoes
rulemaking for Public Law 117–168, the Department should con-
sider adding Kosovo to the list of covered countries for the purposes
of determining presumptive eligibility, specifically service in the
NATO Kosovo Force [KFOR] since June 1999, as ‘‘covered service.’’

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money.
As defined in Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the
term ‘‘congressionally directed spending item’’ means a provision or
report language included primarily at the request of a Senator, pro-
viding, authorizing, or recommending a specific amount of discre-
tionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending au-
thority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority,
or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific
State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statu-
tory or administrative, formula-driven, or competitive award proc-
ess.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests).
Following is a list of congressionally directed spending items in-
cluded in the Senate recommendation discussed in this report,
along with the name of each Senator who submitted a request to
the Committee of jurisdiction for each item so identified. Neither
the Committee recommendation nor this report contains any lim-
ited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.
