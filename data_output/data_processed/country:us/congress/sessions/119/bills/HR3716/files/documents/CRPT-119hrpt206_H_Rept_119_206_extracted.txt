PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3716, the Systemic Risk Authority Transparency Act, was
introduced on June 4, 2025, by Representative Al Green (TX–09).
H.R. 3716 requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
and appropriate Federal banking regulators to issue timely public
reports when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in-
vokes the systemic risk exception under section 13(c)(4)(G) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. These reports must include a de-
tailed analysis of the causes of the bank failure, regulatory and su-
pervisory actions taken, and any shortcomings in management
oversight or regulatory response.

BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Introduced in response to the spring 2023 bank failures, the bill
formalizes a dual-reporting process that occurred after the col-
lapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. H.R. 3716
requires both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and ap-
propriate Federal banking regulators to issue reports when the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) invokes the sys-
temic risk exception.
In drafting an earlier iteration of H.R. 3716, Committee Demo-
crats addressed concerns raised by Republicans that GAO’s inde-
pendent findings should be prioritized ahead of regulatory agency
reports to avoid the appearance of biased narratives. This concern
stemmed from perceptions that the Federal Reserve’s post-SVB re-
view lacked sufficient objectivity. The bill enhances transparency
and accountability by ensuring that both independent and regu-
latory perspectives are provided in a timely and structured man-
ner. This legislation also accommodates reasonable extensions to
reporting deadlines and includes confidentiality protections to safe-
guard sensitive supervisory and proprietary information, ensuring
that public transparency does not compromise financial stability or
regulatory integrity.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
119TH CONGRESS
On June 4, 2025, Representative Green introduced H.R. 3716,
the Systemic Risk Authority Transparency Act. The bill was re-
ferred solely to the Committee on Financial Services. The bill was

Future: Reviewing Data Privacy in Today’s Financial System.’’
On June 10, 2025, the Committee on Financial Services met in

sponsors. The bill is an earlier iteration of H.R. 3716. The bill was
referred solely to the Committee on Financial Services. On April
17, 2024, the Committee on Financial Services ordered H.R. 4116
to be favorably reported to the House of Representatives by a re-
corded vote of 50 yeas and 0 nays.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3716 is to enhance trans-
parency and accountability by requiring timely, public reports on
the use of the systemic risk exception authority.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3716. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 6:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 7:
Section 1. Short title

Section 8:
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Systemic Risk Authority
Transparency Act.’’

Section 9:
Section 2. Bank failure transparency related to systemic risk excep-
tion.

Section 10:
Section 2 outlines new requirements for public reporting and ac-
countability when the systemic risk exception is used. It directs the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit two inde-
pendent reports to Congress—one within 60 days and another
within 180 days—following such a determination. These reports
must include an evaluation of the basis for the systemic risk deter-
mination, the impact on depositor and institutional behavior, any
mismanagement at the failed bank, and potential regulatory or su-
pervisory failures. The GAO must also assess the actions of rel-
evant financial regulators and other contributing factors, such as
auditors, credit rating agencies, and emergency lending sources.
This section also requires the appropriate Federal banking agen-
cy (such as the FDIC, OCC, or Federal Reserve) to submit two sep-
arate reports—within 90 and 210 days of the systemic risk deter-
mination. These reports must include redacted supervisory docu-
ments from the prior three years, analysis of executive and board
mismanagement, identification of agency oversight failures, and
recommendations to strengthen regulatory practices. Agencies are
required to make these materials public to the greatest extent pos-
sible, with procedures for withholding sensitive content in consulta-
tion with Congressional committee leadership. Extensions of up to
60 days are permitted in cases of systemic risk, and agencies may
consolidate reports if statutory deadlines are met. Finally, the bill
affirms that none of the reporting requirements affect the enforce-
ment authority of any federal agency.

(A) if such action is taken to prevent the default of such in-
sured depository institution;
(B) if, with respect to an insured bank in default, such action
is taken to restore such insured bank to normal operation; or
(C) if, when severe financial conditions exist which threaten
the stability of a significant number of insured depository insti-
tutions or of insured depository institutions possessing signifi-
cant financial resources, such action is taken in order to lessen
the risk to the Corporation posed by such insured depository
institution under such threat of instability.

posed by such insured depository institution under such threat
of instability.
(C) Any action to which the Corporation is or becomes a
party by acquiring any asset or exercising any other authority
set forth in this section shall be stayed for a period of 60 days

poration and obligations incurred by the Corporation
(including any immediate and long-term obligation of

institution’s insured depositors at the least possible cost to
the Deposit Insurance Fund, the Corporation shall comply
with the following provisions:
(i) PRESENT-VALUE ANALYSIS; DOCUMENTATION RE-
QUIRED.—The Corporation shall—
(I) evaluate alternatives on a present-value
basis, using a realistic discount rate;
(II) document that evaluation and the assump-
tions on which the evaluation is based, including
any assumptions with regard to interest rates,
asset recovery rates, asset holding costs, and pay-
ment of contingent liabilities; and
(III) retain the documentation for not less than
5 years.

that the Government would forego as the result of a
proposed transaction, to the extent reasonably ascer-
tainable, shall be treated as if they were revenues
foregone by the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(i) GENERAL RULE.—For purposes of this subsection,
the determination of the costs of providing any assist-
ance under paragraph (1) or (2) or any other provision

poration makes the determination to provide such as-
sistance to the institution under this section.
(ii) RULE FOR LIQUIDATIONS.—For purposes of this
subsection, the determination of the costs of liquida-
tion of any depository institution shall be made as of
the earliest of—
(I) the date on which a conservator is appointed
for such institution;
(II) the date on which a receiver is appointed for
such institution; or
(III) the date on which the Corporation makes
any determination to provide any assistance
under this section with respect to such institution.
(D) LIQUIDATION COSTS.—In determining the cost of liq-
uidating any depository institution for the purpose of com-
paring the costs under subparagraph (A) (with respect to
such institution), the amount of such cost may not exceed

posits of such institution as of the earliest of the dates de-

PURPOSE ONLY.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—After December 31, 1994, or at
such earlier time as the Corporation determines to be
appropriate, the Corporation may not take any action,
directly or indirectly, with respect to any insured de-
pository institution that would have the effect of in-
creasing losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund by pro-

such institution is liquidated); or
(II) creditors other than depositors.
(ii) DEADLINE FOR REGULATIONS.—The Corporation

provision of this subparagraph shall be construed as
prohibiting the Corporation from allowing any person
who acquires any assets or assumes any liabilities of
any insured depository institution for which the Cor-
poration has been appointed conservator or receiver to
acquire uninsured deposit liabilities of such institution
so long as the insurance fund does not incur any loss
with respect to such deposit liabilities in an amount
greater than the loss which would have been incurred
with respect to such liabilities if the institution had
been liquidated.
(F) DISCRETIONARY DETERMINATIONS.—Any determina-
tion which the Corporation may make under this para-
graph shall be made in the sole discretion of the Corpora-
tion.

Board of Directors (upon a vote of not less than two-
thirds of the members of the Board of Directors) and
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the mem-
bers of such Board), the Secretary of the Treasury (in
consultation with the President) determines that—
(I) the Corporation’s compliance with subpara-
graphs (A) and (E) with respect to an insured de-
pository institution for which the Corporation has
been appointed receiver would have serious ad-
verse effects on economic conditions or financial
stability; and

(II) any action or assistance under this subpara-
graph would avoid or mitigate such adverse ef-

Corporation has been appointed receiver as necessary
to avoid or mitigate such effects.

(I) IN GENERAL.—The Corporation shall recover
the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising
from any action taken or assistance provided with
respect to an insured depository institution under

the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to hold-
ing companies), or both, as the Corporation deter-
mines to be appropriate.
(II) TREATMENT OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION
HOLDING COMPANIES.—For purposes of this clause,

Section 12:
sections 7(c)(2) and 18(h) shall apply to depository
institution holding companies as if they were in-
sured depository institutions.
(III) REGULATIONS.—The Corporation shall pre-
scribe such regulations as it deems necessary to
implement this clause. In prescribing such regula-
tions, defining terms, and setting the appropriate
assessment rate or rates, the Corporation shall es-
tablish rates sufficient to cover the losses incurred
as a result of the actions of the Corporation under
clause (i) and shall consider: the types of entities
that benefit from any action taken or assistance
provided under this subparagraph; economic con-
ditions, the effects on the industry, and such other

relevant to the action taken or the assistance pro-
vided. Any funds so collected that exceed actual
losses shall be placed in the Deposit Insurance
Fund.

the Treasury shall—
(I) document any determination under clause (i);

(5) The Corporation may not use its authority under this sub-

Section 13:

or of the interest or dividends paid on such deposits.
(B) When such insured depository institution no longer has any

lished by the Corporation, after consultation with the applicable
State and local taxing authorities.

ceiver for such institution only under the following cir-
cumstances:

determines—
(I) grounds for the appointment of a conservator
or receiver exist or likely will exist in the future

meets the following criteria:
(I) The appropriate Federal banking agency and

to offer to acquire or acquire,
(B) prohibits any person from offering to acquire or ac-
quiring, or
(C) prohibits any person from using any previously dis-
closed information in connection with any such offer to ac-
quire or acquisition of,
all or part of any insured depository institution, including any
liabilities, assets, or interest therein, in connection with any
transaction in which the Corporation exercises its authority
under section 11 or 13, shall be enforceable against or impose
any liability on such person, as such enforcement or liability
shall be contrary to public policy.

cy of an insured depository institution about which a deter-
mination is made under paragraph (4)(G)(i) shall, not later

formation under section 552 of title 5, United
States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Freedom of

thority of paragraph (2) or (3), the Corporation may solicit such of-
fers or proposals as are practicable from any prospective pur-
chasers or merger partners it determines, in its sole discretion, are
both qualified and capable of acquiring the assets and liabilities of
the bank in default or the bank in danger of default.
(6)(A) If, after receiving offers, the offer presenting the lowest ex-
pense to the Corporation, that is in a form and with conditions ac-
ceptable to the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘lowest
acceptable offer’’), is from an offeror that is not an existing in-State
bank of the same type as the bank that is in default or is in danger
of default (or, where the bank is an insured bank other than a mu-
tual savings bank, the lowest acceptable offer is not from an in-
State holding company), the Corporation shall permit the offeror
which made the initial lowest acceptable offer and each offeror who
made an offer the estimated cost of which to the Corporation was
within 15 per centum or $15,000,000, whichever is less, of the ini-
tial lowest acceptable offer to submit a new offer.
(B) In considering authorizations under this subsection, the Cor-
poration shall give consideration to the need to minimize the cost
of financial assistance and to the maintenance of specialized depos-
itory institutions. The Corporation shall authorize transactions
under this subsection considering the following priorities:
(i) First, between depository institutions of the same type
within the same State.
(ii) Second, between depository institutions of the same
type—
(I) in different States which by statute specifically au-
thorize such acquisitions; or

furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or
to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part
of the United States;
(B) whose effect in any section of the country may be sub-
stantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monop-
oly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of
trade, unless the Corporation finds that the anticompetitive ef-
fects of the proposed transactions are clearly outweighed in the
public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in
meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be
served; or
(C) if in the opinion of the Corporation the acquisition
threatens the safety and soundness of the acquirer or does not
result in the future viability of the resulting depository institu-
tion.

ing company’’ means an existing insured depository institution

suant to subsection (c) before grounds exist for appoint-
ment of a conservator or receiver for such member under
the following circumstances:
(i) TROUBLED CONDITION CRITERIA.—The Corporation

lowing criteria:

regulatory accounting principles but had negative
tangible capital.
(II) The member’s negative tangible capital posi-
tion is substantially attributable to its participa-
tion in acquisition and merger transactions that
were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation for supervisory reasons.
(III) The member is a qualified thrift lender (as
defined in section 10(m) of the Home Owners’
Loan Act) or would be a qualified thrift lender if
commercial real estate owned and nonperforming
commercial loans acquired in acquisition and
merger transactions that were instituted by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board or the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for su-
pervisory reasons were excluded from the mem-
ber’s total assets.
(IV) The appropriate Federal banking agency
has determined that the member’s management is
competent and has complied with applicable laws,
rules, and supervisory directives and orders.
(V) The member’s management did not engage
in insider dealing or speculative practices or other
activities that jeopardized the member’s safety
and soundness or contributed to its impaired cap-
ital position.
(VI) The member’s offices are located in an eco-
nomically depressed region.
(B) CORPORATION CONSIDERATION OF ASSISTANCE PRO-
POSAL.—If a member meets the requirements of clauses (i)
and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall con-
sider providing direct financial assistance.

pressed region’’ means any geographical region which the
Corporation determines by regulation to be a region within
which real estate values have suffered serious decline due
to severe economic conditions, such as a decline in energy
or agricultural values or prices.

materials provided pursuant to this paragraph may be construed to limit
the authority of a Federal agency to enforce violations of Federal statutes,
rules, or orders.’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3716, the Systemic Risk Authority Transparency Act, was
introduced on June 4, 2025, by Representative Al Green (TX–09).
H.R. 3716 requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
and appropriate Federal banking regulators to issue timely public
reports when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in-
vokes the systemic risk exception under section 13(c)(4)(G) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. These reports must include a de-
tailed analysis of the causes of the bank failure, regulatory and su-
pervisory actions taken, and any shortcomings in management
oversight or regulatory response.

BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Introduced in response to the spring 2023 bank failures, the bill
formalizes a dual-reporting process that occurred after the col-
lapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. H.R. 3716
requires both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and ap-
propriate Federal banking regulators to issue reports when the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) invokes the sys-
temic risk exception.
In drafting an earlier iteration of H.R. 3716, Committee Demo-
crats addressed concerns raised by Republicans that GAO’s inde-
pendent findings should be prioritized ahead of regulatory agency
reports to avoid the appearance of biased narratives. This concern
stemmed from perceptions that the Federal Reserve’s post-SVB re-
view lacked sufficient objectivity. The bill enhances transparency
and accountability by ensuring that both independent and regu-
latory perspectives are provided in a timely and structured man-
ner. This legislation also accommodates reasonable extensions to
reporting deadlines and includes confidentiality protections to safe-
guard sensitive supervisory and proprietary information, ensuring
that public transparency does not compromise financial stability or
regulatory integrity.

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3716 is to enhance trans-
parency and accountability by requiring timely, public reports on
the use of the systemic risk exception authority.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3716. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Systemic Risk Authority
Transparency Act.’’
Section 2. Bank failure transparency related to systemic risk excep-
tion.
Section 2 outlines new requirements for public reporting and ac-
countability when the systemic risk exception is used. It directs the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit two inde-
pendent reports to Congress—one within 60 days and another
within 180 days—following such a determination. These reports
must include an evaluation of the basis for the systemic risk deter-
mination, the impact on depositor and institutional behavior, any
mismanagement at the failed bank, and potential regulatory or su-
pervisory failures. The GAO must also assess the actions of rel-
evant financial regulators and other contributing factors, such as
auditors, credit rating agencies, and emergency lending sources.
This section also requires the appropriate Federal banking agen-
cy (such as the FDIC, OCC, or Federal Reserve) to submit two sep-
arate reports—within 90 and 210 days of the systemic risk deter-
mination. These reports must include redacted supervisory docu-
ments from the prior three years, analysis of executive and board
mismanagement, identification of agency oversight failures, and
recommendations to strengthen regulatory practices. Agencies are
required to make these materials public to the greatest extent pos-
sible, with procedures for withholding sensitive content in consulta-
tion with Congressional committee leadership. Extensions of up to
60 days are permitted in cases of systemic risk, and agencies may
consolidate reports if statutory deadlines are met. Finally, the bill
affirms that none of the reporting requirements affect the enforce-
ment authority of any federal agency.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT
* * * * * * *
SEC. 13. (a) INVESTMENT OF CORPORATION’S FUNDS.—
(1) AUTHORITY.—Funds held in the Deposit Insurance Fund

upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may pre-
scribe, to make loans to, to make deposits in, to purchase the as-

tributions to, any insured depository institution—
(A) if such action is taken to prevent the default of such in-
sured depository institution;
(B) if, with respect to an insured bank in default, such action
is taken to restore such insured bank to normal operation; or
(C) if, when severe financial conditions exist which threaten
the stability of a significant number of insured depository insti-
tutions or of insured depository institutions possessing signifi-
cant financial resources, such action is taken in order to lessen
the risk to the Corporation posed by such insured depository
institution under such threat of instability.

posed by such insured depository institution under such threat

party by acquiring any asset or exercising any other authority
set forth in this section shall be stayed for a period of 60 days

poration and obligations incurred by the Corporation
(including any immediate and long-term obligation of

ance under paragraph (1) or (2) or any other provision

sistance to the institution under this section.

subsection, the determination of the costs of liquida-
tion of any depository institution shall be made as of
the earliest of—

such institution; or
(III) the date on which the Corporation makes
any determination to provide any assistance
under this section with respect to such institution.

uidating any depository institution for the purpose of com-
paring the costs under subparagraph (A) (with respect to

posits of such institution as of the earliest of the dates de-

scribed in subparagraph (C), minus the present value of
the total net amount the Corporation reasonably expects to
receive from the disposition of the assets of such institu-
tion in connection with such liquidation.
(E) DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AVAILABLE FOR INTENDED
PURPOSE ONLY.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—After December 31, 1994, or at
such earlier time as the Corporation determines to be
appropriate, the Corporation may not take any action,
directly or indirectly, with respect to any insured de-
pository institution that would have the effect of in-
creasing losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund by pro-
tecting—

of deposits (determined without regard to whether
such institution is liquidated); or
(II) creditors other than depositors.
(ii) DEADLINE FOR REGULATIONS.—The Corporation

prohibiting the Corporation from allowing any person
who acquires any assets or assumes any liabilities of
any insured depository institution for which the Cor-
poration has been appointed conservator or receiver to
acquire uninsured deposit liabilities of such institution
so long as the insurance fund does not incur any loss
with respect to such deposit liabilities in an amount
greater than the loss which would have been incurred
with respect to such liabilities if the institution had
been liquidated.
(F) DISCRETIONARY DETERMINATIONS.—Any determina-
tion which the Corporation may make under this para-
graph shall be made in the sole discretion of the Corpora-
tion.

THE TREASURY.—Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A)
and (E), if, upon the written recommendation of the
Board of Directors (upon a vote of not less than two-
thirds of the members of the Board of Directors) and
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the mem-
bers of such Board), the Secretary of the Treasury (in
consultation with the President) determines that—
(I) the Corporation’s compliance with subpara-
graphs (A) and (E) with respect to an insured de-
pository institution for which the Corporation has
been appointed receiver would have serious ad-
verse effects on economic conditions or financial
stability; and

graph would avoid or mitigate such adverse ef-
fects,

sistance under this section for the purpose of winding
up the insured depository institution for which the
Corporation has been appointed receiver as necessary
to avoid or mitigate such effects.
(ii) REPAYMENT OF LOSS.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—The Corporation shall recover
the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising
from any action taken or assistance provided with
respect to an insured depository institution under

insured depository institutions, depository institu-
tion holding companies (with the concurrence of
the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to hold-
ing companies), or both, as the Corporation deter-
mines to be appropriate.
(II) TREATMENT OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION
HOLDING COMPANIES.—For purposes of this clause,
sections 7(c)(2) and 18(h) shall apply to depository
institution holding companies as if they were in-
sured depository institutions.
(III) REGULATIONS.—The Corporation shall pre-
scribe such regulations as it deems necessary to
implement this clause. In prescribing such regula-
tions, defining terms, and setting the appropriate
assessment rate or rates, the Corporation shall es-
tablish rates sufficient to cover the losses incurred
as a result of the actions of the Corporation under
clause (i) and shall consider: the types of entities
that benefit from any action taken or assistance
provided under this subparagraph; economic con-
ditions, the effects on the industry, and such other

vided. Any funds so collected that exceed actual
losses shall be placed in the Deposit Insurance
Fund.

the Treasury shall—
(I) document any determination under clause (i);
and
(II) retain the documentation for review under

(bb) the purpose for which any action was
taken pursuant to such clause;
(cc) the likely effect of the determination and

tion; and
(hh) any additional relevant entities or ac-
tivities that may have contributed to the fail-
ure of the insured depository institution, in-
cluding with respect to auditing, accounting,
credit rating agencies, investment bank under-
writers, and emergency liquidity options such
as loans from the Federal reserve banks or ad-
vances through the Federal Home Loan Bank
system.
(II) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this
clause or a report issued pursuant to this clause
may be construed to limit the authority of a Fed-
eral agency to enforce violations of Federal stat-
utes, rules, or orders.

(I) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 3 days after
making a determination under clause (i), the Sec-
retary of the Treasury shall provide written notice

(II) DESCRIPTION OF BASIS OF DETERMINATION.—
The notice under subclause (I) shall include a de-
scription of the basis for any determination under
clause (i).
(H) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—No provision of law
shall be construed as permitting the Corporation to
take any action prohibited by paragraph (4) unless
such provision expressly provides, by direct reference
to this paragraph, that this paragraph shall not apply
with respect to such action.
(5) The Corporation may not use its authority under this sub-
section to purchase the voting or common stock of an insured de-
pository institution. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be
construed to limit the ability of the Corporation to enter into and
enforce covenants and agreements that it determines to be nec-
essary to protect its financial interest.
(6)(A) During any period in which an insured depository institu-
tion has received assistance under this subsection and such assist-
ance is still outstanding, such insured depository institution may
defer the payment of any State or local tax which is determined on
the basis of the deposits held by such insured depository institution
or of the interest or dividends paid on such deposits.
(B) When such insured depository institution no longer has any

person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including
the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the
asset by the depository institution,
(C) was approved by the board of directors of the deposi-

in anticipation of an impending appointment.
(iii) If the State supervisor objects during such period, the Cor-
poration may use the authority of this paragraph only by a vote of
75 percent of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
provide to the State supervisor, as soon as practicable, a written
certification of its determination.

subsection (c) to an insured bank; and

bank, the holding company which controls the insured
bank (if any), or any affiliated insured bank is eligible to
be acquired by an out-of-State bank or out-of-State holding
company under this paragraph,
the insured bank, the holding company, and such other affili-
ated insured bank shall remain eligible, subject to such terms

tion) may impose, to be acquired by an out-of-State bank or
out-of-State holding company under this paragraph as long as
any portion of such assistance remains outstanding.
(E) STATE BANK SUPERVISOR APPROVAL.—The Corporation

sion of State law, and section 408(e)(3) of the National Housing Act

(i) IN GENERAL.—Any out-of-State bank holding company
which acquires control of an insured bank in any State under

are principally conducted in such State may acquire any other
insured bank or establish branches.

poses of this subparagraph, the State in which the operations
of a holding company’s insured bank subsidiaries are prin-
cipally conducted is the State determined under section 3(d) of
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 with respect to such
holding company.
(E) CERTAIN STATE INTERSTATE BANKING LAWS INAPPLICABLE.—
Any holding company which acquires control of any insured bank
or holding company under paragraph (2) or (3) or subparagraph (D)
of this paragraph shall not, by reason of such acquisition, be re-
quired under the law of any State to divest any other insured bank
or be prevented from acquiring any other bank or holding company.
(5) In determining whether to arrange a sale of assets and as-
sumption of liabilities or an acquisition or a merger under the au-
thority of paragraph (2) or (3), the Corporation may solicit such of-
fers or proposals as are practicable from any prospective pur-
chasers or merger partners it determines, in its sole discretion, are
both qualified and capable of acquiring the assets and liabilities of
the bank in default or the bank in danger of default.
(6)(A) If, after receiving offers, the offer presenting the lowest ex-
pense to the Corporation, that is in a form and with conditions ac-
ceptable to the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘lowest
acceptable offer’’), is from an offeror that is not an existing in-State
bank of the same type as the bank that is in default or is in danger
of default (or, where the bank is an insured bank other than a mu-
tual savings bank, the lowest acceptable offer is not from an in-
State holding company), the Corporation shall permit the offeror
which made the initial lowest acceptable offer and each offeror who
made an offer the estimated cost of which to the Corporation was
within 15 per centum or $15,000,000, whichever is less, of the ini-
tial lowest acceptable offer to submit a new offer.
(B) In considering authorizations under this subsection, the Cor-
poration shall give consideration to the need to minimize the cost
of financial assistance and to the maintenance of specialized depos-
itory institutions. The Corporation shall authorize transactions
under this subsection considering the following priorities:
(i) First, between depository institutions of the same type
within the same State.
(ii) Second, between depository institutions of the same
type—
(I) in different States which by statute specifically au-
thorize such acquisitions; or

which are contiguous.

in different States other than the States described in clause
(v).
(C) MINORITY BANK PRIORITY.—In the case of a minority-con-
trolled bank, the Corporation shall seek an offer from other minor-
ity-controlled banks before proceeding with the bidding priorities
set forth in subparagraph (B).
(D) In determining the cost of offers and reoffers, the Corpora-
tion’s calculations and estimations shall be determinative. The Cor-
poration may set reasonable time limits on offers and reoffers.
(7) No sale may be made under the provisions of paragraph (2)
or (3)—
(A) which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in
furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or
to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part
of the United States;
(B) whose effect in any section of the country may be sub-
stantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monop-
oly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of
trade, unless the Corporation finds that the anticompetitive ef-
fects of the proposed transactions are clearly outweighed in the
public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in
meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be
served; or
(C) if in the opinion of the Corporation the acquisition
threatens the safety and soundness of the acquirer or does not
result in the future viability of the resulting depository institu-
tion.

ing company’’ means an existing insured depository institution

mestic building and loan association under section

suant to subsection (c) before grounds exist for appoint-
ment of a conservator or receiver for such member under
the following circumstances:
(i) TROUBLED CONDITION CRITERIA.—The Corporation
determines—
(I) that grounds for appointment of a conser-
vator or receiver exist or likely will exist in the fu-
ture unless the member’s tangible capital is in-
creased;
(II) that it is unlikely that the member can
achieve positive tangible capital without assist-
ance; and
(III) that providing assistance pursuant to the
member’s proposal would be likely to lessen the
risk to the Corporation.
(ii) OTHER CRITERIA.—The member meets the fol-
lowing criteria:
(I) Before enactment of the Financial Institu-

regulatory accounting principles but had negative
tangible capital.
(II) The member’s negative tangible capital posi-
tion is substantially attributable to its participa-
tion in acquisition and merger transactions that
were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation for supervisory reasons.
(III) The member is a qualified thrift lender (as
defined in section 10(m) of the Home Owners’
Loan Act) or would be a qualified thrift lender if
commercial real estate owned and nonperforming
commercial loans acquired in acquisition and
merger transactions that were instituted by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board or the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for su-
pervisory reasons were excluded from the mem-
ber’s total assets.
(IV) The appropriate Federal banking agency
has determined that the member’s management is
competent and has complied with applicable laws,
rules, and supervisory directives and orders.
(V) The member’s management did not engage
in insider dealing or speculative practices or other
activities that jeopardized the member’s safety
and soundness or contributed to its impaired cap-
ital position.
(VI) The member’s offices are located in an eco-
nomically depressed region.
(B) CORPORATION CONSIDERATION OF ASSISTANCE PRO-
POSAL.—If a member meets the requirements of clauses (i)
and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall con-
sider providing direct financial assistance.
(C) ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED REGION DEFINED.—For

pressed region’’ means any geographical region which the
Corporation determines by regulation to be a region within
which real estate values have suffered serious decline due
to severe economic conditions, such as a decline in energy
or agricultural values or prices.
