BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The United States is currently facing an overdose crisis. Sub-
stance addiction, abuse, and misuse remain a major public health
issue. Over 107,000 Americans lost their lives to a drug overdose
in 2023.1 In addition, 40 to 60 percent of individuals treated for
substance use disorders will relapse at least once.2 Lastly, over 93
percent of people with a past-year substance use disorder (SUD)
did not receive specialty treatment.3
Congress took action to address the crisis in 2016 with the pas-
sage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the
21st Century Cares Act, which established new funding for preven-
tion, treatment, and recovery services for people struggling with
substance use disorder. The two laws attempted to address a grow-
ing prescription opioid epidemic that, at the time, was killing as
many as 50,000 to 60,000 Americans per year.4 However, as over-
dose deaths rose to nearly 70,000 deaths per year, Congress took
further action in 2018 to tackle the evolving crisis by passing the
Substance Use-Disorder Prevention That Promotes Opioid Recovery
And Treatment For Patients And Communities Act (or SUPPORT
Act).5 The SUPPORT Act was the largest investment in overdose
prevention programs by funding efforts to improve care, including
efforts to reduce barriers to all levels of the care continuum and al-
locate resources to states and providers for the purposes of pre-
venting and treating substance use disorder.
Congress’ work proved to be initially successful, evidenced by an-
nual overdose deaths decreasing for the first time since 2018.6
However, the current landscape has changed since 2018. Fentanyl
is now the primary driver of overdoses in the United States, ac-
counting for 70 percent of all overdose deaths.7 Further, the coun-
try is grappling with a mental health crisis, fueled by the COVID–
19 pandemic, which has driven millions of new Americans to use
and misuse drugs for the first time and set back countless others
on their road to recovery.8
Key provisions from the SUPPORT Act expired in 2023. The
SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of
2025 would advance SUD treatment for patients and allocate re-
sources to strengthen the addiction treatment and workforce.

vider, the program participant shall notify the appropriate
Federal, State, or local government agency that administers
the program of such referral.

the State or local government makes available of entities
in the geographic area that provide program services; and

ternative provider to which the individual is referred.

treatment services.
(b) NONDISCRIMINATION.—In determining whether personnel of a
program participant that has a record of successful drug treatment
for the preceding three years have satisfied State or local require-
ments for education and training, a State or local government shall
not discriminate against education and training provided to such
personnel by a religious organization, so long as such education

the relevant requirements have been satisfied.

treatment (MAT) using covered medications (as such terms
are defined in section 8.2 of title 42, Code of Federal Regu-
lations (or successor regulations)) in a qualified practice
setting (as described in section 8.615 of title 42, Code of
Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)); or

fications of practitioners to provide such treatment, or requires
standards respecting the quantities of the drugs that may be

waiver under subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall assign
the practitioner involved an identification number under this para-
graph for inclusion with the registration issued for the practitioner
pursuant to subsection (g). The identification number so assigned
shall be appropriate to preserve the confidentiality of patients for
whom the practitioner has dispensed narcotic drugs under a waiver
under subparagraph (A).
(iii) Not later than 45 days after the date on which the Secretary
receives a notification under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall
make a determination of whether the practitioner involved meets
all requirements for a waiver under subparagraph (B) and shall

identification number described in clause (ii) at the end of such pe-
riod.
(E)(i) If a practitioner is not registered under paragraph (1) and,
in violation of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (B)
through (D), dispenses narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or
combinations of such drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxi-
fication treatment, the Attorney General may, for purposes of sec-
tion 304(a)(4), consider the practitioner to have committed an act
that renders the registration of the practitioner pursuant to sub-
section (g) to be inconsistent with the public interest.

Secretary receives a notification under subparagraph (B), a practi-
tioner who in good faith submits a notification under subparagraph

mence to prescribe or dispense such narcotic drugs for such pur-
poses prior to the expiration of such 45-day period if it facilitates
the treatment of an individual patient and both the Secretary and

III, IV, or V or combinations of such drugs to patients for mainte-
nance or detoxification treatment, a practitioner may, in his or her
discretion, dispense such drugs or combinations for such treatment

fect on the conditions for obtaining a registration under paragraph
(1), including with respect to the number of patients who may be

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 2483, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reau-
thorization Act of 2025, reauthorizes public health programs that
help address the ongoing opioid epidemic. This historically bipar-
tisan bill should have continued to earn bipartisan support, but
Congressional Republicans have refused to conduct proper over-
sight of the Trump Administration’s dismantling of the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the
agency responsible for the United States’ response to ongoing men-
tal health and substance use disorder crises and for carrying out
many of the programs reauthorized by H.R. 2483.
On February 14, 2025, the Trump Administration fired approxi-
mately 100 probationary employees at SAMHSA.1 This was more
than 10 percent of the agency’s workforce.2 On April 1, 2025, there
was another round of mass firing at the agency as part of a depart-
ment-wide Reduction in Force (RIF), including senior officials such
as the Director of the Center for Mental Health Services and the
Director of the Center for Substance Use Treatment.3 The Adminis-
tration has refused to answer written questions regarding exactly
how many people were fired, despite repeated requests from the
Ranking Member and Minority Committee staff. However, reports
indicate that up 50 percent of the agency’s staff have been fired.4
In March, the Trump Administration also revealed plans to
eliminate SAMHSA altogether and combine mental health and sub-
stance use programs with unrelated programs such as occupational
health and safety and toxic substances in a new ‘‘Administration
for a Healthy America.’’5 This action will deprioritize mental
health and substance use efforts within the federal government,
and it has been opposed by dozens of leading mental health and
substance use groups.6
At the same time, the Trump Administration illegally rescinded
over $1 billion from state and local behavioral health programs
under Mental Health and Substance Use Block Grant funding.7
These funds were appropriated by the American Rescue Plan Act
during the COVID–19 pandemic, but the funding was never limited

to be used only for COVID–19 activities or during a public health
emergency. The funding was already obligated to states and re-
scinding it has only undermined States’ ability to address the over-
dose crisis.
On April 16, 2025, an internal budget document revealed the
Trump Administration’s plans for drastic cuts across the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services (HHS).8 The document listed
out specific programs that are poised to be eliminated, including 40
different mental health and substance use programs. Among these
programs were eight programs reauthorized by H.R. 2483, includ-
ing programs that train first responders for overdose response, pro-
vide residential treatment for pregnant and postpartum women, a
task force on best practices for trauma-informed care, support the
full spectrum of recovery services, target youth substance use dis-
order prevention, and help individuals in recovery reenter the
workforce.9
Congressional Republicans have stood silently by while the
Trump Administration decimates our mental health and substance
use prevention, treatment, and recovery landscape. It is Congress’
job to ensure that agencies can continue their critical work and
that authorized programs are not arbitrarily and illegally slashed.
Without proper Congressional oversight, there is little evidence to
inspire confidence that H.R. 2438 will be faithfully implemented, or
that we can make meaningful progress to combat the opioid crisis
or improve the mental health and well being of all Americans.
