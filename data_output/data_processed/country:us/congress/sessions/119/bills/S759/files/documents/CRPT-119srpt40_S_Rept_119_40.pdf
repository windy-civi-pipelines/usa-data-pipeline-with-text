MODERNIZING ACCESS TO OUR PUBLIC OCEANS ACT
JULY16, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 759]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 759) to provide for the standardiza-
tion, publication, and accessibility of data relating to public outdoor
recreational use of Federal waterways, and for other purposes, hav-
ing considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute and recommends that the bill,
as amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 759, Modernizing Access to Our Public Oceans
Act, is to provide for the standardization, publication, and accessi-
bility of data relating to public outdoor recreational use of Federal
waterways, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA)
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for man-
aging marine fisheries within the U.S. exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), the area from 3 to 200 nautical miles off the U.S. coast.
Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Manage-
ment Act,1 Marine Mammal Protection Act,2 and Endangered Spe-
116 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.; Public Law 94–265.
216 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.; Public Law 92–522.

cies Act,3 NOAA has the authority to set rules that restrict fishing
and other recreational activities in the EEZ to ensure Federal fish-
eries are sustainably managed and specific marine species are pro-
tected.4
NOAA currently publishes data on fisheries, vessel traffic, pro-
tected areas, and other relevant information in several different
formats. However, there is not one centralized online location for
the public to access all such data.
During the 117th Congress, the Modernizing Access to Our Pub-
lic Lands Act (or MAPLand Act)5 passed, requiring the Federal
Government to standardize and digitize information showing data
on permitted outdoor recreation activities for Federal lands. This
allowed the public to easily understand where and when they could
access public lands for hunting, fishing, camping, and other recre-
ation activities. The Modernizing Access to Our Public Oceans Act
follows a similar approach as the MAPLand Act requiring Federal
agencies to create a centralized database and mapping of permitted
recreation activities within Federal waters.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 759, as reported, would do the following:
• Direct the Secretary of Commerce to develop data standards
for geospatial data on the fishing restrictions and recreational
use of the EEZ.
• Direct the Secretary to digitize fishing and recreation data for
the EEZ and make it publicly available online.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 759 was introduced on February 26, 2025, by Senator Cruz
(for himself and Senator King) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On
March 12, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and,
by voice vote, ordered S. 759 to be reported favorably with an
amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
118th Congress
S. 3889, the Modernizing Access to Our Public Oceans Act, was
introduced on March 6, 2024, by Senator Cruz (for himself and
Senator King) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
316 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; Public Law 93–205.
4‘‘Understanding Fisheries Management in the United States,’’ National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/
insight/understanding-fisheries-management-united-states).

S. 759 would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA) to publish geographic data, within 31 months
of enactment, identifying areas within the U.S. exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) that are subject to regulatory restrictions on fishing,
boating, diving, and other recreational activities. The data must be
accessible on the agency’s website and updated at least twice a
year. The EEZ is an area that is adjacent to the country’s coastal
territorial sea and extends about 230 miles beyond the coastline.
Under current law, NOAA maintains and publishes data identi-
fying area-based regulations related to fishing and marine sanc-
tuaries and develops navigational and underwater mapping infor-
mation for the EEZ. The agency also maintains a federal spatial
database of managed fisheries in collaboration with the Regional
Fishery Management Council Coordination Committee and the Pa-
cific States Marine Fisheries Commission. In 2024, NOAA allocated
$101 million for those activities.
CBO expects that NOAA would build on its existing capabilities
to develop geospatial data standards and classification strategies
for identifying restricted areas, working with other federal agen-
cies, tribes, state and local governments and interstate commis-
sions.
Based on information from the agency, CBO expects that NOAA
would need seven full-time equivalent staff in 2026 and five each
year thereafter, at an average cost of $180,000 per employee. Those
employees would be responsible for developing standards and com-
piling data into a digital, accessible, and interoperable geographic
format. After accounting for anticipated inflation, CBO estimates
that implementing the bill would cost $5 million over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aurora Swanson. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.

Director, Congressional Budget Office.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 759 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Modernizing Access to Our Public Oceans Act’’.
Section 2. Definitions.
This section would define the terms ‘‘exclusive economic zone’’,
‘‘fishing restriction’’, ‘‘Indian Tribe’’, ‘‘Tribal organization’’, ‘‘Native
Hawaiian organization’’, ‘‘nonprofit organization’’, ‘‘recreational ves-
sel’’, and ‘‘Secretary’’.
Section 3. Data standardization.
This section would require the Secretary to develop and adopt
standards for coordinating and disseminating geospatial data re-
lated to fishing restrictions, recreational boating, and access to the
exclusive economic zone. These standards must be established
within 31 months, with input from stakeholders including State
and local governments, Indian Tribes, and Native Hawaiian organi-
zations.
Section 4. Data publication and accessibility.
This section would require the Secretary to make geographic in-
formation system data on the exclusive economic zone available to
the public no later than 4 years after enactment, including infor-
mation on fishing and boating restrictions, protected marine areas,
and navigation data. The website would be accessible, reusable,
regularly updated, and include a public comment process. Sensitive
information, like data on cultural or archaeological resources and
information on Tribal waters and usual and accustomed fishing
areas, would not be disclosed to the public nor included on the
website.
Section 5. Cooperation and coordination.
This section would enable the Secretary to partner with States,
Indian Tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, experts in data
science, analytics, and operations research, the private sector, and
other non-Federal entities to carry out the Act’s provisions. The
Secretary would also be required to work with other Federal agen-
cies to ensure interoperability of Federal geospatial data relating to

public outdoor recreational use of the EEZ. The Secretary would
ensure the data made public complies with applicable Federal,
State, and Tribal laws and regulations.
Section 6. Rule of construction.
This section would clarify that the Act does not alter the defini-
tion of the term ‘‘navigable waters,’’ affect the authority of Federal
or State agencies to regulate navigable waters, or modify the re-
sponsibilities of Federal or State agencies or Indian Tribes in man-
aging fisheries under existing law. It would also preserve the re-
quirement for government-to-government consultation with Indian
Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. This section ensures
the Act does not alter Indian Tribe treaties or rights.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
