The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act’’.
SEC. 2. CHANGES REQUIRED TO THE SMALL BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND SAVINGS AND
LOAN HOLDING COMPANY POLICY STATEMENT.
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall revise appendix C to part 225 of
title 12, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly known as the ‘‘Small Bank Holding
Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement’’), to raise the
consolidated asset threshold under that appendix to $25,000,000,000 for any bank
holding company or savings and loan holding company.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 2835, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act, was in-
troduced on April 10, 2025, by Representative Byron Donalds (FL–
19). H.R. 2835 requires the Federal Reserve Board to raise the con-
solidated asset threshold of the Small Bank Holding Company and
Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (Policy
Statement) from $3 billion to $25 billion. The bill will provide sen-
sible regulatory relief to make it easier for smaller community
banks to raise capital. The bill does not change capital rules and
regulations for subsidiary banks.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Policy Statement applies only to bank holding companies
(BHC) that (i) are not engaged in significant nonbanking activities
either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) do not conduct
significant off-balance sheet activities; and (iii) do not have a mate-
rial amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than
preferred securities) that are registered with the Securities and Ex-
change Commission. The Policy Statement also applies to BHCs
seeking to acquire an additional bank or company, as well as to
transactions involving changes in control, stock redemption, or
other shareholder transactions, provided they meet these qualifica-
tions.
The Policy Statement reflects the Federal Reserve’s recognition
of the funding constraints faced by small BHCs when seeking to fi-
nance their formation or growth through acquisitions. Ordinarily,
the Federal Reserve would be reluctant to approve debt-financed
startup or acquisition transactions due to the risks that high debt-
servicing costs pose to solvency and liquidity. Excessive leverage
may impair a BHC’s ability to serve as a ‘‘source of strength’’ for
its subsidiary banks. However, the Federal Reserve has acknowl-
edged that small BHCs typically face limited access to equity fi-
nancing in both public and private capital markets. As a result, the
use of debt financing is often necessary for these institutions.
The Federal Reserve first adopted the Policy Statement in 1980.
In 2015, it amended the asset-size threshold from $500 million to
$1 billion, allowing more institutions to benefit from its provisions.
The threshold was further increased in August 2018 to $3 billion.
These adjustments reflected a bipartisan effort to account for mar-
ket changes and maintain regulatory flexibility for small institu-
tions.

Since 2018, the total value of assets held by U.S. commercial
banks has increased from $16.7 trillion to approximately $23.8 tril-
lion, a 42.5 percent rise. If the Policy Statement’s threshold had
been adjusted in line with this growth alone, the asset-size limit
would now exceed $4.3 billion. This suggests that in real terms
fewer BHCs qualify for the Policy Statement’s regulatory treatment
over time. Raising the threshold would maintain the relative defini-
tion of a ‘‘small’’ BHC in the context of broader asset growth and
inflation across the banking sector.

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
which became Public Law 115—174 on May 24, 2018.
RELATED HEARINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following hearing was used to develop H.R.
2835:
The Committee on Financial Services held a February 5, 2025,
hearing titled ‘‘Making Community Banking Great Again.’’ A dis-
cussion draft version of the bill was attached to the hearing. The
following witnesses testified at the hearing: Ms. Cathy Owen, Exec-
utive Chairman, Eagle Bank & Trust Company; Ms. Susannah
Marshall, Bank Commissioner, Arkansas State Bank Department;
Ms. Rebeca Romero Rainey, President & CEO, Independent Com-
munity Bankers of America; Mr. Patrick J. Kennedy Jr., Founding
Partner, Kennedy Sutherland, LLP; and Ms. Mitria Spotser, Vice
President, Federal Policy, Center for Responsible Lending.
COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.
On June 10, 2025, the Committee ordered H.R. 2835, as amend-
ed, to be reported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 30
yeas and 20 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–
135).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
2835:
• Representative Donalds offered an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute, which made minor edits and technical
changes. This amendment was adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Bill Foster (D–IL) offered an amendment
(No. 2), designated AMENDHR2835_3. This amendment would
reduce the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal Re-
serve’s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan
Holding Company Policy Statement to $4 billion, down from
$25 billion as proposed in the bill. It would also require GAO
to submit a report within 18 months evaluating the effective-
ness of the threshold, including its impact on competition, con-
sumer benefits, and the safety and soundness of bank holding
companies. This amendment failed by a recorded vote of 19
yeas and 29 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No.
FC–134).

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 2835 is to require the Federal
Reserve Board to raise the consolidated asset threshold of the Pol-
icy Statement from $3 billion to $25 billion, to provide sensible reg-
ulatory relief to make it easier for smaller community banks to
raise capital.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 2835. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Small Bank Holding
Company Relief Act.’’
Section 2. Changes required to the small bank holding company
and savings and loan holding company policy statement
Section 2 requires that, not later than 180 days after the date
of enactment, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem revise appendix C to part 225 of title 12, Code of Federal Reg-
ulations, to raise the consolidated asset threshold to
$25,000,000,000 for any bank holding company or savings and loan
holding company.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 2835 does not repeal or amend any section of a statute.
Therefore, the Office of Legislative Counsel did not prepare the re-
port required under clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the House of Rep-
resentatives.

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 2835 would significantly increase the consolidated asset
threshold from $3 billion to $25 billion for bank holding companies
(BHCs) and savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) to be eli-
gible for the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company and
Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement. This state-
ment exempts small BHCs and SLHCs from consolidated risk-
based capital and leverage requirements, reduces reporting require-
ments, expedites bank mergers, and allows them to have higher
debt flexibility to finance bank acquisitions. While Congress has
updated this threshold from time to time, most recently in 2018 by
increasing the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion, H.R. 2835
would significantly increase the threshold by 833% and be a major
rollback, exempting 98% of all BHCs and SLHCs including numer-
ous mid-sized banks that have different risk profiles compared to
much smaller community banks.
The Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company and Sav-
ings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement was first imple-
mented by the Fed in 1980. It was originally designed to help the
smallest BHCs with less than $150 million in assets ($618 million
in today’s dollars)1 that had less access to equity financing than
larger institutions to take on more debt to help finance a bank ac-
quisition. Congress increased the $150 million threshold to $500
million in 2006, added SLHCs and increased the threshold to $1
billion in 2015, and raised the threshold to $3 billion in 2018 ($3.8
billion in today’s dollars), where it stands today.
Under the policy statement, small BHCs and SLHCs may qualify
if they have fewer than $3 billion in total assets and don’t engage
in significant nonbanking activities, off-balance-sheet activities, or
have material amounts of SEC-registered debt or equity securities
(excluding trust preferred securities, or TruPS). They are allowed
to use up to 75% debt for acquisitions provided the BHC would re-
duce the debt to 30% or less of equity in 12 years and retire the
debt in 25 years.2 (BHC debt generally is limited to 30% of eq-
uity.)3 While this policy statement primarily applies to the forma-
tion of small BHCs, it also applies to existing small BHCs that
wish to acquire an additional bank or company and to transactions
involving changes in control, stock redemptions, or other share-
holder transactions.4 In addition to debt flexibility, BHCs and
SLHCs that qualify are exempt from consolidated risk-based and
leverage capital rules, provided the subsidiary depository institu-
tion is well-capitalized.5 They also have less frequent reporting re-
quirements, filing reports semi-annually instead of quarterly, and

Statement—Regulatory Relief for Bank Growth and Acquisitions (Aug. 17, 2017), which indicated
increasing the threshold above $1 billion may have diminishing returns given securities-related
exceptions.

5This exemption is provided by Section 171 of Dodd-Frank (referred to as the ‘‘Collins Amend-
ment’’), which exempts small BHCs covered by the policy statement from having to meet the
same capital requirements at the holding company level that depository subsidiaries face. See
CRS, Over the Line: Asset Thresholds in Bank Regulation (May 3, 2021).

the reports are significantly less detailed, in part because the hold-
ing companies are not subject to capital requirements.6
There have been a variety of proposed adjustments that the
House has considered the last decade. After Congress raised the
threshold from $500 million to $1 billion in 2015, House Repub-
licans sought to increase the $1 billion threshold to $5 billion in
2016.7 That bill passed the House by a vote of 247–171. The
Obama Administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy
(SAP) with a veto threat opposing the bill, explaining, ‘‘[T]his piece
of legislation [is] an attempt to allow large banks to evade specific
minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements. These lim-
itations were put in place to ensure that banks remain sound and
able to serve their customers. Community banks with $1 to $5 bil-
lion in assets already have sufficient access to capital markets and
as a group are exhibiting health and resilience. Raising the thresh-
old to exempt banks with over $1 billion from important minimum
leverage and capital requirements would do little more than en-
courage banks to take on debt, endangering their soundness and
potentially depriving their customers of much needed banking serv-
ices should the bank fail.’’8
In 2017, Trump’s Treasury Department issued a recommendation
to raise the threshold to $2 billion.9 House Republicans instead
proposed a much bigger increase to $10 billion as part of a major
financial deregulatory bill, which passed the House but with all
Democrats opposing the bill.10 In 2018, House Republicans pro-
posed to raise the threshold to $3 billion as a standalone bill,11
which the House passed by a vote of 280–139. This change was in-
cluded in S. 2155 (115th), the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief,
and Consumer Protection Act (Crapo), which was signed into law
by President Trump.12
There has not been evidence presented to Congress thus far to
justify raising this particular threshold to $25 billion. Chairman
Hill’s community bank agenda simply suggested that, ‘‘The consoli-
dated asset threshold under the Small Bank Holding Company Pol-
icy Statement should be raised to allow more community banks to
grow using certain debt financing,’’ but it did not specify a new
threshold or cite any studies to justify this change.13 Earlier this
year, House Republicans posted a discussion draft of Rep. Donalds’
bill that proposed raising the threshold to $10 billion, instead of
$25 billion, that was considered as part of a hearing on community
banking.14 Despite having several bank industry witnesses testify,
the proposal was not discussed and none of the witnesses provided
a rationale to explain why increasing this threshold to $10 billion,

let alone $25 billion, would be justified.15 The proposal also was not
discussed at a recent Financial Institutions Subcommittee hearing
that focused on bank mergers.
Increasing this threshold by 833% from $3 billion to $25 billion
would expand the scope to cover roughly 98% of all BHCs and
SLHCs,16 which includes numerous mid-sized banks that have dif-
ferent risk profiles than much smaller banks. For example, some
mid-sized banks have major exposures to commercial real estate
(CRE) that has raised some concerns.17
It would be prudent to gather more data and analysis to consider
what adjustments, if any, should be made. One approach would be
to make an adjustment based on inflation, which would be roughly
$3.8 billion today, and to study the issue further. Rep. Bill Foster
(D–IL), Ranking Member of the Financial Institutions Sub-
committee, offered such an amendment that Republicans rejected
that would increase the threshold to $4 billion, and require the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to do an impact study
that would give Congress more data and analysis to help explore
legislative options to make the eligibility criteria more dynamic
and the policy statement more effective in a way that supports
community banks and the communities they serve in a safe and
sound manner.
Congress might also consider utilizing a more nuanced definition
to support smaller banks, instead of a simple asset threshold, as
Better Markets suggested more generally in response to Chairman
Hill’s community bank agenda.18 This could include or utilizing
FDIC’s definition of a community bank that goes beyond asset size
and considers factors like a bank’s lending and deposit-gathering
activities, its geographic focus, and its overall relationship with the
community,19 or considering if the institution receives high exam
ratings.
While there may be some benefits with adjusting the threshold,
there are risks too, given the reduced reporting and exemptions
from certain capital requirements, among other factors. The change
could result in more situations in which a BHC get into financial
trouble with knock-on impacts to its subsidiary bank. After all, the
Fed acknowledged in its Policy Statement that ‘‘The Board believes
that a high level of debt at the parent holding company impairs the
ability of a bank holding company to provide financial assistance
to its subsidiary bank(s) and, in some cases, the servicing require-
ments on such debt may be a significant drain on the resources of
the bank(s).’’20 Several consumer groups oppose the bill, including
Americans for Financial Reform and Public Citizen.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 2835.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
