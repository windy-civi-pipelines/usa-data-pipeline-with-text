The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘District of Columbia Federal Immigration Compli-
ance Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SERVING AS SANCTUARY JURISDICTION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided under subsection (b), the District of Colum-
bia may not have in effect a statute, ordinance, policy, or practice that prohibits or
restricts any entity or official of the District government from—
(1) sending, receiving, maintaining, or exchanging with any Federal, State, or
local government entity information regarding the citizenship or immigration
status (lawful or unlawful) of any individual; or
(2) complying with a request lawfully made by the Department of Homeland
Security under section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) to comply with a detainer for, or notify about the release
of, an individual.
(b) EXCEPTION.—The District of Columbia is not in violation of subsection (a) sole-
ly because it has a policy whereby its officials will not share information regarding
an individual who comes forward as a victim or a witness to a criminal offense, or
comply with a request made by the Department of Homeland Security under section
236 or 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) to com-
ply with a detainer regarding an individual who comes forward as a victim or a wit-
ness to a criminal offense.
SUMMARY AND PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
H.R. 2056, the District of Columbia Federal Immigration Compli-
ance Act nullifies any statute, ordinance, policy, or practice of the
D.C. government which restricts any entity or official from (1) pro-
viding citizenship or immigration status of any individual to any
Federal, state, or local governmental entity or (2) complying with
a lawful request by the Department of Homeland Security under
sections 236 (Apprehension and detention of aliens) or 287 (Powers
of immigration officers and employees) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act, including complying with detainers or providing noti-
fication regarding the release of an individual. The bill also pro-
vides a safe harbor to protect individuals who come forward as the
witness to, or victim of, a crime.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The progressive D.C. Council has enacted multiple laws prohib-
iting D.C. employees from cooperating with federal immigration
agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE). Most notably, D.C. has enacted the Sanctuary Values
Amendment Act of 2020 (D.C. Law 23–282) which prevents D.C.
from learning the immigration status of an individual in custody
and prevents the release of an individual for the purpose of trans-
ferring them to a federal immigration agency. These laws have ef-
fectively transformed the Nation’s Capital into a sanctuary city, re-
leasing criminal illegal aliens instead of turning them over to ICE
for removal.
H.R. 2056 removes prohibitions on D.C. employees from cooper-
ating with ICE and providing the alienage status of individuals in
the District’s custody. This bill also requires D.C. to comply with
lawful detainer requests from ICE and the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS). This will overturn D.C.’s sanctuary city sta-

tus, ensuring more cooperation between the District and federal
immigration agencies. H.R. 2056 includes an exception for individ-
uals who come to law enforcement as a witness or victim of a
crime: identical language was also included in the No Bailout for
Sanctuary Cities Act (H.R. 5717, 118th) which passed the House in
September 2024. This exception removes potential arguments by
open borders advocates that illegal aliens will otherwise be de-
terred from coming forward to assist law enforcement as witnesses
to or victims of crime.
This bill vacates any D.C. laws and memoranda prohibiting co-
operation with ICE detainers, nullifying D.C.’s sanctuary city sta-
tus. This initiative is in line with the Trump Administration’s ef-
forts to help keep the Nation’s Capital city safe.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
The short title is the District of Columbia Federal Immigration
Compliance Act.
Section 2. Prohibition on District of Columbia serving as a sanc-
tuary jurisdiction
• Subsection (a) (In General) nullifies existing D.C. laws, ordi-
nances, policies, or practices that prohibit District employees from
providing the immigration status of an individual to the federal
government and requires the District to comply with all lawful de-
tainer requests from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
• Subsection (b) (Exception) provides an exception to subsection
(a) for any individual whose contact with a D.C. employee is solely
as a victim or witness to a crime.

H.R. 2056 would amend federal law to specify that the District
of Colombia (D.C.) government must comply with requests from
federal immigration authorities to share information and detain
aliens (non-U.S. nationals). Under the D.C. Official Code, the Dis-
trict does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities with-
out a judicial warrant.
CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2056 could increase the num-
ber of aliens in government custody and the number of aliens de-
ported by making it easier for the federal government to enforce
U.S. immigration laws within the district. Any change in that num-
ber would depend on many factors, including the availability of de-
tention space and decisions made by the executive branch. There-
fore, CBO estimates that any changes in the size of the population
based solely on enacting this bill would be small.
Enacting H.R. 2056 would reduce direct spending because aliens
are eligible for certain federal benefits, such as emergency Med-
icaid, if they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for those
benefits. Because few people would be affected by the bill, CBO es-
timates that those effects would not be significant in any year and
over the 2025–2035 period.
CBO estimates that the cost to implement the bill would not be
significant; any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 2056 would impose an intergovernmental mandate as de-
fined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by pre-
empting local laws in the District of Columbia. Specifically, the bill
would preempt any D.C. statute, ordinance, policy, or practice that
limits cooperation with federal immigration agencies. CBO esti-
mates that the cost of the mandate would not exceed the annual
intergovernmental threshold established in UMRA ($103 million in
2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would not impose any private-sector mandates.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Jeremy Crimm and
Matthew Pickford (for federal costs) and Andrew Laughlin (for

MINORITY VIEWS
Committee Democrats strongly oppose H.R. 2056, which would
effectively nullify laws, policies, and practices duly enacted by the
District of Columbia (D.C.), because we strongly support local D.C.
self-government.
DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY IN D.C.
The principles of no taxation without representation and consent
of the governed helped launch the American Revolution and are en-
shrined in the Declaration of Independence. Yet, D.C. residents,
who pay all federal taxes, have no voting representation in Con-
gress, and Congress has plenary authority over D.C.1
The Majority claims Congress has a constitutional duty to legis-
late on local D.C. matters. That is false, and Republicans legislate
on local D.C. matters only when they think they can score political
points.
Despite giving Congress plenary authority over D.C., the Fram-
ers expected Congress to establish a local government for D.C.2 In-
deed, Congress has established various forms of local government
for D.C. since 1802.3 The Supreme Court has held that ‘‘there is
no constitutional barrier to the delegation by Congress to the Dis-
trict of Columbia of full legislative power.’’4
In 1973, Congress passed the D.C. Home Rule Act, which estab-
lished an elected chief executive (the D.C. Mayor) and an elected
legislature (the D.C. Council) for D.C.5 The purpose of the D.C.
Home Rule Act is to, among other things, ‘‘grant to the inhabitants
of the District of Columbia powers of local self-government’’ and
‘‘relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon essentially local
District matters.’’6 H.R. 2056 contravenes the purpose of the D.C.
Home Rule Act.
PUBLIC SAFETY
H.R. 2056 constitutes an unacceptable encroachment on D.C.’s
self-governance by mandating that local agencies participate in fed-
eral immigration enforcement operations. Such a mandate would
undermine community trust and pose a serious risk to public safe-
ty. Mayors, police chiefs, sheriffs, and other local officials across
the country have made clear that the way to combat violent crime
is to allow local police to protect public safety in their own commu-
1U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17.
2‘‘[A] municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course
be allowed them.’’ Library of Congress, Federalist Nos. 41–50 (online at https://guides.loc.gov/

nities—not to spend their limited time and resources rounding up
and detaining immigrants who pose no threat.7 Moreover, police
departments need all residents, especially the witnesses to, and the
victims of, crime, to feel safe cooperating with them. H.R. 2056
would make immigrants less willing to cooperate with the D.C. po-
lice department. All people, regardless of immigration status, de-
serve to feel and be safe in their communities.
CONCLUSION
We strongly oppose H.R. 2056 and any other effort to undermine
the will of D.C. residents and their locally elected representatives.
Instead of interfering in local D.C. matters, Congress should grant
D.C.’s statehood petition.
