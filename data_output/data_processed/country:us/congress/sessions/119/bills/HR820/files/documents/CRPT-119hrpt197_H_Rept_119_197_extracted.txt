PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 820, the ‘‘Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening
Enhancement Act,’’ amends existing law to improve the hygienic
handling of breast milk, baby formula, and related feeding items
during aviation security screening conducted by the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) and authorized private screeners.
The bill requires the TSA Administrator to issue or update guid-
ance within 90 days of enactment, and at least once every five
years thereafter.
The legislation further directs the Department of Homeland Se-
curity’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) to conduct a one-
time audit, within one year of enactment, to assess TSA’s compli-
ance with the updated hygienic screening standards. This audit
must also evaluate the impact of screening technologies such as
bottled liquid scanners and provide data on the denial rate of cov-
ered items at airport checkpoints. The bill builds on the original
‘‘Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act’’ and aims to
improve the experience of traveling families without compromising
aviation security.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Families traveling through the United States’ commercial avia-
tion system frequently encounter confusion, inconsistent screening
procedures, and even health risks when carrying breast milk, for-
mula, juice, or cooling accessories for infants and young children.
Despite TSA guidance exempting these items from general liquid
restrictions, numerous reports have surfaced of parents being told
to discard expressed breast milk, submit to unsanitary screenings,
or relinquish essential feeding supplies. Such practices not only
cause emotional distress but can jeopardize the health and nutri-
tion of infants during travel.
Parents have reported that TSA officers and contract screeners
often lack adequate training in how to properly inspect medically
necessary liquids and related equipment, such as bottles, ice packs,
and breast pumps. In some cases, improper handling has intro-
duced contamination risks or resulted in parents being separated
from vital supplies. Inconsistent application of policies at different
airports, and across various personnel, has contributed to public
confusion and undermined trust in TSA procedures.
The TSA has taken some steps to improve the situation by
issuing guidance and training materials. However, given the con-
tinued occurrence of problematic incidents, more durable and en-
forceable solutions are needed. H.R. 820 seeks to codify hygiene-fo-
cused standards and require systematic updates to screening proce-
dures that reflect best practices in maternal and infant health.
Additionally, the bill introduces an important oversight compo-
nent by requiring the DHS Inspector General to evaluate both
TSA’s adherence to the updated protocols and the role that screen-
ing technologies play in the treatment of these items. This require-
ment ensures accountability and transparency, helping Congress
assess whether policies are applied consistently and humanely
across airports and screening environments. In striking a balance
between aviation security and public health, H.R. 820 represents a

necessary update to the Federal government’s handling of a deeply
personal and sensitive issue for millions of families.
HEARINGS
The Committee has not held a hearing that guided the develop-
ment of this legislation in the 119th Congress. However, the bill re-
flects concerns raised through constituent outreach, stakeholder en-
gagement, and oversight activities relating to TSA screening prac-
tices and the treatment of medically necessary liquids and infant
feeding equipment at airport security checkpoints. The Committee’s
ongoing review of aviation security policy and passenger experience
informed the development and consideration of this legislation.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
The Committee met on Wednesday, April 9, 2025, a quorum
being present, to consider H.R. 820 and ordered the measure to be
favorably reported to the House by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII requires the Committee to list the re-
corded votes on the motion to report legislation and amendments
thereto.
No recorded votes were requested during consideration of H.R.

Section 3:
820.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee ad-
vises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee,
based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X, are in-
corporated in the descriptive portions of this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE, NEW BUDGET
AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX EXPENDITURES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII
and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and
with respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII and

Section 4:
section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee adopts as its own the estimate of any new budget authority,
spending authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in
revenues or tax expenditures contained in the cost estimate pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 820 would require the Transportation Security Administra-
tion (TSA) to issue or update guidance to minimize the risk of con-
taminating breastmilk, baby formula, and related accessories dur-
ing the passenger screening process at airports. The bill also would
require the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to audit that guidance.
According to information from the agency, TSA regularly updates
its guidance for screening breastmilk and related items under cur-
rent law. On that basis, CBO estimates that implementing that
provision would not significantly affect the federal budget. Based
on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that conducting the
audit would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period; any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
On February 13, 2025, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for S.
260, the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhance-
ment Act, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation on February 5, 2025. The two
pieces of legislation are similar, and CBO’s estimates of their budg-
etary effects are the same.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aaron Krupkin. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
