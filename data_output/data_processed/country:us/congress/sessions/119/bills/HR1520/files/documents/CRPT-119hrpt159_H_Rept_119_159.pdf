BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
According to the National Council on Disability, individuals with
disabilities are often denied equal access to organ transplants
based solely on disability status. The denials are usually based on
assumptions that these individuals’ lives are of poorer quality than
individuals without disabilities and on misinterpretations regard-
ing the ability for these individuals to comply with postoperative
care.1 Existing federal laws, including the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, prohibit organ transplant cen-
ters from discriminating on the basis of disability.2 However, there
is limited enforcement and a lack of federal guidance to ensure pa-
tients are protected. Some states have laws banning organ trans-
plant discrimination, but the state patchwork can lead to further
confusion, and disability-based discrimination in the organ trans-
plant system continues to occur. For instance, an infant with Down
syndrome in Florida needed a heart transplant due to a congenital
heart defect. The infant was denied a heart transplant by three
physicians and tragically passed away.3 H.R. 1520 will clarify that
individuals with disabilities shall not be denied an organ trans-
plant or related services based solely on the individual’s disability
and includes an expedited review and enforcement mechanism, as
appropriate, through the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices Office of Civil Rights.
COMMITTEE ACTION
