HOTEL FEES TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2025
APRIL28, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 314]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 314) to prohibit unfair and deceptive
advertising of prices for hotel rooms and other places of short-term
lodging, and for other purposes, having considered the same, re-
ports favorably thereon without amendment and recommends that
the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 314 is to prohibit covered entities from adver-
tising a price for short-term lodging that does not clearly, conspicu-
ously, and prominently include the total price, including all fees.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Price transparency is a key factor in a free and fair market. Con-
sumers have experienced hidden fees or drip pricing—where only
part of the price for a product or service is disclosed up front and
additional charges are revealed or imposed through the purchasing
process—in a number of contexts. Drip pricing is the practice of ad-
vertising only part of a product’s price up front and revealing addi-
tional charges later as a consumer goes through the purchasing
process. In the hotel and short-term rental industry, these fees can
be revealed throughout the booking process, or even imposed upon

check-in.1 When these practices are used, consumers will likely ex-
perience additional mandatory charges or fees on their purchase,
which are not disclosed to the consumer with the initial or adver-
tised price. As a result, consumers may pay significantly more for
hotel services than the advertised price. Consumers also may be
unable to effectively comparison shop for hotels and short-term
rentals. A 2019 report by Consumer Reports found that at least 85
percent of Americans have encountered an unexpected or hidden
fee for a service they had used in the past 2 years.2
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has long expressed con-
cerns with these practices, noting that failing to disclose the full
price of goods or services in advertisements can deceptively lower
consumers’ estimates of how much they expect to (and will) pay for
a product or service.3 In 2012, the FTC held a conference to exam-
ine drip pricing.4 FTC staff made a recommendation for up-front
pricing in a 2017 staff report.5
The Department of Transportation already requires airlines to
advertise the full fare for air transportation.6 This legislation will
provide consumers with a consistent experience when booking lodg-
ing.
In enforcing their consumer protection statutes, State attorneys
general have addressed fee disclosure in the hotel and lodging sec-
tor. In 2023, the State attorneys general from Pennsylvania, Colo-
rado, Nebraska, and Oregon entered into a binding settlement with
a hotel chain to require the upfront disclosure of all mandatory fees
to consumers.7
In June 2023, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Prod-
uct Safety, and Data Security of the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing, ‘‘Protecting
Consumers from Junk Fees,’’ which highlighted the need for legis-
lative action to address hidden fees, including in the hotel indus-
try.8 Sally Greenberg, chief executive officer of the National Con-
sumers League, wrote extensively in her testimony about hotel fees

as an example of an industry’s use of hidden fees.9 As a result of
such hidden fees and the confusion injected into the purchasing
process, consumers often end up purchasing more expensive hotel
rooms, as they appear less expensive to start.10 Additionally, com-
petitors who choose to display their fees up front may face a com-
petitive disadvantage if their prices appear to be more expensive at
first glance. Legislation would ensure that all competitors are held
to the same standard and consumers are protected from hidden
fees.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 314 would do the following:
• Prohibit covered entities from displaying or advertising a price
for temporary lodging without clearly, conspicuously, and
prominently displaying the total service price.
• Require covered entities to disclose the total service price at
the time a price for temporary lodging is first displayed to an
individual and throughout the purchasing process. Prior to
final purchase, any government tax or fee must also be dis-
closed.
• Grant enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commis-
sion, State attorneys general, and other authorized officers of
a State to enforce the Act.
• Protect intermediaries or third-party online sellers by allowing
them to assert an affirmative defense in enforcement actions if
the intermediaries established procedures to receive up-to-date
price information from hotels or short-term rentals, the third
parties relied in good faith on the information provided to
them, and took prompt action to remove or correct any false or
inaccurate information after receiving notice.
• Preempt any State or a local law, rule, regulation, require-
ment, standard, or other provision that prohibits a covered en-
tity from displaying or advertising a covered service, or other-
wise affects the manner in which a covered entity may display
or advertise a price of a covered service, and that requires fee
disclosure, unless the law requires the total services price to
include each service fee (as defined in the Act) in accordance
with the requirements in this Act.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 314 was introduced on January 29, 2025, by Senator Klo-
buchar (for herself and Senators Moran, Cortez Masto, and Capito)
and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation of the Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee
met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 314
reported favorably without amendment.

ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.
S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-
mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-

facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included
in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.

menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any

related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in

Section 3:
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticker issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-
funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would
occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most
ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited

from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs and revenues: David
Hughes; Mandates: Grace Watson and Rachel Austin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

ECONOMIC IMPACT
By increasing transparency in the hotel market, S. 314 will allow
consumers to more effectively comparison shop and select the best-
priced hotel rooms or short-term rentals. Therefore, the bill is ex-
pected to save consumers both time and money.
PRIVACY
S. 314 is not anticipated to impact the personal privacy of indi-
viduals.
PAPERWORK
S. 314 is not anticipated to generate any additional paperwork.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 4:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 5:
Section 1. Short title.
This section provides that this Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hotel
Fees Transparency Act of 2025’’.

Section 6:
Section 2. Prohibition on unfair and deceptive advertising of hotel
rooms and other short-term rental prices.
Subsection (a)(1) would prohibit a covered entity from displaying,
advertising, marketing, or offering in interstate commerce, a price
for covered services that does not clearly, conspicuously, and promi-
nently display the total services price; disclose the total services
price at the time it is first displayed to the individual and anytime
throughout the purchasing process; and disclose any tax or fee im-
posed by the government prior to the final purchase.
Subsection (a)(2) would provide that a covered entity is not pro-
hibited from displaying individual components of the total price or
additional details of other items not required by this Act, provided
that such displays are less prominent than the required total serv-
ice price.
Subsection (a)(3) would provide that nothing in this section shall
be construed to prohibit any covered entity from entering into a
contract with another covered entity that contains an indemnifica-
tion provision regarding price or fee information.
Subsection (b)(1) would provide that a violation of subsection (a)
will be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or decep-
tive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.11
Subsection (b)(2) would provide for State enforcement of sub-

Section 7:
section (a) through State attorneys general. Attorneys general who
wish to bring a case must inform the Commission prior to bringing
civil action. If they are unable to notify the Commission prior to
the action, they must notify immediately upon bringing the civil ac-
tion. The Commission may intervene in any civil action brought by
1115 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B).

the attorney general of a State and file petitions for appeal. Noth-
ing in this section may be construed to prevent State attorneys
general from exercising other powers conferred upon them by the
laws of a State to conduct investigations, administer oaths or affir-
mations, or compel the attendance of witnesses or the production
of evidence. Where a civil action has been instituted by or on behalf
of the Commission, no attorney general may institute an action
against any defendant in the complaint. Any action brought under
subparagraph (a) may be brought in a United States district court
or another competent court of jurisdiction. Actions brought under
subparagraph (a) may be served in any district where the defend-
ant is an inhabitant, is found, or transacts business; or the venue
is proper under section 1391 of title 28, United States Code. Au-
thorized State officers other than attorney generals may bring a
civil action under subparagraph (a), subject to the same require-
ments under this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph may be
construed to prohibit an authorized State official from initiating or
continuing State court proceedings for violations of a State’s civil
or criminal law.
Subsection (b)(3) would provide that in any action initiated under
this Act, an intermediary or third-party online seller may assert an
affirmative defense if they have (A) established procedures to re-
ceive up-to-date price information, (B) relied on good faith that the
information supplied to them was accurate, and (C) took prompt ac-
tion to correct any false or inaccurate information after receiving
notice.
Subsection (c) would prohibit States (and their political subdivi-
sions) from enforcing any provision having the force and effect of
law that prohibits a covered entity from advertising or displaying
or affects the manner in which a covered entity advertises or dis-
plays a price, and that requires fee disclosure, unless the law re-
quires the total services price to include each service fee (as defined
by this Act), and in accordance with subsection (a)(1). This section
may not be construed to preempt any State law relating to con-
tracts or torts, or any State law relating to fraud.
Subsection (d) would define key terms in this Act. The term
‘‘base service price’’ means the price to obtain the covered service
of the hotel or short-term rental, not including service fees or taxes.
The term ‘‘Commission’’ means the Federal Trade Commission. The
term ‘‘covered entity’’ means a person or partnership that the Com-
mission has jurisdiction over, including hotels, third-party online
sellers, or an intermediary. The term ‘‘covered services’’ means the
temporary provision of a room, building, or other lodging. Such
term does not include the provision of a meeting room, banquet
services, or catering services. The term ‘‘hotel’’ means an establish-
ment that provides a covered service and promotes such service.
The term ‘‘intermediary’’ means an entity that operates as either
business-facing, consumer-facing, or both and displays a price for
covered entities or a price comparison service for covered services.
The term ‘‘optional product or service’’ means a product or service
that an individual does not need to purchase for use of covered
services. The term ‘‘service fee’’ means a charge from a covered en-
tity necessary for covered services and does not include any govern-
ment taxes or fees or any optional fees. The term ‘‘short-term rent-
al’’ means a property that provides covered services to the general

States, the District of Columbia, and any territory of the United
States. The term ‘‘third-party online seller’’ means any person
other than a hotel or short-term rental that sells covered services
with respect to a hotel in a transaction on the internet. The term
‘‘total services price’’ means the total cost of covered services, in-
cluding the base service price and any service fees, and does not
include any government taxes or tees or optional fees.

HOTEL FEES TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2025
APRIL28, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 314]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 314) to prohibit unfair and deceptive
advertising of prices for hotel rooms and other places of short-term
lodging, and for other purposes, having considered the same, re-
ports favorably thereon without amendment and recommends that
the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 314 is to prohibit covered entities from adver-
tising a price for short-term lodging that does not clearly, conspicu-
ously, and prominently include the total price, including all fees.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Price transparency is a key factor in a free and fair market. Con-
sumers have experienced hidden fees or drip pricing—where only
part of the price for a product or service is disclosed up front and
additional charges are revealed or imposed through the purchasing
process—in a number of contexts. Drip pricing is the practice of ad-
vertising only part of a product’s price up front and revealing addi-
tional charges later as a consumer goes through the purchasing
process. In the hotel and short-term rental industry, these fees can
be revealed throughout the booking process, or even imposed upon

check-in.1 When these practices are used, consumers will likely ex-
perience additional mandatory charges or fees on their purchase,
which are not disclosed to the consumer with the initial or adver-
tised price. As a result, consumers may pay significantly more for
hotel services than the advertised price. Consumers also may be
unable to effectively comparison shop for hotels and short-term
rentals. A 2019 report by Consumer Reports found that at least 85
percent of Americans have encountered an unexpected or hidden
fee for a service they had used in the past 2 years.2
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has long expressed con-
cerns with these practices, noting that failing to disclose the full
price of goods or services in advertisements can deceptively lower
consumers’ estimates of how much they expect to (and will) pay for
a product or service.3 In 2012, the FTC held a conference to exam-
ine drip pricing.4 FTC staff made a recommendation for up-front
pricing in a 2017 staff report.5
The Department of Transportation already requires airlines to
advertise the full fare for air transportation.6 This legislation will
provide consumers with a consistent experience when booking lodg-
ing.
In enforcing their consumer protection statutes, State attorneys
general have addressed fee disclosure in the hotel and lodging sec-
tor. In 2023, the State attorneys general from Pennsylvania, Colo-
rado, Nebraska, and Oregon entered into a binding settlement with
a hotel chain to require the upfront disclosure of all mandatory fees
to consumers.7
In June 2023, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Prod-
uct Safety, and Data Security of the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing, ‘‘Protecting
Consumers from Junk Fees,’’ which highlighted the need for legis-
lative action to address hidden fees, including in the hotel indus-
try.8 Sally Greenberg, chief executive officer of the National Con-
sumers League, wrote extensively in her testimony about hotel fees

as an example of an industry’s use of hidden fees.9 As a result of
such hidden fees and the confusion injected into the purchasing
process, consumers often end up purchasing more expensive hotel
rooms, as they appear less expensive to start.10 Additionally, com-
petitors who choose to display their fees up front may face a com-
petitive disadvantage if their prices appear to be more expensive at
first glance. Legislation would ensure that all competitors are held
to the same standard and consumers are protected from hidden
fees.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 314 would do the following:
• Prohibit covered entities from displaying or advertising a price
for temporary lodging without clearly, conspicuously, and
prominently displaying the total service price.
• Require covered entities to disclose the total service price at
the time a price for temporary lodging is first displayed to an
individual and throughout the purchasing process. Prior to
final purchase, any government tax or fee must also be dis-
closed.
• Grant enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commis-
sion, State attorneys general, and other authorized officers of
a State to enforce the Act.
• Protect intermediaries or third-party online sellers by allowing
them to assert an affirmative defense in enforcement actions if
the intermediaries established procedures to receive up-to-date
price information from hotels or short-term rentals, the third
parties relied in good faith on the information provided to
them, and took prompt action to remove or correct any false or
inaccurate information after receiving notice.
• Preempt any State or a local law, rule, regulation, require-
ment, standard, or other provision that prohibits a covered en-
tity from displaying or advertising a covered service, or other-
wise affects the manner in which a covered entity may display
or advertise a price of a covered service, and that requires fee
disclosure, unless the law requires the total services price to
include each service fee (as defined in the Act) in accordance
with the requirements in this Act.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 314 was introduced on January 29, 2025, by Senator Klo-
buchar (for herself and Senators Moran, Cortez Masto, and Capito)
and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation of the Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee
met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 314
reported favorably without amendment.

ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.
S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-
mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-

facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included
in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any

related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticker issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-
funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would
occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most
ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited

from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs and revenues: David
Hughes; Mandates: Grace Watson and Rachel Austin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

ECONOMIC IMPACT
By increasing transparency in the hotel market, S. 314 will allow
consumers to more effectively comparison shop and select the best-
priced hotel rooms or short-term rentals. Therefore, the bill is ex-
pected to save consumers both time and money.
PRIVACY
S. 314 is not anticipated to impact the personal privacy of indi-
viduals.
PAPERWORK
S. 314 is not anticipated to generate any additional paperwork.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section provides that this Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hotel
Fees Transparency Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Prohibition on unfair and deceptive advertising of hotel
rooms and other short-term rental prices.
Subsection (a)(1) would prohibit a covered entity from displaying,
advertising, marketing, or offering in interstate commerce, a price
for covered services that does not clearly, conspicuously, and promi-
nently display the total services price; disclose the total services
price at the time it is first displayed to the individual and anytime
throughout the purchasing process; and disclose any tax or fee im-
posed by the government prior to the final purchase.
Subsection (a)(2) would provide that a covered entity is not pro-
hibited from displaying individual components of the total price or
additional details of other items not required by this Act, provided
that such displays are less prominent than the required total serv-
ice price.
Subsection (a)(3) would provide that nothing in this section shall
be construed to prohibit any covered entity from entering into a
contract with another covered entity that contains an indemnifica-
tion provision regarding price or fee information.
Subsection (b)(1) would provide that a violation of subsection (a)
will be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or decep-
tive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.11
Subsection (b)(2) would provide for State enforcement of sub-
section (a) through State attorneys general. Attorneys general who
wish to bring a case must inform the Commission prior to bringing
civil action. If they are unable to notify the Commission prior to
the action, they must notify immediately upon bringing the civil ac-
tion. The Commission may intervene in any civil action brought by
1115 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B).

the attorney general of a State and file petitions for appeal. Noth-
ing in this section may be construed to prevent State attorneys
general from exercising other powers conferred upon them by the
laws of a State to conduct investigations, administer oaths or affir-
mations, or compel the attendance of witnesses or the production
of evidence. Where a civil action has been instituted by or on behalf
of the Commission, no attorney general may institute an action
against any defendant in the complaint. Any action brought under
subparagraph (a) may be brought in a United States district court
or another competent court of jurisdiction. Actions brought under
subparagraph (a) may be served in any district where the defend-
ant is an inhabitant, is found, or transacts business; or the venue
is proper under section 1391 of title 28, United States Code. Au-
thorized State officers other than attorney generals may bring a
civil action under subparagraph (a), subject to the same require-
ments under this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph may be
construed to prohibit an authorized State official from initiating or
continuing State court proceedings for violations of a State’s civil
or criminal law.
Subsection (b)(3) would provide that in any action initiated under
this Act, an intermediary or third-party online seller may assert an
affirmative defense if they have (A) established procedures to re-
ceive up-to-date price information, (B) relied on good faith that the
information supplied to them was accurate, and (C) took prompt ac-
tion to correct any false or inaccurate information after receiving
notice.
Subsection (c) would prohibit States (and their political subdivi-
sions) from enforcing any provision having the force and effect of
law that prohibits a covered entity from advertising or displaying
or affects the manner in which a covered entity advertises or dis-
plays a price, and that requires fee disclosure, unless the law re-
quires the total services price to include each service fee (as defined
by this Act), and in accordance with subsection (a)(1). This section
may not be construed to preempt any State law relating to con-
tracts or torts, or any State law relating to fraud.
Subsection (d) would define key terms in this Act. The term
‘‘base service price’’ means the price to obtain the covered service
of the hotel or short-term rental, not including service fees or taxes.
The term ‘‘Commission’’ means the Federal Trade Commission. The
term ‘‘covered entity’’ means a person or partnership that the Com-
mission has jurisdiction over, including hotels, third-party online
sellers, or an intermediary. The term ‘‘covered services’’ means the
temporary provision of a room, building, or other lodging. Such
term does not include the provision of a meeting room, banquet
services, or catering services. The term ‘‘hotel’’ means an establish-
ment that provides a covered service and promotes such service.
The term ‘‘intermediary’’ means an entity that operates as either
business-facing, consumer-facing, or both and displays a price for
covered entities or a price comparison service for covered services.
The term ‘‘optional product or service’’ means a product or service
that an individual does not need to purchase for use of covered
services. The term ‘‘service fee’’ means a charge from a covered en-
tity necessary for covered services and does not include any govern-
ment taxes or fees or any optional fees. The term ‘‘short-term rent-

States, the District of Columbia, and any territory of the United

with respect to a hotel in a transaction on the internet. The term
