INSURE CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2025
JUNE9, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 245]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 245) to require the Assistant Sec-
retary of Commerce for Communications and Information to estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance, to require dissemination
of informative resources for issuers and customers of cyber insur-
ance, and for other purposes, having considered the same, reports
favorably thereon without amendment and recommends that the
bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 245 is to direct the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration (NTIA) to establish a
working group on cyber insurance, to produce a report on cyber in-
surance, and to require dissemination of informative resources for
issuers and customers of cyber insurance.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Over the past 5 years, cyberattacks on U.S. businesses and orga-
nizations have surged1 with ransomware and data breaches among
the most common cyber incidents impacting businesses and con-
sumers.2 Between 2022 and 2023, ransomware attacks in the

Report, April 2024, (https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3Report.pdf).

direct reported losses from cyberattacks are small, around $0.5 million, but the risk of extreme

United States rose by 74 percent.3 As of October 2024, the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence reported the United States
was on track to exceed 2023’s record-number of ransomware at-
tacks.4 Meanwhile, the rate of data breaches from cyber incidents
in 2024 also remains high with 3,158 data breach incidents—on
par with the rate of incidents in 2023, which also marked an all-
time high.5
There is a direct connection between cyberattacks and data
breaches. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center’s Data
Breach report released in January 2025, cyberattacks are the root
cause of many data breaches.6
Cyberattacks and data breaches have significant financial and
operational impacts. In the past two decades, nearly one-fifth of re-
ported cyber incidents have affected the global financial sector,
causing $12 billion in direct losses to financial firms, according to
the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Global Financial Stability
Report. Since 2020, direct losses amounted to an estimated $2.5 bil-
lion.7 In 2023, the average data breach cost for businesses climbed
higher than ever, to $4.45 million, according to IBM’s Annual Data
Breach Report. A majority (60 percent) of small businesses say cy-
bersecurity threats, including phishing, malware, and ransomware,
are a top concern.8
Considering the growing threat and cost of cyberattacks, private
companies are increasingly turning to cyber insurance as part of
their organization’s large cybersecurity strategy. There is a rising
demand for cyber insurance among small and medium-sized enter-
prises, as 72 percent without cyber insurance say a major
cyberattack could destroy their business.9
As part of an organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy, cyber
insurance can provide both financial protection and a framework
for companies’ cyber risk management strategy. Benefits of cyber
insurance include:
• Lowering the cost to a business in the event of a data breach
or cyberattack by helping cover costs related to data recovery,
legal fees, regulatory fines, and public relations efforts;
• Requiring organizations to assess their cybersecurity posture
before purchasing a cyber insurance policy, and encouraging
companies to proactively assess, identify, and address cyberse-
curity risks;
losses-at least as large as $2.5 billion-has increased. See International Monetary Fund, Global
Financial Stability Report: The Last Mile: Financial Vulnerabilities and Risks, chapter 3,
April 16, 2024 (https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/GFSR/2024/April/English/

• Assisting companies with cyber incident responses by con-
necting companies to experts and resources; and
• Providing insurance customers with ongoing best practices for
their cybersecurity posture.
Currently, the details of cyber insurance coverage are often hard
to understand, according to a 2021 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, which found that ambiguity in policy language can re-
sult in misunderstandings and litigation between issuers and pol-
icyholders and that many customers, especially smaller businesses,
may underestimate the coverage they need to protect against cyber
risks.10
According to the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC),
there are also other challenges to the insurance industry and cus-
tomers to ensuring cybersecurity coverage effectively models,
prices, and understands risk to stabilize the industry and its cov-
erage.11 To address this challenge, the CSC recommended that
Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and
the private sector address the gaps in data sets, best practices, and
information to help inform insurers and consider convening a work-
ing group with stakeholders, including insurance companies and
cyber risk modeling companies to collaborate in pooling and
leveraging available statistics and data that can inform innovations
in cyber risk modeling.
This bill would develop additional resources to better inform cy-
bersecurity insurance customers, particularly small businesses, and
also develop additional insights pertaining to measuring cyber risk
and cyber insurance costs and how to bring down those risks and
costs in the future.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 245 would do the following:
• Require the Assistant Secretary to create a working group that
will develop information about cyber insurance to help inform
and assist issuers, agents, brokers, and customers in their un-
derstanding of cyber insurance and to improve communication
over cybersecurity insurance coverage levels.
• Direct the working group to gather input from insurers on
what measures could improve their ability to offer additional
coverage policies including: (1) improvements to their actuarial
data and cyber risk data; (2) the development of effective infor-
mation sharing mechanisms; and (3) accurate measures of cus-
tomers’ cybersecurity practices.
• Direct the working group to identify what measures could re-
duce the cost of policies and reduce the amount of cyber risk
and cyber incidents.
• Require that no later than 1 year after the working group first
convenes that the working group submit to Congress a report
describing its activities and recommendations, upon which
time the group would terminate.

• Provide that nothing in the working group report submitted to
Congress shall be construed to require adoption of the working
group’s recommendations or provide any authority to any
member of the working group or any other individual to regu-
late the business of insurance that is not already provided
under any other provision of law.
• Require, no later than 90 days after the working group sub-
mits the cyber insurance report to Congress, that the Assistant
Secretary and NTIA to disseminate and make publicly avail-
able the informative resources developed by the working group.
• Provide that the Assistant Secretary of NTIA’s dissemination
of the informative resources developed by the working group
not be construed as requiring the use of such resources.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 245 was introduced on January 24, 2025, by Senator
Hickenlooper (for himself and Senator Capito) and was referred to
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Execu-
tive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 245 to be reported favor-
ably without amendment.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.

S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-
mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-
facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included

in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in

Section 3:
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticker issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-

funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would
occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most
ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited
from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 245 would not create any new programs and would have no
additional regulatory impact. The bill would result in minimal ad-
ditional reporting requirements because the working group is di-
rected to gather input from insurance issuers.
Economic Impact
S. 245 would have no economic impact.
Privacy
S. 245 is not expected to have an impact on privacy.
Paperwork
S. 245 would have no further impact on the paperwork required
from individuals and businesses, with the exception of the input di-
rected to be gathered by the working group from insurance issuers.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

INSURE CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2025
JUNE9, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 245]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 245) to require the Assistant Sec-
retary of Commerce for Communications and Information to estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance, to require dissemination
of informative resources for issuers and customers of cyber insur-
ance, and for other purposes, having considered the same, reports
favorably thereon without amendment and recommends that the
bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 245 is to direct the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration (NTIA) to establish a
working group on cyber insurance, to produce a report on cyber in-
surance, and to require dissemination of informative resources for
issuers and customers of cyber insurance.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Over the past 5 years, cyberattacks on U.S. businesses and orga-
nizations have surged1 with ransomware and data breaches among
the most common cyber incidents impacting businesses and con-
sumers.2 Between 2022 and 2023, ransomware attacks in the

Report, April 2024, (https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3Report.pdf).

direct reported losses from cyberattacks are small, around $0.5 million, but the risk of extreme

United States rose by 74 percent.3 As of October 2024, the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence reported the United States
was on track to exceed 2023’s record-number of ransomware at-
tacks.4 Meanwhile, the rate of data breaches from cyber incidents
in 2024 also remains high with 3,158 data breach incidents—on
par with the rate of incidents in 2023, which also marked an all-
time high.5
There is a direct connection between cyberattacks and data
breaches. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center’s Data
Breach report released in January 2025, cyberattacks are the root
cause of many data breaches.6
Cyberattacks and data breaches have significant financial and
operational impacts. In the past two decades, nearly one-fifth of re-
ported cyber incidents have affected the global financial sector,
causing $12 billion in direct losses to financial firms, according to
the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Global Financial Stability
Report. Since 2020, direct losses amounted to an estimated $2.5 bil-
lion.7 In 2023, the average data breach cost for businesses climbed
higher than ever, to $4.45 million, according to IBM’s Annual Data
Breach Report. A majority (60 percent) of small businesses say cy-
bersecurity threats, including phishing, malware, and ransomware,
are a top concern.8
Considering the growing threat and cost of cyberattacks, private
companies are increasingly turning to cyber insurance as part of
their organization’s large cybersecurity strategy. There is a rising
demand for cyber insurance among small and medium-sized enter-
prises, as 72 percent without cyber insurance say a major
cyberattack could destroy their business.9
As part of an organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy, cyber
insurance can provide both financial protection and a framework
for companies’ cyber risk management strategy. Benefits of cyber
insurance include:
• Lowering the cost to a business in the event of a data breach
or cyberattack by helping cover costs related to data recovery,
legal fees, regulatory fines, and public relations efforts;
• Requiring organizations to assess their cybersecurity posture
before purchasing a cyber insurance policy, and encouraging
companies to proactively assess, identify, and address cyberse-
curity risks;
losses-at least as large as $2.5 billion-has increased. See International Monetary Fund, Global
Financial Stability Report: The Last Mile: Financial Vulnerabilities and Risks, chapter 3,

• Assisting companies with cyber incident responses by con-
necting companies to experts and resources; and
• Providing insurance customers with ongoing best practices for
their cybersecurity posture.
Currently, the details of cyber insurance coverage are often hard
to understand, according to a 2021 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, which found that ambiguity in policy language can re-
sult in misunderstandings and litigation between issuers and pol-
icyholders and that many customers, especially smaller businesses,
may underestimate the coverage they need to protect against cyber
risks.10
According to the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC),
there are also other challenges to the insurance industry and cus-
tomers to ensuring cybersecurity coverage effectively models,
prices, and understands risk to stabilize the industry and its cov-
erage.11 To address this challenge, the CSC recommended that
Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and
the private sector address the gaps in data sets, best practices, and
information to help inform insurers and consider convening a work-
ing group with stakeholders, including insurance companies and
cyber risk modeling companies to collaborate in pooling and
leveraging available statistics and data that can inform innovations
in cyber risk modeling.
This bill would develop additional resources to better inform cy-
bersecurity insurance customers, particularly small businesses, and
also develop additional insights pertaining to measuring cyber risk
and cyber insurance costs and how to bring down those risks and
costs in the future.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 245 would do the following:
• Require the Assistant Secretary to create a working group that
will develop information about cyber insurance to help inform
and assist issuers, agents, brokers, and customers in their un-
derstanding of cyber insurance and to improve communication
over cybersecurity insurance coverage levels.
• Direct the working group to gather input from insurers on
what measures could improve their ability to offer additional
coverage policies including: (1) improvements to their actuarial
data and cyber risk data; (2) the development of effective infor-
mation sharing mechanisms; and (3) accurate measures of cus-
tomers’ cybersecurity practices.
• Direct the working group to identify what measures could re-
duce the cost of policies and reduce the amount of cyber risk
and cyber incidents.
• Require that no later than 1 year after the working group first
convenes that the working group submit to Congress a report
describing its activities and recommendations, upon which
time the group would terminate.

• Provide that nothing in the working group report submitted to
Congress shall be construed to require adoption of the working
group’s recommendations or provide any authority to any
member of the working group or any other individual to regu-
late the business of insurance that is not already provided
under any other provision of law.
• Require, no later than 90 days after the working group sub-
mits the cyber insurance report to Congress, that the Assistant
Secretary and NTIA to disseminate and make publicly avail-
able the informative resources developed by the working group.
• Provide that the Assistant Secretary of NTIA’s dissemination
of the informative resources developed by the working group
not be construed as requiring the use of such resources.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 245 was introduced on January 24, 2025, by Senator
Hickenlooper (for himself and Senator Capito) and was referred to
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Execu-
tive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 245 to be reported favor-
ably without amendment.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.

S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-
mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-
facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included

in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticker issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-

funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would
occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most
ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited
from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 245 would not create any new programs and would have no
additional regulatory impact. The bill would result in minimal ad-
ditional reporting requirements because the working group is di-
rected to gather input from insurance issuers.
Economic Impact
S. 245 would have no economic impact.
Privacy
S. 245 is not expected to have an impact on privacy.
Paperwork
S. 245 would have no further impact on the paperwork required
from individuals and businesses, with the exception of the input di-
rected to be gathered by the working group from insurance issuers.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘In-
sure Cybersecurity Act of 2025’’.

Subsection (c) would direct the working group to define the term
‘‘cyber insurance’’ and do the following:
• Analyze and explain relevant terminology, common types of
cyber incidents, common customer responses, coverage for
losses, and constraints by issuers;
• Develop information on coverage policies and information for
insurers on communicating policies;
• Gather input on policy improvements;
• Identify ways to reduce costs and risks; and
• Develop recommendations for customers.
This section would also direct the working group to engage in
public consultations with relevant stakeholders.
Subsection (d) would require the working group, no later than 1
year after first convening, to submit to Congress a report regarding
the activities of the working group under subsection (c) and any
recommendations of the working group.
Subsection (e) would require that upon submitting the cyber in-
surance report required under subsection (d) the working group
would terminate.
Subsection (f) would provide that nothing in the section shall be
construed to require adoption of the working group’s recommenda-
tions or provide any authority to any member of the working group
or any other individual to regulate the business of insurance that
is not already provided under any other provision of law.
Section 4. Dissemination of informative resources for cyber insur-
ance stakeholders.
Subsection (a) would require the Assistant Secretary to dissemi-
nate and make publicly available informative resources for cyber
insurance stakeholders no later than 90 days after the working
group submits the report to Congress.
Subsection (b) would provide the requirements for carrying out
subsection (a), specifically, that the Assistant Secretary would en-
sure the resources distributed: (1) incorporate the recommendations
of the cyber insurance report; (2) are generally applicable to cyber
insurance stakeholders; and (3) include case studies and examples
where appropriate.
Subsection (c) would require the resources disseminated by the
Assistant Secretary be published on the NTIA’s website.
Subsection (d) would require that the Assistant Secretary con-
duct outreach and coordination to promote the resources produced
and made available.
Subsection (e) would provide that nothing in this section may be
construed to require the use of the resources disseminated by the
Assistant Secretary.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
