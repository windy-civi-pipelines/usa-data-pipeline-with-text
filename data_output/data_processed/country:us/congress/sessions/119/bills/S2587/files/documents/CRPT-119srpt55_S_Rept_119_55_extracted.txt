COMMITTEE REPORT FOR DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR,
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND
RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 2026
SUMMARY OF BUDGET ESTIMATES AND COMMITTEE
RECOMMENDATIONS
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee recommends total budget au-
thority of $1,713,436,053,000 for the Departments of Labor, Health
and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. This
amount includes $196,974,000,000 in current year base discre-
tionary funding consistent with the subcommittee’s allocation. In
addition, the bill includes $3,104,000,000 in program integrity allo-
cation adjustments.
Fiscal year 2025 levels cited in this Committee Report reflect the
enacted amounts in Public Law 119–4, the Full-Year Continuing
Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, adjusted for com-
parability where noted.
BILL-WIDE DIRECTIVES
The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Re-
lated Agencies [Labor-HHS–Education] appropriations bill con-
stitutes the largest share of non-defense discretionary funding and
supports critical investments in a wide range of areas including
early learning, substance use and mental health, biomedical re-
search, public health and preparedness, elementary and secondary
education, higher education, workforce development, and social se-
curity, among many others.
This Committee Report provides additional direction and speci-
ficity on the uses of funds provided in this bill. During fiscal year
2026, for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Def-
icit Control Act of 1985, as amended, with respect to appropriations
contained in the accompanying bill, the terms ‘‘program, project,
and activity’’ [PPA] shall mean any item for which a dollar amount
is contained in appropriations acts (including joint resolutions pro-
viding continuing appropriations) or accompanying reports of the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, or accompanying
conference reports and joint explanatory statements of the com-
mittee of conference. The Committee expects agencies to submit
any reprogramming or transfer requests in compliance with re-
quirements of this act and to provide a thorough explanation of the
proposed reallocations, including a detailed justification of in-
creases and reductions. The Committee expects each agency to
manage the expenditures of its programs and activities to remain
within the amounts appropriated by Congress.
The Committee also continues the longstanding requirement that
each agency submit an operating plan to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after enact-
(7)
8
ment of this act, in order to establish the baseline for application
of reprogramming and transfer authorities provided in this act. The
operating plan should include at minimum funding for PPAs as
specified above.
The Committee continues to appreciate the close working rela-
tionship with the various budget offices of the agencies funded in
this bill. Maintaining these relationships is critical for the Com-
mittee to perform its duties in both developing these funding re-
quirements and recommendations and providing oversight over the
execution of funds.
Finally, each reference to the Committees or Committees on Ap-
propriations in this Committee Report, unless otherwise noted, is
to the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies and the
Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies.
Agency Performance Reports.—The Committee looks forward to
receiving the fiscal year 2025 Agency Performance Reports from
the Departments and agencies funded in this act. Not later than
45 days after enactment of this act, the Committee directs the De-
partments funded in this act and CNCS to provide a briefing on
their strategic plan goals for fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2026
and the actions the Departments and CNCS have taken or plan to
take to meet those goals, including through any planned workforce,
programmatic (including planned programmatic reviews), and orga-
nizational changes and how the Departments and CNCS deter-
mined those changes would improve direct services and grantee
oversight and support.
Consultation and Briefing Requirement.—The Committee directs
the Departments funded in this act and CNCS to consult with the
Committee on any actions expected to significantly increase or de-
crease current or future costs of programs they administer. In addi-
tion, the Committee directs the Departments funded in this act and
CNCS to consult with the Committee on any execution action re-
lated to any program or activity for which a directive is included
in this report not later than 4 weeks prior to a public announce-
ment related to such action. Further, the Committee directs the
Departments funded in this act and CNCS to brief the Committee
on any action covered by this consultation requirement, including
consideration and incorporation of feedback during such initial con-
sultation, not later than 1 week prior to a public announcement re-
lated to such action. This paragraph does not replace a more spe-
cific directive for a program or activity included in this report.
Final Spend Report.—The Committee directs the Departments
funded in this act and CNCS to submit a report to the Committees
at the conclusion of the fiscal year providing details on all entities
awarded funding, selection criteria used, and the funding amount
for each grant or contract awarded for each competitive grant pro-
gram funded under this act.
Grant Process.—The Departments and agencies funded in this
act provide grants that support important activities—from bio-
medical research to workforce training to substance use treatment
services to education for students with disabilities—that touch the
lives of millions of Americans in communities across the country.
9
Accordingly, it is critical that the Federal grant making process is
implemented in a timely, efficient, and consistent manner. The
Committee directs the Departments funded in this act and CNCS
to ensure that funding opportunity announcements are posted, non-
competing continuation awards are made, new grants are awarded,
and funding is disbursed all in a timely, efficient, and consistent
manner.
The Committee directs the Departments funded in this act and
CNCS to post publicly on their Website a listing of all of the no-
tices of funding opportunities they plan to announce for the subse-
quent 6 months and the estimated award date of funding under
those notices, and update such information no less than monthly
thereafter. The Committee also directs the Departments funded in
this act and CNCS, to adjust internal competitive grant timelines
as necessary to ensure when funding opportunities are announced
and when funding is awarded aligns with a program’s purpose, for
example that Department of Education funding generally aligns
with school years, and to the extent practicable provide applicants
with a minimum of 60 days to apply for most funding opportuni-
ties. The Committee also directs the Departments funded in this
act and CNCS to provide a report to the Committees listing all
grants during the previous month for which a scheduled non-com-
peting continuation award was not made within 14 days of the end
of the previous period of performance, including an explanation for
the delay. Finally the Committee directs the Departments funded
in this act and CNCS to ensure grant recipients do not experience
unjustified delays in drawing down grant funds.
The Committee requests GAO conduct targeted reviews of the
grant processes at specific agencies funded in this act and make
recommendations to improve efficiencies that could apply broadly
to prevent unnecessary disruptions for grantees and maximize the
benefits to intended beneficiaries of Federal programs.
Grant Terminations.—The Committee has long required advance
notification prior to issuing grant awards, and includes a new com-
parable requirement for advance notification prior to terminating
grants. The Committee directs the Departments funded in this act
and CNCS to provide a report within 120 days of enactment of this
act of all grants that were terminated or discontinued in fiscal year
2025, including a justification for the termination or discontinu-
ation, and any grants that were subsequently reinstated or par-
tially reinstated. The Committee directs the Departments funded
in this act and CNCS to include a timely appeals process for such
actions, and provide a decision on any appeals within 30 days.
Lifesaving Safety Stations.—The Committee is encouraged by the
General Services Administration’s Bulletin FMR C–2024–01, ‘‘Safe-
ty Station Program Guidelines in Federal Facilities’’ that was
issued on December 21, 2023. The Committee encourages all De-
partments covered in this act to implement these guidelines and
establish safety stations in each public building that include auto-
mated external defibrillators, opioid reversal agents, and hemor-
rhagic control programs and requests a briefing from each Depart-
ment within 90 days of enactment of this act on progress towards
implementing these guidelines.
10
Trust and Treaty Responsibilities.—The Committee reminds
agencies funded by this act of their obligation to uphold the Fed-
eral trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes and Federal obliga-
tions to the Native Hawaiian Community. This includes upholding
treaty and reserved rights, and any other rights and obligations
under Federal law; supporting self-determination efforts by Native
communities; fulfilling obligations under Presidential Memoranda
and Executive Orders; and conducting early and robust govern-
ment-to-government consultation with Tribes, and meaningful out-
reach and engagement with Native Hawaiians.
National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.—The Committee also
directs the Secretary of Education, Secretary of Health and Human
Services, and Secretary of Labor to release public reports detailing
how the Departments are addressing antisemitism, including by
implementing the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.
Timely Access for Inspectors General.—The Committee reminds
departments and agencies funded by this act that the Inspector
General Act authorizes the Offices of the Inspector General funded
by this act ‘‘to have timely access to all records, reports, audits, re-
views, documents, papers, recommendations, or other materials
available’’ related to ‘‘programs and operations’’ and expects such
departments and agencies to meet this requirement and not im-
pede the work of Inspectors General to carry out their statutory re-
sponsibilities.
Voter Registration and Participation.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of Education, Secretary of Health and Human Services,
and Secretary of Labor to brief the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of this act
regarding any strategic plans developed by the Department over
the three prior fiscal years outlining the ways that the Department
has promoted voter registration, and voter participation.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
Any references in this title of the report to the ‘‘Secretary’’ or the
‘‘Department’’ shall be interpreted to mean the Secretary of Labor
or the Department of Labor, respectively, unless otherwise noted.
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION
TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,898,587,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,977,088,000
The Training and Employment Services [TES] account provides
funding primarily for activities under the Workforce Innovation
and Opportunity Act [WIOA] (Public Law 113–128), and is a decen-
tralized, integrated system of skill training and related services de-
signed to enhance the employment and earnings of economically
disadvantaged and dislocated workers. Funds provided for many
training programs for fiscal year 2026 will support the program
from July 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027. A portion of this ac-
count’s funding, $1,772,000,000, becomes available on October 1,
2026, for the 2026 program year.
Advanced Robotics Manufacturing.—The Committee recognizes
the need for workforce training and certificate programs targeting
collaborative robotics and additive manufacturing to adequately
prepare the current and future workforce for the challenges of to-
morrow. The Committee encourages the Department to appro-
priately address this need through the prioritization of such pro-
grams, with an emphasis on programs that re-skill incumbent
manufacturing workers.
Apprenticeship Grants.—The Committee supports the expansion
of apprenticeship opportunities and notes that they can often pro-
vide more affordable pathways to high-paying jobs. Not later than
180 days after the enactment of this act, the Department shall pub-
licly disclose on its website grantees receiving funding under the
Apprenticeship Program from the previous program year, the num-
ber of apprentices attributable to each grantee, and the respective
employment and earnings outcomes of program participants as re-
quired under section 116(b)(2)(A)(i) of WIOA. The Committee di-
rects the Department to provide information related to apprentice-
ship grants, including all currently active grants and contracts, and
data dashboards that allow for search and comparison of such data,
including data on credentials earned through or as a result of ap-
prenticeships. The Department shall make updates to apprentice-
ship.gov at least quarterly and shall include up to date information
on grants and contracts. Additionally, the Department shall report
to the Committee on the extent to which it is engaging with the
(11)
12
Department of Education to address mismatches between worker
skills or their participation in the labor force and employer needs
and the steps that the Department has taken or plans to take to
study the drivers of skills’ mismatches, workforce shortages, pro-
ductivity fluctuations, turnover fluctuations, stagnant wages, and
poor working conditions across occupations, industries, and the
economy as a whole.
Communities Affected by Substance Use.—The Committee con-
tinues to encourage the Secretary to prioritize funding for grants
to serve or retrain workers in communities impacted by the health
and economic effects of widespread substance use, including meth-
amphetamine use, addiction, and overdose.
Creative Economy.—The Committee recognizes that the creative
economy was severely impacted by COVID–19 and encourages the
Department to partner with the National Endowment for the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Humanities to explore the
feasibility and expansion of Registered Apprenticeship programs
for creative workers who previously received income through cre-
ative, cultural, or artistic-based pursuits to produce ideas, content,
goods, and services, without regard to whether such income is
earned through employment as an independent contractor or as an
employee for an employer.
Improving Access to Available Benefits.—The Committee recog-
nizes that one-stop customers often face significant barriers to pur-
suing training and employment, including lack of access to quality
childcare, food and nutrition, and medical services. Further, the
Committee is concerned that the complexity of supportive services
program eligibility requirements and application processes may dis-
courage enrollment. To optimize use of Federal funds, the Com-
mittee encourages the Department, in coordination with the De-
partment of Education and the Department of Health and Human
Services, to provide guidance on informing one-stop center cus-
tomers about the availability, including eligibility requirements, of
supportive services or assistance, including Medicaid, the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Earned Income Tax
Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families Program, and on referring customers to such serv-
ices or assistance. Further, guidance should clarify how one-stops
can assist customers in establishing eligibility for financial aid as-
sistance programs related to education and training programs that
are funded outside of WIOA.
Interconnected Workforce Development Technology.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to consider a unified approach
to workforce development by encouraging States to develop digital,
interconnected systems of technologies, maintained by State Work-
force Agencies, to support the growth of skills-based hiring and
competency-based education in order to increase credential comple-
tion and labor force participation.
Laboratory Technicians.—The Committee is concerned by the
Nationwide shortage of trained laboratory technicians. BLS
projects 12,000 new medical laboratory technicians are needed each
year to meet growing demand. According to the American Society
for Clinical Laboratory Science, programs currently graduate just
5,000 laboratorians each year. The Committee encourages the Sec-
13
retary to make funding available to increase the number of quali-
fied laboratory technicians through workforce development.
Modernizing Workforce Development Programming and Serving
Underemployed Workers.—The Committee encourages ETA to col-
laborate with State workforce agencies to modernize workforce de-
velopment programming. The Committee is also concerned about
the continued difficulty of underemployed workers transitioning to
full employment and encourages ETA to explore new avenues for
training, including the use of virtual resources. As part of this ef-
fort, ETA should consider the time constraints of underemployed
workers who may work multiple jobs or have caretaking respon-
sibilities that limit their ability to utilize the existing resources
provided by ETA. Finally, the Committee further encourages the
Department to develop a comprehensive long-term strategy for the
delivery of online training and development programming.
Opportunity Youth.—The Committee continues to encourage the
Department to use funds provided to carry out sections 168(b) and
169(c) of WIOA, which may be used for technical assistance and
demonstration projects, to support demonstration programs that
allow at-risk youth who are out-of-school, have limited work experi-
ence, and live in communities experiencing high rates of unemploy-
ment and high rates of community violence, to participate in the
workforce, including programs that provide such youth with men-
toring services.
Public Libraries.—The Committee continues to encourage ETA to
expand its collaborative work with the Institute of Museum and Li-
brary Services [IMLS] to help States and local boards integrate the
education, employment, and training services provided by public li-
braries into the workforce development system. Libraries can play
a critical role in helping people access benefits and get back to
work and the Committee encourages ETA to work with IMLS to
identify barriers to libraries participating in programs funded
under WIOA and to develop a plan to address those barriers. The
Committee requests a briefing on the plan to identify and address
barriers to libraries participating in programs under WIOA as en-
couraged in Senate Report 118–84.
Pursue Workforce Data Linkages.—The Committee directs the
Department, in coordination with the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Department of Education, and other Federal
agencies that support workforce development programs and that
hold nationwide earnings data, to submit a report to Congress
within 360 days of enactment on how to improve data quality and
transparency regarding participation in and outcomes from Federal
education and training programs, including but not limited to
WIOA, and including pre-participation earnings and employment
measures as well as outcomes reporting beyond a single year post-
exit, while also protecting privacy. The Departments should seek
input from States, data-linkage experts, including members of the
Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence-Building, with knowl-
edge of practices for linking client data with Federal and State
earnings data, data privacy experts, and other relevant stake-
holders. The report should explain what steps can be taken under
current law to implement modernized data infrastructure for work-
force development programs, barriers presented by current stat-
14
utes, regulations, and guidance, as well as legislative changes that
would be necessary to overcome those barriers. The report should
also include steps the Department has taken to implement rec-
ommendations from the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence
Building’s October 2022 final report.
Railroad Workforce Development.—The Committee is concerned
about the workforce needs in the railroad and transit sectors. The
Committee encourages the Department to expand workforce devel-
opment opportunities to address the growing need for additional
workers in the railroad and transit sectors. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to work with the Department of Transpor-
tation and other Federal agencies to support educational opportuni-
ties and workforce training opportunities for high-skill, high-wage,
and high-growth railroad and transit jobs in economically dis-
advantaged areas.
Small Businesses.—The Committee encourages the Department
to support the employment needs of small businesses and entrepre-
neurial skills training through WIOA programs, particularly in un-
derserved, disadvantaged communities.
Submarine Construction Workforce.—The Committee continues to
encourage ETA to collaborate with the Departments of Defense and
Education to address critical workforce needs in the submarine
construction pipeline.
Technology Usage for Workforce Interview Preparation.—The
Committee recognizes the critical role of interview preparation pro-
grams in supporting unemployed individuals, including opportunity
youth, parents, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and formerly
incarcerated individuals—as they transition into the workforce.
The Committee encourages ETA to collaborate with state workforce
agencies to prioritize partnerships with providers utilizing digital
interview preparation programs to enhance workforce readiness,
mitigate persistent unemployment challenges, and reduce strain on
unemployment benefit resources, resulting in substantial cost sav-
ings for States.
Water and Wastewater Operators.—The Committee continues to
be concerned by the Nationwide shortage of water and wastewater
operators, particularly in rural areas, and continues to strongly
urge the Secretary to make funding available through workforce
development and apprenticeship activities funded under this bill
for registered apprenticeship programs consistent with National
Guideline Standards of Apprenticeship for Water and Wastewater
System Operations Specialists and WIOA. The Committee con-
tinues to direct the Department to highlight the availability of
funding opportunities that may support such activities, and to pro-
vide technical assistance and outreach to potential grantees with
an emphasis on sectors that are underrepresented in the appren-
ticeship program and that have demonstrated shortages of workers.
Grants to States
The Committee provides $2,919,332,000 for Training and Em-
ployment Services Grants to States.
Under WIOA, a local board is given up to 100 percent transfer
authority between Adult and Dislocated Worker activities upon ap-
proval of the Governor.
15
Adult Employment and Training.—The Committee provides
$875,649,000 for adult employment and training. Formula funding
is provided to States and further distributed to local workforce in-
vestment areas through one-stop centers. The program provides
employment and training services to disadvantaged, low-skilled,
unemployed, and underemployed adults, including veterans.
Funds are made available in this bill for adult employment and
training activities in program year 2026, which occurs from July 1,
2026, through June 30, 2027. The bill provides that $163,649,000
is available for obligation on July 1, 2026, and that $712,000,000
is available on October 1, 2026. Both categories of funding are
available for obligation through June 30, 2027.
Dislocated Worker Assistance.—The Committee provides
$1,095,553,000 for dislocated worker assistance. This program is a
State-operated effort that provides training services and support to
help permanently separated workers reskill to return to productive
unsubsidized employment. In addition, States must use State-wide
reserve funds for rapid response assistance to help workers affected
by mass layoffs and plant closures. States must also use these
funds to carry out additional State-wide employment and training
activities, such as providing technical assistance to certain low-per-
forming local areas, evaluating State programs, and assisting with
the operation of one-stop delivery systems. States may also use
funds for implementing innovative training programs.
Funds made available in this bill support activities in program
year 2026, which occurs from July 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027.
The bill provides that $235,553,000 is available for obligation on
July 1, 2026, and that $860,000,000 is available on October 1,

Section 2:
2026. Both categories of funding are available for obligation
through June 30, 2027.
Timely Disbursement of Formula Funds.—The Committee notes
the importance of grant recipients receiving timely access to for-
mula funds. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to
obligate formula funding in a timely manner, following the agency’s
historical timelines for such funds.
Youth Training.—The Committee provides $948,130,000 for
youth training. The purpose of this program is to provide low-in-
come youth who are facing barriers to employment with services
that prepare them to succeed in the knowledge-based economy.
Funds are made available for youth training activities in program
year 2026, which occurs from April 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027.
National Programs
Dislocated Worker Assistance National Reserve
The Committee provides $300,859,000 for the Dislocated Worker
Assistance National Reserve, which is available to the Secretary for
activities such as responding to mass layoffs, plant and/or military
base closings, and natural disasters, as well as for technical assist-
ance, training, and demonstration projects.

Automation Impacted Industries.—The Committee continues to
support funding to support demonstration and pilot projects relat-
ing to the training needs of workers who are, or are likely to be-
come, dislocated as a result of automation.
Career Pathways for Youth Grants.—The Committee continues to
recognize that multiple career pathways should be available to
young people. The Committee also recognizes the need for early
workforce readiness, employment, and training opportunities that
help youth develop soft skills, such as responsibility, organization,
and time management, as well as the need to learn workplace safe-
ty. The Committee provides $20,000,000 to utilize the demonstra-
tion grant authority under the dislocated worker national reserve
for grants to support national out-of-school time organizations that
serve youth and teens, and place an emphasis on age-appropriate
workforce readiness programming to expand job training and work-
force pathways for youth and disconnected youth. This program-
ming includes soft skill development, career exploration, men-
toring, job readiness and certification, summer jobs, year-round job
opportunities, and apprenticeships. Funding will also support part-
nerships between workforce investment boards and youth serving
organizations. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to determine the feasibility of utilizing the existing one-stop
infrastructure to develop and execute career pathways for youth at
the local or regional level.
Dislocated Worker National Reserve Grantee Performance Report-
ing.—Consistent with the requirements of section 116(b)(2)(A)(i) of
WIOA (29 U.S.C. 3141), the Committee directs the Department to
require that all grantees receiving awards funded through the Dis-
located Worker National Reserve report on the employment, earn-
ings, and credential attainment outcomes of program participants.
The Committee further directs ETA to include program participant
outcomes disaggregated by grantee on its website.
Employee Ownership Initiative.—The Committee provides
$2,000,000 for grants authorized by section 346(d) of the SECURE

Section 3:
2.0 Act of 2022. Funds will be used to establish and expand em-
ployee ownership programs authorized by such section. The Com-
mittee directs the Employee Benefits Security Administration to
provide subject matter assistance to ETA as it develops and admin-
isters this grant program.
Multi-State National Dislocated Coal Miners Assistance Grant
Program.—The Committee is aware of the difficulties experienced
by dislocated coal miners as a result of continuing energy sector re-
structuring. The Committee continues to strongly support funding
for non-profit organizations that provide employment and training
assistance, as well as related supportive services, to individuals
who are dislocated by coal plant closures or substantial layoffs at
coal mine operations and their immediate family.
Strengthening Community College Training Grants [SCCTG].—
The Committee provides $65,000,000 for SCCTG. This program
builds the capacity of community colleges to address workforce de-
velopment needs in in-demand industries and career pathways
17
leading to quality jobs and to expand evidence-based solutions to
addressing such needs.
Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities.—The Committee
provides $50,000,000 for the Workforce Opportunity for Rural Com-
munities program, to provide enhanced worker training in the Ap-
palachian, Delta, and Northern Border regions. These funds pro-
vide reemployment and training assistance to dislocated workers in
rural areas to help them adapt existing skills and learn new ones
demanded by growing industries. The Committee strongly encour-
ages the Department to develop funding opportunity announce-
ments and make grant awards in coordination with the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission [ARC], Delta Regional Authority
[DRA], and Northern Border Regional Commission [NBRC], for
which each award shall not exceed $1,500,000. Within the total,
the Committee provides $21,750,000 for grants in areas served by
the ARC, $21,750,000 for areas served by the DRA, and $6,500,000
for areas served by the NBRC.
Indian and Native American Programs
The Committee provides $60,000,000 for Indian and Native
American Programs. These programs are designed to improve the
academic, occupational, and literacy skills of Native Americans,
Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians to aid the participants in
securing permanent, unsubsidized employment. Allowable training
services include adult basic education, general educational develop-
ment attainment, literacy training, English language training, re-
medial education, and career and technical education.
The Committee supports the effective implementation of the In-
dian and Native American programs. The Committee directs the
Department to ensure new members of the Native American Em-
ployment and Training Council [NAETC] are selected as expedi-
tiously as possible to avoid vacancies on the NAETC.
Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs
The Committee provides $97,396,000 for migrant and seasonal
farmworkers programs, which serve members of economically dis-
advantaged families whose principal livelihood is derived from mi-
gratory and other forms of seasonal farm work, fishing, or logging
activities. Enrollees and their families are provided with employ-
ment, training, and related services intended to prepare them for
stable, year-round employment within and outside of the agri-
culture industry.
The Committee provides that $90,134,000 be used for State serv-
ice area grants. The Committee also provides bill language direct-
ing that $6,591,000 be used for migrant and seasonal farmworker
housing grants, of which not less than 70 percent shall be for per-
manent housing. The principal purpose of these funds is to con-
tinue the network of local farmworker housing organizations work-
ing on permanent housing solutions for migrant and seasonal farm-
workers. The Committee also provides $671,000 to be used for
training, technical assistance, and related activities, including
funds for migrant rest center activities under section 167 of WIOA.
The Committee recognizes the value of this program in serving
the entire nation and directs the Department to ensure no state is
18
prohibited from applying for funds under migrant and seasonal
farmworker programs if such state otherwise meets eligibility cri-
teria outlined in statute.
YouthBuild
The Committee provides $105,000,000 for YouthBuild, which
helps provide disconnected youth with work readiness and indus-
try-driven credential attainment opportunities.
The Committee encourages the Department to ensure
YouthBuild grants reach geographically diverse areas, including
rural areas.
Reentry Employment Opportunities [REO]
The Committee provides $110,000,000 for the REO program, in-
cluding $30,000,000 for national and regional intermediaries. The
REO program provides current or formerly incarcerated youth and
adults involved in the justice system with occupational skills train-
ing that leads to industry recognized credentials and apprentice-
ships leading to employment in good, well-paying jobs and careers
with opportunities for advancement. Programs are carried out di-
rectly through State and local governmental entities and commu-
nity-based organizations, as well as indirectly through inter-
mediary organizations.
The Committee directs the Department to ensure grantees estab-
lish formal partnerships with employers and that program partici-
pants receive industry recognized credentials and training in fields
that prepare them for successful reintegration, including ensuring
participants receive training and credentials in fields where their
record is not a barrier to entry or continued employment. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department to consider the needs of commu-
nities that have recently experienced significant unrest.
Apprenticeship Grants
The Committee provides $285,000,000 for Apprenticeship Grants.
The Committee continues to support the prioritization of funding
to expand registered apprenticeships into new industries and for
underserved or underrepresented populations. The Committee sup-
ports the use of apprenticeship grants that provide worker edu-
cation in in-demand and emerging fields, including first responder;
disaster resilience, response, and recovery; utility (energy and
water) and resource management; transportation and infrastruc-
ture; goods movement sectors such as global logistics, rail and
other freight-related employment; technology and outdoor recre-
ation economy-related employment. The Committee also encourages
the Department to support apprenticeship opportunities that incor-
porate non-traditional industries, while providing appropriate flexi-
bility for such industries. Further, the Committee encourages the
Department to fund apprenticeship opportunities in local commu-
nities that have high rates of unemployment and high rates of com-
munity violence.
Pay for Success.—The Committee looks forward to the Depart-
ment’s assessment of the feasibility of supporting a pay-for-success
initiative as directed in the fiscal year 2024 explanatory statement.
19
School Administrator Apprenticeships.—The Committee is en-
couraged by the Department’s decision to make school administra-
tors eligible for apprenticeship training and assistance. The De-
partment should provide additional funding to further establish
and implement a leadership development apprenticeship program
to help educators advance their careers, address school principal
and superintendent shortages, and meet growing demand.
Workforce Data Quality Initiative
The Committee provides $6,000,000 for the Workforce Data
Quality Initiative, which provides competitive grants to support
States in developing, connecting, and enhancing their longitudinal
data systems that integrate education and workforce data. This
supports evaluation and research on the effectiveness of education
and workforce programs, and helps provide consumer-friendly in-
formation so that individuals can select the programs that best
meet their needs.
Workforce Data Innovation and Transparency.—The Committee
recognizes the need to encourage innovation at the state level to
improve data collection and accuracy. The Committee supports the
work of the Workforce Data Quality Initiative to increase data
transparency, enhance workforce delivery services, and help con-
nect individuals to careers.
Congressionally Directed Spending
The Committee provides $93,501,000 for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table at the end of this Committee Re-
port.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act and every 60 days there-
after, the Committee directs the Department to provide a report de-
tailing the status of CDS funding for fiscal year 2026. Such a re-
port shall be presented in Excel format and include a project de-
scription, requestors, the type of award, total obligations, total dis-
bursements, and the percent disbursed.
JOB CORPS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,760,155,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,760,155,000
The Committee provides $1,603,325,000 for operations of Job
Corps centers.
The Committee provides $33,830,000 for administrative costs.
The Committee provides a total of $123,000,000 in construction,
renovation, and acquisition [CRA] funds. This amount is available
from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2029. The Committee continues bill
language allowing the Secretary to transfer up to 15 percent of
CRA funds, if necessary, to meet the operational needs of Job
Corps centers or to achieve administrative efficiencies. The bill con-
tinues to require the Secretary to notify the Committees at least
15 days in advance of any transfer. Any such notification shall in-
clude a justification.
Background Checks.—The Committee is concerned that the
pause in processing background checks for Job Corps applicants
has had a detrimental impact on young people and on the efficient
operations of the program. The Committee directs the Secretary to
20
immediately resume processing background checks and provide a
briefing on the number of background checks requested, the num-
ber of background checks completed, and the number of new stu-
dents enrolled in Job Corps programs. Additionally, the Committee
directs the Department to issue interim guidance authorizing Job
Corps center operators to utilize alternative background check and
vetting services that meet the requirements of 29 U.S.C.
3195(b)(1)(C] in order to immediately resume student enrollment.
The Committee further directs the Department to submit a report
within 60 days of enactment outlining the steps it has taken to im-
plement this authority and any remaining barriers to center-level
intake and enrollment.
Continuous Campus Improvement.—The Committee encourages
the Department to develop a process involving Job Corps youth
service providers for setting achievable campus performance expec-
tations in order to more effectively drive continuous improvement
in student outcomes.
COVID Staffing Determinations.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to fully rescind COVID-era policies related to staffing de-
cisions. The Committee encourages the Department to work with
Job Corps operators and other experts to make staffing determina-
tions based on State requirements, budgetary outlooks, and which
staffing levels will produce the highest-quality student outcomes.
Homeless Youth.—The Committee continues to strongly encour-
age the Department to streamline application requirements for
homeless youth in Job Corps.
Maximizing Employer Partnerships.—The Committee applauds
the Department’s efforts to develop relationships between Job
Corps and employers associated with our Nation’s strategic prior-
ities including infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and the de-
fense industrial base. The Committee encourages the Department
to fully leverage section 158(f) of WIOA to maximize the resources
available to campuses to develop these partnerships and meet em-
ployers’ needs.
Rural Training Sites.—The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to support and incentivize high quality center operators to de-
velop and enhance partnerships with existing rural training sites
to enhance opportunities and work experiences for students in un-
derserved rural or remote communities. Such rural partnerships
should use student-focused industry-backed curricula, prepare stu-
dents for employment in high-demand fields, offer students the op-
portunity to take coursework leading to college credit, and dem-
onstrate strong employer partnerships within the region in which
the center is located. Such partnerships will also promote the abil-
ity of Job Corps centers to meet local workforce and cultural needs
in communities far removed from their locations.
Status Updates on Atlanta Job Corps Center.—Congress has pre-
viously provided funding for the construction of the new Atlanta
Job Corps center. The Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide a semi-annual report to the Committee on the status of the
construction of the Atlanta Job Corps Center. The report should be
made available online and should include relevant resources of-
fered by the Department, including other Job Corps opportunities
21
for young people in the Atlanta Job Corps Center service area
while the Atlanta Job Corps Center is completed.
Substance Use and Behavioral Health.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the increase in overdoses and deaths among youth re-
sulting from drug use, including fentanyl. The Committee requests
the Department make recommendations, including legislative
changes, to address substance use and behavioral health challenges
of Job Corps participants in its fiscal year 2027 CJ.
COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $405,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 395,000,000
Community Service Employment for Older Americans [CSEOA]
provides part-time employment in community service activities and
work-based training for unemployed, low-income persons aged 55
and older to help increase the number of such persons who obtain
unsubsidized employment. The Committee provides $395,000,000
for CSEOA.
The Committee encourages the Department to reserve amounts
proportionate to the Pacific Islander and Asian American and the
Indian populations for national grants to national Pacific Island
and Asian American and Indian aging organizations who have a
track record of reaching, in a linguistically and culturally com-
petent manner, this underserved population of older workers across
the country with significant barriers to employment. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department to provide an update in the fis-
cal year 2027 CJ on how recipients of funding under title V of the
Older Americans Act of 1965 [OAA] are serving older individuals
who are Native American and Pacific Islander and Asian American
with such funding.
FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $33,900,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 50,300,000
The Committee provides mandatory funds for the Federal unem-
ployment benefits and allowances program that assists workers
who have been adversely affected by international trade by retrain-
ing for new careers and updating their skills. The Trade Adjust-
ment Assistance program provides benefits and services to help
participants find a path back into middle-class jobs, improve earn-
ings, and increase credential and education rates. TAA provides
benefits and services to those who qualify, to include job training,
job search and relocation allowances, and wage supplements for
workers age 50 and older.
The Committee notes that while the Department may not issue
any determinations and may not accept any new petitions or re-
quests for reconsideration, workers who were certified and sepa-
rated from their job on or before June 30, 2022, may still be eligible
for benefits and services.
22
STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE
OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,012,150,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,081,150,000
The Committee provides $4,002,084,000 authorized to be drawn
from the Employment Security Administration account of the Un-
employment Trust Fund and $79,066,000 to be provided from the
general fund of the Treasury.
The funds in this account are used to provide administrative
grants and assistance to State agencies that administer Federal
and State unemployment compensation laws and operate the public
employment service.
Unemployment Insurance
The Committee provides a total of $3,226,635,000 for Unemploy-
ment Insurance [UI] activities. For UI State operations, the Com-
mittee provides $2,750,635,000.
The Committee provides $467,000,000 for Reemployment Serv-
ices and Eligibility Assessments, to expand intensive, individual-
ized reemployment assistance, and to help address and prevent
long-term unemployment, and reduce improper payments. This in-
cludes $117,000,000 in base funding and $350,000,000 in allocation
adjustment funding. The Committee also provides $9,000,000 for
the UI Integrity Center of Excellence, including supporting an inte-
grated data hub, training modules, and data analytics capacity to
help States reduce fraud.
Finally, the Committee provides $18,000,000 for UI national ac-
tivities, which will support activities that benefit the entire Fed-
eral-State UI system, including supporting the continuation of IT
upgrades and technical assistance.
The Committee directs the Department to include information in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ on: (1) how the ability of State workforce
agencies to provide federally required service levels for unemploy-
ment insurance programs is affected when States do not receive the
resources they need for administration as identified by the Re-
source Justification Model; (2) whether improvements to the Re-
source Justification Model could support improved State adminis-
tration of the unemployment insurance programs; (3) whether Fed-
eral funding to States fully pays for the administration of Federal
benefit programs, including emergency benefit programs imple-
mented during the COVID–19 pandemic; (4) how ETA used CARES
Act, ARPA, and annual appropriations to improve the administra-
tion and integrity of the unemployment insurance system since
2020 and how the termination of the UI ARPA grants in May 2025
impacts efforts to improve the integrity of States’ unemployment
insurance systems; (5) how States identify fraudulent actors who
apply for unemployment insurance payments and the nature of
these actors; (6) how any new appropriations and authorities would
help the Department improve access to unemployment insurance
for eligible workers and identify and recoup fraudulent overpay-
ments; and (7) how any new appropriations and authorities would
enhance methods by which ETA helps States better administer
23
their unemployment insurance programs and identify and recoup
fraudulent overpayments.
The Committee also directs the Department to submit a report
within 360 days of enactment of this act evaluating all state unem-
ployment insurance offices for program integrity, timely delivery of
benefits, front-end verification of applicants, timely and accurate
determinations of eligibility for initial and continued claimants, re-
employment efforts, and how Federal support for state insurance
offices contributes to these issues. Additionally, the report should
recommend to the Committee targeted investments to address the
systemic issues listed in the report and include best practices from
States that have improved the administration of the unemployment
insurance program.
Employment Service
For the Employment Service allotments to States, the Committee
provides $675,052,000. This amount includes $21,413,000 in gen-
eral funds together with an authorization to spend $653,639,000
from the Employment Security Administration account of the Un-
employment Trust Fund.
The Committee also provides $20,000,000 for Employment Serv-
ice national activities.
The Committee provides $2,500,000 to continue efforts to reduce
the processing backlog for the work opportunity tax credit [WOTC]
program and for assisting States to modernize information tech-
nology for processing certification requests, which may include
training and technical assistance. The Committee directs the De-
partment to provide a briefing to the Committee 90 days after en-
actment of this act on efforts to reduce the WOTC backlog. Con-
sistent with this effort, the Committee strongly urges the Depart-
ment to develop national guidelines for the consistent administra-
tion of the program, including flexibility for State workforce agen-
cies with lower capacity. This guidance should also encourage State
workforce agencies to enter into cooperative information exchange
agreements with Federal and State agencies that have the data
needed to determine WOTC eligibility. Finally, the Committee rec-
ognizes that processing requests for remote workers may be best
accomplished in the State where the workers reside and not where
the employer is located.
Foreign Labor Certification
For carrying out the Department’s responsibilities related to for-
eign labor certification activities, the Committee provides
$60,528,000. In addition, 5 percent of the revenue from H–1B fees
is available to the Department for costs associated with processing
H–1B alien labor certification applications, and $23,282,000 is
available for related State grants.
Prompt Processing of H–2B Visas.—The Committee continues to
strongly encourage the Department to take steps to ensure prompt
processing of H–2B visa applications and to minimize future inter-
ruptions to the H–2B visa program.
Timely Processing of Permanent Labor Certification Applica-
tions.—The Committee strongly encourages the Department to take
appropriate actions using existing authority and resources to im-
24
prove the processing of Permanent Labor Certification Applica-
tions, including Prevailing Wage Determinations filed through For-
eign Labor Application Gateway [FLAG] system. Historically, proc-
essing took less than 6 months, but currently takes well over a
year. The Prevailing Wage Determinations for the process should
be processed in no more than 2 weeks and the Department should
return to processing times of less than 1 month, notwithstanding
backlogs at other departments involved in the visa process. Within
60 days of enactment, the Department shall provide the Committee
with a report detailing efforts being taken to improve processing
timeframes by using existing authority and resources, including
automating the self-attestation process to speedily approve submis-
sions, while flagging potential bad actors for further investigation
and audits.
One Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information
For one-stop career centers and labor market information, the
Committee provides $57,653,000 for assisting States with collecting
and producing workforce and labor market information and to im-
prove the ability of job seekers to obtain information about pro-
grams of study funded with Federal workforce training funds.
The Committee is encouraged by progress made through the De-
partment’s efforts to incentivize States to reduce barriers to entry
into licensed occupations and increase license portability to facili-
tate mobility of workers in such occupations, with an emphasis on
transitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses. The
Committee encourages the Department to expand on these past ef-
forts to encourage occupational licensing reform, which could in-
clude grants to States, and associations of States, to review, elimi-
nate and reform licensing requirements, and to promote portability
of State licenses. Grant funding would support institutions of high-
er education and occupational licensing partners to address bar-
riers to licensure for veterans and transitioning service members,
immigrants with work authorization, individuals with a criminal
history, and dislocated, low-wage workers. The Department, in con-
sultation with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, is
also encouraged to improve the information made publicly available
on credentials and licenses that facilitate entry into or advance-
ment in occupations.
ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS
The Committee bill continues language providing such sums as
necessary in mandatory funds for this account. The appropriation
is available to provide advances to several accounts for purposes
authorized under various Federal and State unemployment com-
pensation laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, when-
ever balances in such accounts prove insufficient.

tion, including $104,527,000 in general funds and $53,906,000 from
25
the Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-
ment Trust Fund.
General funds in this account pay for the Federal staff needed
to administer employment and training programs under WIOA,
OAA, the Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–618), and the National
Apprenticeship Act. Trust funds provide for the Federal adminis-
tration of employment security, training and employment, and ex-
ecutive direction functions.
VETERANS’ EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $335,341,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 335,341,000
The Committee provides $335,341,000 for the Veterans’ Employ-
ment and Training Service [VETS], including $65,500,000 in gen-
eral revenue funding and $269,841,000 to be expended from the
Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-
ment Trust Fund.
This account provides resources for VETS to maximize employ-
ment opportunities for veterans and transitioning service members,
including protecting their employment rights. VETS carries out its
mission through a combination of grants to States, competitive
grants, and Federal enforcement and oversight.
The Committee provides $185,000,000 for the Jobs for Veterans
State Grants [JVSG] program. This funding will enable Disabled
Veterans’ Outreach Program specialists and Local Veterans’ Em-
ployment Representatives to continue providing intensive employ-
ment services to veterans and eligible spouses; transitioning service
members early in their separation from military service; wounded
warriors recuperating in military treatment facilities or transition
units; and spouses and family caregivers to help ensure the family
has income to provide sufficient support. The Committee maintains
language providing authority for JVSG funding to be used for data
systems and contract support to allow for the tracking of partici-
pant and performance information. The Committee includes new
language providing authority for JVSG funding to be used to sup-
port surviving spouses of service members.
The Committee provides $34,379,000 for the Transition Assist-
ance Program [TAP] to support apprenticeship opportunities and
employment workshops at military installations, and in virtual
classrooms, worldwide for exiting service members and spouses.
The Committee provides $47,048,000 for Federal administration
costs. This funding level will support oversight and administration
of the VETS grant programs, TAP employment workshops, and
compliance and enforcement activities.
The Committee provides $65,500,000 for the Homeless Veterans’
Reintegration Program [HVRP] to help homeless veterans attain
the skills they need to gain meaningful employment. The bill al-
lows Incarcerated Veterans’ Transition funds to be awarded to
serve veterans who have recently been released from incarceration
but are at risk of homelessness.
The Committee provides $3,414,000 for the National Veterans’
Training Institute, which provides training to Federal staff and
veteran service providers.
26
The Committee provides $500,000 to support the HIRE Vets Me-
dallion program.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $191,100,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 191,100,000
The Committee bill includes $191,100,000 for the Employee Ben-
efits Security Administration [EBSA]. EBSA is responsible for the
enforcement of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act [ERISA] in both civil and criminal areas and for enforcement
of sections 8477 and 8478 of the Federal Employees’ Retirement
Security Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–335). EBSA administers an in-
tegrated program of regulation, compliance assistance and edu-
cation, civil and criminal enforcement, and research and analysis.
Bill language continues to allow EBSA to obligate up to $3,000,000
for 2 fiscal years for the expert witness program. The authority is
needed for services on cases extending beyond fiscal year limita-
tion.
The Committee requests that DOL’s required operating plan and
future CJs include long-standing budget activity detail provided in
the fiscal year 2025 and prior CJs.
Adequate Consideration Guidance.—The Committee notes that
the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 also directs the Department to issue
formal guidance on the adequate consideration exemption, as de-
fined in section 407(d)(6) of ERISA. The Committee urges the De-
partment to prioritize a timely, formal notice and comment rule-
making on the adequate consideration exemption that ensures tax-
payers benefit from stakeholder input and experience, consistent
with congressional intent.
ERISA Requirements.—The Committee notes that firms domi-
ciled in or otherwise controlled by the People’s Republic of China
can be opaque in their auditing and accounting work and practices.
The Committee encourages EBSA to consider whether these trans-
parency risks have any implications for requirements on plan fidu-
ciaries under ERISA.
Implementation of Employee Ownership Initiative.—The Com-
mittee directs $2,000,000 within ETA for the grant program au-
thorized section 346 of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 to help estab-
lish and expand employee ownership programs. The Committee di-
rects EBSA to provide subject matter assistance to ETA as it devel-
ops and administers this grant program.
Mental Health Parity.—The Committee supports additional ef-
forts directed toward systemic and targeted audits of healthcare
coverage provided through ERISA plans, to ensure parity between
mental and physical healthcare coverage as required by current
law.
PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $512,900,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 494,264,000
27
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s [PBGC] estimated
obligations for fiscal year 2026 include single-employer benefit pay-
ments of $7,873,000,000, multi-employer financial assistance of
$187,000,000, Investment Management Fees Program of
$139,800,000, and consolidated administrative expenses of
$494,264,000, including no less than $7,588,000 available for the
Office of Inspector General. Administrative expenses are comprised
of three activities: pension insurance activities, pension plan termi-
nation expenses, and operational support. These expenditures are
financed by permanent authority. PBGC also anticipates obliga-
tions of $1,523,356,000 for Special Financial Assistance and
$15,000,000 for related administrative expenses from the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Previously, the Committee accepted the PBGC’s proposal to re-
form the administrative apportionment classifications from three
budget activities to one budget activity to make operations more ef-
ficient and improve stewardship of resources. That consolidated ap-
proach for the three activities is continued, but PBGC is directed
to continue providing detail every year on the three activities in its
annual CJ.
The PBGC is a wholly owned Government corporation estab-
lished by ERISA. The law places it within DOL and makes the Sec-
retary the chair of its board of directors. The Corporation receives
its income primarily from insurance premiums collected from cov-
ered pension plans, assets of terminated pension plans, collection
of employer liabilities imposed by the act, and investment earnings.
The primary purpose of the PBGC is to guarantee the payment of
pension plan benefits to participants if covered defined benefit
plans fail or go out of existence.
The bill continues authority for a contingency fund for the PBGC
that provides additional administrative resources when the number
of new plan participants in terminated plans exceeds 100,000.
When that threshold is reached, an additional $9,200,000 becomes
available through September 30, 2030, for every 20,000 additional
participants in terminated plans. The bill also continues authority
allowing the PBGC additional obligation authority for unforeseen
and extraordinary pre-termination expenses, after approval by the
Office of Management and Budget and notification to the Commit-
tees. Finally, the bill includes authority for PBGC to expend not
more than an additional $100 per affected person for credit or iden-
tity monitoring to individuals upon suffering a security incident or
privacy breach in the event PBGC’s costs exceed $250,000. Those
funds are available for obligation through September 30, 2030.
WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $260,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 260,000,000
The Committee bill includes $260,000,000 for the Wage and Hour
Division [WHD].
WHD is responsible for administering and enforcing laws that
provide minimum standards for wages and working conditions in
the United States. The Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] (Public
28
Law 75–718), employment rights under the Family and Medical
Leave Act (Public Law 103–3), and the Migrant and Seasonal Agri-
cultural Worker Protection Act (Public Law 97–470) are several of
the important laws that WHD is charged with administering and/
or enforcing.
WHD administers and enforces laws covering more than 165 mil-
lion workers in 11 million workplaces in the United States and its
territories. The Committee supports WHD in its efforts to be more
strategic in enforcement activities, which can lead to more signifi-
cant results for workers at an industry-level and deter employers
from violating the law, particularly in key areas of protecting the
rights and wages of workers, ensuring prevailing wage protections,
and combatting exploitative child labor.
PAID Program.—The Committee notes that the Department has
restarted the Payroll Audit Independent Determination program.
The Committee urges the Department to ensure that any worker
provided a settlement under this program is fully informed of their
rights.
OFFICE OF LABOR-MANAGEMENT STANDARDS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $48,515,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 48,515,000
The Committee bill includes $48,515,000 for the Office of Labor-
Management Standards [OLMS].
OLMS administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclo-
sure Act of 1959 [LMRDA] (Public Law 86–257) and related laws.
These laws establish safeguards for union democracy and financial
integrity. They also require public disclosure by unions, union offi-
cers, employers, labor relations consultants and others. In addition,
the Office administers employee protections under federally spon-
sored transportation programs.
OFFICE OF FEDERAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $110,976,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 105,976,000
The Committee bill includes $105,976,000 for the Office of Fed-
eral Contract Compliance Programs [OFCCP].
This Office protects workers and potential employees of Federal
contractors from employment discrimination prohibited under sec-
tion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era
Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These prohibitions
make it unlawful for contractors and subcontractors doing business
with the Federal Government to discriminate in employment be-
cause of disability or status as a protected veteran.
VAHBP Enforcement Moratorium.—The Committee notes that
OFCCP Directive 2021–01 Revision 2 indicates OFCCP’s intent to
exercise prosecutorial discretion with regard to the affirmative obli-
gations of Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Program [VAHBP] pro-
viders until May 2027. The Committee encourages OFCCP to work
with stakeholders and lawmakers to ensure appropriate implemen-
29
tation of OFCCP programs and robust access to care for veterans
and their families.
Worker Outcomes.—The Committee notes a reduction in staffing
at OFCCP. This could impact protections for workers and prospec-
tive employees of Federal contractors from discrimination. The
Committee plans to examine required monthly staffing reports and
performance outcomes achieved for Federal contractor employees.
OFFICE OF WORKERS’ COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $122,705,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 122,705,000
The Committee bill includes $122,705,000 for the Office of Work-
ers’ Compensation Programs [OWCP]. This includes $2,205,000
from the special fund established by the Longshore and Harbor
Workers’ Compensation Act. In addition, $50,684,000 is available
by transfer from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
OWCP administers four distinct compensation programs: the
Federal Employees’ Compensation Act [FECA], the Longshore and
Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (Public Law 69–803), the Black
Lung Benefits programs, and the Energy Employees Occupational
Illness Compensation Program Act (Public Law 106–398). In addi-
tion, OWCP houses the Division of Information Technology Man-
agement and Services.
SPECIAL BENEFITS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $726,670,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,298,385,000
The Committee bill includes $1,298,385,000 for this account. This
mandatory appropriation, which is administered by OWCP, pri-
marily provides benefits under FECA.
The Committee continues to provide authority to require disclo-
sure of Social Security numbers by individuals filing claims under
FECA or the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act
(Public Law 69–803) and its extensions.
The Committee continues language that provides authority to
use FECA funds to reimburse a new employer for a portion of the
salary of a newly reemployed injured Federal worker. FECA funds
will be used to reimburse new employers during the first 3 years
of employment, not to exceed 75 percent of salary in the worker’s
first year, and declining thereafter.
The Committee continues language that allows carryover of un-
obligated balances to be used in the following year and provides au-
thority to draw such sums as needed after August 15 to pay cur-
rent beneficiaries. Such funds are charged to the subsequent year
appropriation.
The Committee continues language to provide authority to de-
posit into the special benefits account of the employees’ compensa-
tion fund those funds that the Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley
Authority, and other entities are required to pay to cover their fair
share of the costs of administering the claims filed by their employ-
ees under FECA.
30
Finally, the Committee maintains language consistent with long-
standing interpretations and implementation of this appropriation
stating that, along with the other compensation statutes already
specifically enumerated, the appropriation is used to pay obliga-
tions that arise under the War Hazards Compensation Act (Public
Law 77–784), and the appropriation is deposited in the Employees’
Compensation Fund and assumes its attributes, namely avail-
ability without time limit as provided by 5 U.S.C. section 8147.33.
SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $31,367,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 30,585,000
The Committee bill includes a mandatory appropriation of
$24,585,000 in fiscal year 2026 for special benefits for disabled coal
miners. This is in addition to the $6,000,000 appropriated last year
as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, for a total
program level of $30,585,000 in fiscal year 2026.
These mandatory funds are used to provide monthly benefits to
coal miners disabled by black lung disease, their widows, and cer-
tain other dependents, as well as to pay related administrative
costs.
The Committee bill also includes an advance appropriation of
$5,900,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. These funds will
ensure uninterrupted benefit payments as promised to coal miners,
their widows, and dependents.
DIVISION OF ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS
COMPENSATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $66,966,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 68,148,000
The Committee bill includes $68,148,000 for the Division of En-
ergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program
[EEOICP]. This is a mandatory appropriation for administrative
expenses for administration of Part B of the Energy Employees Oc-
cupational Illness Compensation program.
The Division administers the Energy Employees Occupational Ill-
ness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA] (Public Law 106–398),
which provides benefits to eligible employees and former employees
of the Department of Energy, its contractors and subcontractors, or
to certain survivors of such individuals. The mission also includes
delivering benefits to certain beneficiaries of the Radiation Expo-
sure Compensation Act (Public Law 106–245). The Division is part
of OWCP.
BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $485,350,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 477,295,000
The bill provides an estimated $477,295,000 as requested for this
mandatory appropriations account. This estimate is comprised of
$90,499,000 for administrative expenses and an estimated
$386,796,000 for benefit payment and interest costs.
31
The bill continues to provide indefinite authority for the Black
Lung Disability Trust Fund to provide for benefit payments. The
Trust Fund pays all black lung compensation/medical and survivor
benefit expenses when no responsible mine operation can be as-
signed liability or refuses to pay for such benefits, as well as all
administrative costs that are incurred in administering the benefits
program and operating the trust fund. As proposed in the Presi-
dent’s budget, the bill provides for transfers from the trust fund for
administrative expenses for the following Department agencies: up
to $50,684,000 for the part C costs of the Division of Coal Mine
Workers’ Compensation Programs; up to $39,086,000 for Depart-
mental Management, Salaries and Expenses; and up to $373,000
for Departmental Management, Inspector General. The bill also al-
lows a transfer of up to $356,000 for the Department of the Treas-
ury.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $632,309,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 632,309,000
The Committee bill includes $632,309,000 for the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], which is responsible for
enforcing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public
Law 91–596) in the Nation’s workplaces. New bill language is in-
cluded to require OSHA to adhere to program allocations as identi-
fied in the table at the end of this report.
The Committee continues bill language to allow OSHA to retain
course tuition and fees for training institute courses used for occu-
pational safety and health training and education activities in the
private sector. The cap established by the bill is $499,000 per year,
consistent with current law.
The Committee also continues bill language to exempt farms em-
ploying 10 or fewer people from the provisions of the Occupational
Safety and Health [OSH] Act, with the exception of those farms
having a temporary labor camp. The exemption of small farming
operations from OSHA regulation has been in place since 1976.
OSHA clarified the limits of its authority under the appropriations
rider to conduct enforcement on small farms in July 2014, particu-
larly regarding post-harvest activities of a farming operation. It is
also important the Department of Agriculture and National Insti-
tute for Occupational Safety and Health are consulted in any fu-
ture attempt by OSHA to redefine or modify any aspect of the
small farm exemption. The Committee also continues language ex-
empting employers with fewer than 10 employees in industry clas-
sifications having a lost workday injury rate less than the National
average from general schedule safety inspections, except for the
small farms covered by the broader exemption.
Compliance Assistance.—The Committee bill includes language
requiring OSHA to dedicate not less than $3,500,000 for admin-
istering the Voluntary Protection Program [VPP] in its Federal
Compliance Assistance budget. OSHA shall not reduce funding lev-
els or the number of employees administering the VPP, the Safety
and Health Achievement Recognition Program, or Federal Compli-
32
ance Assistance, and shall not collect any monies from participants
for the purpose of administering these programs.
Opioid Use in the Workplace.—The Committee is concerned over
the prevalence of opioid use in the workplace. According to the Na-
tional Safety Council, while 75 percent of employers reported see-
ing opioid use impact their workplace, only 17 percent reported
being well-prepared to address it. The Committee encourages the
Secretary to issue guidance to employers on acquiring and main-
taining opioid overdose reversal medication and training employees
on an annual basis on the usage of such medication, and requests
a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this act on progress to-
wards issuing these guidelines.
Smoke-Related Health Issues for Workers.—The Committee di-
rects the Department to work with the National Institute for Occu-
pational Safety and Health [NIOSH] and other relevant agencies to
gather evidence on best practices and make recommendations that
protect workers from the consequences of long-term exposure to ad-
verse air. Further, the Committee requests that the Department
provide a briefing to the Committees on Appropriations on their
joint efforts with NIOSH supporting vulnerable workers, particu-
larly those exposed to adverse air.
State Plan States.—The Committee bill includes $120,000,000 for
grants to States under section 23(g) of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act (Public Law 91–596). These funds primarily are pro-
vided to States that have taken responsibility for administering
their own occupational safety and health programs for the private
sector and/or the public sector. State plans must be at least as ef-
fective as the Federal program and are monitored by OSHA. The
bill continues language that allows OSHA to provide grants of up
to 50 percent for the costs of State plans approved by the agency.
Workplace Violence in Healthcare and Social Services.—The
Healthcare and Social Assistance industry sector includes nearly
21 million employees and these workers face an increased risk of
workplace violence that is nearly six times that of workers in all
other industries. This violence dramatically impacts nurse well-
being and burnout. It exacerbates the nurse staffing crisis and af-
fects the quality of patient care. The Committee urges OSHA to ex-
plore steps the agency can take to ensure that healthcare and so-
cial services workers are protected from violence in the workplace
and requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act
on such steps.
The Committee bill also includes $12,787,000 for the OSHA
Susan Harwood Training Grant program. The program provides
disadvantaged, underserved, low-income, or other hard-to-reach, at-
risk workers with identifying and avoiding workplace hazards,
training to protect them from on-the-job hazards, and to inform
workers of their rights and employers of their responsibilities
under the OSH Act.
MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $387,816,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 387,816,000
33
The Committee bill includes $387,816,000 for the Mine Safety
and Health Administration [MSHA]. New bill language is included
to require MSHA to adhere to program allocations as identified in
the table at the end of this report.
MSHA enforces the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act (Public
Law 91–173) by conducting inspections and special investigations
of mine operations, promulgating mandatory safety and health
standards, cooperating with the States in developing effective State
programs, and improving training in conjunction with States and
the mining industry.
The Committee continues language authorizing MSHA to use up
to $2,000,000 for mine rescue and recovery activities. It also retains
the provision allowing the Secretary to use any funds available to
the Department to provide for the costs of mine rescue and survival
operations in the event of a major disaster. To prepare properly for
an emergency, the Committee also directs MSHA to continue to de-
vote sufficient resources toward a competitive grant activity for ef-
fective emergency response and recovery training in various types
of mine conditions.
In addition, bill language continues to allow the National Mine
Health and Safety Academy to collect not more than $750,000 for
room, board, tuition, and the sale of training materials to be avail-
able for mine safety and health education and training activities.
Bill language also allows MSHA to retain up to $2,499,000 from
fees collected for the approval and certification of equipment, mate-
rials, and explosives for use in mines, and to utilize such sums for
these activities.
The Committee continues to emphasize the importance of mine
safety enforcement, and instructs MSHA to fully implement the re-
quirements of section 103 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health
Act of 1977 (Public Law 91–173). MSHA shall make inspections of
each underground coal or other mine in its entirety at least four
times a year and each surface coal or other mine in its entirety at
least two times a year. Further, MSHA shall fully and effectively
enforce the Final Rule Reducing Miners’ Exposure to Coal Dust
and should not use any funds to weaken or eliminate the Final
Rule Lowering Miners’ Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust.
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $703,952,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 703,952,000
The Committee bill includes $703,952,000 for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics [BLS]. This amount includes $68,000,000 from the
Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-
ment Trust Fund and $635,952,000 in Federal funds.
BLS is the principal fact-finding agency in the Federal Govern-
ment in the broad field of labor economics. The Committee recog-
nizes that the Nation requires current, accurate, detailed workforce
statistics for Federal and non-Federal data users as provided by
BLS.
Current Population Survey.—The Committee remains concerned
by declining response rates facing all survey programs and other
34
challenges which necessitate actions by BLS and the Census Bu-
reau to modernize the operations of the Current Population Survey
[CPS] and maintain this resource. The Committee believes steps
must be taken to modernize the CPS. The Committee understands
work on an Internet self-response mode and other improvements
are underway. The Committee requests a CPS modernization plan,
including an implementation timeline and resource needs, not later
than 30 days after enactment of this act and follow-up briefing not
later than 30 days after submission of the plan. Such plan and
briefing shall include input from and participation of the Census
Bureau.
GAO Briefing and Report.—The Committee directs the GAO to
study and provide a briefing with preliminary observations to the
Committees no later than 180 days after enactment of this act,
with a report to follow on a date mutually agreed upon with the
Committee at the time of the preliminary briefing, on the impact
of the elimination of the Technical Advisory Committee and the
Data Users Advisory Committee on the quality and reliability of
BLS data collection and steps BLS is taking to improve the quality
and reliability of BLS data collection.
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.—The Committee con-
tinues to recognize the importance of the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth [NLSY], which provides valuable information
about labor market trends across different generations and spans
multiple decades.
The Committee directs BLS to maintain sufficient funding levels
for the continued fielding of the NLSY79 and NLSY97 cohorts and
to continue the current design, methodology, and data quality. In
addition, the Committee directs BLS to continue development of
the new NLSY27 cohort established by the Further Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2020, and maintained since. Further, the Com-
mittee directs BLS to issue a public report and brief the Commit-
tees on its plans for executing these directives, providing a status
update on the fielding and future of the NLSY79 and NLSY97 co-
horts and carrying out its implementation of the NLSY27 cohort
plans.
OFFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $43,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 43,000,000
The Committee bill includes $43,000,000 for the Office of Dis-
ability Employment Policy [ODEP] to provide leadership, develop
policy and initiatives, support technical assistance and implemen-
tation, and award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts
furthering the objective of eliminating physical and programmatic
barriers to the training, labor force participation and employment
of people with disabilities and to design and implement research
and technical assistance grants and contracts that support the
transition to competitive, integrated employment for youth and
adults with disabilities. The bill also includes language continuing
to allow not less than $9,000,000 to be used for research and dem-
onstration projects related to testing effective ways to promote
greater labor force participation of people with disabilities. These
35
funds may be transferred to the ‘‘State Unemployment Insurance
and Employment Service Operations’’ account for such purpose.
The Committee requests notification at least 14 days prior to any
such transfer.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $388,197,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 363,843,000
The Committee bill includes $363,843,000 for the Departmental
Management, Salaries and Expenses account. Of this amount,
$363,535,000 is available from general funds and $308,000 is avail-
able by transfer from the Employment Security Administration ac-
count of the Unemployment Trust Fund. In addition, $39,086,000
is available by transfer from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
The Departmental Management, Salaries and Expenses appro-
priation pays the salaries and related expenses of staff responsible
for formulating and overseeing the implementation of departmental
policy and management activities in support of that goal. In addi-
tion, this appropriation includes a variety of operating programs
and activities that are not involved in departmental management
functions, but for which other appropriations for salaries and ex-
penses are not suitable.
Bureau of International Labor Affairs [ILAB].—The Committee
bill includes $111,125,000, of which $76,725,000 is available for ob-
ligation through December 31, 2026, for ILAB to carry out its stat-
utory responsibilities. These funds are in addition to the supple-
mental appropriations for ILAB in Public Law 116–113, the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, for its re-
sponsibilities under that law.
ILAB’s appropriation is available to help improve working condi-
tions and labor standards for workers around the world by carrying
out ILAB’s statutory mandates and international responsibilities,
including in promoting the elimination of the worst forms of child
labor and forced labor. ILAB works to ensure workers and busi-
nesses in the United States are not put at a competitive disadvan-
tage by trading partner countries not adhering to their labor com-
mitments under trade agreements and trade preference programs.
The bill continues language setting aside funding for grants, con-
tracts and other arrangements for technical assistance on worker
rights and for combatting child labor, with no less than
$30,175,000 available for worker rights programs and no less than
$30,175,000 for combatting exploitative child labor internationally.
This flexibility will allow ILAB to target additional resources where
conditions on the ground and other factors create the greatest op-
portunities to make significant progress on these issues and main-
tain a robust level of support for both critically important activi-
ties. The Committee directs ILAB to use available funds for moni-
toring, oversight, and technical assistance in support of the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to include information on how all
available funds are being used for the purposes of such act, includ-
36
ing Mexico’s implementation of nationwide labor reforms and com-
pliance with labor obligations, in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
The Committee continues to support the critical role ILAB plays
in working to eradicate child labor, forced labor, and human traf-
ficking, including through its research and reporting in its Findings
on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, List of Goods Produced by
Child Labor or Forced Labor, and List of Products Produced by
Forced or Indentured Child Labor. The appropriation will support
continued publication of these important reports, including the
tracking of goods through supply chains and identifying inputs
made with child and forced labor.
Communications With the Committee.—The Committee relies on
its relationship with the Office of Congressional and Intergovern-
mental Affairs [OCIA] and the Departmental Budget Center [DBC]
to make decisions about how to best allocate budget resources and
provide oversight over how taxpayer dollars are spent. OCIA has
a responsibility to ensure that the Committees receive accurate and
timely information including by ensuring that program offices pro-
vide program-specific information in a timely manner upon request.
The Committee directs OCIA to improve the quality and timeliness
of the information it provides, including by reforming and stream-
lining internal clearance processes, and allowing DBC to commu-
nicate directly with the Committee as they have done historically.
Evaluation, and Evidence-Building and Use.—The Committee
bill includes $4,281,000 for program evaluation and allows these
funds to be available for obligation through September 30, 2027.
The Committee bill also continues the authority of the Secretary to
transfer these funds to any other account in the Department for
evaluation purposes. The Committee bill continues authority to use
up to 0.75 percent of certain Department appropriations for evalua-
tion activities identified by the chief evaluation officer. The Depart-
ment shall notify the Committee of the planned uses of funds de-
rived from this authority.
Foundation for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.—The Com-
mittee continues to believe that the execution of the Foundations
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act will enhance the evidence-
building capacity of Federal agencies, strengthen privacy protec-
tions, improve secure access to data, and provide more and higher
quality evidence to policymakers. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Department to continue to include in the fiscal year 2027 and
future CJs updates on the implementation and planned implemen-
tation of such act for the current and future budget years. These
updates shall describe important changes being made by agencies
using research findings, evaluation and evidence to improve their
operations.
Paid Family Leave.—The Committee is particularly supportive of
the Women’s Bureau’s work and dedication to supporting paid
leave programs as part of their mission to support women’s work-
force participation. In order to study best practices in paid leave
programs, the Women’s Bureau is encouraged to request data from
State paid leave programs in order to publish a report about usage
rates and distribution of paid leave at the State level as well as
steps State paid leave programs are taking to support the full
range of businesses and entrepreneurs.
37
Payment Management System [PMS].—The Committee directs
the Department to immediately notify the Committees of any PMS
outages or technical problems exceeding 48 hours, and any pay-
ment delays or disruptions in the PMS distribution of funds exceed-
ing 14 days for individual payees, including any delays resulting
from Executive Order 14158 or Executive Order 14222.
Staffing Report.—Not later than 30 days after enactment, the
Department is directed to provide the Committee an operating plan
identifying the total FTE and non-personnel allocations supported
by each appropriation provided by this act and FTE and non-per-
sonnel allocations for each office supported by each of these appro-
priations provided in this act. In addition, the Department shall
provide on a monthly basis the number of on-board staff, attrition,
approved hires not yet on-boarded and projected full-year FTE
usage, including approved hires, and actual non-personnel ex-
penses, for each office supported by, and in total for each appro-
priation provided by this act. The monthly reports should be de-
tailed by competitive (including career SES) and excepted (includ-
ing noncareer and limited term SES) service staff. The Department

ber of people who have access to medical services at health centers.
Health centers play a vital role in ensuring access to primary care
in underserved areas of the country, including urban, rural, and
frontier areas.
In addition, within the amount provided, the Committee provides
up to $120,000,000 under the Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA]
(Public Law 102–501 and Public Law 104–73), available until ex-
pended. These funds are used to pay judgments and settlements,
(40)
41
occasional witness fees and expenses, and related administrative
costs. The Committee intends FTCA coverage funded through this
bill to be inclusive of all providers, activities, and services included
within the health centers’ federally approved scope of project.
Addressing Intimate Partner Violence and Project Catalyst.—The
Committee includes no less than $2,000,000 for the HRSA Strategy
to Address Intimate Partner Violence.
Base Grant Adjustments.—The Committee recognizes that health
center costs have increased significantly and that it has been near-
ly a decade since the last base grant adjustment. The Committee
encourages HRSA to consider the needs of existing health centers
in relation to their current base grants when allocating health cen-
ter funding.
Brain Health Access Initiative.—The Committee supports HRSA’s
efforts to integrate screenings for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias [ADRD] into the Health Center Program, as well as the
agency’s technical assistance activities that help support health
centers’ ability to meet the healthcare needs of older Americans.
The Committee encourages HRSA to continue utilizing the ADRD
screening measure reporting requirement to promote increased ac-
cess to cognitive assessments across the Health Center Program.
Children’s Mental Health Services.—The Committee continues to
urge HRSA to provide funding to health centers to support vital
mental health services for children.
Early Childhood Development.—The Committee continues no less
than $30,000,000 to further integrate early childhood development
services and expertise, including by hiring or contracting for early
childhood development specialists.
Ending the HIV Epidemic.—The Committee provides
$157,250,000 within the Health Centers Program for the Ending
the HIV Epidemic initiative. The initiative provides funding to
health centers in high-need jurisdictions to increase prevention and
treatment services for people at high risk for HIV transmission, in-
cluding pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] related services, outreach,
and care coordination through new grant awards in areas currently
served by health centers.
Federally Qualified Health Center [FQHC] Look-Alike Participa-
tion.—The Committee notes that certain health centers throughout
the country are ineligible to apply for supplemental funding awards
because of their status as a FQHC Look-Alike [LAL]. The Com-
mittee requests a briefing from HRSA within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on the impacts of allowing FQHC LALs to apply
for supplemental funding opportunities under section 330 of the
Public Health Service [PHS] Act and ways in which the FQHC LAL
program could be better utilized as a pipeline into the section 330
Health Center Program.
Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Coverage.—The Committee pro-
vides $1,000,000 for payments of claims under the FTCA to be
made available for free clinic health professionals as authorized by

Section 21:
section 224(o) of the PHS Act (Public Law 104–73). This appropria-
tion extends FTCA coverage to medical volunteers in free clinics to
expand access to healthcare services for low-income individuals in
medically underserved areas.
42
Health Center Controlled Networks [HCCNs].—The Committee
recognizes the value of HCCNs, which support nationwide virtual
infrastructure that enables real-time performance tracking, inter-
operability, and digital connectivity to advance healthcare mod-
ernization. The Committee encourages HRSA to prioritize contin-
ued investment in HCCNs as a driver of cost-effective, technology-
forward, community-based care.
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis [MASH].—
MASH is a form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver
disease linked to metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions includ-
ing high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and type
2 diabetes. The Committee urges HRSA to increase screening ef-
forts for MASH in community health centers [CHCs] to support
early identification and earlier treatment, which reduces the risk
of end-stage liver disease.
Native Hawaiian Health Care.—The Committee affirms the Fed-
eral trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians, and further that the
provision of healthcare and the betterment of health conditions of
Native Hawaiians as directed in 42 U.S.C. 11705 is key to advanc-
ing the Federal trust responsibility of the United States. The Com-
mittee includes no less than $27,000,000 for the Native Hawaiian
Health Care Program. Of the total amount appropriated for the
Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, not less than $10,000,000
shall be provided to Papa Ola Lokahi for administrative purposes
authorized under 42 U.S.C. 11706, including to coordinate and sup-
port healthcare service provision to Native Hawaiians and
strengthen the capacity of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Sys-
tem to provide comprehensive health education and promotion, dis-
ease prevention services, traditional healing practices, and primary
health services to Native Hawaiians.
School-Based Health Centers [SBHCs].—The Committee includes
$55,000,000 for awards to health centers operating school-based
service sites under section 330 of the PHS Act to increase their ca-
pacity to meet the increasing demand for health services, including
mental health services.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee believes funding for the
training and technical assistance available for health centers
through national and State cooperative agreements and grants is
critical to the successful operation and expansion of the Health
Centers Program. Funds are available within the amount provided
to enhance technical assistance and training activities and further
quality improvement initiatives that improve health outcomes.
Timely Notice of Awards.—The Committee includes new bill lan-
guage directing BPC to award funding for continuation awards that
continue previous activities under existing awards no later than
the day following the expiration of the period of performance. For
health centers subject to specific award conditions due to a correc-
tive action plan, BPC may extend the current award in lieu of pro-
viding a new award for the purposes of finalizing negotiations with
the grantee.
Type I Screenings.—The Committee supports efforts to increase
type 1 diabetes screenings at community health centers [CHCs],
particularly among high-risk populations, especially given the ad-
vances in treatments that now can delay onset of the disease for
43
several years if caught early enough. HRSA is directed to provide
a report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act
and to post on a publicly available website on the efforts being
made to increase screening for type 1 diabetes at CHCs. The report
should include the feasibility and cost estimate of expanding
screening, as well as a plan and timeline on how to roll out such
efforts. Additionally, approximately 40 percent of people do not
know they have type 1 diabetes until they experience diabetic
ketoacidosis [DKA], which is a life-threatening event requiring hos-
pitalization. The Committee supports the inclusion of screening for
DKA in CHCs’ type 1 diabetes screening protocols and educating
high-risk patients about DKA.
Vaccination and Screening for Hepatitis B.—The Committee con-
tinues to encourage HRSA to support health center grantees’ adop-
tion of the necessary practices and policies to comply with the No-
vember 2021 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
[ACIP] recommendation that all adults between ages 19 and 59 be
vaccinated and the March 2023 ACIP recommendation that all
adults between ages 19 and 59 be screened for hepatitis B. To im-
plement these policies, the Committee further encourages HRSA to
ensure that health centers screen patients aged 19–59 for hepatitis
B, offer to immunize all non-infected patients in the 19–59 age co-
hort, and navigate infected individuals into care. The Committee
requests an update from HRSA before the end of fiscal year 2026
on its progress to meet this goal, including the number of individ-
uals screened and number of individuals vaccinated for hepatitis B
at HRSA-funded health centers.
Women’s Preventive Services Initiative.—The Committee notes
that the Women’s Preventive Services Initiative [WPSI] developed
evidence-based guidelines for community health centers to provide
preventive services and screenings to improve women’s health
throughout their lifespan. The Committee supports continued ac-
cess to preventive screenings at community health centers, includ-
ing for patients in rural areas. Within 180 days of enactment of
this act, the Committee directs HRSA to provide a briefing on the
extent to which FQHCs have adopted WPSI guidelines and what
barriers exist to clinics providing services, including in rural areas.
HEALTH WORKFORCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,404,376,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,383,376,000
The Bureau of Health Workforce provides policy leadership and
grant support for health professions workforce development. The
mission of the Bureau is to identify shortage areas while working
to make them obsolete. Programs are intended to ensure that the
Nation has the right clinicians, with the right skills, working
where they are needed.
The Committee also encourages HRSA to conduct outreach, pro-
vide technical assistance, and give priority in awarding cooperative
agreements and grants to entities in high poverty areas and his-
torically marginalized communities. The Committee encourages
HRSA to work with these communities to develop their mental
health workforce and requests an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ
44
on best practices and strategies to attract mental healthcare practi-
tioners to these disproportionately impacted communities.
National Health Service Corps
The Committee provides $128,600,000 for the National Health
Service Corps [Corps]. The Committee recognizes the success of the
Corps program in building healthy communities in areas with lim-
ited access to care. The program has shown increases in retention
of healthcare professionals located in underserved areas.
Within this total, the Committee continues support for access to
quality opioid and substance use disorder [SUD] treatment in rural
and underserved areas nationwide. The Committee continues lan-
guage that expands eligibility for loan repayment awards through
the Corps to include SUD counselors. The Committee also con-
tinues bill language to modify the rules governing the Corps to
allow 60 days for every Corps member to cancel their contract. Fur-
ther, the Committee encourages HRSA to explore opportunities to
provide incentives for individuals working in their home State or
the State in which they received their education.
Correctional Facilities.—While Federal and State correctional fa-
cilities are eligible for Corps scholarships and loan repayment, a
1989 Federal regulation narrowed eligibility for Corps scholarships
to exclude county jails. The Committee notes that county jails in
large metropolitan areas are often the biggest correctional facilities
in an area and encourages HRSA to work with Congress and rel-
evant stakeholders to develop a process to provide county and mu-
nicipal correctional facilities the opportunity to participate in the
Corps program if they would otherwise meet the requirements of
a National Health Service Corps service site. Within 180 days of
enactment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing detailing
implications and considerations for participation by county jails.
Maternity Care Target Areas [MCTAs].—The Committee recog-
nizes HRSA’s progress in determining MCTAs in order to begin
making loan repayment awards to maternal health practitioners,
such as OB/GYNs and Certified Nurse Midwives, who agree to
serve in MCTAs. Within the total for the Corps, the Committee in-
cludes not less than $8,000,000 to support loan repayment and
scholarships for maternity care health services in health profes-
sional shortage areas. The Committee requests that HRSA provide
a briefing on this effort within 120 days of enactment of this act.
Rural Health.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
Corps Scholarship Program, especially in combatting the rural
healthcare provider shortage, and encourages HRSA to increase the
number of scholarships provided. Providing Corps scholarships,
particularly to students from rural communities, will increase ac-
cess to medical school and help to solve the rural provider work-
force shortages throughout the United States.
Workforce Shortages.—The Committee appreciates HRSA’s ef-
forts to tackle healthcare workforce shortages across the country,
particularly in rural areas. The Committee supports the expansion
of the physician, nursing, and pharmacy workforce to meet the
growing health needs of our population. The Committee encourages
HRSA to consider ways to expand these efforts and directs HRSA
to include in the fiscal year 2027 CJ information on steps the agen-
45
cy is taking to address health professions shortages, including ef-
forts to ensure the State Loan Repayment Program is supporting
all healthcare professions. The update should include: (1) informa-
tion, by State, on what professions are benefiting from the State
Loan Repayment Program and how many individuals in each pro-
fession have received funding; and (2) the number of applicants,
broken down by profession and State. In addition, the update
should provide information on how HRSA can expand efforts to in-
clude health professionals who do not typically benefit from HRSA
workforce programs, such as pharmacists, in its educational, train-
ing, and loan repayment programs.
Training for Diversity
The Committee supports programs that improve the diversity of
the healthcare workforce. HRSA’s diversity pipeline programs help
advance patient care and ensure opportunity for all healthcare pro-
viders.
Centers of Excellence
The Committee provides $25,422,000 for the Centers of Excel-
lence [COE] program. This program provides grants to health pro-
fessions schools and other institutions to serve as resource and
education centers for the recruitment, training, and retention of
underrepresented minority students and faculty. The Committee
notes that COEs educate a disproportionate share of health profes-
sionals from minority and underserved backgrounds and address
the need for a diverse and culturally competent healthcare work-
force.
Health Careers Opportunity Program
The Committee includes $15,000,000 for the Health Careers Op-
portunity Program [HCOP]. The Committee notes that HCOPs as-
sist students from minority and economically disadvantaged back-
grounds with navigating careers into the health professions.
Faculty Loan Repayment
The Committee provides $2,310,000 for the Faculty Loan Repay-
ment Program. This program provides loan repayment to health
profession graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who serve as
faculty at eligible health professions academic institutions.
Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students
The Committee provides $55,014,000 for Scholarships for Dis-
advantaged Students. This program provides grants to eligible
health professions and nursing schools to award scholarships to
students from disadvantaged backgrounds who have financial need.
The Committee recognizes the success of the program and encour-
ages HRSA to prioritize institutions with a proven record of train-
ing diverse practitioners and placing practitioners in low-income
communities.
Midwifery Training.—The Committee continues $5,000,000 to
support grants to educate midwives to address the National short-
age of maternity care providers. The Committee encourages HRSA
to award robust funding to increase and diversify the number of
46
Certified Nurse Midwives, particularly in rural and underserved
communities.
Primary Care Training and Enhancement
The Committee provides $49,924,000 for the Primary Care Train-
ing and Enhancement [PCTE] program to support the expansion of
training in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics.
Funds may be used to develop training programs or provide direct
financial assistance to students and residents.
Administrative Academic Units.—The Committee supports the
inclusion of administrative academic units within medical schools
and requests a briefing within 60 days of enactment of this act on
HRSA’s work to support administrative academic units within med-
ical schools, including barriers to additional funding opportunities
for such units.
Community-Based Clinical Rotations for Medical Students.—The
Committee recognizes that patient care is frequently provided in a
range of community-based settings and that providing outpatient
training opportunities in underserved areas encourages long-term,
sustainable physician practice in high-need areas. The Committee
encourages HRSA to evaluate and facilitate opportunities for med-
ical schools to partner with FQHCs, Rural Health Clinics or other
healthcare facilities located in medically underserved communities
to increase medical school clinical rotations in rural and under-
served areas.
Eating Disorders Screening and Referrals.—Within the total for
PCTE, the Committee continues to support no less than $1,000,000
in coordination with SAMHSA’s Center of Excellence for Eating
Disorders, to provide trainings for primary care health profes-
sionals to screen, intervene, and refer patients to treatment for the
severe mental illness of eating disorders, as authorized under sec-
tion 13006 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114–255).
Training in Oral Health Care
The Committee provides $42,673,000 for Training in Oral Health
Care Programs, which includes not less than $13,000,000 for Gen-
eral Dentistry Programs and not less than $13,000,000 for Pedi-
atric Dentistry Programs and not less than $15,000,000 for State
Oral Health Workforce grants. This funding supports a competitive
program in fiscal year 2026 for multi-year awards. The Committee
directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for section 748 post-
doctoral training grants, predoctoral dental grants, and dental fac-
ulty loan repayment program [DFLRP] grants. The Committee di-
rects HRSA to initiate a new DFLRP grant cycle in fiscal year 2026
with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty supervising dental
students or residents and providing clinical services in dental clin-
ics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affili-
ated sites.
Medical Student Education
The Committee provides $45,000,000 to support colleges of medi-
cine at public universities located in the top half of States projected
to have a primary care provider shortage.
47
Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages
Area Health Education Centers
The Committee provides $47,000,000 for Area Health Education
Centers [AHECs]. The program links university health science cen-
ters with community health service delivery systems to provide
training sites for students, faculty, and practitioners. The program
supports three types of projects: core grants to plan and implement
programs; special initiative funding for schools that have pre-
viously received AHEC grants; and model programs to extend
AHEC programs with 50 percent Federal funding.
Health Care Simulation Labs.—The Committee provides no less
than $3,000,000 to continue competitive grants for AHEC recipi-
ents to expand experiential learning opportunities through simula-
tion labs designed to educate and train healthcare professionals
serving rural, medically underserved communities. HRSA shall in-
clude as an allowable use the purchase of simulation training
equipment.
Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training Pro-
gram
The Committee provides $113,000,000 for the Behavioral Health
Workforce Education and Training [BHWET] program. This pro-
gram establishes and expands internships or field placement pro-
grams in behavioral health serving populations in rural and medi-
cally underserved areas. The Committee expresses ongoing, strong
support for the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery
[STAR] Loan Repayment program that was previously funded
under BHWET but is now funded as a standalone program.
Addiction Medicine Fellowship [AMF] Program.—Within the
total for BHWET, the Committee includes $25,000,000 for AMF to
foster robust community-based clinical training of addiction medi-
cine or addiction psychiatry physicians in underserved, community-
based settings who see patients at various access points of care and
provide addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services
across healthcare sectors.
Community-Based Settings.—The Committee encourages HRSA
to work with grantees to use BHWET funds to support individuals
providing care in community-based settings while completing clin-
ical training requirements for licensure. This flexibility would allow
for improved access to behavioral health services in rural and un-
derserved communities across America.
Peer Support Specialists.—Within BHWET, the Committee in-
cludes $14,000,000 to fund training, internships, and certification
for mental health and substance use peer support specialists to cre-
ate an advanced peer workforce prepared to work in clinical set-
tings.
Provider Distribution.—The Committee recognizes that some
communities may disproportionately experience a high prevalence
of substance use disorders, high suicide rates, and high poverty
rates, combined with severe mental health provider shortages. The
Committee encourages HRSA to assess the distribution of behav-
ioral health students and providers who have participated in be-
havioral health workforce development programs and examine best
48
practices to support healthcare and mental health providers serv-
ing in such communities.
Geriatric Programs
The Committee provides $48,245,000 for the Geriatric Programs,
including the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program and the
Geriatrics Academic Career Awards [GACA] Program. These pro-
grams support training to integrate geriatrics into primary care de-
livery and develop academic primary care community-based part-
nerships to address gaps in healthcare for older adults.
Mental and Behavioral Health Programs
The Committee includes $44,053,000 for Mental and Behavioral
Health programs.
Graduate Psychology Education [GPE].—Within the total for
Mental and Behavioral Health programs, the Committee includes
$25,000,000 for the inter-professional GPE program to increase the
number of health service psychologists trained to provide inte-
grated services to high-need, high-demand populations in rural and
urban communities. The Committee recognizes the growing need
for highly trained mental and behavioral health professionals to de-
liver evidence-based behavioral interventions for pain management
in addressing the opioid epidemic. The Committee also notes con-
tinued mental health needs among youth and adolescents and
urges HRSA to strengthen investments in the training of health
service psychologists to help meet these demands.
Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery [STAR]
Loan Repayment Program
The Committee provides $40,000,000. This program addresses
shortages in the SUD workforce by providing for the repayment of
education loans for individuals working in a full-time SUD treat-
ment job that involves direct patient care in either a Mental Health
Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death
rate exceeds the National average. The Committee also encourages
HRSA to actively recruit SUD counselors to take advantage of its
STAR Loan Repayment Program, so that underserved communities
may benefit from the presence of these professionals.
Health Professions Workforce Information and Analysis
The Committee provides $5,663,000 for health professions work-
force information and analysis. This program provides for the col-
lection and analysis of targeted information on the Nation’s
healthcare workforce, research on high-priority workforce ques-
tions, the development of analytic and research infrastructure, and
program evaluation and assessment.
Real-Time Data to Improve U.S. Healthcare Workforce.—The
Committee recognizes the benefit of using real-time information in
order to assess whether such programs are leading to improved
physician supply in medically underserved areas. The Committee
supports development of a data dashboard for all graduate medical
education training position participants to include real-time infor-
mation on residency applications, interviewee demographics, and
residency fulfillment rates. The Committee requests a professional
49
judgment estimate for the development of such a data dashboard,
and any potential barriers, within 180 days of enactment of this
act.
Public Health Workforce Development
The Committee provides $18,000,000 for Public Health Workforce
Development. This program line, also called Public Health and Pre-
ventive Medicine, funds programs that are authorized in titles III
and VII of the PHS Act (Public Law 111–148) and supports awards
to schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, public health, and in-
tegrative medicine programs.
Nursing Workforce Development Programs
The Committee provides $303,472,000 for Nursing Workforce De-
velopment programs. These programs provide funding to address
all aspects of nursing workforce demand, including education, prac-
tice, recruitment, and retention. The Committee recognizes the se-
vere nursing shortage facing our country and the challenges this
shortfall poses to our healthcare system’s ability to meet increasing
demand. The Committee encourages the agency to engage with
stakeholders to assess current and projected shortages, identify
best practices and innovative strategies at the Federal, State, and
local levels, and make recommendations to strengthen the nursing
workforce pipeline.
Palliative Care Nursing Workforce.—Palliative care is patient
and family-centered care, involving the support of an inter-profes-
sional team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other providers
and specialists who provide care for people with serious illnesses.
As the healthcare needs of the Nation evolve and grow in com-
plexity, the Committee encourages HRSA to expand opportunities
to train and strengthen the palliative care nursing workforce
through existing programs and activities.
State-Based Nursing Workforce Centers.—The Committee notes
interest in State-based nursing workforce centers. Such centers can
collect local workforce research data, conduct strategic nursing
workforce planning and program development, support programs to
decrease workplace violence against nurses, develop programs to
increase the recruitment and retention of nurses, and coordinate
nurse leadership development programs. The Committee encour-
ages HRSA to work with Congress and stakeholders to examine
ways to establish new or enhance existing State-based nursing
workforce centers to advance training.
Strategic Partnerships.—The Committee recognizes that the triad
model of academic-clinical-community partnerships offers prom-
ising strategies for addressing nursing shortages and increasing re-
cruitment to rural areas. The Committee directs HRSA to deter-
mine the feasibility of collecting data on such partnerships, includ-
ing partnerships that receive Federal funding; the number of par-
ticipants engaging in such partnerships; the characteristics of a
successful partnership; and how preceptors play a key role in part-
nership nurse training models. The Committee directs HRSA to
provide an update on its findings in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
50
Advanced Education Nursing
The Committee provides $89,581,000 for Advanced Education
Nursing programs, which increase the number of qualified nurses
in the workforce by improving nursing education through cur-
riculum and faculty development. The Committee recognizes the
importance of strengthening the primary care workforce and train-
ing providers to work in community-based settings, particularly by
funding Advanced Nursing Education and Residency Programs.
Certified Nurse Midwives.—The Committee includes $8,000,000
to grow and diversify the maternal and perinatal nursing workforce
by increasing and diversifying the number of Certified Nurse Mid-
wives with a focus on practitioners working in rural and under-
served communities. The program awards scholarships to students
and registered nurses [RNs] to cover the cost of tuition for the du-
ration of the nurse midwifery program.
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program.—The Committee pro-
vides $15,000,000 to support training and certification of RNs, ad-
vanced practice registered nurses [APRNs], and forensic nurses to
practice as sexual assault nurse examiners.
Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention Program
The Committee includes $64,413,000 for competitive grants with-
in the Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention program
to enhance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce
through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. With-
in this total, the Committee continues no less than $10,750,000 for
grants to enhance nurse education through the expansion of experi-
ential learning opportunities. HRSA is directed to ensure that
these grants include as an allowable use the purchase of simulation
training equipment.
RN Shortages.—The Committee provides $5,000,000 to increase
the supply of registered nurses. Further, the Committee directs
HRSA to give priority in new funding announcements to public en-
tities for training additional RNs, specifically for long-term and
acute care settings, and to give priority to applicants in States list-
ed by HRSA as having the greatest shortages.
Traineeships to Address the Nursing Shortage and Prepare Aca-
demic Faculty.—The National Academies of Science, Engineering,
and Medicine [NASEM] issued a report that provided recommenda-
tions to Congress to ease the nursing shortage in America. The
Committee recognizes the urgent need to address the nursing
shortage existing in all parts of the United States and grow the
pipeline of nurse educators to meet the demand to grow the work-
force. Therefore, the Committee encourages HRSA to provide new
traineeships and fellowships, including stipends, for eligible enti-
ties at both public and private institutions to expand opportunities
that prepare individuals for careers in nursing.
Nurse Practitioner Fellowship Program
The Committee provides $6,000,000 for grants to community-
based nurse practitioner residency and fellowship training pro-
grams that are accredited, or in the accreditation process, for prac-
ticing postgraduate nurse practitioners in primary care or behav-
ioral health, where supported education and training specialties
51
will include family, adult family, adult gerontology, pediatric, wom-
en’s healthcare, nurse midwife, and psychiatric mental health. The
Committee is concerned that the Nation remains unprepared to ad-
dress healthcare provider shortages and recognizes the importance
of primary care and behavioral health providers being prepared to
manage clinical and social complexities. The Committee directs
HRSA to give preference to FQHCs, as defined by section
1861(aa)(4) of the Social Security Act, in awarding grants.
Nurse Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment
The Committee includes $92,635,000 for Nurse Corps. This pro-
gram supports scholarships and loan repayment assistance for
nurses and nursing students committed to working in communities
with inadequate access to care.
Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment
The Committee includes $28,500,000 for Nurse Faculty Loan Re-
payment to expand the number of qualified nursing faculty nation-
wide by providing low interest loans for individuals studying to be
nurse faculty and loan cancellation for those who then go on to
work as faculty.
Nursing Workforce Diversity
The Committee includes $22,343,000 for Nursing Workforce Di-
versity to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals
from disadvantaged backgrounds by providing student stipends,
scholarships, and preparation and retention activities.
Children’s Hospitals Graduate Medical Education
The Committee provides $390,000,000 for the Children’s Hos-
pitals Graduate Medical Education [CHGME] program. The Com-
mittee strongly supports the CHGME program, which provides sup-
port for graduate medical education training programs in both am-
bulatory and inpatient settings within freestanding children’s
teaching hospitals. CHGME payments are determined by a per-
resident formula that includes an amount for direct training costs
added to a payment for indirect costs. Payments support training
of resident physicians as defined by Medicare in both ambulatory
and inpatient settings.
Pediatric Specialty Loan Repayment Program
The Committee recognizes that significant shortages of pediatric
medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists, child and ado-
lescent psychiatrists, and other pediatric mental health profes-
sionals are impeding access to care for children and adolescents in
underserved areas. The Committee includes $10,000,000 for section
775 of the PHS Act. The Committee understands that high student
loan debt is a significant barrier to providers choosing to complete
training that would enable them to provide specialized care to chil-
dren with special needs. The Committee directs HRSA to work
with stakeholders with expertise in pediatric specialty care to en-
sure that the program and application process reflects the unique
nature of pediatric specialty care, including ensuring that any clin-
ical and service hour requirements and service site eligibility cri-
52
teria are consistent with pediatric specialty practice and reflect the
regionalization of pediatric specialty care.
National Practitioner Data Bank
The Committee provides $33,500,000 for the National Practi-
tioner Data Bank. As mandated by the Health Care Quality Im-
provement Act (Public Law 99–660), the National Practitioner Data
Bank does not receive appropriated funds, but instead is financed
by the collection of user fees.
The National Practitioner Data Bank collects certain adverse in-
formation, medical malpractice payment history, and information
related to healthcare fraud and abuse. The data bank is open to
healthcare agencies and organizations that make licensing and em-
ployment decisions.
MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,170,430,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,160,680,000
The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau is to im-
prove the physical and mental health, safety, and well-being of the
Nation’s women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families.
This population includes fathers and children with special
healthcare needs.
Maternal and Child Health [MCH] Block Grant
The Committee provides $799,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant,
which provides a flexible source of funding that allows States to
target their most urgent maternal and child health needs. Within
this total, the Committee also includes funding for a number of
special projects to address the Nation’s rising rate of maternal mor-
tality. The program supports a broad range of activities, including
providing prenatal care, well-child services, and immunizations; re-
ducing infant mortality; preventing injury and violence; expanding
access to oral healthcare; addressing racial and ethnic disparities;
and providing comprehensive care through clinics, home visits, and
school-based health programs.
Indian Health Service Facilities.—The Committee encourages
HRSA to ensure the services offered through the MCH Block Grant
are provided at Indian Health Service facilities, tribally operated
health programs, and Urban Indian Health programs.
MCH Block Grant-Special Projects of Regional and National
Significance [SPRANS]
The Committee provides $196,116,000 for SPRANS. The Com-
mittee includes funding for the following activities in the following

Congenital Syphilis [CS].—The Committee is concerned by re-
ports of record high cases of CS, which is preventable during preg-
nancy and can result in bone deformities, deafness, blindness, still-
birth or death. The Committee encourages HRSA to expand efforts
to increase prenatal screening and testing throughout pregnancy
and to implement proper education for pregnant women and pro-
viders on screening, diagnosis, and treatment of CS.
Early Childhood Development Expert Grants.—The Committee
provides $10,000,000 to continue support for placements of early
childhood development experts in pediatric settings with a high
percentage of Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program
patients.
Hemophilia Programs.—The Committee strongly supports and
maintains funding for the Regional Hemophilia Network Program,
which provides grant funds to the National network of 140 Hemo-
philia Treatment Centers [HTCs]. The Committee recognizes the
importance of the Program’s work in supporting HTCs and the
model comprehensive and multi-disciplinary care they offer, includ-
ing physical therapy assessments, social work and case manage-
ment, which are vital to managing this complex, vulnerable, and
rare bleeding disorders patient community.
Infant-Toddler Court Teams.—The Committee includes
$18,000,000 to continue and expand research-based Infant-Toddler
Court Teams to change child welfare practices to improve well-
being for infants, toddlers, and their families.
Minority-Serving Institutions.—The Committee continues
$10,000,000 for a research network that is comprised of and sup-
ports minority-serving institutions to study health disparities in
maternal health outcomes and develop curricula for training health
professionals to identify and address the risks that environmental
factors pose for vulnerable mothers and women who plan to become
pregnant.
Newborn Essentials Support Toolkit.—The Committee includes
$1,000,000 to continue the Newborn Support Kit public-private
partnership program, which is consistent with the activities au-
thorized for the Special Projects of Regional and National Signifi-
cance under 42 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). The Committee recognizes dem-
onstrated successful outcomes of such programs to decrease mater-
nal mental health symptoms and financial stress. Funding shall be
used to purchase and distribute newborn supply kits, including dia-
pers, postpartum supplies, blood pressure monitors, and infant
thermometers. The Secretary shall prioritize implementation of the
program in medically underserved geographic areas, including
rural communities, tribal communities, and communities with the
highest maternal mortality rates.
54
Oral Health.—The Committee includes $5,250,000 to continue
demonstration projects to increase the implementation of inte-
grating oral health and primary care practice. The projects should
model the core clinical oral health competencies for non-dental pro-
viders that HRSA published and initially tested in its 2014 report
Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice.
Regional Pediatric Prevention Network.—The Committee provides
$25,000,000 to continue work among the Nation’s pediatric hos-
pitals and their communities to prepare for and coordinate re-
search-informed responses to future pandemics and other global
health threats.
State Maternal Health Innovation Grants.—The Committee pro-
vides $55,000,000 to support innovation among States to improve
maternal health outcomes and address disparities in maternal
health. With this funding, States collaborate with maternal health
experts to implement State-specific action plans in order to improve
access to maternal care services, identify and address workforce
needs, and support postpartum and inter-conception care services.
Stillbirth Prevention Technical Assistance.—The Committee is
encouraged by HRSA’s efforts to update its materials and guidance
to clarify that stillbirth prevention activities are an allowable use
of funds under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block
Grant program. The Committee urges HRSA to continue to provide
for ongoing technical assistance and other activities to support
States’ stillbirth prevention activities.
Maternal and Child Health Programs
Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program
The Committee provides $8,205,000 for grants and contracts to
help coordinate service delivery for individuals with sickle cell dis-
ease, including genetic counseling and testing, long-term follow-up
and care coordination, and training of health professionals.
Autism and Other Developmental Disorders
The Committee provides $56,344,000 for the Autism and Other
Developmental Disorders program. The program supports surveil-
lance, early detection, education, and intervention activities for au-
tism and other developmental disorders, as reauthorized in the Au-
tism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Sup-
port Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–60).
The Committee provides not less than $38,245,000 for the Lead-
ership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities
[LEND] programs. LEND programs are uniquely positioned to pro-
vide innovative strategies to integrate and enhance existing invest-
ments, including translating research findings on interventions,
guidelines, tools, and systems management approaches to training
settings, to communities, and into practice, and to promote life-
course considerations-from developmental screening in early child-
hood to transition to adulthood issues. The funding is critical to the
LEND’s role in providing direct clinical assessment and evidence-
based interventions. Additionally, this workforce development fund-
ing is essential to increasing the number of providers with ad-
vanced interdisciplinary training in a broad array of professional
55
disciplines to improve the identification, assessment, and care for
individuals with autism and other neurodevelopmental and related
disabilities. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue sup-
porting the program’s efforts to address a critical shortage of
healthcare professionals, serve under-represented communities,
and fulfill the expanded statutory mandate to serve individuals
across the lifespan.
Healthy Start
The Committee provides $145,250,000 for Healthy Start. The pri-
mary purpose of Healthy Start is to reduce infant mortality and
generally improve maternal and infant health in at-risk commu-
nities. Grants are awarded to State and local health departments
and nonprofit organizations to conduct and develop a package of in-
novative health and social services for pregnant women and infants
and evaluate these efforts.
Maternal Mortality.—The Committee continues to support a new
targeted expansion of an enhanced Healthy Start program model
that began in fiscal year 2023. The Committee also continues to
support nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician as-
sistants, and other maternal-child advance practice health profes-
sionals within all program sites nationwide.
Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring Initiative.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the Healthy Start blood pressure monitoring
pilot, which distributed cuff kits to 15 Healthy Start sites in 12
States. The Committee provides no less than $250,000 for more
States to benefit from this pilot project, and to the Healthy Start
program to continue to support the self-measured blood pressure
monitoring pilot, which works to identify preeclampsia during preg-
nancy at an earlier stage in high-risk communities by distributing
blood pressure cuffs and patient information. Preeclampsia, the
most dangerous form of hypertension, is a pregnancy complication
that affects as many as one in 12 pregnancies and can easily be
monitored.
Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children
The Committee provides $20,883,000 for the Heritable Disorders
in Newborns and Children program, as described in the Newborn
Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008 (Public Law 113–240). This pro-
gram provides funding to improve States’ ability to provide new-
born and child screening for heritable disorders. Newborn screen-
ing provides early identification and follow-up for treatment of in-
fants affected by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal, and/or func-
tional conditions.
Recommended Uniform Screening Panel [RUSP].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of Federal guidance, including the
significant influence of the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel
[RUSP], in State decision-making around the detection of chronic
illnesses at birth. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs HRSA to provide a briefing on the activities of
the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and
Children [ACHDNC], including efforts to promote universal screen-
ing, respond to medical breakthroughs, and any updates to the
RUSP.
56
Early Hearing Detection and Intervention
The Committee provides $18,818,000 for universal newborn hear-
ing screening and early intervention activities. This program
awards 59 competitive grants to States and territories that support
statewide systems of newborn hearing screening, audiologic diag-
nostic testing before 3 months of age, and enrollment in early inter-
vention programs before the age of 6 months.
Congenital Cytomegalovirus [cCMV].—The Committee notes that
cCMV is the most common viral infection infants are born with in
the United States and the leading non-genetic cause of hearing
loss. Emerging research has shown that early intervention treat-
ments may prevent or lessen the severity of hearing loss in infants
born with cCMV. The Committee encourages HRSA to expand ef-
forts to provide cCMV education, screening, and testing during
pregnancy.
Emergency Medical Services for Children
The Committee provides $24,334,000 for the Emergency Medical
Services for Children program, which focuses on improving the pe-
diatric components of the emergency medical services system and
improving the quality of care provided to children in the pre-hos-
pital setting. Funding is available to every State emergency med-
ical services office to improve the quality of emergency care for
children and to pay for research and dissemination of best prac-
tices.
Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Sub-
stance Use Disorders [MMHSUD]
The Committee provides $12,000,000 for the MMHSUD program,
which was reauthorized in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of
2023 (Public Law 117–328). HRSA is directed to make grants to
States to establish, improve, or maintain programs to train profes-
sionals to screen, assess, and treat for maternal depression in
women who are pregnant or who have given birth within the pre-
ceding 12 months.
According to Maternal Mortality Review Committee data in 38
States, mental health conditions accounted for over 22 percent of
pregnancy-related deaths in 2020. Maternal mental health [MMH]
conditions impact one in five pregnant or postpartum women, in-
cluding as many as one in three in high-risk populations.
MMHSUD trains healthcare providers to screen, assess, and treat
MMH conditions and substance use disorders, and provides special-
ized psychiatric consultation to providers. The Committee encour-
ages HRSA to improve or maintain existing State programs,
prioritizing States with high rates of adverse maternal health out-
comes, and to provide technical assistance to both grantee and non-
grantee States to implement activities under this program. Grants
shall include culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to
assist in the reduction of maternal health disparities. Within 180
days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs HRSA to pro-
vide a report detailing efforts by the agency to increase access to
training for healthcare providers and to provide support for Tribes
and tribal organizations.
57
Pediatric Mental Health Care Access
The Committee provides $13,000,000 for expanding access to be-
havioral health services in pediatric primary care by supporting the
development of pediatric mental healthcare telehealth access pro-
grams.
Home-Based Behavioral Healthcare Services.—The Committee
encourages the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access [PMHCA] pro-
gram State grantees to foster collaboration with organizations that
are working within communities and with families to support indi-
vidualized, comprehensive home-based behavioral healthcare serv-
ices for young people and adolescents. Where possible, the Com-
mittee encourages PMHCA recipients to share resources with pedi-
atric health professionals about programs that support comprehen-
sive family support services.
Poison Control Centers
The Committee provides $26,846,000 for Poison Control Centers.
The Committee remains concerned with longstanding geo-routing
challenges for incoming calls of poison centers. Not later than 18
months after the date of enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects HRSA to coordinate with the Federal Communications Com-
mission and leading wireless carriers, to the extent technically and
economically feasible, to identify, develop, and implement a proof-
of-concept trial of a geo-routing solution to ensure that communica-
tions with the National toll-free number are routed to the appro-
priate poison control center based on the physical location of the
contact rather than the area code of the contact device. The Com-
mittee encourages HRSA to use SAMHSA geo-routing for the 988
Lifeline as a framework for development and implementation.
Innovation for Maternal Health
The Committee includes $17,300,000 to support continued imple-
mentation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health pro-
gram’s maternal safety bundles to all U.S. States, the District of
Columbia, and U.S. territories, as well as tribal entities, and to
support capacity building, address maternity care deserts, and pro-
vide technical assistance nationwide for the implementation of the
Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program. Patient safety
bundles are a set of targeted, evidence-informed best practices that,
when implemented, improve patient outcomes and reduce maternal
mortality and severe maternal morbidity.
Within the total provided, the Committee includes $500,000 to
support the development and implementation of a resource kit for
providers, as well as correctional custody and healthcare staff, who
care for pregnant, birthing, and postpartum women who are incar-
cerated. Such resource kits should include best practices, resources,
and planning materials for use by teams in healthcare settings that
may not typically provide obstetric services or frequently care for
people in need of obstetric care.
Integrated Services for Pregnant and Postpartum Women
The Committee provides $10,000,000 to reduce adverse maternal
health outcomes and maternal deaths by incentivizing maternal
healthcare providers to provide integral healthcare services to preg-
58
nant women and new mothers to optimize maternal and infant
health outcomes.
Maternal Mental Health Hotline
The Committee provides $8,000,000 to expand support for a ma-
ternal mental health hotline. The hotline shall provide 24 hours a
day voice and text support that is culturally and linguistically ap-
propriate. Funds provided shall also be used to raise public aware-
ness about maternal mental health issues and the hotline.
Increasing Awareness.—Maternal mental health conditions im-
pact one in five pregnant and postpartum women and one in three
high-risk populations including service members, military spouses,
and rural women. Since its launch on Mother’s Day in 2022, the
Hotline has served more than 64,000 women and families across
the United States with average response times of less than 30 sec-
onds. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects HRSA to provide a report to Congress on the agency’s efforts
to increase awareness of the hotline, including any promotional ac-
tivities and coordination with stakeholders.
Support for Servicemembers.—Maternal mental health conditions
impact 36 percent of female servicemembers and military spouses,
and 60 percent of retired servicemembers. The Committee encour-
ages HRSA to train hotline staff on best practices to support the
unique needs of servicemembers, veterans, and military families
utilizing the hotline. The Committee further directs HRSA to co-
ordinate with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department
of Defense to ensure that public awareness activities reach civilian,
military, and veteran pregnant and postpartum women, as author-
ized in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (Public Law
117–328).

support services. Funds are awarded to States to support HIV serv-
ice delivery consortia, the provision of home and community-based
care services for individuals with HIV disease, continuation of
health insurance coverage for low-income persons with HIV dis-
ease, and support for State AIDS drug assistance programs
[ADAP]. The Committee provides $900,313,000 for AIDS medica-
tions in ADAP.
Medical Nutrition Therapy and Food Bank/Home Delivered
Meals.—The Committee recognizes the value of nutrition services
as an evidence-based intervention that improves health outcomes
and lowers healthcare costs for people living with HIV/AIDS. The
Committee supports the existing nutrition services offerings, in-
cluding Medical Nutrition Therapy and Food Bank/Home Delivered
Meals, within the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and encourages
HRSA to continue these important initiatives and coordinate these
activities with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health,
where feasible.
Early Intervention Services
The Committee provides $208,970,000 for early intervention
grants. These funds are awarded competitively to primary
healthcare providers to enhance healthcare services available to
people at risk of HIV and AIDS. Funds are used for comprehensive
primary care, including counseling, testing, diagnostic, and thera-
peutic services.
Children, Youth, Women, and Families
The Committee provides $77,935,000 for grants for coordinated
services to women, infants, children, and youth. Funds are award-
ed to a variety of providers, including community health centers,

departments, and other nonprofit community-based programs that
provide comprehensive primary healthcare services to populations
with or at risk for HIV.
AIDS Dental Services
The Committee provides $13,620,000 for the AIDS Dental Serv-
ices program. This program provides grants to dental schools, den-
tal hygiene schools, and post-doctoral dental education programs to
assist with the cost of providing unreimbursed oral healthcare to
patients with HIV.
The Ryan White Part F program provides for the Dental Reim-
bursement Program, which covers the unreimbursed costs of pro-
viding dental care to persons living with HIV/AIDS. Programs that
qualify for reimbursement are dental schools, hospitals with post-
doctoral dental education programs, and colleges with dental hy-
giene programs.
AIDS Education and Training Centers
The Committee provides $34,886,000 for AIDS Education and
Training Centers [AETCs], which train healthcare practitioners,
faculty, and students who care for AIDS patients outside of the tra-
60
ditional health professions education venues and supports cur-
riculum development on the diagnosis and treatment of HIV infec-
tion for health professions schools and training organizations.
Special Projects of National Significance
The Committee provides $25,000,000 for the Special Projects of

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 127,009,000
The Committee provides is $127,009,000 for the Health Care
Systems Bureau.
The Health Care Systems Bureau protects the public health and
improves the health of individuals through efforts to support and
enhance the systems by which healthcare is delivered in America.
Organ Donation and Transplantation
The Committee provides $59,049,000 for organ donation and
transplantation activities.
Kidney Transplant Disparities.—The Committee recognizes con-
cerns that some of the metrics used at transplant hospitals may
disincentive the treatment of complex, higher risk kidney trans-
plant and directs HRSA to provide a report no later than 60 days
after enactment of this act on ways HRSA can work with trans-
plant hospitals to ensure that the metrics used do not penalize hos-
pitals for taking on more complex kidney transplant cases.
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [OPTN] Mod-
ernization Initiative.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
the OPTN Modernization Initiative, launched in March 2023, to
strengthen accountability and the performance of the nation’s
organ transplant system. The Committee is extremely concerned by
recent reports of cases involving patients with neurological signs
incompatible with organ donation. Such reports raise serious eth-
ical and legal questions, and the Committee is encouraged by the
Secretary’s recent announcement that HRSA is mandating strict
corrective actions for the entities involved. The Committee requests
a briefing within 30 days of enactment of this act and every 90
days thereafter on HRSA’s spend plan and progress toward its stat-
ed objectives and actions the Department has taken or plans to
take to improve oversight, protect patient safety, increase public
and stakeholder trust in the organ allocation process, and track
and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the initiative. Further,
as HRSA continues this work, it is critical that the needs of pedi-
atric transplant patients and their families be prioritized, and the
Committee urges HRSA to maintain the multidisciplinary commit-
tees in the OPTN system, and to require pediatric representation
on each organ-specific committee. Finally, the Committee directs
HRSA to provide an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the use
of organ tracking technology to allow organ procurement organiza-
61
tions real-time updates on an organ’s location to help improve the
safe and efficient transportation of donor organs.
OPTN Next Generation Technology.—Due to the significant fail-
ures of the OPTN’s technology in the past, the Committee is par-
ticularly interested in HRSA’s continuation of activities to develop
a technology solution to fully modernize the OPTN. The Committee
directs the Secretary to prioritize obligations from resources in the
nonrecurring expenses fund [NEF] for these activities. The Com-
mittee encourages HRSA to consider technology solutions already
adopted across HHS and the private sector, particularly those that
address complex medical and logistics supply chain challenges
while promoting patient safety, as part of a competitive process
and successful transition.
Organ Transportation Working Group.—The Committee supports
the recommendations made by the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion’s [FAA] Organ Transportation Working Group to identify best
practices for transporting organs in the cabin of airplanes. This ini-
tiative is critical for patients awaiting organ transplants, as trans-
porting organs in the cabin can reduce transit time, minimize tem-
perature fluctuations, and increase the viability of life-saving or-
gans during critical transportation windows. As part of the report,
FAA developed 20 recommendations, including five for HRSA: (1)
establish a forum for continuous discussion and communications
across the transplant community and aviation industry stakeholder
groups; (2) establish standardized data definitions, data types, and
reporting protocols for data collection in the organ transport com-
munity; (3) add granularity in data reporting by collecting trans-
portation methods and success/failure rates in addition to timing in
schedule; (4) develop a centralized data management system to col-
lect data from OPTN members, couriers, and other relevant stake-
holders; (5) share relevant incident reports with Transportation Se-
curity Administration [TSA] and airlines. The Committee strongly
supports these recommendations and directs HRSA to provide an
update to the Committee no later than 60 days after enactment of
this act on how the agency will implement these recommendations.
National Cord Blood Inventory
The Committee provides $19,266,000 for the National Cord Blood
Inventory [NCBI]. The purpose of this program is to provide funds
to cord blood banks to build an inventory of the highest quality
cord blood units for transplantation.
NCBI builds a racially and ethnically diverse inventory of high-
quality umbilical cord blood for transplantation. The Committee
applauds HRSA for increasing the number of units collected and
maintained under NCBI.
C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program
The Committee provides $33,009,000 for the C.W. Bill Young
Cell Transplantation Program. The Committee continues to support
cell transplantation through the use of bone marrow, peripheral
blood stem cells, and cord blood. The Committee appreciates
HRSA’s efforts to increase the diversity of the volunteer registry
and encourages HRSA to continue to address barriers that impact
62
a patient’s ability to identify a matched donor and access lifesaving
transplants in a timely manner.
National Hansen’s Disease Program
The Committee includes $13,706,000 for the Hansen’s Disease
Program, $122,000 for Hansen’s Disease Buildings and Facilities,
and $1,857,000 for Payments to Hawaii for Treatment of Hansen’s
Disease. These programs support inpatient, outpatient, and long-
term care, as well as training and research in Baton Rouge, Lou-
isiana; outpatient clinic sites in the continental U.S. and Puerto
Rico; related expenses for the facilities of the National Hansen’s
Disease Center; and medical care and treatment of persons with
Hansen’s disease through the Hawaii Department of Health’s com-
munity program administered from Honolulu, Hawaii.
RURAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $364,607,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 373,907,000
The Committee provides $373,907,000 for Rural Health pro-
grams.
The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy [FORHP] administers
HHS rural health programs, coordinates activities related to rural
healthcare within HHS, and analyzes the possible effects of policy
on the more than 60 million residents of rural communities.
FORHP advises the Secretary on the effects of Medicare and Med-
icaid on rural citizens’ access to care, the viability of rural hos-
pitals, and the availability of physicians and other health profes-
sionals.
Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA] Codes.—The Committee
applauds FORHP’s work to better define rural areas in difficult
and mountainous terrain areas and encourages them to continue to
work to adopt the Road Ruggedness Scale, as defined in the report
Characterizing Rugged Terrain in the United States, published by
the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research
Service.
Rural Communities Opioid Response Program [RCORP]
The Committee provides $145,000,000 for RCORP. Within the
funding provided, the Committee includes $10,000,000 to continue
at least three Rural Centers of Excellence [Centers], as established
by Public Law 115–245 and continued through Public Law 116–260
and 117–103. The Committee recognizes the success of the Centers
in addressing substance use disorders within rural communities
through various evidence-based treatment and recovery models but
is concerned about growing issues of alcohol misuse. Funding pro-
vided to the Centers may be used for research and dissemination
activities to address rural alcohol misuse.
Further, the Committee supports HRSA’s continued investment
in the current Centers and encourages HRSA to consider how the
Centers can expand their outreach into other underserved commu-
nities. Within the total provided for RCORP, the Committee con-
tinues to include $4,000,000 to support career and workforce train-
ing services and other needs related to substance use challenges
63
within the Northern Border Regional Commission’s rural regions to
assist individuals affected by a substance use disorder.
Rural Health Outreach
The Committee provides $103,975,000 for the Rural Health Out-
reach program. This program supports projects that demonstrate
new and innovative modes of outreach in rural areas, such as inte-
gration and coordination of health services. Outreach grant pro-
grams include Outreach Service Grants, Rural Network Develop-
ment Grants, Delta States Network Grant Program, Network Plan-
ning Grants, and Small Health Care Provider Quality Improve-
ment Grants.
Regional Grant Programs.—The Committee includes not less
than the fiscal year 2025 level for the Delta States Rural Develop-
ment Network Grant program, including not less than $15,000,000
for the Delta Region Community Health Systems Development pro-
gram. The Committee provides no less than $5,000,000 for HRSA’s
collaboration with the Northern Border Regional Commission to
provide direct support to member States and help underserved
rural communities with planning and implementing service coordi-
nation improvements that better population health. Lastly, the
Committee provides no more than $2,500,000 for HRSA’s collabora-
tion with the Appalachian Regional Commission.
Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies
[RMOMS].—The Committee provides no less than $13,000,000 for
RMOMS to support grants to improve access to and continuity of
maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities by increasing
the delivery of and access to preconception, pregnancy, labor and
delivery, and postpartum services, as well as developing sustain-
able financing models for the provision of maternal and obstetrics
care. The Committee encourages HRSA to examine efforts to sup-
port collaborative innovation networks to improve maternal and in-
fant health outcomes and reduce preventable maternal mortality
and severe maternal morbidity by improving prenatal care, labor
care, birthing, and postpartum care services in rural areas.
Rural Health Research
The Committee provides $11,076,000 for the Rural Health Re-
search program, which funds publicly available and policy relevant
research on rural health to assist providers and Federal, State, and
local governments in addressing challenges faced by rural commu-
nities. Additional research on the significant and pervasive chal-
lenges faced by rural Americans in accessing healthcare in support
of mental health, substance use, nutrition and healthy eating,
chronic health management, among other critical needs, requires
additional policy research capacity to inform solutions to these im-
portant issues. The Committee encourages HRSA to consider oppor-
tunities for additional research studies within the funds provided.
Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants
The Committee provides $66,277,000 for Rural Hospital Flexi-
bility grants and the Small Hospital Improvement Program. Under
these grant programs, HRSA works with States to provide support
and technical assistance to Critical Access Hospitals and other
64
small, rural hospitals to focus on quality and performance improve-
ment and to integrate emergency medical services.
The Committee is keenly aware of the significant challenges fac-
ing emergency care for rare and chronic disease patients in rural
America. Rural emergency medical service [EMS] providers have
gaps in education that can lead to disparate outcomes for rural
rare and chronic disease patients based on delays in proper care,
administration of emergency prescription medications, or unfore-
seen side effects or drug interactions occurring during medical
interventions. Without closing these care gaps, rare and chronic
disease patients face risks to their health and lives in the event of
an emergency. Therefore, the Committee encourages HRSA to
allow education for the administration of patient-held drugs for
rural rare and chronic disease patients for rural EMS personnel as
an eligible use of funding from the Emergency Services Supplement
of the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant Program.
Cybersecurity.—The Committee urges HRSA to clarify that funds
from the Small Hospital Improvement Program may be used to
support cybersecurity measures including purchases of hardware,
software, and training.
State Offices of Rural Health
The Committee provides $13,500,000 for State Offices of Rural
Health. These offices help States strengthen rural healthcare deliv-
ery systems by enabling them to coordinate care and improve sup-
port and outreach in rural areas.
Black Lung Clinics
The Committee provides $12,190,000 for the Black Lung Clinics
program. This program funds clinics that treat respiratory and pul-
monary diseases of active and retired coal miners, steel mill work-
ers, agricultural workers, and others with occupationally related
respiratory and pulmonary impairments. These clinics reduce the
incidence of high-cost inpatient treatment for these conditions.
Radiation and Exposure Screening and Education Program
The Committee provides $1,889,000 for activities authorized by
the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Public Law 109–482).
This program provides grants for the education, prevention, and
early detection of radiogenic cancers and diseases resulting from
exposure to uranium during mining and milling at nuclear test
sites.
Rural Residency Planning and Development
The Committee provides $14,000,000 for the Rural Residency
Planning and Development program. The Committee commends
FORHP for efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas
and supports continuation and expansion of the program to develop
new rural residency programs, or Rural Training Tracks.
The Committee provides no more than $2,000,000 to support
family medicine/obstetrics training programs in States with high
infant morbidity rates. The funding will reduce infant mortality
and maternal morbidity by improving the availability and accessi-
bility of prenatal care through increasing family medicine/obstetrics
65
training programs and graduates, increasing Family Medicine and
OB/GYN faculty to train physicians, and by providing equipment,
such as ultrasound, electronic fetal monitors, and telemedicine
equipment with the training and support for this equipment to
rural areas. HRSA is directed to brief the Committee on its plans
no less than 15 days prior to releasing a Funding Opportunity An-
nouncement.
Rural Hospital Stabilization Pilot Program
The Committee includes $6,000,000 for the Rural Hospital Sta-
bilization Pilot program that started in fiscal year 2024. The pro-
gram is intended to provide support to at-risk rural hospitals to en-
hance or expand service lines to retain healthcare services locally
and increase service volume and revenue that will enhance hos-
pitals’ financial viability. HRSA is directed to prioritize applica-
tions from hospitals that do not have Medicare Critical Access Hos-
pital designation and are at risk of closure.
FAMILY PLANNING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $286,479,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 286,479,000
The Committee provides $286,479,000 for the title X Family
Planning program. This program supports preventive and primary
healthcare services at clinics nationwide.
HRSA-WIDE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM SUPPORT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $219,588,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,078,036,000
The Committee provides $1,078,036,000 for HRSA-wide activi-
ties. Within the total, $150,000,000 is provided for program man-
agement.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—Within the total for pro-
gram management, the Committee also includes $873,748,000 for
projects financing the construction and renovation (including equip-
ment) of healthcare and other facilities and for one-time grants
supporting other health-related activities. The projects are specified
in the table at the end of this Committee Report.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter,
the Committee directs HRSA to provide a report detailing the sta-
tus of CDS funding for the previous three fiscal years. Such a re-
port shall be presented in Excel format and include a project de-
scription, House and Senate requestors, the type of award, total ob-
ligations, total disbursements, and the percent disbursed.
Addressing Chronic Disease.—The Committee recognizes the Ad-
ministration’s focus on addressing chronic disease, including the
proposed Make America Healthy Again [MAHA] Initiative and its
approach to addressing the prevalence of chronic disease and child-
hood obesity. The Committee urges HRSA to work with the Office
of the Assistant Secretary for Health to ensure coordination of
these efforts across the Department. Within 30 days of enactment
of this act, the Committee directs HRSA to provide a briefing on
efforts to utilize the principles of the MAHA Initiative to inform ac-
tivities throughout HRSA’s programs.
66
Oral Health Literacy.—Within the total provided for HRSA-wide
activities, the Committee includes $300,000 to support the develop-
ment of an oral health awareness and education campaign across
relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program,
Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White
HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health.
Telehealth
The Committee provides $42,050,000 for the Office for the Ad-
vancement of Telehealth [OAT], which promotes the effective use
of technologies to improve access to health services for people who
are isolated from healthcare and to provide distance education for
health professionals. The Committee strongly supports OAT and
their mission to expand high quality medical care to rural commu-
nities that do not have adequate access to medical providers includ-
ing many medical specialties.
Technology-Enabled Collaborative Learning.—The Committee
provides $8,500,000 as authorized in Public Law 116–260 to con-
tinue the use of technology-enabled collaborative learning and ca-
pacity building models. This collaborative model of medical edu-
cation and care management, often referred to as Project ECHO
[Extension for Community Health Outcomes], helps clinicians pro-
vide expert-level care to patients wherever they live, and increases
access to specialty treatment in rural and underserved areas for a
variety of conditions. The Committee recognizes that HRSA has ini-
tiated activities to allow grantees to explore addressing Alzheimer’s
disease. The Committee encourages HRSA to expand and support
such activities, including improving Alzheimer’s person-centered
care coordination and improving care transitions.
Telehealth Centers of Excellence [Centers].—The Committee pro-
vides $8,500,000 for the existing Centers to continue to validate
technologies and reimbursement mechanisms, establish training
protocols, and develop comprehensive templates for States to inte-
grate telehealth into their State health provider networks. The
Centers identify best practices, serve as national training resources
and test the efficacy of different telehealth clinical applications.
The Centers serve to promote the adoption of telehealth programs
across the country by validating technology, establishing training
protocols, and providing a comprehensive template for States to in-
tegrate telehealth into their State health provider network. Fund-
ing should serve to promote the adoption of telehealth services na-
tionwide and help address the access to care issue faced by rural
America. The Committee directs HRSA to continue funding exist-
ing sites with the funds provided.
Telehealth Network Grants.—The Committee expresses support
for the Telehealth Network Grant program in addressing rural
health emergencies and encourages HRSA to include telepharmacy
as an area of interest for future awards.
Telemental Health for Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupa-
tions.—The Committee recognizes the persistent barriers to access-
ing mental healthcare for individuals in farming, fishing, and for-
estry occupations and other medically underserved populations,
particularly in rural areas. The Committee encourages HRSA, in
collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, to consider op-
67
portunities to support home-based telemental health services to
help meet the unique needs of these populations.
Office of Pharmacy Affairs
The Committee provides $12,238,000 for the Office of Pharmacy
Affairs [OPA]. OPA administers the 340B drug-pricing program,
which requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts or rebates
to a set of programs and hospitals that serve a disproportionate
share of low-income patients. The 340B program is a critical life-
line to many of its program participants, including FQHCs, FQHC
Look-Alikes, children’s hospitals, Ryan White HIV/AIDS clinics,
and other safety-net hospitals and providers. These covered entities
are model stewards of the program and reinvest 340B savings to
‘‘stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible, reaching more
eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services,’’ as
Congress intended.
The Committee is concerned that manufacturers continue to deny
340B pricing for drugs purchased by covered entities for use in con-
tract pharmacies, which threatens the ability of safety-net pro-
viders to care for patients in need. The Committee urges HRSA to
continue to take actions to safeguard covered entities’ lawful access
to discounted drugs.
VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,200,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,200,000
The Committee includes $15,200,000 for administrative costs as-
sociated with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The Na-
tional Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides compensa-
tion for individuals with vaccine-associated injuries or deaths.
Funds are awarded to reimburse medical expenses, lost earnings,
pain and suffering, legal expenses, and death benefits. The Vaccine
Injury Compensation Trust Fund is funded by excise taxes on cer-
tain vaccines recommended for routine administration to children
and pregnant women.
Completion of Medical Reviews.—The Committee requests a re-
port within 6 months of enactment of this act detailing HRSA’s use
of intelligent document processing [IDP] and artificial intelligence
[AI] to complete medical reviews for individuals seeking compensa-
tion from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund,
including how IDP and AI have contributed to reducing reviewing
times and reductions in the backlog of cases, as well as guardrails
in place to ensure that medical reviews are accurate and complete.
COVERED COUNTERMEASURES PROCESS FUND
Appropriation, 2025 ............................................................................... $7,000,000
Committee Recommendation ................................................................ 7,000,000
The Committee includes $7,000,000 for compensation of injury
claims associated with countermeasures costs to administer the
Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program [CICP]. The CICP
provides benefits to individuals who are seriously injured as a re-
sult of the administration or use of covered countermeasures.
68
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
The Committee provides a program level of $9,152,090,000 for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which in-
cludes $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the En-
ergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act
[EEOICPA], and $1,398,375,000 in transfers from the Prevention
and Public Health [PPH] Fund.
The activities of CDC focus on several major priorities: providing
core public health infrastructure and functions; detecting and re-
sponding to urgent health threats; monitoring the Nation’s health
using sound scientific methods; preventing the leading causes of ill-
ness, injury, and death; assuring the Nation’s preparedness for
emerging infectious diseases and potential pandemics; and pro-
viding training, support, and leadership for the public health work-
force.
IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $919,291,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 913,291,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases is $913,291,000,
which includes $554,958,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund.
The mission of the National Center for Immunization and Res-
piratory Diseases is the prevention of disease, disability, and death
through immunization and by control of respiratory and related
diseases.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol-
lowing activities in the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on

Section 22:
Section 317 ...................................................................................................................................................... $681,933,000

Section 23:

Influenza Planning and Response appropriations........................................................................................... 231,358,000
317 Immunization Program.—The Committee recognizes CDC’s
immunization program plays a fundamental role in achieving na-
tional immunization goals and sustaining high vaccination cov-
erage. In addition, this program underpins the protection of all
children being vaccinated, even those fully insured, by providing
Federal, State, and local resources to investigate outbreaks, con-
duct surveillance, and provide public awareness campaigns to ad-
dress vaccine hesitancy that continues to be the root cause of out-
breaks for measles and other preventable diseases. The Committee
continues to expect funding be used to promote vaccinations for
vaccine preventable diseases [VPDs] as well as address vaccine
hesitancy using well-established science. CDC is encouraged to ex-
pand the existing immunization infrastructure, including imple-
menting new strategies for hard-to-reach populations, such as those
who may be vaccine-hesitant and those who are underserved due
to socioeconomic or other reasons. The Committee requests an up-
date in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the rate of routine vaccination
69
across all ages, as well as a forward-looking plan to administer
missed doses.
Accelerate the Elimination of HPV-Related Cancer and Disease.—
Human papillomavirus [HPV]-related cancers remain an alarming
public health concern in the United States, impacting nearly
40,000 Americans each year and is the leading cause of cervical
cancer. Each year, approximately 200,000 women are diagnosed
with cervical pre-cancer, 13,000 women are diagnosed with cervical
cancer caused by HPV, and approximately 4,000 women die from
cervical cancer in the United States. The evidence shows that HPV
vaccination is extremely effective at preventing over 90 percent of
HPV-related cancers when given between the recommended ages of
9 and 12. Yet, CDC data from 2023 shows that only 61 percent of
children ages 13–17 were up to date with HPV vaccination, which
is significantly less than the ‘‘Healthy People 2030’’ goal of 80 per-
cent. While all childhood and adolescent vaccinations declined dur-
ing the pandemic, the HPV vaccine rates experienced the largest
decrease and have been the slowest to rebound to pre-pandemic
levels. The Committee urges CDC to take immediate action to ex-
pand access to HPV vaccination, including by: updating the immu-
nization information system at the Federal level to enable stand-
ardized forecasting of HPV vaccination at age 9 across the country;
supporting providers and trusted voices to engage patients with a
strong recommendation for HPV vaccination as cancer prevention;
and continuing to reduce health disparities and barriers to care for
underserved communities.
Acute Flaccid Myelitis [AFM].—The Committee recommends CDC
continue its work to review suspected cases of AFM, examine pos-
sible risk factors and causes of AFM, and update clinicians about
AFM diagnosis, management, and possible treatment options.
Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices [ACIP].—ACIP
serves a critical role in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The Committee recognizes the essential role of experts serving on
ACIP who have the experience necessary to make informed rec-
ommendations regarding vaccine policy, which also serves to en-
sure the public’s trust in ACIP and its recommendations. Congress
has codified, under several Federal statutes, policies that link to
ACIP’s recommendations for vaccine-preventable diseases, includ-
ing requirements for insurance coverage of certain vaccinations. In
order to promote transparency, the Committee directs CDC to work
in collaboration with medical professional societies to help deter-
minate any updates necessary for the immunization schedules.
Cost Estimates.—The Committee reiterates the request for the
Fiscal Year 2024 report, included in Public Law 118–47, and re-
quests that the report on estimated funding needs of the Section
317 Immunization Program subsequently be updated and sub-
mitted not later than February 1, 2026, to the Committees on Ap-
propriations. The updated report should include an estimate of op-
timum State and local operations funding, as well as a discussion
of the role of the 317 Program, as coverage for vaccination under
public and private resources continues to evolve. Estimates should
also be included to address the needs of outbreak investigation and
response, particularly as measles cases are increasing. The Com-
mittee also requests that the report include specific information on
70
the estimated cost to fully address evidence-based public health
strategies that could be funded through CDC to improve coverage
for HPV and influenza.
Long COVID.—The Committee encourages CDC to monitor and
track incidence of Long COVID among children and adults, includ-
ing developing a patient registry for Long COVID.
National Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that the National Perinatal Hepatitis B Program
[PHBPP] is critical to preventing chronic liver disease and liver
cancer. The Committee is aware that hepatitis B is most commonly
spread from mother-to-child due to blood exchange during the
birthing process, and that approximately 90 percent of children
who are exposed to the hepatitis B virus will develop a chronic in-
fection if they do not receive proper care. PHBPP provides integral
services to prevent lifelong chronic liver disease, such as tracking
perinatal hepatitis B infections, providing the hepatitis B birth
dose, and ensuring hepatitis B immunization series completion for
infants exposed to hepatitis B. The Committee urges CDC to main-
tain PHBPP, and to continue to fund all current participants in the
program in order to eliminate one of the leading causes of liver
cancer.
Non-Influenza Respiratory Viruses.—Respiratory viruses cause
substantial illness and death in the United States, especially in
young children, older adults, and people with underlying health
conditions. The Committee recognizes the importance of a strong
capacity at CDC to address respiratory viruses and supports CDC’s
work to address respiratory illnesses holistically, with the capacity
to identify and assess characteristics of viruses to inform vaccines
and therapeutics, quantify the burden such viruses place on the
health of Americans, and the effectiveness of vaccines and other
preventive measures.
Promoting Routine Vaccination.—The Committee is concerned
about declining rates of vaccination among children ages 24
months and entering kindergarten, resulting in increased out-
breaks in preventable, infectious diseases including measles and
whooping cough across States. The Committee requests CDC pro-
vide an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the vaccine education
efforts and the rate of routine vaccination across all ages, as well
as an update on the plan to administer missed doses, prioritizing
areas with the largest reduction in routine coverage rates. CDC
should include updated recommendations about what other tools it
could employ to address this issue, as well as a plan to strengthen
efforts to combat misinformation about vaccines and vaccination,
which are contributing to confusion and hesitancy.
Vaccines for Children Program.—The Vaccines for Children
[VFC] program provides safe, effective, and life-saving immuniza-
tions for millions of children each year, including the hepatitis B
immunization. The hepatitis B immunization alone has prevented
90,100 childhood deaths in the U.S. since 1994—the fourth highest
number of deaths prevented out of all 14 of the childhood immuni-
zations. Additionally, all vaccines in the VFC program have gone
through multiple rounds of scientific review and rigorous approval
processes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and ACIP.
The hepatitis B vaccine has been administered over 1 billion times
71
since its discovery—a clear testament to its safety and efficacy. The
Committee urges CDC to continue to fund and maintain the VFC
in an effort to prevent chronic illness and death in the United
States.
HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, AND
TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,391,056,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,381,056,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases
[STDs], and Tuberculosis Prevention [TB] is $1,381,056,000.
The Center administers CDC’s activities on HIV/AIDS, viral hep-
atitis, STDs, and TB, with the exception of the Global AIDS pro-
gram, which is housed in the Global Health Center.

Ending the HIV Epidemic [EHE] Initiative.—The Committee in-
cludes $220,000,000 for the EHE Initiative. The Committee sup-
ports efforts to increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]
medication that prevents HIV infection. CDC is encouraged to sup-
port the building blocks of a national program to increase aware-
ness of PrEP, including by increasing access to PrEP medication,
laboratory services, essential support services such as case man-
agement, counseling, linkage, and adherence services, robust PrEP
outreach and education activities, and PrEP provider capacity ex-
pansion.
Hepatitis.—The Committee encourages efforts to eliminate the
public health threat of viral hepatitis and to implement and help
fund the HHS National Viral Hepatitis Strategic Plan, which offers
a framework to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat.
The Committee encourages CDC to expand the viral hepatitis dis-
ease tracking and surveillance capabilities of States to permit an
effective targeting of resources and evaluation of program effective-
ness. In pursuit of this goal, the Committee recommends greater
emphasis and access to testing for both hepatitis B and hepatitis
D. The Committee is aware of the November 2021 ACIP rec-
ommendation that all adults between ages 19 and 59 be vaccinated
for hepatitis B and the March 2023 CDC recommendation that all
adults be screened for hepatitis B. The Committee urges a coordi-
nated Federal effort to implement these goals. The Committee
urges CDC to continue disease tracking and surveillance for acute
and chronic viral hepatitis A, B, and C in States and jurisdictions,
which will save lives and allow for effective and efficient distribu-
72
tion of resources. The Committee requests an update on the preva-
lence and incidence of hepatitis D and the opportunities to enhance
the analysis of this disease in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
HIV Prevention and Treatment.—The Committee recognizes the
continued threat posed by HIV, which remains on the rise in many
communities across the United States. There are approximately
32,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year, and pre-
venting a single new infection can result in an average of $850,000
in lifetime healthcare cost savings. The Committee underscores the
importance of preserving targeted Federal funding for HIV surveil-
lance, testing, linkage to care, and prevention and treatment serv-
ices and notes that State and local health departments require suf-
ficient resources to contain and reduce the spread of HIV. In addi-
tion, the Committee recognizes the transformative impact of contin-
ued biomedical innovations in turning HIV/AIDS from a fatal dis-
ease into a chronic, manageable condition, as well as a preventable
condition through PrEP, and underscores the importance of pre-
serving targeted funding to ensure access to essential HIV treat-
ment and prevention medicines, including long acting injectables
for HIV prevention. The Committee continues to support invest-
ment in four key strategic areas that are essential to ending the
HIV epidemic: (1) HIV testing and diagnosis of people living with
HIV; (2) linkage to care and rapid initiation of HIV treatment; (3)
connection to HIV prevention services, including PrEP; and (4) dis-
ease surveillance and rapid response to potential HIV outbreaks.
Infectious Diseases and Opioids.—The Committee encourages
CDC to prioritize jurisdictions with the highest age-adjusted mor-
tality rate related to SUDs and acute hepatitis C infection. CDC is
also encouraged to prioritize jurisdictions that are experiencing
outbreaks or emerging clusters of infectious diseases associated
with drug use, including those not eligible for EHE funding.
Sexually Transmitted Infections [STIs].—The Committee included
$10,000,000 for fiscal years 2023–2025 to advance the grant period
for the STI program forward one month. For fiscal year 2026, the
Committee provides $164,310,000 which will allow the program to
operate at the same fiscal level and grant year as provided for in
fiscal year 2025. The Committee is concerned by the high rates of
sexually transmitted infections in the United States, particularly
the increase in syphilis and congenital syphilis. The Committee in-
cludes funding to combat and prevent the high incidence of STIs.
The Committee directs CDC to work with other agencies, as appro-
priate, to develop innovative approaches including the use of tele-
health platforms and at home specimen collection to increase
screening, treatment, and education to curb the spread of STIs in
vulnerable populations.
Subawards.—The Committee is concerned about the account-
ability of subawards made with funds appropriated for infectious
diseases and the opioid epidemic and directs CDC to track and
monitor subawards.
Tribal Tuberculosis.—The Committee is concerned about the in-
sufficient staffing of tuberculosis technicians in Tribal areas. The
Committee encourages CDC in conjunction with State and local
health departments, to continue supporting TB prevention and
73
treatment activities in populations at highest risk for TB, including
American Indian and Alaska Native communities.
Tuberculosis [TB].—The Committee is concerned, that despite
the United States having one of the lowest incidence rates of TB
in the world, an outbreak in January 2025 caused 2 deaths, and
67 persons developed latent TB in Kansas. Delays in care for peo-
ple with TB and postponement of identification and treatment of
individuals with latent TB infection stalls efforts to eliminate TB
in the United States. The Committee encourages CDC to work to
ensure resources are available for TB screening, identification,
treatment, and prevention services.
EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $760,272,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 763,272,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases is $763,272,000, which
includes $52,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund.
The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Dis-
eases aims to detect, prevent, and control infectious diseases from
spreading, whether they are naturally occurring, unintentional, or
the result of terrorism.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol-
lowing activities in the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on
Antibiotic Resistance Initiative appropriations ............................................................................................... $197,000,000

Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Transfer from Prevention and Public Health Fund........................... 40,000,000
Healthcare-Associated Infections Transfer from Prevention and Public Health Fund.................................... 12,000,000
Advanced Molecular Detection [AMD].—The Committee includes
$40,000,000 and recognizes the critical role the AMD program
plays in bringing cutting edge technology to the front lines of public
health by harnessing the power of advanced sequencing methods
and high performance computing with bioinformatics and epidemi-
ology expertise to study pathogens. The Committee commends CDC
for advancing research in the critical area of lethal bacteria and
special pathogens. However, the Committee remains concerned
about the increasingly dangerous threat to public health of emerg-
ing and dangerous bacterial pathogens that can be difficult or im-
possible to grow in laboratory settings and can disproportionately
affect health equity of underrepresented populations. Further re-
search is required in advanced DNA sequencing to speed the devel-
opment of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The Committee
requests a briefing on the advanced DNA sequencing and detection
74
of novel emerging and dangerous pathogens no later than 180 days
after enactment of this act.
Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee continues to
support the administration’s proposal to address the problem of
antimicrobial resistant bacteria and fungi through a ‘‘One Health’’
approach and by tracking and preventing the spread of resistance
at the local, regional, national and global levels. The Committee
notes the complexities in conducting surveillance of antimicrobial
resistance. The Committee directs CDC to publish a report publicly
describing national trends in the prescription of antibiotics. The re-
port shall identify recommendations for how antibiotic stewardship
programs could be improved, and what steps should be taken for
Congress to help physicians improve appropriate use of antibiotics.
Additionally, the Committee recognizes the important role played
by CDC’s Global Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory and Re-
sponse Network in detecting and responding to threats, including
through the Antibiotic Resistance in Communities and Hospitals
[ARCH] initiative. The Committee urges continued investment in
ARCH, which is working in six countries to better understand, and
develop effective strategies to prevent, the spread of high-risk,
multi-drug resistant organisms in communities and hospitals lo-
cally and globally. The Committee also strongly encourages CDC to
increase awareness of the elevated risk of drug-resistant infections
that impact patients, especially those with cancer. The Committee
urges CDC to educate physicians and patients on infection preven-
tion and antibiotic stewardship as well as a focus on appropriate
antibiotic use in the cancer patient population.
Importation of Dogs.—The Committee understands the role of
CDC in preventing the spread of disease, however, certain changes
to the final rule entitled ‘‘Control of Communicable Disease; For-
eign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats’’ were not included
in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and did not receive public
comment. The burden of such changes on pene-exclaves and com-
munities near the border of a rabies-free or low-risk country should
be reviewed and mitigated by CDC. The Committee views CDC’s
efforts to modify implementation of the rule as a step forward. The
Committee directs CDC to maintain the current pause on imple-
mentation of the rule and further directs CDC to restart the rule
process in order to consider additional ways to ensure that the
transport of dogs into the country by rescue organizations, citizens
who cross the border for work or other daily activities, including
sporting events, and U.S. employees stationed overseas traveling
with their pets are not unreasonably inhibited. The Committee also
requests that CDC evaluate any flexibilities to the 6-months of age
requirement, in order to ensure dogs from rabies-free or low-risk
countries, and their owners or potential owners, are not unneces-
sarily penalized by the final rule. The Committee requests a brief-
ing within 60 days of enactment on the status of this rule.
Lyme Disease and Related Tick-Borne Illnesses.—The Committee
provides continued funding for programs authorized under the Kay
Hagan Tick Act (Public Law 116–94) to promote a public health ap-
proach to combat rising cases of tick-borne diseases. In distributing
these funds, the Committee directs CDC to prioritize entities fo-
cused on Lyme disease and related tick-borne diseases in the areas
75
of surveillance, control, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and edu-
cation. The Committee encourages CDC to execute the Lyme and
tick-borne disease portion of the National Strategy for Vector-borne
Disease in order to accelerate measures to improve Alpha-gal Syn-
drome surveillance, patient care, and public awareness with an em-
phasis on healthcare provider education, in keeping with the three
public health priorities identified in the CDC 2024 report. The
Committee recognizes the growing public health threat of Lyme
disease and related tick-borne diseases and directs CDC to provide
support in endemic areas as well as areas not yet considered en-
demic. Given the impact of Lyme disease and the status of ongoing
clinical trials, the Committee requests a report within 180 days of
enactment on CDC’s research to date and recommendations on ac-
tions needed to facilitate a successful Lyme disease vaccine rollout
that will build confidence and encourage uptake should a vaccine
be approved by the FDA.
Mosquito Surveillance and Control Activities.—The Committee
urges CDC to enhance capacity and expand nation-wide surveil-
lance of vector-borne disease through an Internet-based program
called VectorSurv. The Committee is aware that this modernized,
data management and analysis system is used by vector control
and state public health agencies in the U.S. It is currently in use
in a growing number of States and the U.S.–Affiliated Pacific Is-
lands. Mosquito control and public health agencies that use the
VectorSurv system are able to manage and analyze surveillance
and control data related to mosquitoes, ticks, arboviruses, and
other vector-borne diseases
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [ME/
CFS].—Given that a subset of patients with post-acute COVID–19
and other post-infectious syndromes meet the diagnostic criteria for
ME/CFS, the Committee continues to encourage CDC to develop a
national epidemiological and disease tracking study of post-infec-
tious syndromes prevalence, specifically the rates of ME/CFS in
adults. The Committee encourages CDC to strengthen collaboration
with (1) interagency partners, (2) disease experts and stakeholders,
and (3) the NIH’s Collaborative Research Centers. Additionally, the
Committee urges CDC to conduct a series of epidemiological stud-
ies into the causes, diagnosis, and risk factors of ME/CFS. The
Committee expects CDC to engage physicians and patients in an
effort to increase awareness of ME/CFS and disseminate updated
clinical guidance. Finally, the Committee supports CDC’s successful
Project ECHO-style primary care provider education programs and
encourages CDC to explore expanding the program to additional
States and regions, with a special focus on rural and underserved
communities.
Mycotic Diseases.—The Committee supports CDC’s efforts relat-
ing to mycotic diseases, including its collaboration with the Valley
Fever Institute, Valley Fever Center for Excellence, and the Cocci
Study Group. As part of this effort, the Committee urges CDC to
grow its work to improve surveillance, awareness, and diagnostics
for coccidioidomycosis and other fungal diseases. The Committee
also urges CDC to prioritize national action plans or programs that
seek to increase disease surveillance, medical stewardship, and pa-
tient education and awareness activities; biothreat readiness or ac-
76
tivities that deliver expedited and actionable results at the point-
of-care, provide potential to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations or
escalations of care, or aid the government’s ability to halt the
spread of deadly fungal infections nationally; and medical products,
such as diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, that work against a pri-
ority fungal pathogen with particular focus on novel products that
create new product classes capable of spurring future product
types. The Committee directs CDC to fund these activities at not
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
National Healthcare Safety Network [NHSN].—The Committee
includes $24,000,000 for NHSN and recognizes the critical value of
this system for healthcare quality measurement and improvement,
as well as supporting national security needs for situational aware-
ness of health systems’ capacity during major outbreaks and pan-
demic responses. The Committee supports the modernization of the
system’s infrastructure resulting in increased timeliness and accu-
racy, reduced burden on healthcare facilities, and the ability to col-
lect urgent data as called for by the National Biodefense Strategy
to create an enduring domestic all-hazards hospital data collection
capability.
Prion Disease Surveillance.—The Committee is concerned that
Chronic wasting disease [CWD], a fatal condition in cervids (deer,
elk, and moose) caused by misfolded prions, has been detected in
over 30 States and all four regions of the country. Monitoring the
prevalence of prion diseases, including determining a disease’s inci-
dence and whether it was acquired from animals or other humans,
is critical. In light of scientific observations regarding the Nation-
wide spread of CWD and concerns about the potential for cross-spe-
cies transmissions to humans and food production animals, the
Committee includes $8,000,000 for surveillance efforts of human
prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, through the
National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center and CDC.
Quarantine and Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance [TGS].—
The Committee includes a $2,000,000 increase for this program
and supports efforts to detect pathogens early and enhance global
biosecurity efforts through the Traveler-based Genomic Surveil-
lance program. The Committee is aware of the expansion of the
TGS program and its ability to detect over 60 pathogens collected
through aircraft wastewater and nasal swabs from voluntary trav-
elers arriving at eight international U.S. based airports and rec-
ommends continuing to advance these activities through resources
made available in this bill and from prior years’ appropriations bal-
ances. This capability has been transformative in advancing the
Nation’s pathogen surveillance capabilities to provide early warn-
ing for detection, characterization and response, including assess-
ments of medical countermeasure efficacy.
Sepsis.—The Committee includes $5,000,000 to support CDC’s
ongoing work for expanded data collection related to sepsis and the
Sepsis Core Elements through NHSN and the Division of
Healthcare Quality Promotion’s work to develop sepsis quality
measures. The Committee recognizes the importance of developing,
in coordination with CMS, measures to improve the detection of
sepsis and outcomes for patients with sepsis. These include a hos-
pital sepsis programs’ structural measure to address the implemen-
77
tation of structures and activities to improve the recognition and
care of patients with sepsis, the Adult Sepsis Event outcome meas-
ure that will assess the number of cases and outcomes of adult pa-
tients hospitalized with sepsis, and the Pediatric Sepsis Event
measure that will be used to estimate the National burden of pedi-
atric sepsis. The Committee requests CDC release an annual report
on hospital use of the Sepsis Core Elements, which includes how
many hospitals use the Core Elements and CDC plans for further
analysis that detail success and barriers to implementation of the
sepsis Core Elements.
Vector-Borne Diseases [VBDs].—The Committee is concerned
about the risk of a vector-borne infectious disease outbreak in the
United States and our readiness to quickly respond to and stop its
spread. The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for con-
tinued implementation of the Kay Hagan Tick Act and to enhance
capacity to expand nation-wide surveillance of vector-borne disease.
The Committee intends that this additional funding will also sup-
port the purposes of the Strengthening Mosquito Abatement for
Safety and Health provisions in the All-Hazards Preparedness and
Advancing Innovation Act (Public Law 116–22).
Wastewater Surveillance.—The Committee remains encouraged
by CDC’s infectious disease surveillance work through wastewater
surveillance that partners with health laboratories and academic
institutions to track multiple existing infectious disease threats si-
multaneously and to quickly pivot to detect both the resurgence of
known pathogens and the emergence of new threats. The Com-
mittee continues to underscore the importance of a wastewater sur-
veillance system that can serve as a national early-warning system
for infectious diseases with broad geographic representation that
strategically incorporates sites across the country to strengthen
early detection and biosecurity and shares results publicly to help
inform communities and protect Americans. The Committee directs
CDC to provide details regarding the status of wastewater surveil-
lance including specifications for the number, composition, capabili-
ties, and geographic distribution of sites in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
This information should also include recommendations regarding
the funding required annually to create a national wastewater sur-
veillance system for infectious diseases as well as an analysis of
spending on wastewater surveillance for fiscal years 2023–2026.
CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,433,914,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,428,914,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion is
$1,428,914,000, which includes $340,417,000 in transfers from the
PPH Fund.
The mission of the Center is to provide national leadership in
promoting health and well-being through prevention and control of
chronic diseases. More than one-half of all American adults have
at least one chronic illness, and such diseases account for 70 per-
cent of all U.S. deaths and over three-quarters of all healthcare
costs in the United States.
78
These conditions are largely preventable or improved through
evidence-based programs and strategies. The Committee encour-
ages CDC to continue working with State and local health depart-
ments and national organizations to maximize their investments in
evidence-based programming and strategies at the community
level.
Within the total provided for the National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the following amounts
are available for the following activities:

Alzheimer’s Disease.—The Committee recommendation includes
$41,500,000, an increase of $2,000,000 to continue Alzheimer’s and
related dementias public health programs authorized in Public Law
115–406 and to strengthen the Healthy Brain Initiative, including
implementation of the Healthy Brain Initiative Public Health Road
Maps. HHS formally made prevention of Alzheimer’s disease a na-
79
tional priority when it added Goal Six to the National plan to fight
the disease in 2021. Goal Six calls for clear strategies to achieve
the goal, including additional research, strengthening our Nation’s
public health infrastructure, and turning risk reduction into clin-
ical practice. The Committee is encouraged by research dem-
onstrating the impact of risk reduction on dementia prevalence. To
ensure disproportionately affected populations are reached, the
Committee encourages CDC to increase capacity to support popu-
lations with a high burden of Alzheimer’s and other dementias
through public health promotion and workforce development. The
Committee directs the Secretary to publish a report publicly within
180 days of enactment on progress made toward meeting the goal.
Breast and Cervical Cancer.—The Committee includes
$235,500,000 for the provision of critical, lifesaving breast cancer
screening and diagnostic services to uninsured and underinsured
women. The Committee is aware that there are still substantial
barriers to screening like geographic isolation, limited health lit-
eracy, lack of provider recommendation, inconvenient times to ac-
cess services, and language barriers. The Committee directs CDC
to continue efforts to reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities
especially in underserved communities and to work to reach women
who may have delayed screening services during the COVID–19
pandemic.
Cardiac Emergency Response Planning in Schools.—The Com-
mittee notes the recent enactment of the Cardiomyopathy Health
Education, Awareness, and Research, and AED Training in the
Schools [HEARTS] Act (Public Law 118–176) and encourages CDC
to provide extramural funding to an appropriate partner with rel-
evant expertise to systematically review, identify best practices,
and offer recommendations for AED deployment as directed by the
HEARTS Act.
Childhood Cancer STAR Act.—The Committee continues
$2,000,000 for implementation of the Childhood Cancer Survivor-
ship, Treatment, Access, and Research [STAR] Act (Public Law
115–180 and 117–350) for CDC’s ongoing efforts to enhance State
cancer registries to track cancer in children, adolescents, and young
adults.
Chronic Disease and Alzheimer’s.—The Committee recognizes the
work of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases, espe-
cially as more is learned about the relationship and linkage be-
tween multiple chronic diseases. Research shows association be-
tween multiple chronic diseases, modifiable risk factors, and the
development of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Heart disease,
obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions are being studied as
risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The Committee
requests a report from CDC within 120 days of enactment of this
act outlining efforts to educate, particularly underserved commu-
nities, about the relationship between chronic diseases and poten-
tial development of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
Chronic Disease Education and Awareness [CDEA] Program.—
The Committee notes the importance of the CDEA program and in-
cludes funding to support grants for chronic health conditions that
do not have a line item in CDC’s budget. The Committee urges
80
CDC to continue to support several important multi-year projects
that are improving public and professional awareness, along with
new initiatives. Multiple conditions, patient advocacy organiza-
tions, clinicians, and researchers could benefit from this program,
such as schizophrenia; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
[POTS] and similar forms of dysautonomia; tardive dyskinesia,
which can be a debilitating movement disorder affecting individ-
uals with serious mental illness; and improved prevention, diag-
nosis, and treatment of life-threatening blood clots.
Eating Disorders Awareness Program.—The Committee is con-
cerned that eating disorders have one of the highest fatality rates
of any psychiatric illness, and the rate of diagnosis for youth ages
12–18 rose 25 percent since 2019. The Committee supports the im-
plementation of public awareness campaigns for eating disorders
including education implementation on proper prevention strate-
gies.
Epilepsy.—The Committee includes $11,500,000 and commends
CDC for its ongoing leadership of this successful program and ef-
fective community collaboration, and encourages further efforts to
eliminate stigma, improve awareness and education, and better
connect people with epilepsy to health and community services.
The Committee appreciates CDC’s ongoing epilepsy-related surveil-
lance and funding of epidemiologic studies on epilepsy and recog-
nizes the importance of data to accurately understand the inci-
dence, prevalence, and mortality rate of epilepsies, along with indi-
vidual and social risk factors that influence health outcomes. The
Committee encourages CDC to enhance surveillance and epidemio-
logic studies of the epilepsies to generate data that can guide inter-
ventions to improve outcomes for people with epilepsy, including
interventions for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The Com-
mittee looks forward to receiving the report requested in fiscal year
2024 on current gaps in surveillance data of people living with
epilepsies and on the feasibility, cost, and timing of case reporting
epilepsy through the addition of the disease to the National Neuro-
logical Conditions Surveillance System.
Farm-to-School.—The Committee continues $2,000,000 within
Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity for research and edu-
cation activities related to farm-to-school programs that result in
promoting healthy eating habits for students. The Committee in-
tends that these grants support multi-agency, multi-organizational
State farm to early childhood initiatives. The Committee also di-
rects CDC to coordinate farm-to-early childhood program efforts
with the Office of Community Food Systems at the Department of
Agriculture.
Fertility Data and Assisted Reproductive Technology [ART].—The
Committee is concerned by the elimination of CDC’s ART Surveil-
lance and Research team, which fulfilled statutorily mandated ac-
tivities under the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification
Act [FCSRCA] of 1992. This team collected and published data on
over 98 percent of U.S. IVF cycles, ensuring transparency and ac-
countability for families seeking fertility care. The Committee di-
rects CDC to restore full ARTS program capacity, including rees-
tablishing staff with demonstrated expertise in fertility and ART
and maintaining public reporting of ART data. The Committee pro-
81
vides funding sufficient to support the staff and statutorily re-
quired activities of this program. Additionally, CDC shall keep the
ART dataset publicly available and updated at least quarterly. The
Committee reminds CDC of its obligation under FCSRCA to ensure
this data is transparent, comprehensive, and standardized, ena-
bling patients to make informed medical decisions about fertility
treatment. The Committee requests a report 60 days after enact-
ment on CDC’s ART data and research activities.
Food Allergies.—The Committee recognizes the serious issue of
food allergies, which affect approximately 8 percent of children in
the United States. The Committee includes continued funding for
a school-based effort to address food allergies and reduce poten-
tially fatal anaphylactic reactions.
Food Service Guidelines [FSG] for Federal Facilities.—The Food
Service Guidelines for Federal Facilities is a set of voluntary best
practices that can be used to increase healthy and safe food options
for employees. The Committee encourages the Director to update
the guidelines and work with the General Services Administration
to increase awareness and adoption of the Food Service Guidelines
for Federal Facilities and to ensure they are updated following each
update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Heart Disease and Stroke.—The Committee continues funding for
CDC’s Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention program. CDC is en-
couraged to support community partnerships in additional States
to control heart disease and stroke and help the more than 119
million Americans living with high blood pressure. The Committee
continues funding to support implementation of the Cardiovascular
Advances in Research and Opportunities Legacy Act (Public Law
117–224). In addition, the Committee also continues the
WISEWOMAN program to increase the number of low-income, un-
insured and underinsured women who are assessed and connected
to resources.
High Obesity Rate Counties.—The Committee directs CDC to con-
tinue this program at no less than the fiscal year 2024 level. CDC
grantees are expected to work with State and local public health
departments and other partners to support measurable outcomes
through community and population-level evidence-based obesity
intervention and prevention programs. Funded projects should in-
tegrate evidence-based policy, systems, and environmental ap-
proaches to better understand and address the environmental and
societal implications of obesity. The Committee encourages CDC to
also consider including the preponderance of obesity by State based
on the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in its eli-
gibility criteria for the High Obesity Program.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD].—The Committee commends
CDC’s ongoing efforts to continue epidemiological studies on
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, known collectively as IBD,
and encourages CDC to establish awareness and education activi-
ties for patients and healthcare professionals to improve early dis-
ease diagnosis to result in improved outcomes.
Lung Cancer.—The Committee is concerned that only 16 percent
of all those eligible were screened for lung cancer. To improve
screening rates, the Committee encourages CDC to work with
States on targeted, cost-effective strategies that increase lung can-
82
cer screening rates. Strategies might include improving patient and
provider education, increasing awareness of the screening criteria,
and leveraging patient navigators and community health workers
to reduce barriers to accessing lung cancer screening.
Kidney Disease.—The Committee provides funding to support the
Chronic Kidney Disease Program, for activities that increase
awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic kidney disease
[CKD] including continued support for existing partnerships. CDC
is encouraged to support the public awareness initiative for advanc-
ing American kidney health that was established to implement Ex-
ecutive Order 13879.
Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative.—Within the funds pro-
vided for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the
Committee encourages CDC to continue the Mississippi Delta
Health Collaborative project and requests that CDC provide an up-
date on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
National Diabetes Prevention Program.—The Committee includes
an increase and is encouraged by the health progress of many par-
ticipants in CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program. The
Committee encourages CDC to continue its work to update the
PreventT2 curriculum content to include evidence from the USDA’s
Dietary Guidelines for Americans on the importance of and access
to healthy foods, including data on disease prevention through a
balanced diet, and to prioritize working directly with local commu-
nity partners who provide produce prescription programming. The
Committee encourages CDC to explore ways to integrate food as
medicine approaches in the National Diabetes Prevention Program.
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.—The Committee
encourages CDC to work with healthcare providers to inform the
public about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS] and
similar forms of dysautonomia, common chronic conditions that im-
pact millions of Americans and cause severe disability. The Com-
mittee is concerned that 28 States do not have a board-certified au-
tonomic specialist resulting in POTS patients facing on average a
5-year diagnostic delay, and encourages CDC to work with a na-
tional patient advocacy organization and expert clinicians and re-
searchers to develop an education program for healthcare providers
to increase access to care for POTS and similar dysautonomia pa-
tients.
Prostate Cancer.—The Committee remains concerned about the
continued rise in prostate cancer deaths and supports CDC’s work
to address this trend by increasing public awareness of prostate
cancer risks, screening, and treatment in high-risk men. The Com-
mittee provides continued funding for CDC’s prostate cancer activi-
ties, including for outreach and education initiatives targeting
high-risk men and their families.
Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health [REACH].—
The Committee includes $64,950,000 to support grantees in build-
ing capacity for collaboration and disseminating evidence-based
strategies in communities. REACH is a vital initiative to help
eliminate healthcare disparities in minority communities. The
Committee’s recommended level includes $24,000,000 for Good
Health and Wellness in Indian Country.
83
Reducing Healthcare Costs.—The Committee recognizes the role
of CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion in addressing chronic diseases, which account for
seven of the 10 leading causes of death and significantly contribute
to the Nation’s $4,500,000,000,000 in annual healthcare costs. The
Committee is concerned that despite high healthcare spending, the
United States continues to face suboptimal health outcomes. The
Committee also acknowledges the connection between chronic dis-
eases and infectious diseases, as people with chronic conditions are
at higher risk of severe illness and death from infectious disease.
Strengthening prevention efforts is a cost-effective strategy to im-
prove the Nation’s health status, reduce healthcare spending and
support a more productive workforce. To ensure transparency and
accountability, the Committee requests a briefing from CDC within
120 days of enactment CDC’s ongoing efforts to reduce healthcare
costs through data driven public health programs, partnerships
with non-governmental entities, and coordination with State and
local health departments.
Rural Prevention Health Research.—The Committee recognizes
the important work of Prevention Research Centers [PRCs], in par-
ticular the needs of rural focused prevention research. The Com-
mittee encourages CDC to review their grant funding process to en-
sure appropriate funding to rural areas, including rural Appa-
lachia, which consistently ranks high in incidences of disease, in-
jury, and poor health outcomes, to ensure important rural health
research continues to take place. The Committee also directs CDC
to ensure at least 20 percent of PRC funding is being directed to
research in rural areas.
Safe Motherhood and Infant Health.—The Committee includes a
$3,000,000 increase for this portfolio of programs to improve the
health of pregnant and postpartum individuals and their infants.
The CDC is directed to maintain the same level of staff in the Safe
Motherhood Office as were in place on March 31, 2025. The mater-
nal mortality rate in the United States has trended downward in
recent years but still persists at an unacceptably high rate. The
Committee encourages CDC to use the funding increase to expand
support for Maternal Mortality Review Committees [MMRCs],
Perinatal Quality Collaboratives [PQCs], the Hear Her Campaign,
and other programs including Sudden Unexplained Infant Death
[SUID] and the Sudden Death in the Young [SDY] Case Registry.
The Committee is concerned that data collection under the Preg-
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System [PRAMS] was
inexplicably paused this year and that staffing reductions will im-
pact data collection and technical assistance going forward. The
Committee includes funding to continue this vital program to pro-
vide accurate national statistics on U.S. maternal mortality rates
and inform data-driven actions to prevent these deaths. The Com-
mittee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this act on
PRAMS data collection efforts in fiscal year 2025 and barriers to
effective and consistent data collection and opportunities to im-
prove coordination among State MMRCs. The Committee encour-
ages CDC to prioritize funding to help MMRCs build stronger data
systems and improve data collection at the State level to create
consistency and ensure accuracy and completeness in data collec-
84
tion, analysis, and reporting across State MMRCs. Additionally, the
Committee supports CDC for funding State-based PQCs and en-
courages CDC to prioritize funding to expand PQCs to additional
States and territories and provide increased support to existing
PQCs. The Committee requests an update on the expansion of
PQCs beyond the States currently funded, as well as any barriers
to expansion in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
School Health.—The Committee includes $19,400,000 to promote
school-based health and to prevent chronic disease and promote the
health and well-being of children and adolescents in schools.
School Health Index [SHI].—The Committee understands the im-
portance for educational institutions to promote health and
wellness to their students from a holistic perspective to encourage
stronger learning environments. The Committee recognizes that
CDC created SHI to assist schools in evaluating and improving the
health and well-being of students. The Committee encourages CDC
to create and develop a tool similar to the SHI for higher edu-
cation.
Skin Cancer Education and Prevention.—The Committee is con-
cerned with the growing number of people diagnosed with prevent-
able forms of skin cancer, which is now the most commonly diag-
nosed cancer in the United States. The Committee provides
$5,000,000 for skin cancer education and prevention and encour-
ages CDC to continue its collaboration and partnership with local
governments, business, health, education, community, nonprofit,
and faith-based sectors.
Sleep Health and Sleep Disorders.—The Committee is concerned
with the troubling lack of coordinated efforts in public health to im-
prove sleep health and disorder awareness, diagnosis, and treat-
ment despite landmark scientific discoveries demonstrating the sig-
nificant impact of sleep on disease and mental and physical health
and wellness. The Committee encourages CDC to expand activities
to improve sleep health and sleep disorders awareness, epidemi-
ology, detection, and care particularly for rare and orphan sleep
disorders, like narcolepsy, and requests that CDC provide an up-
date on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Sudden Cardiac Arrest.—The Committee recognizes that sudden
cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death among athletes at all
ages and that timely access to automated external defibrillators
[AEDs] can significantly improve survival rates. The Committee
urges CDC to publish best practices for how to best deploy AEDs
in sporting facilities, including schools, colleges, community cen-
ters, and stadiums. The best practices should include recommenda-
tions on optimal locations, maintenance, training, and coordination
with emergency medical services, including the development of
Emergency Action Plans for AED deployment. Additionally, the
Committee encourages CDC to expand the Cardiac Arrest Registry
to Enhance Survival [CARES] program to capture data from addi-
tional States. The Committee recognizes that every year, more than
350,000 Americans fall victim to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and
only about 1 in 10 will survive this event. Registry data is critical
to improving sudden cardiac survival rates in all States by allowing
communities to measure the quality of patient care, establish per-
85
formance goals, and analyze emergency response data to identify
opportunities for improvement.
Tobacco.—The Committee includes funding for CDC, States,
Tribes and territories to continue efforts to reduce tobacco use
among disparate populations and in areas and regions with high
tobacco prevalence and mortality, such as rural communities, vet-
erans, and people with behavioral health conditions, as well as con-
tinue the highly successful and cost-effective Tips from Former
Smokers media campaign, which has helped over 1 million people
quit smoking, saved lives, and saved over $7,000,000,000 in
healthcare costs. The Committee acknowledges the overall progress
that has been made on reducing adult smoking prevalence, but un-
fortunately approximately 2 in 10 U.S. adults continues to smoke
cigarettes, and urges CDC to continue its evidence-based work to
ensure that rates also decline in populations disproportionately af-
fected by tobacco use, including rural communities. The Committee
remains concerned that 10 percent of youth use at least one tobacco
product and encourages CDC’s ongoing efforts to respond to and
prevent youth use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. The
Committee is also concerned by staff terminations within the Office
of Smoking and Health, especially as tobacco use has long been the
leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The con-
tinued funding for CDC’s tobacco programs will allow CDC, States,
Tribes and territories to continue programs and activities to reduce
tobacco use. The Committee directs CDC to provide a briefing on
the Tobacco program, including a breakdown of funding sources,
programs, and activities within 120 days of enactment of this act.
Additionally, CDC is instructed to provide information on how
funds are currently supporting, or may prospectively support, FDA
enforcement and regulation of unauthorized products and State di-
rectories.
Type 1 Diabetes.—Over 1,450,000 Americans have type 1 diabe-
tes [T1D], with 304,000 of those diagnosed under the age of 18. The
Committee is concerned that CDC has not adequately focused edu-
cation and awareness efforts on T1D, especially given the signifi-
cant progress made in the past several years related to new treat-
ments. The Committee directs CDC to update its website to reflect
progress on treatments for T1D. The website should include infor-
mation targeting physicians, school health workers, parents, and
young adults about screening recommendations as well as potential
treatments now available to delay onset of T1D. The Committee
also directs CDC to provide a plan, no later than 60 days after en-
actment of this act, outlining steps the agency will take to increase
outreach and education efforts focused on T1D.
Vision and Eye Health.—The Committee provides $4,500,000 for
vision and eye health and glaucoma detection The Committee is
aware that vision impairments and eye disease contribute to or
complicate many other serious and costly chronic health conditions,
including diabetes, depression and anxiety, cardiovascular disease,
and cognitive decline. Data on risk of vision loss and existence of
vision loss in the United States is necessary to inform State and
community partnerships that emphasize early detection and inter-
vention and to address the biggest challenges

Autism.—The Committee includes funding for the Autism Devel-
opmental Disabilities Monitoring [ADDM] Network and to continue
surveillance of cerebral palsy to reach nearly all of its 16 ADDM
Network sites.
Blood Clots.—The Committee is concerned about the enormous
toll of blood clots on patients and the healthcare system, particu-
larly for pregnant women, Black Americans, and cancer patients.
The Committee again urges CDC to develop a comprehensive, na-
tionwide blood clot education and awareness campaign for the gen-
eral public focused on the treatment and prevention of blood clots
and education and training of healthcare professionals about the
signs and symptoms of blood clots.
Congenital Heart Disease [CHD].—CHD is the most common and
deadliest category of birth defects in the United States. The Com-
mittee commends NCBDDD for its leadership in improving under-
standing of the unique, specialized care needs for the growing CHD
population across the lifespan. The Committee includes $9,250,000
for surveillance, research, and awareness activities authorized by
87
the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act (Public Law
115–342), including to support additional longitudinal surveillance
sites, survey activities on long-term outcomes and patient needs,
engagement with healthcare providers, and analysis of healthcare
claims and clinical data.
Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—The Committee in-
cludes $9,000,000 to continue Muscular Dystrophy research and
disease surveillance initiatives. The Committee strongly encourages
CDC to update research and tracking to better understand the out-
comes for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy treated both
in and out of Certified Duchenne Care Centers; examine impacts
of Duchenne on bone health, cardiovascular, and cognitive function;
and investigate care and outcomes for adults with Duchenne, those
receiving multiple therapies including gene therapy, and various
demographic subpopulations. The Committee requests a report
within 180 days of enactment of this act detailing its plan for up-
dating muscular dystrophy efforts along these parameters.
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.—The Committee includes $11,500,000
for the surveillance of prenatal alcohol use and fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorders [FASD], to facilitate partnerships to prevent alcohol
use during pregnancy, improve support services and access to care
by responding to families living with FASD, and disseminating
practical resources and information through existing community-
based local affiliates.
Hemophilia Programs.—The Committee strongly supports and
maintains funding for the hemophilia programs long housed at
CDC’s Division of Blood Disorders and Public Health Genomics.
The Committee recognizes the important work of these programs,
which help fund the collection of surveillance data by Hemophilia
Treatment Centers and support public health efforts related to
bleeding disorders. These programs also support laboratory testing
and other essential work relating to the detection, understanding,
and prevention of inhibitors—a devastating complication that af-
fects up to 20 percent of individuals living with hemophilia, vastly
increasing the disease burden and costs of treatment for the dis-
order.
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome [NAS] Surveillance.—The Com-
mittee includes $4,250,000 to address the rise in NAS resulting
from the overuse of opioids and other related substances during
pregnancy. Funding should be used to conduct research on the use
of opioids and other substances during pregnancy and related ad-
verse outcomes from infancy through childhood, and identify best
practices for care, evaluation, and management to help children.
Physical Activity for People with Disabilities.—The Committee
provides an increase of $1,000,000 to strengthen existing programs
that address healthy athletes.
Rare Blood Disorders and Immune Thrombocytopenia [ITP]
Care.—The Committee encourages CDC to explore the creation of
an ITP treatment centers pilot program in order to identify public
health and patient care opportunities to enhance efficiency and im-
prove outcomes in coordination with the professional and patient
community to establish an ITP treatment centers pilot program
modeled on similar successful efforts for hemophilia and sickle cell
88
disease. The Committee requests a briefing on resource needs and
core activities within 180 days of the enactment of this act.
Sickle Cell Disease [SCD].—The Committee provides continued
funding for the sickle cell disease data collection program. The
Committee encourages CDC to provide technical assistance to addi-
tional States with a higher prevalence of SCD, so that they can
successfully participate in this grant program to better identify af-
fected individuals in their States and better meet their needs.
Spina Bifida.—The Committee recognizes that Spina Bifida is
the most common permanently disabling congenital disability com-
patible with life in the United States, affecting 1,500 babies in the
country each year. While Spina Bifida and related neural tube de-
fects are sometimes preventable through education and adequate
daily folic acid consumption, there are an estimated 166,000 indi-
viduals, more than 65 percent of whom are adults, living with all
forms of this complex birth defect. The Committee understands
that there is a significant need for immediate support at CDC to
address the transitional and adult care needs of the growing, aging
Spina Bifida community and the Committee requests an update in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts to address these needs. The Com-
mittee supports the continuation of the Spina Bifida Clinical Care
Monitoring and Tracking Program, which works with the National
Spina Bifida Registry to guide the healthcare community in the
best treatment options for people living with Spina Bifida.
Stillbirth.—Stillbirth rates remain unacceptably high, affecting
thousands of families each year. The Committee appreciates the
findings and recommendations included in the March 2023 Still-
birth Task Force report and encourages CDC to implement the rec-
ommendations including improved recordkeeping, data collection,
and analysis about stillbirths, addressing disparities in stillbirth
risk, and provide better support for families after a stillbirth oc-
curs.
Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Net-
work [SET–NET].—The Committee includes $23,000,000 for SET–
NET. The program supports CDC’s collaboration with State, Tribal,
territorial, and local health departments to monitor the impact of
emerging health threats, including COVID–19, and the impact of
such threats on pregnancy, as well as the health of infants, to in-
form public health and clinical decision-making.
Tourette Syndrome.—The Committee provides $2,500,000 and di-
rects CDC to continue to educate physicians, educators, clinicians,
allied professionals, and the general public about the disorder and
to improve scientific knowledge on prevalence, risk factors, and co-
occurring conditions of Tourette Syndrome. The Committee com-
mends CDC for its national public health education and research
program on Tourette syndrome. The Committee encourages funding
be used to continue to educate physicians, educators, clinicians, al-
lied professionals, and the general public about the disorder and to
improve scientific knowledge on prevalence, risk factors, cost, and
impact and co-occurring conditions of Tourette syndrome.

Community Health Workers and Community Health.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of the community health work-
force in reaching underserved communities, preventing illness, and
reducing related healthcare costs. The Committee urges CDC to en-
courage the use of community health workers, including within
Tribal communities, to support the delivery of person-centered care.
Global Civil Registry and Vital Statistics.—The Committee
strongly supports the National Center for Health Statistics’ efforts
to facilitate capacity building among low- and middle-income coun-
tries to develop civil registry and vital statistics systems. The Com-
mittee requests a report within 180 days of enactment that in-
cludes a listing of countries that have been supported through
these partnerships to-date and a budgetary estimate of the funding
required to continue this work.
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.—The Committee recog-
nizes that CDC’s mission to detect and respond to health threats
requires rapid dissemination of information. The Committee urges
CDC to continue publication of CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report, which allows for timely release of public health in-
formation. The Committee also directs CDC to continue publishing
evidence-based scientific findings in peer-reviewed journals to dis-
seminate public health data, health surveillance findings, and sup-
plemental information.
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander National Health Interview
Survey.—The Committee recognizes that it has been 10 years since
the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander National Health Inter-
view Survey was last fielded. The Committee looks forward to the
report as directed in Public Law 118–47 on the feasibility, advis-
ability, and costs to re-issue this survey, as well as methods to en-
90
sure the inclusion of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in the
annual National Health Interview Study.
National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System.—The
Committee includes $5,000,000 within Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and Informatics to continue efforts on the two initial conditions-
multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.
Public Health Data Modernization Initiative [DMI].—The Com-
mittee commends CDC’s work to advance public health data mod-
ernization and acknowledges that efforts to enhance public health
data system capabilities will result in fast and more reliable data
sharing. The Committee provides continued funding for CDC to
continue bringing together State, Tribal, local and territorial public
health jurisdictions and public and private sector partners with the
goal of establishing modern, interoperable, and real-time public
health data and surveillance systems to protect the American pub-
lic. The Committee recommends CDC ensure that funding from
DMI is allocated to jurisdictions through the National Center for
Health Statistics to support necessary upgrades to their vital sta-
tistics systems to enable more, better, and faster vital records data.
The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of
this act on the progress and plans for programs and activities sup-
ported by DMI funding. The Committee directs HHS to prioritize
CDC data modernization and IT projects, focusing on improving en-
terprise capabilities and infrastructure. The Committee further di-
rects HHS to continue to provide quarterly reports for all ongoing
projects.
Public Health Workforce.—The Committee includes $71,000,000
and urges CDC to invest in fellowship and training programs to re-
build the public health workforce that includes, but is not limited
to, epidemiologists, contact tracers, lab scientists, community
health workers, data scientists, behavioral scientists, disease inter-
vention and prevention specialists, occupational health specialists,
public health physicians, veterinarians, nurses, informaticians, pro-
gram managers, economists, policy and evaluation experts, and
communicators who can help protect the Nation’s communities.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $242,850,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 242,850,000
The Committee provides $242,850,000 for the National Center
for Environmental Health. This includes $51,000,000 in transfers
from the PPH Fund.
The National Center for Environmental Health addresses emerg-
ing pathogens and environmental toxins that pose significant chal-
lenges to public health. The Center conducts surveillance and data
collection to determine which substances in the environment are
found in people and to what degree. The Center also determines
whether, and at what level of, exposure to these substances are
harmful to humans.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] Registry.—The Committee
encourages CDC to continue its investment in research that will re-
duce incidence and prevalence of ALS in the United States. The
Committee encourages CDC to continue its efforts to evaluate, up-
date, and improve the National ALS Registry program, by ensuring
that the most up to date information is provided to researchers,
and ALS patients are connected with clinical trials, treatments,
and resources in a timely manner. The Committee supports contin-
ued ALS prevalence reports, and urges CDC to publish these re-
ports in a timely manner and provide updates regarding these
prevalence reports. Additionally, the Committee urges CDC to col-
laborate with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to
provide a publicly available report on the incidence and prevalence
of ALS among military veterans.
Asthma.—The Committee includes funding for the National
Asthma Control Program [NACP] so CDC can work with States to
improve health outcomes for people living with asthma. As the
number and severity of wildfires increases, the Committee also
urges the NACP to continue its efforts to develop public health
interventions aimed at protecting people with asthma from wildfire
smoke. The Committee also recognizes the significance of asthma
as a chronic disease and supports the National Asthma Control
Program [NACP] in its efforts to reduce asthma-related hospitaliza-
tions, emergency department visits, and healthcare costs. The Com-
mittee recognizes the economic impact of asthma on workplace and
school productivity and urges CDC to provide an updated assess-
ment of the National economic burden of asthma, including preva-
lence, medical costs, absenteeism, and mortality.
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention.—The Committee includes
$51,000,000 to prevent and mitigate childhood lead exposure and
expand the data capabilities of the program to rapidly identify and
address emerging threats in communities with elevated risk of ex-
posure to lead. CDC is expected to support local capacity to im-
prove the health of children through efforts to eliminate lead from
their environment. Additionally, the Committee is disappointed by
the recent upheaval in the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention
Program, caused by the terminations of the entire branch’s staff,
before those terminations were reversed months later. The funding
provided in this act is intended to support the program’s activities
as they existed in fiscal year 2024. As such, CDC is directed to con-
92
tinue providing funding and technical support to health depart-
ments for identifying, tracking, and responding to lead exposures
in children; maintaining the blood lead surveillance system; devel-
oping and updating guidance and training for health departments
and healthcare providers to support lead poisoning prevention ef-
forts; and offering technical assistance for lead exposure events, in-
cluding through the deployment of CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning
Prevention branch staff to localities requesting assistance after a
lead exposure event.
Climate and Health.—The Committee includes $10,000,000 for
the program to provide guidance, data, and technical assistance to
all States, local health departments, and additional assistance to
Tribes and territories, to identify possible health effects associated
with a changing climate and implement health adaptation plans.
Communities across the country are vulnerable to health effects
from increasingly common events such as heatwaves, wildfires,
floods, droughts, and extreme storms. The Committee expects CDC
to aid in the development and implementation of State-specific ac-
tion plans to protect health from these threats.
Extreme Heat and Data Collection.—The Committee recognizes
the increasing frequency and severity of extreme heat events and
the lack of currently available data to adequately understand the
financial burden that extreme heat places upon healthcare sys-
tems. The Committee encourages CDC, in collaboration with the
National Integrated Heat Health Information System [NIHHIS]
and its participating agencies, to develop and implement a system
for tracking and making publicly available the healthcare costs as-
sociated with the increased demand for medical assistance during
extreme heat events, including expenses related to emergency room
visits, urgent care treatments, hospitalizations, and associated
medications.
Pediatric Reference Intervals.—The Committee encourages CDC
to initiate efforts to improve the accuracy of pediatric reference in-
tervals. CDC is directed to include an estimate of the costs associ-
ated with developing pediatric reference intervals in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Per and Polyflouroalkyl Substances [PFAS].—The Committee re-
mains concerned that extended exposure to PFAS is associated
with decreased antibody response, dyslipidemia, decreased infant
and fetal growth, and increased risk of kidney cancer. CDC is en-
couraged to continue to provide clinical guidance to advise clini-
cians when to offer PFAS blood testing to patients who are likely
to have a history of elevated exposure.
Radon.—The Committee continues to support State radon pro-
gram efforts that raise awareness about the associated risks of
radon exposure. The Committee encourages expanding radon
grants to States that are seeking to adopt or strengthen certifi-
cation requirements for radon measurement and mitigation work-
ers.

Adolescent Mental Health.—The Committee supports the creation
of the Behavioral Health Coordinating Unit to coordinate and le-
verage existing CDC activities related to mental health, with a par-
ticular focus on adolescent mental health activities, including early
intervention. The Committee encourages CDC to begin to develop
a national strategy and establish goals to improve adolescent men-
tal health, including linkages between adolescent mental health
and substance use and overdose, adverse childhood experiences,
suicide, and other areas that impact mental wellbeing. This effort
is expected to include convening of key experts, in and out of gov-
ernment, with special considerations to ensure the voices of under-
served communities and populations are represented. CDC is also
encouraged to provide technical assistance, including through
grants to partner organizations, to support collaborations and con-
nections between multiple sectors in communities such as public
health, education, community mental health organizations and
other community-based organizations, youth serving organizations,
parents, and social services providers to strengthen mental health
prevention and promotion and improve mental health, well-being,
and resilience in communities.
Adverse Childhood Experiences [ACEs].—The Committee pro-
vides $9,000,000 for ACEs surveillance, research, and prevention
efforts. The Committee commends CDC’s Injury Prevention Center
for funding States and localities, including those with high rates of
trauma, violence, and overdoses, to conduct surveillance on expo-
sure to ACEs and target community-based interventions related to
exposure to childhood trauma, ACEs, substance use, and violence
and to promote positive childhood experiences.
94
Child Sexual Abuse Prevention.—The Committee includes
$3,000,000 in recognition of the severe and often life-long physical,
cognitive, and emotional impact of child sexual abuse and com-
mends CDC’s work in child sexual abuse prevention research. CDC
is encouraged to improve surveillance systems and data collection,
increase the understanding of risk and protective factors, and de-
velop and disseminate effective prevention efforts. The Committee
directs CDC to continue the work with partners to evaluate and
improve child sex abuse prevention policies within youth serving
organizations, including through working with non-profit organiza-
tions that specialize in child sexual abuse prevention. The Com-
mittee also notes the expertise of non-profit and research organiza-
tions and encourages CDC to continue collaboration with these
partners to ensure widespread adoption of guidance developed for
youth serving organizations to prevent child sexual abuse.
Community and Youth Violence Prevention.—The Committee
commends CDC for its work to prevent youth and community vio-
lence through technical assistance, research, and partnerships be-
tween community organizations, schools, law enforcement, faith-
based organizations, and academia to evaluate effective interven-
tions to reduce violence. The Committee encourages CDC to scale
up existing partnerships with organizations that have dem-
onstrated success in reducing community violence and its risk fac-
tors, including those involving healthcare and community outreach
organizations, as well as supporting academic-community collabo-
rations and research to advance the science and practice of violence
prevention, while reducing inequities from which such violence
stems.
Core State Injury Prevention Program [Core SIPP].—The Com-
mittee includes $29,950,000 for the Core SIPP to enhance efforts
to identify and respond to injury threats with data-driven public
health actions.
Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence.—The Committee provides
$38,200,000 for CDC to collect data on the connection between
brain injuries and domestic and sexual violence, and implement a
data collection project that follows up on and operates under CDC’s
National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey and asks
questions about the prevalence and circumstances surrounding
brain injuries.
Drowning Prevention.—The Committee continues $2,000,000 to
prevent fatal drownings. Drowning is a leading cause of uninten-
tional deaths among children and youth below the age of 14. This
funding will allow CDC to implement proven drowning prevention
programs with national organizations working with underserved
and diverse youth to support State drowning surveillance efforts,
as well as to develop and begin implementation of a national plan
on water safety.
Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research.—The Com-
mittee includes $12,500,000 to conduct research on firearm injury
and mortality prevention. Given violence and suicide have a num-
ber of causes, the Committee recommends CDC take a comprehen-
sive approach to studying these underlying causes and evidence-
based methods of prevention of injury, including crime prevention.
All grantees under this section will be required to fulfill require-
95
ments around open data, open code, pre-registration of research
projects, and open access to research articles consistent with the
National Science Foundation’s open science principles. The Director
of CDC is to again report to the Committees within 30 days of en-
actment of this act on implementation schedules and procedures for
grant awards, which strive to ensure that such awards support
ideologically and politically unbiased research projects.
Injury Control Research Centers.—The Committee includes
$11,000,000 for awards for multi-disciplinary research on the
causes, outcomes, and prevention of injuries and violence.
National Violent Death Reporting System.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the value of the National Violent Death Reporting System
[NVDRS], as it is the only system in the United States that cap-
tures data on circumstances surrounding violent deaths, including
suicides and homicides. Such data allow States and localities to de-
tect and monitor circumstances that commonly precede violent
death, investigate and respond to factors that increase risk for vio-
lent death, and inform opportunities for preventing premature
death. Modernizing the systems through which these data flow is
imperative to ensure the timeliness of these data and the ability
to use them to inform prevention and response activities. Addition-
ally, the Committee recognizes the value of near real-time
syndromic surveillance data collected on nonfatal violence, suicide,
and mental health-related emergency department visits, particu-
larly as CDC has demonstrated the ability to link these innovative
data with violent death and suicide mortality data. Given that
syndromic surveillance data on violence, suicide, overdose, and
mental health-related emergency department visits are obtained
through CDC’s existing National Syndromic Surveillance Program,
the Committee encourages CDC to identify ways to streamline
these two data sources—nonfatal and fatal violence-related data.
Further, the Committee encourages CDC to identify opportunities
to use existing data science analytic tools and artificial intelligence
(e.g., those available via CDC’s Enterprise Data, Analytics, and
Visualization platform) to reduce time spent by States in manually
abstracting violent death circumstance data.
Opioid Prescribing Guidelines.—The Committee applauds CDC’s
release of the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing
Opioids for Pain, which updates and replaces the 2016 CDC pre-
scribing guideline. The Committee directs CDC to continue its work
educating patients and providers, and to encourage uptake and ap-
propriate use of the Guidelines. The Committee urges CDC to con-
tinue coordination with other agencies including the VA, IHS, DoD,
and HRSA in implementation and related updates in safe pre-
scribing practices to ensure consistent, high-quality care standards
across the Federal Government.
Opioid or Other Drug Use and Overdose Prevention.—The Com-
mittee continues to encourage CDC to ensure that funding for
opioid and stimulant use and overdose prevention, as well as other
emerging substances and threats, reaches local communities to ad-
vance local understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and to
scale-up prevention and response activities. Additionally, CDC is
directed to continue expansion of case-level syndromic surveillance
data, improvements of interventions that monitor prescribing and
96
dispensing practices, better timeliness and quality of morbidity and
mortality data, as well as the enhancement of efforts with medical
examiners and coroner offices.
Opioid Overdose Prevention and Surveillance.—The Committee
notes that recent data shows a reduction in deaths from drug
overdoses, including from dangerous opioids like fentanyl. While
the data is trending in the right direction, the Committee is con-
cerned that this progress could be interrupted by the delay in the
release of funding for overdose prevention efforts, which help State
and local health departments have the capacity to prevent deaths
from overdoses. The Committee directs CDC to issue timely awards
for this program and to provide a briefing to the Committees with-
in 60 days of enactment on the Overdose Data to Action program,
including how States have used the funding to reduce overdose
deaths.
Pain Management.—The Committee acknowledges the population
health demographic data reported on chronic pain in 2023 provided
as directed in Public Law 117–103 and described in House Report
117–96. However, the Committee encourages CDC to update the
report provided to include an analysis and reporting of the direct
healthcare costs related to pain diagnostic, management and treat-
ment services for all forms of treatment including medication,
interventional procedures, medical devices, behavioral health, re-
storative treatments and complementary and integrative treat-
ments for all payer sources including public, private and out of
pocket costs as well as indirect costs related to pain including
missed work, short and long-term disability and loss of produc-
tivity.
Provider Education for Opioid Alternatives.—The Committee re-
mains concerned about the high mortality rate due to opioid
overdoses and encourages CDC to provide outreach to outpatient
surgical providers on the increased availability and wide-ranging
benefits of non-opioid pain management in both hospital outpatient
departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The Committee en-
courages CDC to work with CMS, FDA, and continuing medical
education associations on an education and outreach plan.
Rape Prevention.—The Committee includes $61,750,000 to sup-
port rape prevention and education programs. In granting funds to
States, the Secretary shall set forth procedures designed to ensure
meaningful involvement of the State or territorial sexual assault
coalitions and representatives from underserved communities in
the application for and implementation of funding.
Suicide Prevention.—The Committee remains concerned about
suicide rates in the United States and includes $30,000,000. The
Committee recognizes that suicide is a serious public health prob-
lem requiring strategic programming, especially among dispropor-
tionately impacted populations. The Committee also recognizes that
suicide prevention requires a public health approach that addresses
multiple risk factors at the individual, community, and societal lev-
els. States, tribes, and territories are well positioned to lead a com-
prehensive public health approach to suicide prevention, which in-
volves coordinating with multisector partners, to take a data-driv-
en, evidence-based process to address the broad range of risk and
protective factors associated with suicide. The Committee directs
97
CDC to prioritize funding to State public health departments with
the goal of expanding the Comprehensive Suicide Prevention pro-
gram nationwide, and to help tribes and territories build capacity
and implement strategies to prevent suicide.
Traumatic Brain Injury [TBI].—The Committee provides
$8,250,000 to initiate concussion surveillance, particularly among
children and youth. The Committee appreciates CDC’s work to bet-
ter understand the burden of concussions in the United States. The
Committee recognizes the need for standardized data collection
practices across the care continuum to capture and integrate data
on traumatic brain injury [TBI] with data collected for research
purposes to improve patient identification and outcomes. The Com-
mittee encourages CDC to coordinate across HHS, the Departments
of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Transportation to identify and
recommend key data elements and terms that should be collected
to improve the consistency of TBI health data derived from dif-
ferent sources.
Unintentional Injury on College Campuses.—The Committee re-
quests a briefing, within 120 days of enactment of this act, on the
feasibility of CDC collecting and disseminating data related to acci-
dental injuries among college students that result in serious injury
or death.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $362,800,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 363,800,000
The Committee includes $363,800,000 for the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] programs. This fund-
ing level is sufficient to maintain the programs and activities lo-
cated in Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wash-
ington, and West Virginia as well as the staff in these locations in
place on March 30, 2025. The Committee recognizes that NIOSH
is the only Federal agency responsible for conducting research and
making recommendations for the prevention of work-related illness
and injury. The NIOSH mission is implemented by conducting
basic and applied scientific research and translating the knowledge
gained into products and services that impact workers in settings
from corporate offices to construction sites to coal mines. Further,
the Committee acknowledges that NIOSH continues to protect
American workers through its work-related illness and injury re-
search and directs CDC to ensure work continues in NIOSH re-
search centers nationwide. The Committee encourages NIOSH to
continue its objectivity so as to ensure the highest professional and
ethical standards are maintained.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities at
the following amounts:

Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Program.—The Committee in-
cludes $29,000,000 for efforts to protect workers in this sector by
providing leadership in applied research, disease and injury sur-
veillance, education, and prevention.
Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program Mobile Medical
Unit.—The Committee is concerned about the prevalence of coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung, and the recent
increase in progressive massive fibrosis, the most severe stage of
black lung, among younger miners. According to NIOSH, one in 10
underground coal miners who have worked in mines for at least 25
years were identified as having black lung. Coal miners in central
Appalachia are disproportionately affected with as many as one in
five having evidence of black lung-the highest level recorded in 25
years. Early screening and detection of black lung can improve
health outcomes and reduce mortality. However, a NIOSH report
has identified several potential barriers to screening for miners-in-
cluding the ability to participate in screening. The Committee
urges NIOSH to continue working to improve access to screening
for miners using its mobile medical unit in Morgantown and across
Appalachia.
Disaster Resilience.—The Committee recognizes that extreme
weather and disasters can leave long-lasting damage in commu-
nities. These events require health professionals and public health
departments to have the resources and guidance to prepare for and
mitigate health impacts before disasters, respond during disasters,
and protect health during recovery after disasters. The Committee
expects CDC to aid in the development and implementation of lo-
cally specific plans to respond to these threats.
Education and Research Centers [ERCs].—The Committee in-
cludes $32,000,000 for ERCs in recognition of their important work
to improve workplace safety and health by translating scientific
discoveries into practice through effective education, training, and
outreach. The Committee applauds the work of NIOSH to imple-
ment innovative approaches, and its translational research. The
agency’s priorities and efforts have included work on the protection
of workers from heat hazards as well as the effects of the COVID–
19 pandemic on the workplace, including the mental and emotional
health impact on workers. The Committee encourages NIOSH to
continue its support for new and existing ERCs to support edu-
cation and training programs for graduate students, particularly in
Environmental and Industrial Hygiene, Occupational Health Nurs-
ing, Occupational Medicine Residency, and Occupational Safety
and Health Engineering.
Environmental Exposures and Cancer in First Responders.—The
Committee is aware that first responders have increased rates of
cancer diagnoses and death relative to the general population they
serve. First responders, such as firefighters, are exposed to a com-
plex mix of known and possible cancer-causing chemicals through
breathing hazardous substances and absorbing them through their
99
skin. The Committee encourages NIOSH to continue its work ex-
amining the health and safety of first responders to build upon ex-
isting scientific evidence based research to further develop and rec-
ommend best practices for complex occupational safety and health
problems such as the toxic exposures and higher cancer incidence
rates in this population.
Heat Stress and Worker Illnesses and Injuries.—The Committee
recognizes that working under high heat conditions causes symp-
toms of heat illness, including fatigue, loss of balance, nausea,
headache, loss of physical and mental capacity, heavy sweating,
muscle cramps, and other symptoms that cause or contribute to
workplace injuries and illnesses. Injuries incurred may be minor,
serious, life-threatening illnesses, or fatal and may result in long-
term injuries or permanent disabilities. The Committee urges CDC,
in collaboration with appropriate partners, to research the relation-
ship between heat stress and workplace illnesses and injuries and
to identify means for more accurate data collection, including the
recording and reporting of heat related injuries and illnesses, in
outdoor and indoor workplaces.
Mining Research.—The Committee encourages CDC to partner
with public universities to facilitate the development and imple-
mentation of research initiatives in deep mining of critical minerals
and metals, specifically targeting the enhancement of workplace
safety and health in U.S. mining operations. Collaborative and
independent research efforts should be from universities that offer
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology [ABET] ac-
credited undergraduate mining engineering programs under Min-
ing Engineering Program criteria and graduate programs in mining
and explosives engineering, with explosives engineering focused on
mining applications. These integrated programs are necessary for
conducting highly specialized technical research and implementing
effective workforce development initiatives.
National Firefighter Registry for Cancer.—The Committee in-
cludes an increase of $1,000,000 as the registry recruits and enrolls
participants.
Potential PFAS Exposure Source for Firefighters.—The Com-
mittee is committed to advancing research on occupational expo-
sure of firefighters to PFAS. NIOSH is directed to engage with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology on their ongoing
study to identify a firefighter’s relative risk of exposure to PFAS
released from their protective gear.
Total Worker Health Program.—The Committee continues fund-
ing for the Total Worker Health program, which supports and con-
ducts ground-breaking research to advance the overall safety,
health, and well-being of U.S. workers. This funding supports crit-
ical priorities, including addressing the Nation’s mental health, sui-
cide, and substance use disorder crises, in the context of work de-
sign and employment.
World Trade Center Health Program [WTCHP].—The Committee
notes the importance of adequate staffing at NIOSH for purposes
of fulfilling statutory obligations under the WTCHP. The Com-
mittee anticipates a timely review of the monthly staffing reports
as directed through the Office of the Secretary. The Committee rec-
ognizes that thousands of eligible members of WTCHP reside out-
100
side the New York metropolitan area, including Florida, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. In consideration of migration
trends, and with a greater need to provide clinical services, in par-
ticular monitoring and treatment of WTCHP-certified conditions
and improve access to research within regions where eligible mem-
bers live, the Committee encourages CDC to include an assessment
in the fiscal year 2027 congressional justification on the value and
impact on sustainability of the program in establishing an addi-
tional Clinical Center of Excellence outside the New York metro-
politan area.
ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL INJURY COMPENSATION ACT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $55,358,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,358,000
The Committee includes $55,358,000 for the Energy Employees
Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA] (Pub-
lic Law 106–398). This mandatory funding supports NIOSH sci-
entists who reconstruct radiation dose levels to inform compensa-
tion decisions.
Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program
Act [EEOICPA] Implementation.—The mandatory funding provided
by Public Law 106–398 supports NIOSH scientists who reconstruct
radiation dose levels to inform compensation decision. The Com-
mittee encourages CDC to continue supporting the professional de-
velopment of health physics professionals, who are integral to dose
reconstruction and special exposure cohort determinations within
the program.
GLOBAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $692,843,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 692,843,000
The Committee provides $692,843,000 for global health-related
activities at CDC.
CDC’s global efforts promote health security and prevent disease
in the United States and abroad through rapid detection and re-
sponse to emerging and re-emerging health threats.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities in
the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on
Global HIV/AIDS Program ................................................................................................................................. $128,921,000
Global Tuberculosis.......................................................................................................................................... 11,722,000

Parasitic Diseases and Malaria....................................................................................................................... 29,000,000
Global Public Health Protection....................................................................................................................... 293,200,000
Global Health Protection.—The Committee includes $293,200,000
and recognizes CDC’s unique role in supporting public health ca-
pacity development through scientific and technical leadership both
domestically and globally, by working closely with United States
government agencies, ministries of health, and other partners to
101
ensure that disease threats anywhere are prevented, detected early
and responded to robustly through a coordinated, multisectoral ap-
proach. The Committee recognizes that accurate and swift
diagnostics are crucial for the early detection and containment of
infectious diseases of pandemic potential. The Committee encour-
ages CDC’s Global Health Center in collaboration with the Na-
tional Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases to
prioritize the development of diagnostics for pathogens of pandemic
potential and encourages CDC to work with Federal and other
partners to strengthen capacity and infrastructure of countries to
support adoption and access to diagnostics. The Committee notes
that CDC’s global health research efforts are critical to U.S. bilat-
eral and multilateral global health and global health security pro-
grams that protect Americans and the rest of the world. CDC is a
global leader in infectious disease detection, preparedness, and re-
sponse, including the development and validation of tools and strat-
egies to prevent and mitigate the spread of disease.
Global HIV/AIDS Program.—The Committee recognizes that
since the inception of President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
[PEPFAR], CDC has served as an implementing partner, providing
technical expertise and program oversight. The Committee directs
CDC to coordinate with the State Department’s Bureau of Global
Health Security and Diplomacy to continue this essential role as an
implementing partner to ensure program oversight and account-
ability.
Malaria and Parasitic Diseases.—The Committee provides
$29,000,000, recognizing the important role CDC plays in the fight
against malaria and parasitic disease, particularly providing para-
sitic lab capabilities for the United States. Parasitic diseases cause
devastating health and economic effects for hundreds of millions of
people around the world and in the United States. CDC provides
life-saving services and expertise in research, diagnosis, treatment,
surveillance, consultation, and education of parasitic diseases to
States and countries, U.S. government agencies, and other public
health partners. The Committee encourages further support for
these activities so CDC can enhance its parasitic diseases labora-
tory, close the gap on parasitic disease-related health inequity in
the United States, and advance global control and elimination of
malaria and targeted neglected tropical diseases.
Polio Eradication.—The Committee includes $180,000,000 to sup-
port CDC activities related to wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived
polio surveillance, vaccine procurement, and outbreak response.
CDC is urged to continue to provide technical assistance to coun-
tries for polio immunization campaigns, conduct environmental
surveillance of polio viruses to ensure prompt detection and to pre-
vent potential outbreaks of paralytic polio disease.
Soil Transmitted Helminth and Other Parasites of Domestic Con-
cern.—The Committee is pleased with the success of the currently
funded CDC projects in educating healthcare providers and the
public in at-risk communities and establishing specimen collection
and diagnostic protocols to address soil transmitted helminth. The
Committee includes funding for the surveillance, testing and edu-
cation efforts of the currently funded projects to address other
parasites of domestic concern which may be present in these areas.
102
Projects should consider the prevalence of Chagas,
angiostrongyliasis and toxoplasmosis, among others to investigate
their presence in these regions.
Violence Against Children and Youth Surveys.—The Committee
requests a briefing, not later than 90 days after enactment of this
act, on the implementation and delivery of the Violence Against
Children and Youth Surveys [VACS] in active countries that have
completed the survey implementation in the corresponding fiscal
year and are engaged in the data to action process, including moni-
toring and evaluation. The Committee requests the briefing include
the implementing countries’ efforts to prevent and respond to vio-
lence against children; technical support provided by the United
States government, and research, global thought leadership, and
innovative efforts to respond to the findings of VACS reports.
PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $938,200,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 933,200,000
The Committee provides $933,200,000 for CDC’s Preparedness
and Response activities.
CDC’s preparedness and response mission is to build and
strengthen national preparedness for public health emergencies in-
cluding natural, biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear inci-
dents. This funding supports national response programs, as well
as grants to States and localities to enhance preparedness efforts
across the country.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities in
the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on

Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics [CFA] and Ready
Response Enterprise Data Integration [RREDI] Platform.—The
Committee provides $50,000,000 for CFA and RREDI to facilitate
the use of data, modeling, and analytics to improve preparedness
and response. The Committee is aware of the unprecedented chal-
lenge recent public health emergencies, such as measles, MPox,
RSV, influenza, and COVID–19, pose to Federal, State, and local
governments’ ability to collect and share data in a meaningful way
to ensure informed policy and operational decisionmaking. The
Committee recognizes the investment the U.S. government has
made into these programs and includes funding for CDC to main-
tain this capability to ensure preparedness for future public health
emergencies. The Committee urges CDC to continue to work with
schools of public health and other academic institutions to engage
the Nation’s expertise in disease modeling, public health data anal-
ysis, research, and training to build workforce capacity in this
emerging field. As an interagency resource for early warnings re-
lated to emerging infectious disease threats, the Center will sup-
103
port the public health system in detecting, responding to, and even-
tually preventing future epidemics and outbreaks.
Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agree-
ments.—The Committee includes $735,000,000 to support State and
local health departments to quickly detect, monitor, and respond to
health threats. Public health system investments serve as the
backbone for disaster and outbreak response in every State and the
pandemic has shown that increased funding for preparedness is
necessary for a baseline of consistent protection. The Committee
continues to request a State distribution table in the fiscal year
2027 CJ, which should also include information about how funding
is being allocated to local health departments and how States are
determining these allocations.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $40,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,000,000
The Committee provides $40,000,000 for Buildings and Facilities.
CDC-Owned Buildings and Facilities.—The Committee continues
funding to make progress on reducing CDC’s backlog of mainte-
nance and repairs at its campuses nationwide, including its Atlanta
headquarters. The Committee acknowledges that in order to pro-
tect Americans from health threats and to rapidly respond to public
health emergencies, CDC needs a safe, secure, and fully oper-
ational infrastructure in the form of its own laboratories, buildings,
and facilities. COVID–19 and other recent public health emer-
gencies have required urgent action and demonstrated that CDC
laboratories and facilities need to be ready to respond quickly and
comprehensively. The Committee supports the completion of the
CDC Masterplan Build Out, including continued progress with the
Atlanta Masterplan Build Out.
Mine Safety Research Facility.—The Committee requests the con-
tinuation of quarterly updates on progress in the construction of
the new mine safety research facility and laboratory, costs in-
curred, and unanticipated challenges which may affect timeline or
total costs, and any other pertinent developments until the comple-
tion of the facility.
CDC-WIDE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM SUPPORT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $663,570,000

Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices [ACIP] Report.—
The Committee includes $1,000,000 and directs CDC to enter into
a contract with the National Academies of Science, Engineering,
and Medicine [NASEM] to develop a framework that delineates the
considerations that should be taken into account when considering
prospective voting members of ACIP, as well as recommendations
to strengthen the ACIP appointment process. The framework
should also address best practices for ensuring transparency, inde-
pendence, and integrity in the appointment process. NASEM
should also include specific criteria in the framework for maintain-
ing a balanced range of expertise across ACIP, and propose any
necessary revisions to the conflict of interest policy for ACIP and
its working groups.
CDC Technical Expertise.—The Committee recognizes CDC’s
unique public health expertise, which allows the agency to provide
technical assistance, data, and research to States, communities,
and international partners. The Committee encourages CDC to con-
tinue efforts that support strengthening public health across its
wide range of programs including preventing and responding to in-
fectious diseases, injury prevention and control, and addressing
chronic illnesses. As such, section 238 requires the Secretary to
submit a detailed plan and justification to the Committees on Ap-
propriations prior to initiating a reorganization or transfer of func-
tions carried out by CDC. Additionally, the Committee notes the
number of political appointees at CDC has increased significantly
and further notes the importance of maintaining staff with the
technical expertise to support the agency’s mission to protect the
health, safety, and security of the American people.
Monthly Briefings.—The Committee directs CDC to provide
monthly briefings to the Committees on Appropriations regarding
activities funded by this act and other available appropriations.
Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund [IDRRRF].—
The Committee includes $5,000,000 for the IDRRRF. The IDRRRF
provides an immediate source of funding to ensure that funds are
available when an emerging infectious disease crisis is detected.
Funds are available until expended.
Local Public Health Departments.—The Committee notes that
Federal funding intended for both State and local health depart-
ments does not consistently reach local health departments beyond
those directly-funded. The Committee encourages CDC to require
States to fund local health departments when programmatically
appropriate.
Obligations.—For CDC-Wide activities and for activities within
every Center, unless advanced notice is provided in writing to the
Committees on Appropriations, funds must be obligated for con-
tinuation awards and new award cycles that continue previous ac-
105
tivities under existing NOFOs on the last day prior to the expira-
tion of the period of performance from fiscal year 2024.
Office of Rural Health [ORH].—The Committee provides
$5,000,000 to continue ORH. The Committee is encouraged by ef-
forts from the agency to establish the CDC ORH. The Committee
directs the agency to ensure that the established ORH will guide
CDC’s rural health leadership across the entire agency. This in-
cludes by developing purposeful public health guidance for rural
health departments, analyzing and developing initiatives to expand
the rural public health workforce, establishing a formal partner-
ship with the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy under HRSA,
and otherwise serving as a resource and technical assistance hub
for public health in rural communities.
Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity.—The Committee in-
cludes $350,000,000 in public health funding that is not segmented
by disease, condition, activity. Rather, it is provided for cross-cut-
ting, core public health infrastructure needs, including but not lim-
ited to workforce, health information and data systems, public
health policy and communications, financial management, commu-
nity partnership development, and organizational capacity. By pro-
viding maximum flexibility, this funding will allow public health
agencies to determine and address their greatest needs and build
core capabilities that will strengthen and support new and existing
programmatic functions. The Committee again directs that no less
than 70 percent of this funding be awarded to health departments.
The Committee encourages CDC to strengthen infrastructure in
local health departments by continuing to directly award funds to
local health departments, and by urging State health department
recipients to allocate resources to local health departments. The
Committee urges CDC to publicly track and report to the Com-
mittee how funds provided to State health departments are passed
through to local health departments.
Public Health Leadership and Support.—The Committee includes
$116,570,000 to support CDC’s foundational public health activities
and to facilitate partnerships. The Committee commends CDC for
its commitment to the development of a diverse healthcare and
public health workforce. Within this total, the Committee includes
$6,500,000 to expand the John R. Lewis CDC Undergraduate Pub-
lic Health Scholars Program, including the opportunity for more
HBCUs to participate, as well as Tribal Colleges and Universities.
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
The Committee provides $47,062,518,000 in base discretionary
resources for the National Institutes of Health [NIH], an increase
of $301,000,000. Additionally, the Committee provides
$226,000,000 in budget authority authorized in the 21st Century
Cures Act (Public Law 114–255), an increase of $99,000,000. Per
the Cures Act, $97,500,000 is transferred to the National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS] and $97,500,000 to
the National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH] for the BRAIN Ini-
tiative; and $31,000,000 to the Office of the Director [OD] for the
All of Us precision medicine initiative. In addition, the Committee
also includes $1,412,482,000 in transfers available under section
106
241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended), for a total
program level for NIH of $48,701,000,000.
As in previous years, the Committee has targeted NIH funding
in areas of promise of scientific advancement and urgency, while
allowing NIH to maintain flexibility to pursue unplanned scientific
opportunities and address unforeseen public health needs. The
Committee increases support for cancer research by $150,000,000,
provides an increase of $100,000,000 for Alzheimer’s Disease/Alz-
heimer’s Disease-Related Dementias [AD/ADRD] research, provides
an increase of $25,000,000 for expanded access grants authorized
by the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act (Pub-
lic Law 117–79), increases support for Antiviral Drug Discovery
Centers [AViDDs] by $20,000,000, increases support for the BRAIN
Initiative by $12,000,000, increases support for Lyme disease re-
search by $10,000,000, increases support for diabetes research by
$10,000,000, provides a $10,000,000 increase for rare disease re-
search, increases support for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network
[UDN] by $9,000,000, and provides $5,000,000 for implementation
of the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton Na-
tional Plan to End Parkinson’s Act (Public Law 118–66). The bill
also includes an increase of $20,000,000 for the Implementing a
Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone [IM-
PROVE Initiative] to combat recent alarming rates of maternal
mortality, and an increase of $30,000,000 for the Office of Research
on Women’s Health [ORWH], of which $10,000,000 is provided for
the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health
[BIRCWH] program. Finally, the bill provides $1,500,000,000 for
the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health [ARPA–H].
The Committee directs NIH to include updates on the following
research, projects, and programs in the fiscal year 2027 Congres-
sional Justification [CJ]: Alzheimer’s Disease/Alzheimer’s Disease-
Related Dementias [AD/ADRD] research; Childhood Post-Infectious
Neuroimmune Disorders/PANS/PANDAS; Common Fund projects;
future goals for each of the deadliest cancers-brain, liver (including
cholangiocarcinoma), lung, ovary, pancreas, and stomach and
esophageal cancers; efforts to determine a uniform definition of se-
vere maternal morbidity; efforts to expand research and represen-
tation opportunities for Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine; efforts to
invest in food is medicine research; Made in America research

NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,224,159,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,374,159,000
The Committee recommendation includes $7,374,159,000, an in-
crease of $150,000,000, for the National Cancer Institute [NCI]. Of
this amount, $30,000,000 is available for repairs and improvements
to the NCI facility in Frederick, Maryland.
Advancing Cancer Immunotherapy.—The Committee encourages
NIH to continue to support research to advance double-loaded den-
dritic cell immunotherapy.
Biliary Tract Cancers.—The Committee stongly encourages NIH
to support research to develop novel treatment strategies in biliary
tract cancers, and for basic and translational research as well as
clinical trials in liver cancers, as both are needed to improve state-
of-the-art cancer immunotherapy. The Committee strongly supports
research on novel cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. Targeting
recurrent cancer neoantigens in BTC with novel cancer treatment
vaccine in combination with other drugs that work on the human
immune system could move the treatment paradigm in BTC for-
ward and enable combinatorial immunotherapy trials, including
adoptive cell therapies for future combinatorial immunotherapy
trials, including adoptive cell therapies, in this lethal disease.
Cancer Care Support for Rural Communities.—Rural areas with
limited access to healthcare services often have a high prevalence
of chronic disease and other factors that contribute to increased
levels of cancer mortality. These areas also typically have low
health literacy, poor cancer screening rates and a dearth of spe-
cialty services. The Committee encourages NCI to work with rel-
evant stakeholders, such as academic medical centers, rural hos-
pitals, clinics, and other community partners to determine how best
to direct evidence-based outreach to areas most impacted by cancer
mortality.
Cancer Immunotherapy and Artificial Intelligence [AI].—The
Committee recognizes that targeting a tumor’s immune micro-
environment represents an exciting new approach to preventing the
tumor from growing and spreading, especially for the class of treat-
ments known as immunotherapies. Recent technological advances
in AI, imaging and pathology offer encouraging options for accel-
erating research into how to target a patient’s immune system
against the tumor, but much more work in this area is needed.
Therefore, the Committee encourages NCI to prioritize research on
novel technologies that can help investigators better understand
complex interactions between tumors and the immune system.
Childhood Cancer Data Initiative [CCDI].—The Committee in-
cludes no less than $50,000,000 for the CCDI, including to support
continued enhancement of the CCDI Molecular Characterization
Initiative.
Childhood Cancer STAR Act.—The Committee includes
$28,000,000, for continued implementation of the Childhood Cancer
Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research [STAR] Act (Public
Law 115–180 and 117–350) to support existing biorepositories for
108
childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical trials
to collect and maintain relevant clinical, biological, and demo-
graphic information on all children, adolescents, and young adults
with cancer. The Committee has included funding to carry out
childhood cancer survivorship research and programs as authorized
in the STAR Act, such as supporting research to inform best prac-
tices for the treatment of late effects of childhood cancers, research
to improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better
able to care for this population as they age, and research to inform
innovative models of care for childhood cancer survivors.
Deadliest Cancers.—The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act
[RCRA] of 2012 (Public Law 112–239) focuses on cancers with a 5-
year survival rate below 50 percent, which account for over 40 per-
cent of all U.S. cancer deaths. While advances in some cancers
have made it possible to reduce the overall rate of cancer deaths
over the last several decades, there has been limited progress re-
ducing mortality for these diseases. In fiscal year 2020 (Public Law
116–94), Congress directed NCI to develop a scientific framework
using the process outlined in the RCRA for stomach and esopha-
geal cancers. The Committee commends NCI for developing the
framework and notes that NCI has also launched a Program in
Origins of Gastroesophageal Cancers. Given the devastating toll of
all recalcitrant cancers and the lack of diagnostic and treatment re-
sources currently available, the Committee, alongside the research
and advocacy communities, encourages a continued focus on these
cancers and requests an update on research on each of the dead-
liest cancers-brain, liver (including cholangiocarcinoma), lung,
ovary, pancreas, and stomach and esophageal cancers in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ. Further, given the high mortality rates for these
cancers, the Committee is particularly concerned about reports of
increased incidence of esophageal, liver, pancreas, and stomach
cancer among the adolescent and young adult population and di-
rects NCI to develop a plan with specific actions to understand the
causes and risk factors that are leading to these increases as well
as potential interventions.
HPV Screening, Syphilis Screening, and Self-Collection.—The
Committee recognizes the impact and potential of the Last Mile
Initiative and applauds innovative efforts, such as the emerging
network to study noninvasive self-collection and self-diagnostic op-
portunities for HPV testing. The Committee notes similar opportu-
nities in syphilis and general opportunities to better adopt point-
of-care self-diagnostics in precision medicine and connected
healthcare. NCI is encouraged to continue working with a variety
of stakeholders and to continue studying various approaches to sus-
tain scientific progress.
Improving Native American Cancer Outcomes.—The Committee
urges NCI to continue to coordinate with the National Institute on
Minority Health and Health Disparities [NIMHD] on the Initiative
for Improving Native American Cancer outcomes to support efforts,
including research, education, outreach, and clinical access related
to cancer in Native American populations.
Kidney Cancer.—Kidney cancer is an insidious disease that most
often has no signs or symptoms in early stages. It has not been re-
sponsive to ‘‘traditional’’ cancer interventions such as chemo-
109
therapy and radiation, and the biology has historically been poorly
understood. As a result, it is often the case that once diagnosed,
metastatic disease is present, leading to the low 5-year survival
rate of 18 percent. The Committee encourages NCI to establish a
multi-institute working group that meets annually and incor-
porates involvement from NIDDK, NIBIB, NCATS, and other ap-
propriate Institutes and Centers. This working group should de-
velop a multi-year strategy for improving early detection and sig-
nificantly lowering the mortality rate for kidney cancer patients.
Liver Cancer.—The Committee applauds NCI for seeking input
on how best to address the need to prioritize early detection,
screening, and prevention sciences for primary liver cancer. Pri-
mary liver cancer has a dismal 5-year survival rate of only 22 per-
cent, is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United
States, and unlike most cancers the rate of liver cancer mortality
continues to increase. Action to improve early detection and reduce
liver cancer mortality is urgently needed, as mortality rates have
not meaningfully improved in over a decade. The Committee urges
NCI to continue expanding the use of Program Projects, Coopera-
tive Research and Broad Agency Announcements, and other con-
tract mechanisms to achieve the goals of strategic plans.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer Research.—The Committee recognizes
that metastatic prostate cancer remains highly lethal, with limited
treatment options following relapse. Despite urgent need for inno-
vative therapies, access to investigational treatments, including
early phase clinical trials, remains a significant challenge, given
the advanced age of many patients, multiple comorbidities, and mo-
bility limitations. The Committee urges NCI to prioritize funding
for research that expands access to early phase clinical trials for
metastatic prostate cancer, particularly in community-based set-
tings, to ensure that patients—especially those at the highest risk
of mortality—have the opportunity to benefit from novel thera-
peutic developments.
Natural Products Research.—Research shows that derivatives
from natural products have been an important source of clinically
useful anti-cancer agents, yet not enough evidence-based research
has been done to strategically identify those compounds that could
provide potential benefits in cancer treatment. The Committee en-
courages NCI to continue to support research into whether and
how natural products could be beneficial to cancer patients in re-
ducing the toxicity of therapy or by enhancing therapeutic efficacy
as a primary or adjunctive therapy. The Committee encourages
NCI to continue to fund research to evaluate the potential value of
natural products in reducing adverse effects of cancer therapy and
in enhancing therapeutic efficacy through basic, translational and
clinical trials research. NCI is encouraged to seek applicants that
have a demonstrated expertise in natural products research, are
capable of conducting a holistic review of drugs and disease states
utilizing NCI’s annotated inventory of natural products, and that
are able to test the safety and efficacy of natural products in com-
munities experiencing high rates of healthcare disparities in access
to cancer care.
Neuroblastoma.—The Committee commends NCI for its support
of neuroblastoma research and recognizes the many complex chal-
110
lenges presented by this deadly pediatric cancer. The Committee
encourages NCI to continue investments in this area and requests
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts to improve outcomes
for CNS relapse patients.
Optimal Timing and Sequencing of Cancer Immunotherapy.—The
Committee recognizes that cancer immunotherapy is improving
outcomes for an increasing number of cancer patients, especially
those for whom other treatments were ineffective. New research
suggests that more patients might benefit if immunotherapy were
used earlier in the course of their cancer, or to prevent and inter-
cept cancers before they start. The Committee urges NCI to con-
tinue to support research focused on assessing the optimal timing
for the use of cancer immunotherapy in individual patients. Exam-
ples of such research include studying the effectiveness of cancer
immunotherapy in premalignant conditions, early-stage cancer, and
as a neoadjuvant therapy, prior to additional treatment such as
surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.
Pancreatic Cancer.—Pancreatic cancer will be second only to lung
cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States before 2030. Despite decades of effort, survival remains the
lowest of all the major cancers and is particularly dismal for Black
Americans. It is critical that NCI continue its efforts to support
early detection and clinical research that focuses on pancreatic can-
cer. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of early de-
tection approaches for pancreatic cancer, and the need to ensure di-
verse enrollment in cancer clinical trials, including pancreatic can-
cer trials. The Committee urges the NCI to convene stakeholders—
including scientists, clinicians, and diverse patient representa-
tives—to strategically reconsider current approaches and redesign
both an effective early detection platform and a diversity plan for
clinical trials that will benefit all pancreatic cancer patients and
provide a global model for effective change in the trajectory of a
deadly cancer. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year
2027 CJ regarding progress in early detection research and ongoing
efforts to leverage NCI’s clinical trials networks to advance
progress for all people experiencing a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.
Patient Access to Clinical Trials.—The Committee recognizes that
local healthcare provider and patient access to clinical trials is crit-
ical for improving equitable access to research and novel therapies;
diversifying the population participating in research; ensuring the
safety and efficacy of new drugs; and accelerating the dissemina-
tion and implementation of findings and the adoption of newly ap-
proved therapies. However, access to trials remains out of reach for
many patients and local oncology providers, particularly those in
rural areas and/or at practice sites and hospitals without dedicated
research resources and infrastructure. Leveraging technology can
improve efficiencies of trial start-up, administration, and commu-
nications. A virtual research team who provides centralized re-
search expertise and resources can ultimately support local pro-
vider participation in clinical trials by alleviating the need for spe-
cialized personnel onsite. The NCI’s recently launched Virtual Clin-
ical Trials Office pilot study provides virtual research personnel to
NCI-funded trials conducted at participating NCI-designated can-
cer centers and NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites.
111
The Committee encourages the use of telehealth and expansion of
the clinical trial-related remote services provided by this office. The
Committee requests an update on the Virtual Clinical Trials Office
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ, including demonstrating if there were
increases in local provider and/or patient participation in clinical
trials, especially from rural areas, and challenges and successes in
prescreening/screening of potential trial candidates, obtaining in-
formed consents, data abstraction, building protocol-specific treat-
ment plans, and maintaining a repository for quick adoption into
the local sites.
Pediatric Rare Cancer Therapeutic Development.—Recognizing
that effective treatments for many types of childhood cancer do not
exist yet, the Committee encourages NIH to continue to examine
novel systems for identifying how rare cancers develop and
progress, and to continue supporting and accelerating the develop-
ment and evaluation of life-saving therapeutics for pediatric cancer
patients.
Rural NCI Designation.—The Committee encourages NCI to re-
view its criteria for awarding Cancer Center Support Grants
[CCSGs] to include considerations for Cancer Centers that are pri-
marily providing care to rural patients, conducting cancer research
with rural populations, or otherwise are focused on cancer in rural
America. While recognizing the role that Cancer Centers play in
providing patient care, the Committee also commends the vital
work underway at community cancer clinics across the country and
NCI’s efforts to support them, including through the NCI Commu-
nity Oncology Research Program [NCORP] and the recently created
Working Group in Support of Efforts to Enhance Community Can-
cer Research and Quality Care. The Committee requests an update
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on NCI’s efforts related to promoting
cancer research among rural populations.
Skin Cancer Screening Evidence Gaps.—The Committee urges
NIH to continue to support research in the areas outlined in the
Research Needs and Gaps Section from the U.S. Preventive Serv-
ices Task Force [USPSTF] 2023 Skin Cancer Screening Rec-
ommendation Statement. This will ensure that the Task Force has
the necessary evidence to create the strongest evidence-based rec-
ommendations and further reduce skin cancer morbidity and mor-
tality, especially among those with the greatest burden of disease.
The Committee encourages that these efforts should continue to
prioritize the inclusion of all racial and ethnic groups to investigate
whether the effectiveness of screening, diagnosis, and treatment
vary by group. The Committee requests an update on this effort in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ. The Task Force’s 2023 Skin Cancer Rec-
ommendation Statement identifies several critical research gaps
that restrict the Task Force from making evidence-based rec-
ommendations that address multiple important areas. For example,
the Task Force notes that research is needed to better understand:
the effects of screening on morbidity and mortality or early detec-
tion of skin cancer, particularly melanoma; skin cancer presen-
tations in a variety of skin tones; morbidity and mortality outcomes
reflective of the U.S. population; the effectiveness of screening in
a range of primary care settings that reflect the variation in access
to care in the United States; the effectiveness of screening for re-
112
ducing morbidity and mortality of acral lentiginous melanoma; and
effective risk assessment tools to identify high risk individuals who
would benefit from skin cancer screening. Melanoma is a unique
and major threat to our military community as it was one of the
most frequent diagnoses among male service members and the sec-
ond most frequent cancer diagnosis among female service members
in a 10-year surveillance period. The overall incidence rate of mela-
noma in active-duty military personnel between 2000 and 2007 was
62 percent greater than among the general populace during the
same period. Disparities are also prevalent among rural popu-
lations who lack access to healthcare providers, which often results
in delayed and late-stage diagnoses compared to patients residing
in urban settings.
Theranostics.—Theranostics is a nuclear medicine technique that
combines diagnostic imaging and targeted radiopharmaceutical
therapies to precisely identify and treat diseases like cancer. This
cutting-edge technology uses diagnostic imaging to identify and tar-
get cancer cells; if such cells are present, radiopharmaceutical
therapies are injected intravenously and bind to the targeted can-
cer cells to deliver localized doses of radiation to the tumor.
Theranostics are an innovative, precision medicine technique that
allows for personalized treatment of cancers—such as thyroid can-
cer, prostate cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors—while sparing
healthy tissue around the tumor. Theranostics show huge potential
to advance the battle against cancer; a disease that remains a for-
midable challenge in medicine and has claimed a significant num-
ber of lives nationwide. The Committee encourages NCI to support
research that utilizes and promotes theranostics, where appro-
priate, to provide early, accurate, and effective cancer diagnosis
and treatment.
NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,982,345,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,982,345,000
The Committee recommendation includes $3,982,345,000 for the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI].
Cardiomyopathy Research.—The Committee encourages NHLBI
to support cardiomyopathy research including research regarding
the causation of cardiomyopathy, including genetic causes and mo-
lecular biomarkers, long-term health outcomes in individuals with
cardiomyopathy, including infants, children, teenagers, adults, and
elderly individuals, and facilitate studies using longitudinal data
and retrospective analysis to identify effective treatments and out-
comes for individuals with cardiomyopathy.
Cardiovascular Disease [CVD].—The Committee continues to rec-
ognize that CVD, including heart disease, stroke, and hypertension,
is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide.
The Committee provides robust funding to NHLBI to continue to
address these issues, and to prioritize funding opportunities that
reduce CVD among the hardest-hit geographic areas, such as the
Southern United States.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD].—Among chronic
diseases in the United States in 2022, COPD is the 6th leading
cause of death. Over 16 million Americans have been diagnosed
113
with COPD and it is estimated that a similar number are
undiagnosed and not receiving appropriate treatment. NIH reports
that COPD research funding ranked 182nd in 2023. There is an ur-
gent need for innovative treatments that can effectively slow the
progression and mitigate the lung tissue damage caused by COPD.
Most COPD research and therapy development has focused on later
stages of disease when substantial loss of lung function and dam-
age to lung tissue have already occurred, does not address the un-
derlying causes, and has little opportunity to impact disease pro-
gression. Additionally, there is a need for greater acceptance of
clinical outcome measures that assess what really matters most to
COPD patients in order to support development of more effective
therapies. While NHLBI supports basic and translational research
in COPD, there is currently limited funding provided for observa-
tional and treatment clinical trials, including drug repurposing
studies, that can advance new outcome measures and identify dis-
ease targets for earlier treatment. The Committee encourages
NHLBI to increase support for these research areas and to collabo-
rate with the FDA on patient-centered, novel clinical outcome
measures that support COPD therapy development.
Congenital Heart Disease [CHD].—The Committee commends
NHLBI for its continued work to better understand causation, im-
prove treatments and outcomes, support the growth of the clinical
and research workforce, and integrate registry data and research
datasets to facilitate research on congenital heart disease across
the lifespan, including through the Pediatric Heart Network and
the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium. The Committee en-
courages NHLBI to prioritize CHD activities outlined in its stra-
tegic plan, including improving understanding of outcomes and co-
morbidities, improving treatment options across the lifespan, and
accelerating discovery, analysis, and translation by leveraging CHD
registries and networks. The Committee requests NHLBI include
in its fiscal year 2027 CJ a report on steps being taken to close
these research gaps.
COVID–19 Associated Illnesses.—The Committee recognizes the
growing burden of COVID–19 associated critical illnesses and re-
covery, especially in adults with acute respiratory distress syn-
drome [ARDS], pneumonia, and/or sepsis. The Committee encour-
ages NHLBI, in partnership with the National Institute of General
Medical Sciences, to explore facilitating research support through
ancillary studies enabled by the ARDS, Pneumonia, and Sepsis
Phenotyping [APS] Consortium.
Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—In light of improve-
ments in care leading to patients living into their third decade, the
leading cause of death in DMD patients is heart failure. The Com-
mittee encourages NHLBI to support research that characterizes
fibro-fatty replacement of cardiomyocytes in DMD/BMD. The Com-
mittee encourages NHLBI to explore convening a workshop with
research, clinical, and patient organization leaders to work towards
establishing viable cardiac outcome measures for the development
of therapeutic agents to delay or treat heart disease in individuals
diagnosed with Duchenne. There is growing evidence to support
that select individuals with DMD/BMD would benefit from ventric-
ular assist device placement or heart transplant. The Committee
114
encourages NHLBI to support research to further develop criteria
for identifying patients who may benefit from such strategies.
Lung Health Disparities.—The Committee is concerned about the
disproportionate impact of lung conditions, such as asthma, COPD,
and lung cancer on populations experiencing health disparities, and
encourages NHLBI to work with NIMHD to advance research in
this area. The Committee requests an update from both NHLBI
and NIMHD in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Lung Health Research.—Chronic lung diseases are among the
leading causes of death and chronic illness in the United States in-
cluding the over 15 million Americans diagnosed with chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease [COPD] and related lung diseases.
Most chronic lung disease research to date has focused on later
stages of disease when substantial loss of lung function and dam-
age to lung tissue have already occurred. There is a need for treat-
ments that when applied early in the course of disease can more
effectively slow the progression and mitigate the lung tissue dam-
age caused by chronic lung diseases. NHLBI supports a wide array
of basic and translational research in these conditions. Increased
research is needed to improve our understanding of early disease
to identify appropriate targets to modulate disease progression be-
fore the irreversible tissue damage has occurred. NHLBI-funded
studies such as the COPDGene, SPIROMICS and LungMAP are
critical to this objective and have already provided significant in-
sight to begin to understand the biology of early disease. The Com-
mittee encourages NHLBI to increase support for these and other
early disease research in chronic lung disease.
National Center on Sleep Disorders Research [NCSDR].—The
Committee recognizes NCSDR for facilitating and coordinating ef-
fective sleep health and sleep disorders research across NIH and
HHS. The Committee notes that recent scientific progress along
with improvements in care and therapy are often not reaching the
individuals that could most often benefit from them as time to di-
agnosis for many conditions is measured in years if not decades.
NCSDR is encouraged to work with stakeholders across HHS to
better translate research finding, raise awareness of breakthroughs
and opportunities, and support public health efforts to link patients
to care.
National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases.—The Committee is
pleased with the continued progress of the National Commission on
Lymphatic Diseases. The Committee continues to encourage en-
gagement with relevant stakeholders and other Institutes and Cen-
ters on key priorities and topic areas of need as the Commission
finalizes its comprehensive report on the state of Lymphatic Dis-
eases.
Pulmonary Fibrosis [PF].—The Committee applauds NHLBI for
its growing commitment to groundbreaking research into PF, a
family of chronic diseases affecting more than 250,000 Americans
and taking the lives of roughly 40,000 annually. Yet there remains
no cure and life expectancy is only 3–4 years for many patients.
The Committee encourages NHLBI to sharpen its focus on identi-
fying new paths to improved treatments and creating innovative
ways to support early career investigators so that the pipeline for
PF research will continue to strengthen, thereby providing renewed
115
hope to patients and families facing these serious diseases. The
Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Rare Blood Disorders.—The Committee recognizes NHLBI for its
leadership of the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources, and ap-
preciates efforts to advance science in the rare blood disorders port-
folio. NHLBI is encouraged to sustain progress in this area and to
engage in emerging opportunities for community and cross-agency
collaboration with CDC and HRSA to coordinate research and fur-
ther improve care in immune thrombocytopenia [ITP], hemophelia,
sickle cell disease, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [wAIHA],
and other acquired and inherited blood disorders.
RECOVER Initiative.—The Committee notes with concern that
the multi-organ syndrome known as Long COVID has emerged as
a serious health condition that can cause socioeconomic burdens,
and long-term pulmonary complications represent an important
component of Long COVID. The Committee urges NHLBI, in its co-
leading of the RECOVER Initiative, to continue to prioritize re-
search into the understanding, treatment and prevention of post-
COVID respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in adults and
children, particularly among populations disproportionately im-
pacted by COVID–19.
Wildland Fire Smoke.—The Committee recognizes that exposure
to smoke from wildfires is an occurrence that is impacting more
Americans. The Committee is concerned that public health experts
do not yet fully understand the risk posed by exposure to wildland
fire smoke-particularly acute and chronic smoke exposure to pa-
tients with existing pulmonary and cardiac disease. The Committee
encourages NHLBI to support research to understand the risk
smoke exposure has for patients with underlying health conditions
and any interventions that can be implemented to mitigate adverse
health effects.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $520,163,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 520,163,000
The Committee recommendation includes $520,163,000 for the
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [NIDCR].
NIDCR is the largest institution in the world exclusively dedicated
to researching ways to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial health
for all. It has funded research leading to improvements in oral
health for millions of Americans with investments in pain biology
and management, reducing opioid use, temporomandibular dis-
orders, regenerative medicine, and in developing early diagnostics
and treatments for oral and pharyngeal cancers.
Advancing Head and Neck Cancer Early Detection Research
[AHEAD].—The Committee commends NIDCR for establishing
AHEAD to accelerate translational and clinical research on the
early detection of head and neck cancers [HNC]. The initiative
aims to increase scientific knowledge of the molecular characteris-
tics of dysplastic tissue lesions, which are the predominant pre-
cursor for HNCs. The Committee encourages NIDCR to support re-
search to utilize data from The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] and
other genomic and proteomic projects to help match tumor defects
116
with patient clinical outcomes, which could lead to tailored bio-
marker identification for early diagnosis and treatment.
Oral Care Interventions.—The Committee reaffirms that dental
care is integral to the medical management of numerous diseases
and medical conditions and that the lack of medically necessary
oral healthcare heightens the risk of costly medical complications.
The Committee appreciates NIH’s support for research that has
demonstrated that dental care is closely linked to and crucial to the
clinical success of other covered medical services. The Committee
urges NIH to fund additional research in this area and conduct
trials to determine which oral care interventions are most effective
for reducing the prevalence and improving the medical manage-
ment of malignant oral cancers and chronic diseases, preventing
pneumonia in hospitals, and lowering hospitalization and emer-
gency department admission rates for oral diseases and conditions.
Temporomandibular Disorders [TMD].—The Committee com-
mends NIDCR for developing the TMD Collaborative for Improving
Patient-Centered Translational Research [TMD IMPACT]. The
timely implementation of the TMD IMPACT Collaborative into a
national consortium is essential. The Committee is pleased NIDCR
has funded nine TMD IMPACT groups. The Committee encourages
NIDCR to maintain a patient-centered approach in the implemen-
tation of this Collaborative by including patients and advocacy or-
ganizations in this next phase of the project. The Committee is en-
couraged to see that NIDCR has added collaborators including the
FDA, NIAMS, NIBIB, NINDS, NCCIH, OBSSR, and ORWH.
NIDCR should encourage other Agencies and Institutes, Centers,
and Offices within NIH with appropriate scientific expertise to par-
ticipate in and support this project. Given the complexity of TMDs,
interdisciplinary expertise is essential, particularly in addressing
comorbidities and chronic pain conditions. The Committee directs
NIH to provide an update within 120 days on the progress to im-
plement the next phase of this important initiative including the
recruitment of other NIH Institutes as partners. The Committee
urges NIDCR to enhance the centralized resources of the two TMD
national programs [TMD IMPACT] to advance interdisciplinary
care, disseminate best practices, refine clinical guidelines, and inte-
grate research into precision care for TMD patients. Finally, the
Committee acknowledges NIDCR’s participation and support of the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Report
on TMDs and urges continued engagement to advance a scientific
understanding and improve patient care.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY
DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,310,721,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,320,721,000
The Committee recommendation includes $2,320,721,000, an in-
crease of $10,000,000, for the National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK].
Diabetes.—The Committee provides an increase of $10,000,000
and commends the efforts of NIDDK to prioritize the discovery and
validation of biomarkers and urges NIDDK to continue to prioritize
this important work that will accelerate the designing and con-
117
ducting of clinical trials to prevent, treat, and cure type 1 diabetes.
The Committee urges NIDDK to work with the National Institute
on Aging to explore the relationship between diabetes and
neurocognitive conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Further, the Committee encourages NIDDK to expand re-
search into metabolic interventions for diabetes and its associated
comorbidities, including obesity and cardiovascular disease, with
particular attention to nutritional and other innovative manage-
ment strategies as potential therapeutic approaches. This includes
support for large-scale clinical trials aimed at identifying predictive
biological and metabolic biomarkers, optimizing patient stratifica-
tion, and developing best practice clinical guidelines. Research
should employ multimodal data collection, including imaging, ge-
netics, and cellular biology, to advance understanding of the under-
lying mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction and inform personal-
ized, metabolism-based treatment and prevention strategies.
Diabetic Eye Disease.—The Committee notes the connection be-
tween diabetes and eye health. The Committee encourages NIDDK
to engage with relevant Institutes and Centers and stakeholders to
identify collaborative opportunities to improve research and com-
munity-level intervention activities in diabetic eye disease.
Hepatitis B.—The Committee applauds NIDDK efforts to create
common resource services and materials for the research commu-
nity and urges continued focus on clinical networks, databank de-
velopment and precision medicine approaches. The Committee fur-
ther urges the development of experimental animal and cell culture
models to help advance cure research against the widest possible
set of therapeutic targets and research focused on understanding
the virology and immunology of people with low levels of HBsAg,
a protein on the surface of the hepatitis B virus-as this category
of people are more responsive to therapy. The Committee is aware
of the view within the scientific community that finding a cure for
hepatitis B, as has been achieved for hepatitis C, is a winnable goal
and is within reach in the near term. For these reasons, the Com-
mittee urges that research, based on the needs as identified in the
updated Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure Hepatitis
B, be funded by NIH in fiscal year 2026 and beyond.
Kidney Transplant Disparities.—The Committee appreciates
NIDDK’s ongoing work on kidney disease research, particularly on
disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney
diseases through new studies to address disparities in kidney
transplant care. The Committee reaffirms the importance of reduc-
ing health disparities and urges NIDDK to support health dispari-
ties research to improve kidney transplant care.
Nutrition Science and Addressing Chronic Diseases.—The Com-
mittee recognizes NIDDK for its leadership advancing nutrition
science particularly as it relates to a variety of chronic conditions.
Further, the Committee appreciates that the benefit and impact of
further scientific advancements goes beyond digestive and meta-
bolic conditions and encourages cross-cutting collaborative research
efforts in nutrition science and chronic diseases with relevant NIH
Institutes and Centers in support of ongoing and emerging efforts,
many of which are coordinated by ONR at the Office of the Direc-
118
tor, including the concept for Food is Medicine Networks or Centers
of Excellence.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,603,925,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,773,925,000
The Committee recommendation includes $2,773,925,000, for the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS].
This amount includes a $50,000,000 increase for NINDS’ Alz-
heimer’s Disease and Related Dementias [ADRD] research. This
amount also includes $100,000,000, a $25,000,000 increase, for Ac-
celerating Access to Critical Therapies [ACT] for ALS Act (Public
Law 117–79) research funded by NINDS which was previously pro-
vided to the Office of the Director. Finally, the amount includes
$69,890,000, $6,000,000 increase, for the BRAIN Initiative.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] Research.—The Committee
commends NINDS for its leadership in the NIH ALS Strategic
Planning Working Group and development of the 2023 priorities for
ALS research focused on more effective diagnosis, prevention,
treatment, and a cure. The Committee provides an increase of
$25,000,000 to support these efforts, and urges NINDS to use this
funding to bolster ALS clinical trials, therapies, targeted therapies,
and treatments.
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias
[AD/ADRD].—The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000
across NIH for AD/ADRD research, including an increase of
$50,000,000 in NINDS and $50,000,000 in NIA.
Angelman Syndrome [AS].—The Committee understands that
NINDS is convening research leaders, patient organizations, and
other stakeholders to prepare a roadmap for clinical outcomes
measures and biomarkers for AS, a rare neurogenetic disorder. As
a part of and following this convening, NINDS is urged to support
funding for clinical outcome measures and biomarker development,
determine more efficient pathways for developing and manufac-
turing novel gene therapies for neurodevelopmental diseases, and
inform the next generation of clinical studies that should be pur-
sued based on approved biomarkers. NIH should ensure timely and
comprehensive data-sharing across investigators and industry in
order to advance these goals. NINDS shall provide a report to the
Committees on this initiative within 1 year of enactment.
Brain Aneurysms.—The Committee remains concerned that an
estimated 1 out of every 50 individuals in the United States has
a brain aneurysm and an estimated 30,000 Americans suffer a
brain aneurysm rupture each year, with little or no warning. Rup-
tured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 50 percent of cases. De-
spite the widespread prevalence of this condition and the high soci-
etal cost it imposes on our Nation, the Federal Government only
spends approximately $2.08 per year on brain aneurysm research
for each person afflicted with a brain aneurysm. The Committee
encourages NINDS to increase its support for research focused on
prevention and early detection of brain aneurysms.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [CJD].—The Committee commends the
NAPA Advisory Council report from 2023 that acknowledges the
scientific connection between prion diseases and ADRDs, and the
119
2024 Update that specifically mentioned CJD, and continues to en-
courage NIH to recognize prion diseases as ADRDs and fund more
research for prion diseases, like CJD. ADRDs have already bene-
fited from prion disease research, and further integration of the
fields could lead to beneficial new treatments and improve sci-
entific understanding of these devastating diseases.
Frontotemporal Degeneration [FTD].—The Committee encourages
NIH to continue to support research to identify and validate bio-
markers for FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases among ra-
cially and ethnically diverse cohorts. Easily accessible biomarkers
to accurately detect and measure disease will facilitate greater ac-
cess to diagnosis and promote participation in research on all forms
of dementia. Natural history studies like ALLFTD facilitate bio-
marker discovery and enable the design of clinical trials to test in-
novative treatments. Equally critical is the development of a data
biosphere that enhances secure sharing of clinical and research
data and biological samples for FTD. Broad sharing of datasets will
enable the larger community of researchers to bring their expertise
to bear on the challenge of treating and preventing FTD and other
ADRDs. The Committee also encourages NIH to find ways to sup-
port more effective communication across researchers, and between
clinical science and broader society, to ensure that the research ad-
vances driven by NIH can have maximum effect on improving
health. FTD is rare and tends to occur at a younger age than other
forms of dementia. This creates additional challenges for clinical
trials and research. To overcome these challenges as well as re-
cruitment and retention issues, the Committee urges NIH to fund
investigators who reflect the broad variety of study populations
who can ensure culturally appropriate research is being conducted
as well as develop innovative clinical trial designs that recruit di-
verse populations so that potential therapies can be tested more ef-
ficiently and effectively.
Improving Diagnostic Testing for Neurodegernative Diseases.—
The Committee supports HHS efforts to prevent and effectively
treat neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease,
Lewy body dementia, and other related disorders. The Committee
also recognizes that early detection is imperative to improving
health outcomes and patient quality of life by delaying or halting
the progression of such diseases. To improve the ability of
healthcare providers to diagnose and treat neurodegenerative dis-
eases at an earlier onset, the Committee encourages NINDS to
work with healthcare-related entities, manufacturers, and devel-
opers, as appropriate, to promote the awareness and research of
novel diagnostic testing, including tests that detect and visualize
protein markers using skin and other accessible tissues, for
neurodegenerative diseases. The Committee also encourages
NINDS to collaborate with appropriate stakeholders, including
CMS, to improve access to such novel diagnostic tests for
neurodegenerative diseases by evaluating current Medicare and
Medicaid coverage to determine if such coverage is adequate.
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [ME/
CFS] Research Roadmap.—The Committee recognizes the urgent
need to advance research for ME/CFS, especially given its overlap
with Long COVID and relevance across multiple ICs and com-
120
mends NIH for approving the ME/CFS Research Roadmap. The
Committee encourages NIH to implement the roadmap’s rec-
ommendations, including advancing biomarker discovery, diag-
nostic tool development, and clinical trials. NIH is further directed
to provide a detailed implementation plan to the Committee within
180 days of enactment.
Multiple System Atrophy [MSA].—The Committee notes the con-
nection between MSA and Parkinson’s Disease and the potential
for advancements in research that impact both communities. The
Committee notes the lack of treatment options and the lengthy
time to diagnosis MSA and encourages NINDS to work with com-
munity stakeholders to implement the National Plan to End Par-
kinson’s.
National Parkinson’s Project.—The Committee includes
$5,000,000 for NIH to continue the implementation of the National
Parkinson’s Project, as created by the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and
Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act
(Public Law 118–66). Within 90 days of enactment of this act, NIH
shall provide a briefing describing planned next steps the agency
will take to implement the act.
Opioids, Stimulants, and Pain Management.—The Committee
provides no less than $285,295,000 in NINDS for the HEAL Initia-
tive. The Committee encourages NINDS to continue its efforts
through the HEAL Initiative, with a focus on grant opportunities
to support research and education for effective and non-addictive
pain management to improve outcomes for people with pain in di-
verse settings across the United States.
Pediatric-Onset Epilepsies Network.—The Committee is aware of
the enormous economic cost and toll in human suffering resulting
from epilepsies and considers research in this area a high priority.
There are approximately 470,000 children currently living with epi-
lepsy, as well as three million adults, many of whom were diag-
nosed as children. Creating an infrastructure with a goal of under-
standing pediatric epilepsies diagnoses by cause and coordinating
research across institutions may increase the potential for scientific
progress in the era of precision medicine. This network could in-
clude efforts to unite key assets and support a collaborative, multi-
disciplinary research model to enroll patients from many settings
to accelerate therapy development and expedite translation of re-
search findings into standard clinical care. Therefore, the Com-
mittee urges NINDS, in collaboration with the epilepsies stake-
holder community and the Curing the Epilepsies conference, to es-
tablish the Pediatric-Onset Epilepsies Network. Such a network
could enable cooperative research studies, accelerate the develop-
ment of knowledge about epilepsies, and rapidly advance thera-
peutic options, including genetic therapies, and their implementa-
tion to improve treatments and healthcare outcomes. The Com-
mittee directs the NIH Director to provide a report on key findings
and planned actions within 1 year of enactment and annually
thereafter.
Preventive and Early-Treatment Cognitive and Brain Health Re-
search.—The Committee encourages NIH to give greater attention
to the study of the pre-symptomatic or preclinical stages of neuro-
logical disorders, that is, alterations in cognitive and brain health
121
before the first clinical symptoms of neurological disease when per-
sons typically encounter medical professionals. Learning what hap-
pens during these stages may guide the development of measures
for detection and monitoring earlier in the course of disease, includ-
ing sensitive neuropsychological measure and biomarkers, which
could improve early interventions development and testing for neu-
rological disease before it becomes disabling and, ultimately, pre-
vent diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, mul-
tiple sclerosis, stroke, and epilepsy. Mounting evidence suggests
that significant pathologies have already accumulated by the time
symptoms appear and early, pre-symptomatic intervention may im-
prove outcomes and may reduce the costs that neurological disease
pose on our health system. Additionally, the Committee supports
NIH and relevant agencies research on emerging non-toxic ap-
proaches to the treatment of related neurological disorders, includ-
ing elovanoids.
Research on Dementia in Parkinson’s Disease [PD].—The Com-
mittee encourages NIA and NINDS to expand the use of fiscal year
2026 and beyond AD/ADRD funding to fund projects studying de-
mentia in PD. PD is the second most common and fastest growing
neurodegenerative disease globally and is characterized by the ab-
normal folding of a protein in the brain, which is similar to what
typically occurs in AD/ADRD. Channeling additional resources into
research could help to unlock groundbreaking dementia-relevant
discoveries in crucial areas like PD and other closely associated
neurological disorders.
Spinal Cord Injury [SCI].—The Committee recognizes SCI as a
pressing public health concern, given its potential to cause severe
paralysis, chronic pain, dependence on mechanical ventilation, and
a host of other debilitating outcomes. With millions of individuals
worldwide lacking any effective therapy to restore function, the
Committee urges NINDS to increase its investment in both pre-
clinical and translational research aimed at identifying novel SCI
treatments. Of particular importance are research efforts focused
on promoting regeneration of the neural pathways that support
respiratory function, preventing the onset of chronic neuropathic
pain, and developing cutting-edge imaging modalities to accurately
track and measure patient responses to therapies. Targeted fund-
ing in these priority areas holds the promise of significantly im-
proving quality of life for patients and their families, mitigating the
vast economic and societal impact of this devastating condition,
and propelling progress toward meaningful, long-term clinical solu-
tions.
Stroke.—Despite notable progress in the stroke mortality rate, it
remains the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of se-
vere long-term disability. The Committee supports continued re-
search to improve the scientific understanding of the brain and
stroke, and the translation of that science exploring new treat-
ments and improved approaches to stroke recovery and rehabilita-
tion through the NIH funded clinical trials network StrokeNet. The
Committee also supports continued stroke-related research con-
ducted through the BRAIN Initiative. This initiative is revolution-
izing our understanding of the brain and offering hope for the mil-
lions of individuals impacted by brain diseases, disorders, and inju-
122
ries including stroke. African Americans have a disproportionately
higher prevalence of stroke and the highest death rate from stroke
compared to any other racial group. The Committee encourages
continued investment in research to understand and eliminate
health inequities across neurological disorders and stroke, includ-
ing the Community-Engaged Health Equity Research in Neuro-
science [HERN] Initiative.
Treatments for PSP, CBD, MSA.—Progressive supranuclear
palsy [PSP], corticobasal degeneration [CBD] and multiple system
atrophy [MSA] are rare, adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases
with significant care burdens, no diagnostic biomarkers, and no
disease-modifying treatments or cures. Average life expectancy fol-
lowing symptom onset is approximately 7 years, and accurate diag-
nosis remains a major challenge-currently achieved in only about
25 percent of cases. The Committee urges NINDS to continue to
ensure that PSP, CBD, and MSA are included in relevant pro-
grammatic initiatives, data collection efforts, and strategic plan-
ning activities focused on neurodegenerative disorders. Specific at-
tention should be given to the development of diagnostic biomark-
ers and therapeutic targets. The Committee further encourages the
allocation of dedicated resources to support research that addresses
the unique clinical and scientific challenges presented by these dis-
eases.
Tuberous Sclerosis.—The Committee understands the importance
of continuing to fund research on Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in
order to support ongoing progress for finding cutting-edge treat-
ments and potential cures for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.
Undiagnosed Diseases Network [UDN].—The Committee provides
an increase of $9,000,000, for UDN and directs the continuation of
the coordinating center, all clinical sites, DNA sequencing core,
central biorepository, model organisms screening center, and other
necessary testing in the pursuit of diagnoses, including but not lim-
ited to: metabolomics, infectious and toxic exposures, and immune
abnormalities.
Udall Centers of Excellence in PD.—Established in 1997 by Pub-
lic Law 105–78, the Udall Centers were designed to be the anchor
of the NIH research efforts in PD. Over the past several years, the
number of Udall Centers has shrunk from 10 to 5, despite more
than 1 million Americans suffering from PD with this population
expected to grow to 2 million by 2050. Moreover, the current esti-
mated economic cost of PD in the United States is $52,000,000,000
annually. The Committee believes that the Udall Center program
is in need of re-investment to accelerate progress on new treat-
ments in the fight against PD. The Committee encourages NINDS
to robustly support the establishment of new Udall Centers and ex-
plore ways to expand the number of centers informed by the Dr.
Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan
to End Parkinson’s Act (Public Law 118–66).
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,562,279,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,592,279,000
123
The Committee provides $6,592,279,000, an increase of
$30,000,000, for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases [NIAID].
Antiviral Drug Discovery Centers [AViDDs].—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of research and development of new
antivirals and their ability to combat new viral outbreaks and pre-
vent them from becoming pandemics, and includes $20,000,000 to
continue to support this effort. The Committee supports the
AViDDs and their mission to develop antiviral drugs to serve as
our first line of defense against forthcoming viral outbreaks. The
Committee is concerned that NIH reported to the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States that future funding for the program has
been eliminated, leaving them funded for only three out of the in-
tended 5 years. The Committee directs NIH to continue supporting
antiviral drug discovery to mitigate the risk of future viral out-
breaks.
Bacteriophage Therapy.—The Committee recognizes that engi-
neered bacteriophage therapy has emerged as one of the most
promising technologies for combating the global crisis of multi-
drug-resistant bacterial infections. The Committee further notes
that recent advancements in artificial intelligence, high-throughput
robotic screening, and advanced biomanufacturing have enabled
bacteriophage therapy to selectively eliminate pathogenic bacterial
species while preserving the body’s natural microbiome. To advance
this critical innovation, the Committee encourages NIAID to con-
tinue supporting research and clinical trials on bacteriophage ther-
apy in the United States.
Celiac Disease.—The Committee commends NIH for issuing a
Notice of Special Interest to spur additional research on the study
of celiac disease. Today, the only known treatment is a gluten-free
diet; however, recent public and private sector research confirms
that such a ‘‘treatment’’ is insufficient for many who suffer from ce-
liac disease. The Committee encourages NIH to devote focused re-
search on the study of celiac disease and continues to urge the
newly created NIH Office of Autoimmune Disease Research
[OADR] to work with NIAID and other NIH Institutes to: support
new research on celiac disease; better coordinate existing research;
and focus new research efforts toward causation, diagnosis, man-
agement, treatment, and, ultimately, a cure of this disease. The
Committee directs NIH to include updates on research, projects,
and programs for celiac disease in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Centers for Research on Emerging Infectious Diseases [CREID].—
The Committee provides $18,200,000 for CREID, a global network
of centers dedicated detecting emerging infectious diseases as early
as possible. The network investigates how and where viruses and
other pathogens emerge from wildlife and spread diseases to peo-
ple-information that is critical to waging rapid responses to such
outbreaks. The Committee directs NIAID to provide continued
funding for the network.
Co-Infection.—The Committee applauds the successes of the Mar-
tin Delaney Collaboratories for HIV Cure Research [MDC] in fos-
tering collaboration towards development of potential curative
strategies for HIV. Approximately 5 percent to 15 percent of people
with HIV in the United States also have chronic hepatitis B virus
124
[HBV] infection, and liver disease is a leading cause of death for
people living with HIV. The Committee urges hepatitis B be in-
cluded in ongoing MDC work to more effectively address HIV and
hepatitis B co-infection. Until we have curative therapy, improved
treatments for chronic hepatitis B are needed that will lead to bet-
ter health and treatment sustainability. The Committee urges en-
hanced collaboration with the Office of AIDS Research, and in-
creased effort towards developing and studying new, innovative,
and potentially life-saving treatments for chronic hepatitis B mono-
infection and hepatitis B/HIV co-infection, especially Long-Acting
Antivirals.
Equipping NIH Research Programs to Target HIV/AIDS
Hotspots.—The Committee directs the NIH Office of AIDS Research
to coordinate NIH-wide resources to focus on areas with the high-
est prevalence of HIV/AIDS, for example, utilizing Centers for
AIDS Research [CFARs] to develop targeted interventions that in-
crease the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] and better pro-
tect those communities from HIV transmission and its con-
sequences.
Food Allergies.—The Committee recognizes the serious issue of
food allergies which affect approximately 8 percent of children and
10 percent of adults in the United States. The Committee com-
mends the ongoing work of NIAID in advancing FDA approved
treatment options for people with food allergies and increasing sup-
port for clinical investigation to a total of 27 clinical sites for this
critical research, including 14 sites as part of the Consortium for
Food Allergy Research [CoFAR].
Hepatitis B.—The Committee applauds NIAID for leading the ef-
fort to update the Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure
Hepatitis B, so it remains a robust roadmap to find a cure. The
Committee is aware of the widely held view in the scientific com-
munity that finding a cure for hepatitis B, as has now been
achieved for hepatitis C, is a winnable goal and is within reach in
the near-term. For these reasons, the Committee urges that re-
search, based on the needs as identified in the updated Plan, be
funded in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. The Committee urges
NIAID to expand the use of Program Projects, R01 and U01 Coop-
erative Research Agreements, and other contract mechanisms to
discover and develop new therapies for chronic hepatitis B and D.
The Committee applauds the success of the point of Care Tech-
nologies Research Network [POCTRN] and Rapid Acceleration of
Diagnostics [RADX] programs and encourages more use of these
programs for development of point-of-care tests for HBV, HDV and
the cancers caused by these viruses. Efforts for establishment of
biologically relevant animal models, particularly, the immune com-
petent small animal models supporting persistent HBV infection, to
support the development of immune modulators for the functional
cure of chronic hepatitis B should be supported.
Hereditary Angioedema [HAE] with Normal C1 Inhibitor.—The
Committee applauds the previous work across NIH to identify ge-
netic mutations that cause HAE and to advance treatment options
and care for affected individuals, moving a once deadly rare disease
to a largely manageable chronic illness. However, the Committee
notes that challenges persist in diagnosis, treatment, and care for
125
HAE patients with normal c1 Inhibitor and encourages NIAID to
work with other Institutes and Centers, and the stakeholder com-
munity, to advance research in this key area.
HIV Self-Testing.—The Committee strongly supports advance-
ment of technologies that enable rapid self-testing for HIV, particu-
larly those technologies that detect HIV in people on current or fu-
ture therapeutics and vaccines. The Committee notes the critical
importance of having such self-testing technologies available before
new options for therapeutic control and HIV vaccines become wide-
ly available. Self-testing technologies are necessary for individuals
to know their HIV status and seek care to initiate treatment,
thereby supporting ongoing HIV prevention efforts. Thus, the Com-
mittee urges NIH to fund as many meritorious proposals as pos-
sible to bring these important tests to market.
HIV Vaccine Research.—There are 1.2 million people living with
HIV in the United States, and 36,000 new infections per year. HIV
causes more deaths annually than breast cancer or prostate cancer.
After decades of scientific effort and consistent NIH investment, we
now have a clear, evidence-based road map for developing a suc-
cessful HIV vaccine. Efforts like the HIV Vaccine Trials Unit
[HVTN] and its partner clinical research centers in 13 States en-
sure that expertise from all corners of the United States are con-
tributing to this effort. The Committee notes that in May 2025,
NIH notified researchers that it will not renew funding for major
research consortia working to develop the most cutting-edge experi-
mental HIV vaccines into clinical trials. For 40 years, researchers
have sought to develop an HIV vaccine, and NIH is the largest sin-
gle funder of HIV vaccine research, providing 70 percent of the
global research efforts. The Committee directs NIH to continue to
support sustained, robust Federal funding for HIV vaccine re-
search.
National Biocontainment Laboratories [NBLs].—The Committee
provides $23,000,000, to the two NBLs to support core and shared
resources for BSL–4 containment, enabling them to develop and
maintain the research resources, facilities and personnel needed to
meet the national biodefense and emerging infectious diseases re-
search needs in the event of a deliberate act of bioterrorism or nat-
urally occurring public health emergency. The Committee notes
that research on high consequence zoonotic viruses requires high-
containment BSL–4 labs. High-containment BSL–4 labs enable re-
searchers to diagnose and investigate these types of pathogens, and
develop rapid and reliable diagnostics, novel antiviral therapeutics,
and vaccines, without endangering the staff or population at large.
Additional investments in BSL–4 infrastructure for research in
highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses is critical. The Committee di-
rects that this funding be used by the NBLs to support (1) main-
taining the research resources for biodefense, emerging infectious
disease agents, and other infectious disease threats to global
health; (2) training new researchers in biosafety level 4 practices;
(3) maintaining a workforce skilled in BSL–4 research; and (4) es-
tablishing best practices for the safe, effective, and efficient conduct
of research in BSL–4 facilities.
Neglected Disease Research.—The Committee strongly supports
NIAID’s neglected disease research programs, including for HIV/
126
AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases. NIH
is the world’s single largest funder of neglected disease research
and has supported the development of high-impact technologies for
health areas that receive little attention from industry. Given that
many innovation gaps persist, NIAID is directed to continue to sup-
port this research.
Regional Biocontainment Laboratories [RBLs].—For nearly two
decades the RBLs have played a vital role as part of the nation’s
biodefense infrastructure helping the United States prepare and re-
spond to emerging infectious disease agents. The Committee is
pleased NIAID competitively awarded UC7 awards to the RBLs.
The Committee encourages NIAID to allow grantees to carry over
unused funds into fiscal year 2027 to support this vital work of the
RBLs. The Committee provides $52,000,000, to the 12 RBLs to sup-
port core and shared resources for BSL–3 containment and related
activities within the RBL facility in its entirety. To the extent pos-
sible, of this amount, no less than $3,000,000 shall be provided to
each of the 12 RBLs to support training and maintaining a capable
research workforce with broad, relevant biomedical, technological,
veterinary, and regulatory expertise, supporting operations, facili-
ties, and equipment purchase costs, and supporting research uti-
lizing the capabilities of the RBLs. The remaining funding shall go
to the 12 RBLs to support: (1) research on biodefense, emerging in-
fectious disease agents, and other infectious disease threats to glob-
al health; (2) training new researchers, including in biosafety level
3 practices; (3) maintaining a workforce skilled in BSL–3 research;
and (4) establishing best practices for the safe, effective, and effi-
cient conduct of research in BSL–3 facilities. All funding shall be
used to support the aforementioned activities conducted within the
RBL, and should not be limited to just the BSL–3 space.
Research on Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee is
aware that antibiotic stewardship programs are a key component
in preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance in all healthcare
facilities in the United States and across the world. The Committee
provides no less than $565,000,000 to fund NIAID research to com-
bat AMR and the training of new investigators to improve AMR re-
search capacity as outlined in the 2020–2025 National Action Plan
to Combat Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria [CARB]. In the CARB,
2020–2025, one of the five goals was to Accelerate Basic and Ap-
plied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Thera-
peutics, and Vaccines in order to improve understanding of the
many factors that contribute to the emergence, spread, and persist-
ence of antibiotic resistance and to support new strategies for pre-
venting and mitigating infections. NIH has supported research to
understand mechanisms of AMR spread and to mitigate inappro-
priate usage of antibiotics. The Committee urges NIAID to undergo
an assessment of the current infection control and health services
research, determine where the gaps exist, and create a research
agenda to help advance this important area of knowledge.
Tuberculosis [TB].—According to the World Health Organization,
a total of 1.25 million people died from TB in 2023 (including
161,000 people with HIV). Worldwide, TB is the leading infectious
killer and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV.
Critical scientific research into the development of new TB diag-
127
nostic, treatment and prevention tools was delayed during the
COVID–19 pandemic. The Committee commends NIAID on the
publication of the 2024 update to the Strategic Plan for Tuber-
culosis Research and encourages NIAID to continue its implemen-
tation.
Universal Flu Vaccine.—The Committee includes $270,000,000 to
support efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines that pro-
vides long-lasting protection against numerous flu strains, rather
than a select few. The Committee notes that on May 1, 2025, NIH
received a $500,000,000 transfer from the Administration for Stra-
tegic Preparedness and Response [ASPR] to accelerate the develop-
ment of universal vaccines using beta-propiolactone [BPL]-inac-
tivated, whole-virus platform. Given this substantial increase,
within the total provided, the Committee does not provide funding
to support vaccine development using the beta-propiolactone [BPL]-
inactivated, whole-virus platform. The Committee urges NIAID to
prioritize research needed to develop a universal influenza vaccine
and directs NIH to ensure that all universal influenza vaccine re-
search activities are approved by NIH’s rigorous multi-tiered re-
view system, including the NIAID National Advisory and Infectious
Diseases Council.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,244,679,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,244,679,000
The Committee provides $3,244,679,000 for the National Insti-
tute of General Medical Sciences [NIGMS], which includes
$1,412,482,000 in transfers available under 241 of the PHS Act
(Public Law 104–73 as amended).
Biomedical Research Workforce Training.—Training programs at
the NIH provide a quality standard of training for graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral fellows in biomedical research. The training
grants that support these programs at research institutions across
the country play a vital role in establishing a biomedical research
ecosystem and train the next generation of researchers for health-
related research needs. Despite the success of training programs,
the number of students and postdoctoral scholars supported on
training grants has remained constant over the years. The Com-
mittee applauds NIH efforts to increase funding for IDeA States
and urges NIH to also emphasize the importance of supporting
training grants in IDeA States. The Committee directs NIH Insti-
tutes and Centers to conduct and provide to the Committees, a
portfolio analysis within 120 days of enactment. The analysis will
assess the distribution of T32 training grants among States, includ-
ing number of applicants and success rates per State to ensure
NIH is supporting capacity building and a diverse workforce for the
future biomedical research enterprise. In addition to the portfolio
analysis, in the fiscal year 2027 CJ, NIH is directed to provide an
update on specific actions NIH will take to identify and remove
barriers for applying for training grants in IDeA States.
Bridge Programs.—The Committee strongly supports opportuni-
ties for students with limited access to STEMM [Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine] education and re-
search. The Committee recognizes the effectiveness and importance
128
of NIGMS bridging programs that support historically underserved
students and researchers to pursue STEMM studies and become
the nation’s next generation of researchers, including programs
such as the Bridges to the Baccalaureate Research Training Pro-
gram, Bridges to the Doctorate Research Training Program,
Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program [PREP], Advancing
Research Careers [ARC] program, and Maximizing Opportunities
for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers [MOSAIC] pro-
gram. The Committee is extremely concerned that NIH terminated
many of these programs in 2025, and directs NIH to reestablish
them. The Committee urges NIH to expand the size of existing
training programs that bridge different educational or career
stages and establish these programs at institutions that have his-
torically received low levels of funding support from NIH, including
Minority Serving Institutions and institutions that are eligible
under the Department of Education’s Strengthening Institutions
Program. The Committee urges NIH to set clear mentorship and
support standards for students participating in these programs.
The Committee urges NIH to encourage and provide more guidance
to participating institutions to account for sufficient staff and out-
reach, budget and other training-related expenses in grant applica-
tions. Finally, the Committee directs NIH to provide a report on
these activities within 90 days of enactment.
Institutional Development Award [IDeA].—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the IDeA program in enhancing geo-
graphical representation across NIH’s research portfolio, and pro-
vides continued funding for the program. In order to ensure that
research investments from IDeA programs provide maximum ben-
efit, the Committee urges NIH to examine ways to increase NIH
IDeA State participation in major grant programs across NIH’s
portfolio, including those that support biomedical research facili-
ties, instrumentation, and training. The Committee notes the Bio-
medical Research Workforce Working Group report and supports
growing the IDeA funding level to its minimum recommended level,
which will allow NIH to take advantage of the full diversity of the
nation’s assets: diversity of individuals, diversity of institutions,
and diversity of geography. Currently eligible States have histori-
cally had low aggregate success rates for grant applications to NIH
and rely on the IDeA program to help build a research infrastruc-
ture and enhance research capacity at institutions in those States.
Finally, the Committee opposes any efforts within NIH to change
eligibility for the IDeA program to a system that would be based
on States’ populations.
IDeA Clinician Researcher Support.—The Committee recognizes
the NIH’s continued efforts to support mentorship and career de-
velopment of clinician researchers through the Clinical and
Translational Science Awards and other programs. However, the
Committee is concerned that IDeA-eligible States do not have equi-
table access to funding to support mentored career development.
The Committee encourages NIH to support mentored career devel-
opment funding for physicians and clinicians in IDeA States.
IDeA Networks for Clinical and Translational Research [IDeA–
CTR].—The Committee notes the success of the IDeA Clinical and
Translational Research centers to develop infrastructure and
129
human resources to more effectively conduct clinical and
translational research. Further, the Committee notes the potential
for further enhancement and progress through meaningful collabo-
ration with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards [CTSA]
program, particularly in rural areas. The Committee encourages
NIGMS and NCATS to provide a general roadmap for collaborative
opportunities that preserve the autonomy of both programs while
removing barriers to allow for rapid scientific advancement and im-
proved local care and research.
Increasing Diversity in Biomedical Research.—The Committee
strongly supports opportunities for the nation’s next generation of
researchers and efforts to enhance diversity in biomedical research.
Early-stage researchers, particularly those from groups underrep-
resented in biomedical research, spend longer periods of time in
postdoctoral positions with lower salaries, receive inadequate
mentorship, and are offered fewer opportunities for professional ad-
vancement, resulting in lower retention rates for those groups.
Even with these obstacles, many early-stage researchers tackle
riskier projects and have contributed to research that has gen-
erated positive outcomes for the benefit of society. Grant programs
offering support and opportunities for researchers at key career
transition points requiring little or no preliminary data, are critical
to ensuring innovative scientists from diverse backgrounds succeed
in biomedical research. Therefore, the Committee is concerned that
NIH terminated a number of longstanding research training and
career development programs that play a vital role in building the
next generation of the biomedical research workforce. These pro-
grams provide critical funding for graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars, and the termination of these programs has
caused an immediate and harmful impact on the ability of aca-
demic medicine to attract and retain the best and brightest sci-
entists. To maintain these programs, the Committee provides not
less than $13,100,000 to continue the Maximizing Access to Re-
search Careers [MARC] program; not less than $18,800,000 to con-
tinue the Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program; not less
than $21,300,000 to continue the Undergraduate Research Train-
ing Initiative for Student Enhancement program; not less than
$6,400,000 for the Bridges to Doctorate program; not less than
$15,500,000 for the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development
program; and not less than $20,800,000 for the Institutional Re-
search and Academic Career Development Award to train the next
generation of scientists while enhancing the diversity of the bio-
medical research workforce and enabling promising scientists to
pursue high-risk, high-reward research. Finally, within 90 days of
enactment, the Committee directs NIH to provide a report and
briefing to the Committees on Appropriations on the training and
career development programs that have been terminated since De-
cember 2024, and a justification for the termination of each pro-
gram. Such report shall include the amount NIH spent on each
program in fiscal year 2024, and a comprehensive list of awards as-
sociated with each program, including the grant number, institu-
tion and the total cost of each award.
Minority Serving Institutions.—Congress recognizes the impor-
tance of highly trained physician-scientists to serve diverse commu-
130
nities, decrease health disparities, and enhance the biomedical re-
search workforce. The Committee encourages NIGMS to support
medical scientist training at Minority Serving Institutions as de-
fined in title III of the Higher Education Act. Such efforts should
support dual degree programs that train students in medicine and
biomedical research.
Supporting Biomolecular NMR Databanks.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the essential role that existing, extramural Nuclear Mag-
netic Resonance [NMR] databases located at public academic
health centers play in fostering medical research and drug dis-
covery. As such, the Committee encourages NIGMS to ensure that
grants which support these valuable scientific community assets
are of sufficient size to ensure that they can continue to add and
curate new data, modernize, and support all researchers.
EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH
AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,759,078,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,779,078,000
The Committee provides $1,779,078,000, an increase of
$20,000,000, for the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development [NICHD].
Andrological Health.—The Committee strongly supports
translational and clinical research into andrological health, and
urges NICHD to prioritize and expand these research programs.
Endometriosis.—The Committee urges NICHD to continue ex-
panding basic, clinical, and translational research into the mecha-
nisms of endometriosis, including root causes of the disease and
new treatment methods. The Committee encourages research on
the genetic and immune system components of endometriosis. The
Committee further encourages NIH to devote more resources to
support targeted research of endocrine disrupting chemicals in
endometriosis, the relationship of endometriosis and cancer, pre-
natal and epigenetic influences on the risk for endometriosis. The
Committee also encourages research on non-invasive diagnostics of
endometriosis to reduce diagnosis delay and improve treatment.
The Committee encourages research on the growth of endometriosis
and endometriosis recurrence post-surgical procedures or medical
therapeutics. Additionally, NIH is encouraged to use an updated,
evidence-based definition of the disease, aligning with current sci-
entific understanding that characterizes it as a chronic, systemic,
and inflammatory condition. This aims to ensure the development
of effective diagnostics and treatments reflect endometriosis’ full
clinical reality (i.e., not solely a reproductive condition) as it can af-
fect every major organ in the body.
Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision
for Everyone [IMPROVE] Initiative.—The Committee provides no
less than $73,400,000 for this activity, an increase of $20,000,000.
The Committee is aware that NICHD’s current Maternal Health
Research Centers of Excellence provide a platform to further both
research and clinical care in reducing maternal morbidity and mor-
tality. The Committee appreciates NIH’s commitment to supporting
Centers in areas of the country that see the highest rate of both.
The Committee encourages NICHD to continue to expand its cur-
131
rent Centers of Excellence with a particular emphasis on increas-
ing support for existing centers and establishing new ones in re-
gions of greatest need, eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in
maternal morbidity, and training a diverse group of early-stage sci-
entists in maternal health equity research.
Infertility.—The Committee remains concerned about the rate of
infertility suffered by couples trying to conceive. In the United
States, 11 percent of women of reproductive age have difficulty get-
ting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. The Committee
urges NICHD to continue to research infertility, specifically
adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and polycystic ovary
syndrome. This research could include diagnostic testing, causes of
the conditions, and treatment options, especially non-pharma-
cological intervention. Since there is a gap in the knowledge of how
to diagnose and treat male infertility, the Committee also urges
NICHD to continue to support research on male mechanisms of in-
fertility.
Maternal Morbidity and Mortality.—The Committee is concerned
about recent closures of obstetrics and gynecology units in rural
hospitals across the country and their impact on patient access to
care. The Committee encourages NICHD to support research on
this issue, including examining how these closures are affecting
maternal morbidity and mortality.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Research.—The Committee urges
NICHD to continue expanding basic, clinical, and translational re-
search into the mechanisms of polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS],
including the cause of the condition, such as metabolic dysfunction,
and treatment methods, especially addressing hormonal imbalance,
insulin resistance, nutritional and lifestyle modifications, and sur-
gical procedures.
Population Research.—The Committee commends NICHD for
supporting prospective, population representative longitudinal
studies, including the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child De-
velopment Supplement, Future of Families and Child Wellbeing
Study, and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Data from
these studies are public goods used widely to inform research and
training activities conducted by thousands of scientists at univer-
sities nationwide, including underserved institutions, and are heav-
ily used by new and early-stage investigators. In addition, these
studies are the only nationally representative data scientists may
use to analyze, for example, how parental and grandparental char-
acteristics affect children’s outcomes and the impact of adverse
childhood experiences over the life course. NICHD is encouraged to
continue supporting this type of research.
Safe to Sleep Campaign.—The Committee is concerned that in
April 2025 NIH cancelled Federal participation in Safe to Sleep, a
30-year campaign to prevent infants from dying in their sleep.
Thanks to increased awareness and access to evidence-based risk
reduction strategies for parents and caregivers, Safe to Sleep dra-
matically reduced the number of Sudden Infant Death [SIDs]
cases—cutting them nearly in half between 1994 and 2009. NICHD
expanded the campaign in 2012 to bring an awareness to other
non-SIDs sleep-related infant deaths like accidental suffocation and
strangulation in bed, which fall under a broader umbrella of unex-
132
pected infant deaths known as Sudden Unexpected Infant Death
[SUID]. According to the most recent data available, sudden infant
death rates increased nearly 12 percent between 2020 and 2022, or
more than 300 babies dying every month. The elimination of
NICHD’s support for Safe to Sleep would lead to even more pre-
ventable infant deaths. Therefore, the Committee directs NICHD to
re-establish the Safe to Sleep Campaign and provides $1,300,000,
the same amount as fiscal year 2024, to ensure the health and
safety of all American infants.
Severe Maternal Morbidity.—The Committee is concerned that
despite the high rate of severe maternal morbidity in the United
States, there is not a uniform definition of severe maternal mor-
bidity. Having a uniform definition would help Federal, State and
local agencies and research institutions establish standardized and
interoperable processes for billing surveillance, data collection and
research. The collected data could then inform the development
and deployment of targeted, evidence-based prevention and treat-
ment programs to reduce the incidence of severe maternal mor-
bidity. The Committee encourages NICHD to hold a formal con-
vening of subject matter experts and organizational representa-
tives, including representatives from the CDC, HRSA, NICHD, the
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Tech-
nology, FDA, and public stakeholders, to determine a uniform defi-
nition of severe maternal morbidity. The Committee directs NICHD
to provide a report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the proceedings
of convening including formal definitions for severe maternal mor-
bidity.
Women’s Reproductive Health Research [WRHR] Program and
Research Scientist Development Program [RSDP].—The Committee
encourages NICHD to continue to fund WRHR and RSDP scholars,
with the goal of increasing the diversity of the scholars, sites, and
research supported by the programs. The Committee recognizes the
effectiveness of these programs, which provides an opportunity for
obstetrician/gynecologists who recently completed postgraduate
clinical training to further their training in basic, translational and
clinical research. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update
on these programs in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Uterine Fibroid Research.—The Committee urges NICHD to con-
tinue expanding basic, clinical, and translational research into the
mechanisms of uterine fibroids, including the cause of uterine
fibroids, especially the relation to hormone imbalance and high es-
trogen levels, and new treatment methods, including surgical pro-
cedures. The Committee further encourages research on the impact
of uterine fibroids on abnormal bleeding, anemia, fertility, and re-
current miscarriage. The Committee encourages research on the
prevalence of uterine fibroids in minority populations.
NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $896,549,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 896,549,000
The Committee recommendation includes $896,549,000 for the
National Eye Institute [NEI].
Usher Syndrome.—The Committee encourages NIH to enhance
and prioritize Usher syndrome research at NEI. The Committee re-
133
quests an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ. The update should in-
clude efforts to stimulate the field and to accelerate viable human
treatment options for those with Usher syndrome.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $913,979,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 913,979,000
The Committee recommendation includes $913,979,000 for the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS].
Environmental-Related Health Conditions.—The Committee pro-
vides $40,000,000 for NIEHS to continue research on the impacts
that changing environmental conditions have on human health.
Improving Understanding Environmental Triggers of Inflam-
matory Bowel Disease [IBD].—The Committee is aware of research
indicating linkages between environmental factors such as heavy
and transition metals, air pollutants, food emulsifiers, and pes-
ticides are associated with an increased risk of IBD and the need
to address gaps in this area. The Committee directs NIEHS to col-
laborate with NIH ICs, such as NIDDK and the Office of Nutrition
Research to develop a research strategy to address these gaps, in-
cluding better understanding the impact of environmental factors,
more precise assessments to measure the effects of exposures, and
understanding the overall impact of any such factors and ways to
intervene to address them. The Committee also directs NIH to as-
sess possible ways to incorporate immune-mediated digestive dis-
eases and nutrition into existing programs.
Indoor Air.—The Committee urges NIEHS to continue research-
ing indoor pollutants, including from combustion indoors, to better
understand the indoor air landscape and its impacts. The Com-
mittee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Microplastics and Human Health.—The Committee recommends
that NIH review primary chemicals in the life cycle analysis of
plastic materials that are negatively impacting the environment
and human health. The Committee urges NIH to research the pres-
ence of microplastics and nanoplastics in the human body, includ-
ing in organs and biospecimens and how such presence impacts
human health.
PFAS Mitigation.—The Committee recognizes that contaminated
water poses a significant public health risk, with the potential to
cause a range of adverse health outcomes, including gastro-
intestinal illness, neurological conditions, reproductive issues,
chronic diseases, and the transmission of infectious diseases. Given
the severe and far-reaching impacts on human health, the Com-
mittee continues to appropriate funding to support and coordinate
comprehensive health-focused research efforts to evaluate the di-
rect and indirect impacts of contaminated water on public health.
Wildfire Smoke.—The Committee recognizes that exposure to
smoke from wildfires is no longer a rare occurrence and is a reality
for millions of Americans. The Committee is concerned that public
health experts do not yet fully understand the risk posed by expo-
sure to wildland fire smoke-particularly acute and chronic smoke
exposure to patients with existing pulmonary and cardiac disease.
The Committee encourages NIEHS to support research to under-
134
stand the health risks associated with wildfire smoke exposure and
any interventions that can be implemented to mitigate adverse
health effects.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,507,623,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,557,623,000
The Committee recommendation includes $4,557,623,000, for the
National Institute on Aging [NIA]. This amount includes an in-
crease of $50,000,000 for NIA’s AD/ADRD research.
Alzheimer’s Disease/Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias [AD/
ADRD].—Since fiscal year 2015, Congress has increased research
funding for AD/ADRD by more than 500 percent, making it the
largest expenditure of its kind in NIH. By 2050, the cost to treat
and care for those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease is expected to
rise to as high as $1,100,000,000,000 a year. Without a medical
breakthrough to prevent, slow, or stop the disease, Medicare- and
Medicaid-related costs could rise more than four-fold. NIH-funded
research offers hope for finding solutions to manage this disease
successfully in the future. Therefore, the Committee continues to
support Alzheimer’s disease research, including multi-disciplinary
approaches into the basic science and pathology of the disease,
which builds upon the funding goals needed to prevent and effec-
tively treat Alzheimer’s by 2025 identified in the National Plan re-
quired by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (Public Law 111–
375). The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000 across
NIH for AD/ADRD research, including an increase of $50,000,000
in NINDS and $50,000,000 in NIA. The NIA is encouraged to con-
tinue addressing the research targets outlined in the fiscal year
2026 Professional Judgment Budget. In addition, NIA is directed to
provide an update on activities related to this research in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ.
Alzheimer’s Disease and Metabolic Function.—The Committee en-
courages NIH to investigate the fundamental link between meta-
bolic function and AD/ADRDs, as well as the study of the preven-
tion, treatment, and reversal of AD/ADRDs, including Parkinson’s
disease, through metabolic therapies. The Committee urges the
NIH to expand research into metabolic interventions for AD/
ADRDs. This includes support for large-scale clinical trials aimed
at identifying predictive neurobiological and metabolic biomarkers,
optimizing patient stratification, and developing best practice clin-
ical guidelines. Research may employ multi-disciplinary approaches
into the basic science and pathology of the diseases, including
neuroimaging, genetics, and cellular biology, to advance under-
standing of the underlying mechanisms of disease and inform per-
sonalized, metabolism-based treatment and prevention strategies.
Alzheimer’s Risk Reduction.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to prioritize scientifically-based early interventions for
ADRDs, and to identify and implement a comprehensive set of ac-
tions to assess risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Such
an assessment should include a focus on populations and commu-
nities at highest risk and with the greatest prevalence. Actions
should include: conducting health risk assessments; identifying op-
portunities to address known risk factors; examining incentives to
135
promote brain health; providing payments for prevention and care
delivery models that incorporate brain health as part of care and
treatment of other conditions; and examining the development and
implementation of quality measures specifically related to brain
health.
Palliative Care Research.—The Committee provides continued
funding for NIA to coordinate the work of a multi-institute and
multi-Center initiative for palliative care research, including extra-
mural-based research infrastructure, by developing early and mid-
stage researchers, and engaging various healthcare systems, pro-
viders, and community partners. The Committee recognizes that
palliative care is a critical area of research and informs supportive
care for patients of all ages with serious illness and their families
focused on relief of symptoms and suffering, communication of
prognosis and treatment options in the context of patient goals,
and coordination of care within and across healthcare settings. The
Committee commends NIA for spearheading the release of a fund-
ing opportunity to support a national Consortium for Palliative
Care Research Across the Lifespan in February 2024. This Consor-
tium will provide resources, expertise, and coordination to advance
innovative, high-quality palliative care research across the lifespan
and across a range of serious illnesses, including dementia. The
Consortium will also emphasize scientific workforce development in
palliative care, in addition to clarifying and addressing differences
in quality and use of palliative care services across populations.
NIA is directed to update the Committee monthly on this effort
until awards are made. Finally, NIA is directed to notify the Com-
mittee at least 10 days in advance of the release of a Notice of
Award for the Consortium for Palliative Care Research Across the
Lifespan.
Population Research.—The Committee commends NIA for sup-
porting a robust population aging research portfolio that includes
research grants, centers, networks, training programs, and popu-
lation representative longitudinal surveys, including the Health
and Retirement Study and National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent to Adult Health, studying how demographic, social, environ-
mental, behavioral, psychological, and economic factors impact
health and well-being over the life course. In fiscal year 2025, the
Committee is pleased to learn that NIA plans to renew funding for
its Centers on Demography and Economics of Aging program. The
current 15 centers provide essential infrastructure and data, stimu-
lating aging research and training activities on topics such as phys-
ical and cognitive functioning, disability, health disparities, and
Alzheimer’s disease, nationwide. The Committee urges NIA to con-
tinue to encourage collaboration among its centers, as it currently
does via the Research Centers Collaborative Network [RCCN].
RCCN aligns approaches between NIA Center programs, including
the Centers on Demography and Economics of Aging, Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Centers, and Roybal Centers for Translational
Research in the Behavioral and Social Sciences of Aging.

The Committee recommendation includes $685,465,000 for the
National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Dis-
eases [NIAMS].
Atopic Dermatitis.—The Committee recognizes NIAMS ongoing
efforts to incorporate community feedback and otherwise craft a
new Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2025–2029. The Committee
notes the tremendous opportunity for cross-NIH multidisciplinary
research into atopic dermatitis and other forms of eczema and en-
courages further efforts to coordinate with other institutes and cen-
ters to complement emerging NIAMS activities and to effectively
coordinate the overall research portfolio in atopic dermatitis.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION
DISORDERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $534,333,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 534,333,000
The Committee recommendation includes $534,333,000 for the

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $197,693,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 197,693,000
The Committee recommendation includes $197,693,000 for the
National Institute of Nursing Research [NINR]. Funding for NINR
is crucial for the advancement of nursing science, addressing the
nation’s critical health issues. Funding nursing research offers an
excellent return on investment, advancing the health of individuals
and communities while ensuring high-quality, cost-effective care
across lifespan.
Health Disparities Research.—The Committee continues to pro-
vide $10,000,000 for NINR to support research related to identi-
fying and reducing health disparities.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $595,318,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 595,318,000
The Committee recommendation includes $595,318,000 for the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA].
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders [FASD].—The Committee sup-
ports NIAAA efforts to accelerate FASD basic, prevention, diag-
nosis, and treatment research. The Committee encourages NIAAA
to continue efforts to support innovative research and to dissemi-
nate research findings to States, Tribes, and provider and non-prof-
it organizations in increasing FASD diagnostic capacity, enhancing
FASD prevention programs, developing resources for systems of
care, training services providers and professionals, and responding
to the needs of individuals. In addition, the Committee encourages
137
NIAAA to restore the FASD Center of Excellence to translate and
disseminate research to States, Tribes, and existing FASD affiliates
for the purpose of increasing diagnostic capacity, developing re-
sources for systems of care, training service providers and profes-
sionals, maintaining a clearinghouse and data-based directory, and
responding to the needs of individuals.
Reducing Alcohol Related Mortality.—The Committee is con-
cerned by the high rates of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related mor-
bidity and mortality in the United States. The Committee urges
NIAAA to continue supporting research on prevention programs
that focus on populations most affected by alcohol misuse and alco-
hol-related mortality. This research can include the development,
testing, and implementation of prevention interventions to reduce
alcohol misuse.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,662,695,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,662,695,000
The Committee recommendation includes $1,662,695,000 for the
National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA].
Alternative Clinical Trial Endpoints for Substance Use Dis-
orders.—Although there are effective medications for treating
opioid, tobacco, and alcohol use disorders, these treatments do not
work for everyone-and to date, no medications have been approved
by FDA to treat stimulant use disorders. The Committee therefore
encourages FDA and NIDA to collaborate on the establishment of
endpoints other than abstinence for use in clinical trials of medica-
tions to treat substance use disorders. Such alternative endpoints
may include reduced craving (defined as a strong desire or urge to
use drugs), reduced drug use, or reduced substance use disorder se-
verity. The Committee appreciates NIDA-funded research on using
alternative endpoints in clinical research on substance use dis-
orders, such as the recent finding that reduced drug use is associ-
ated with meaningful clinical improvements for people with stimu-
lant use disorders. The Committee urges FDA and NIDA to build
upon such research and work together toward incorporating alter-
native endpoints into clinical trials for substance use disorders.
Barriers to Research.—The Committee is concerned that restric-
tions associated with Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act
effectively limits the amount and type of research that can be con-
ducted on certain Schedule I drugs, especially opioids, psychedelics,
marijuana or its component chemicals, and new synthetic drugs
and analogs. At a time when we need as much information as pos-
sible about these drugs and antidotes for their harmful effects, we
should be addressing regulatory and other barriers to conducting
this research. The Committee appreciates NIDA’s completion of a
report on the barriers to research that result from the classification
of drugs and compounds as Schedule I substances including the
challenges researchers face as a result of limited access to sources
of marijuana, including dispensary products.
Cocaine Overdose Treatment.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the ‘‘fourth wave’’ of the drug addiction public health
crisis and the surge in overdose deaths involving stimulants, in-
cluding cocaine. The Committee recognizes that NIDA is
138
prioritizing research and development of treatments which can rap-
idly reverse cocaine toxicity and reduce mortality rates, addressing
the severe gap in this unmet medical need. Due to the unavail-
ability of an FDA-approved cocaine overdose reversal medication,
the Committee encourages NIDA to continue prioritization of addi-
tional research and development to advance a life-saving treatment
for overdoses caused by cocaine.
HEAL Initiative.—The Committee continues to be extremely con-
cerned about the epidemic of prescription opioids, heroin, and illicit
synthetic opioid use, addiction, and opioid overdose in the United
States and appreciates the important role that research plays in
the various Federal initiatives aimed at this crisis. The Committee
is also aware of the elevated number of opioid overdose deaths,
with the primary driver of these deaths involving synthetic opioids,
primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Approximately 220 people
die each day in this country from drug overdose (over 149 of those
involved opioids), making it one of the most common causes of non-
disease-related deaths for adolescents and young adults. To combat
this crisis, the Committee has provided within NIDA’s budget no
less than $365,295,000, for the Institute’s share of the HEAL Ini-
tiative and in response to elevated rates of stimulant use and drug
overdose involving stimulants. The Committee encourages NIDA to
continue research on the development of safe and effective medica-
tions and new formulations and combinations to treat substance
use disorders and prevent or reverse overdose, and to continue re-
search on comprehensive care models in communities nationwide to
prevent and treat opioid misuse and opioid use disorder, expanding
treatment capacity, enhancing access to overdose reversal medica-
tions for opioid use disorder, and improving addiction care; testing
interventions in justice system settings to expand the uptake of
medication treatment and methods to scale up these interventions;
and developing evidence-based strategies to integrate screening
and treatment for opioid use disorders in emergency department
and primary care settings. The Committee has included language
expanding the allowable use of these funds to include research re-
lated to stimulant use and addiction.
Investments in Basic Research.—The Committee is aware that
basic research is the foundation for clinical research, both of which
pave the way to new or improved treatments for substance use dis-
orders. Basic research can focus on the causal mechanisms under-
lying the functioning of the human body and provides a critical un-
derstanding of the short- and long-term impacts of drug use. The
discoveries that are made through basic research can often be
translated into improved patient care, including novel medications,
fewer drug-related fatalities, and science-based methods for pre-
venting substance use and substance use disorders. The Committee
encourages NIDA’s continued investments in investigator-initiated
grants in basic research and support for training of young inves-
tigators to ensure a healthy and growing population of researchers.
Methamphetamine and Other Stimulants.—The Committee is
concerned that, according to predicted provisional data released by
CDC, overdose deaths involving drugs in the categories that in-
clude methamphetamine and cocaine increased by 38 and 43 per-
cent respectively, in just 2 years. This sharp increase has led some
139
to refer to stimulant overdoses as the ‘‘fourth wave’’ of the current
drug overdose epidemic in America following the rise of opioid-re-
lated deaths involving prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl-re-
lated substances. No FDA-approved medications are available for
treating methamphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulant use dis-
orders. While there are currently approved medication treatments
for alcohol and opioid addiction, there remains no approved medica-
tion for methamphetamine addiction. The Committee urges NIDA
to continue its ongoing trials in order to expeditiously find and ap-
prove a medication for methamphetamines. The Committee con-
tinues to support NIDA’s efforts to address the opioid crisis, has
provided continued funding for the HEAL Initiative, and supports
NIDA’s efforts to combat the growing problem of methamphet-
amine and other stimulant use disorders and related deaths.
Overdose Reversal Drugs.—Recognizing the increasing severity of
the National opioid crisis and the need to better our options for re-
sponding to, treating, and preventing overdoses, the Committee en-
courages NIDA to prioritize research to expedite treatments for and
prevention of overdose from fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and other
emerging substances.
Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in
Drug Use and Addiction Prevention and Treatment.—Education is
a critical component of any effort to curb drug use and addiction,
and it must target every segment of society, including healthcare
providers (doctors, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists), patients,
and families. Medical professionals must be in the forefront of ef-
forts to curb the opioid crisis. The Committee continues to be
pleased with the NIDAMED initiative, targeting physicians-in-
training, including medical students and resident physicians in pri-
mary care specialties (e.g., internal medicine, family practice, emer-
gency medicine, and pediatrics). The Committee encourages NIDA
to continue to provide clinical resources to providers to help iden-
tify and treat patients with substance use disorder.
Safe Prescribing.—The Committee encourages NIDA to continue
to expand efforts to research and educate physicians and other
medical professionals about safe prescribing practices for pain and
managing patients who abuse prescription opioids, as well as best
practices for incorporating substance misuse and addiction screen-
ing and treatment into their clinical practices.
Youth E–Cigarette Use.—The Committee is aware of alarming
trends in youth electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) use and recent
survey data from CDC indicating that more than 10 percent of high
school students and 4.6 percent of middle school students reported
using e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days in 2023. The Committee
understands that e-cigarettes and other vaporizing equipment re-
main popular among adolescents, and requests that NIDA continue
to fund research on the use and consequences of using these de-
vices. The Committee is pleased that NIDA continues to support
the Monitoring the Future survey and the Population Assessment
of Tobacco and Health Study, which provide timely data on tobacco
products and other drug use. Finally, with more than 4 million
young people using e-cigarettes, there is a greater need for re-
search into therapeutic options for nicotine cessation among youth
who have developed addiction to nicotine. The Committee encour-
140
ages NIDA to continue supporting research to develop therapies,
including both pharmacologic and behavioral therapies, to combat
nicotine addiction in pediatric populations.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,187,843,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,193,843,000
The Committee recommendation includes $2,193,843,000 for the
National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH]. This amount includes
$70,028,000, an increase of $6,000,000 for the BRAIN Initiative.
Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD].—The Committee encourages
NIH to support greater investment in research on autism, particu-
larly in areas outlined in the Interagency Autism Coordinating
Committee’s [IACC] Strategic Plan for ASD, and directs NIH to en-
sure that all research activities for autism follow widely-accepted
scientific practices in order to ensure research integrity. The Com-
mittee encourages NIH to support greater investment in research,
particularly in areas outlined in the IACC Strategic Plan for ASD,
and directs NIH to ensure that all research activities for autism
follow widely-accepted scientific practices in order to ensure re-
search integrity. In addition, the Autism CARES Act of 2024 (Pub-
lic Law 118–80) included several new directives that the NIH is di-
rected to implement. These include releasing an annual budget es-
timate for autism research for fiscal year 2026 based on the IACC
Strategic Plan, ensuring research efforts reflect the entire popu-
lation of individuals with ASD, and creating a new process for the
public to obtain information on all existing and planned autism re-
search activities as well as allowing the public to provide com-
ments. Pursuant to the Autism CARES Act of 2024, the Committee
also directs the prompt re-establishment of the IACC and that
among the non-public members, directs that the Secretary appoints
experienced, leading licensed and board-certified researchers in the
field of ASD.
Mental Health Research.—In recognition of the country’s unprec-
edented mental health crisis, the Committee supports funding for
mental health research. This funding is provided to support re-
search focused on developing targeted prevention of and treatment
for mental illness. The Committee urges NIMH to accelerate better
diagnostics, improved therapeutics and behavioral treatments, and
enhanced precision of mental healthcare; continue to develop a new
Precision Psychiatry Initiative; and support studies of social me-
dia’s impact on mental health. The Committee supports NIMH ef-
forts to launch a new depression biomarker development effort to
guide treatment decisions for major depression and identify re-
search gaps and opportunities for understanding relationships
among social media behavior, social media engagement, and youth
mental health. These initiatives will combine innovative physio-
logical and behavioral methods to better predict patient prognosis
and optimize treatment. In addition, the Committee continues to be
concerned about the effects of the COVID–19 pandemic on mental
and behavioral health and encourages NIMH to support research
into the impacts of the pandemic on mental health.
Peer Support for Youth.—The Committee understands that many
youth who are struggling with their mental health seek out peer
141
support services, often because they are not ready to engage or do
not have access to clinical healthcare. But while numerous studies
have shown that peer support increases help-seeking behavior and
reduces social isolation in adults, research on youth peer support
services and peer-to-peer counseling programs is limited. Therefore,
the Committee encourages NIMH to prioritize research in these
areas, including how to scale up such services and programs effec-
tively. In addition, the Committee encourages NIMH to continue to
regularly hear from young people to inform its future research pri-
orities through its Advisory Council, strategic planning process,
focus groups or similar leadership methods. The Committee sup-
ports the agency’s existing youth-informed activities and encour-
ages additional efforts to grow youth engagement in setting its re-
search priorities and carrying out participatory research.
Serious Mental Illness.—The Committee encourages NIMH to ex-
pand research into metabolic interventions for serious mental ill-
nesses, including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and
schizophrenia. The Committee encourages NIMH to investigate the
fundamental link between metabolic function and psychiatric ill-
ness, as well as the study of the prevention, treatment, and rever-
sal of serious mental illness through metabolic therapies. This in-
cludes support for large-scale clinical trials investigating nutri-
tional ketosis, with a focus on identifying predictive neurobiological
and metabolic biomarkers, optimizing patient stratification, and de-
veloping best practice clinical guidelines. Research should encom-
pass multimodal data collection, including neuroimaging, genetics,
and cellular biology, with an emphasis on translational science that
informs personalized treatment and advances understanding of un-
derlying disease mechanisms.
Suicide Prevention.—The Committee recognizes that suicide a
complex, and serious public health problem with multiple contrib-
uting factors, including biological, psychological, social, and envi-
ronmental. The Committee encourages NIMH to direct additional
attention to suicide prevention research across all of these areas,
as well as the application of novel measurement techniques, statis-
tical analysis, digital initiatives and information systems. The
Committee also encourages NIMH to promote greater collaboration
with other NIH Institutes and Centers with expertise in research
areas that can contribute to suicide prevention, especially NIA,
NICHD, NHGRI, NIAAA and NIDA. The Committee requests an
update on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.

gram in accelerating the innovation and commercialization of
COVID–19 diagnostic technologies. The Committee appreciates
NIBIB’s efforts to expand the innovation funnel model beyond
COVID–19 testing to address other critical unmet needs in diag-
nostic testing and other biomedical technologies and encourages
NIBIB to continue these efforts in fiscal year 2026 in consultation
with other institutes and centers, including but not limited to
NHLBI, NIAID, NICHD, NIA, NINDS, and NIMH. The Committee
further directs NIBIB to provide an update in the fiscal year 2027
CJ on progress of these efforts.

port research into non-pharmacological treatments for pain man-
agement and urges NCCIH, along with DOD and VA, to continue
to support research, including comorbidities such as opioid misuse,
abuse, and disorder among military personnel, veterans, and their
families. The Committee urges NIH, VA, and DOD to expand re-
search on non-pharmacological treatments for veterans and service
members.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $534,395,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 534,395,000
The Committee recommendation includes $534,395,000 for the
National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities
[NIMHD].
Improving Native American Cancer Outcomes.—The Committee
notes that Native Americans experience overall cancer incidence
and mortality rates that are strikingly higher than non-Native pop-
ulations. The Committee includes $6,000,000, for the Initiative for
Improving Native American Cancer Outcomes to support efforts in-
cluding research, education, outreach, and clinical access related to
cancer in Native American populations. The Committee further di-
rects NIMHD to work with NCI to locate this Initiative at an NCI-
designated cancer center demonstrating partnerships with Indian
Tribes, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations to im-
prove the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancers among
Native Americans, particularly those living in rural communities.
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Health Research Office.—The
Committee recognizes the Federal trust responsibility to Native
Hawaiians and the unique health challenges facing the Native Ha-
waiian and Pacific Islander community. The Committee also ac-
143
knowledges that there is limited health research on this commu-
nity, relative to other populations, particularly that disaggregates
between different subpopulations. The Committee includes
$4,000,000, for the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Health Re-
search Office. The Committee encourages collaboration across Insti-
tutes and with the community, including research institutions with
expertise and researcher representation from the NHPI commu-
nity.
Research Centers at Minority Institutions [RCMI] Program.—The
Committee recognizes the longstanding contributions of the RCMI
program in improving the health of all Americans, originally estab-
lished in 1985 by this subcommittee, and as directed in 42 U.S.C.
241 and 284, amended by 42 U.S.C. 201. The RCMI program
strengthens research capacity and infrastructure at minority-serv-
ing institutions, identifies differential outcomes for minority popu-
lations, and provides training and mentoring. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs NIH to maintain funding for RCMI grantees, par-
ticularly institutions serving rural, underserved, and geographi-
cally isolated populations. The Committee encourages NIMHD to
adjust the RCMI annual per-institution NIH funding threshold for
inflation. The Committee directs NIMHD to submit a report within
90 days of enactment regarding the implementation of this ad-
justed eligibility criterion for RCMI, its impact on the pool of eligi-
ble institutions, and how this criterion is applied to eligibility for
other NIMHD programs.
Research Endowment Program.—The Committee is pleased with
NIMHD’s reinvigoration of the Research Endowment Program and
recent investments in the program. The Committee urges NIMHD
to increase funding available to existing grantees and continue to
expand and assist eligible institutions receiving grants with this
additional funding through a competitive process.
JOHN E. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCED STUDY IN
THE HEALTH SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $95,162,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 95,162,000
The Committee provides $95,162,000 for the Fogarty Inter-
national Center [FIC].
Fogarty International Center [FIC].—The Committee recognizes
the need to support resources for FIC for its work in strengthening
health research systems, training infectious disease researchers,
and improving pandemic preparedness in low- and middle-income
countries [LMICs]. FIC supports cross-cutting research and re-
search training programs that apply to a broad range of health
threats, enabling grantees and trainees to anticipate and respond
effectively to new global challenges. Programs within FIC support
training for researchers in the development and use of powerful
tools such as data science, mobile health, and bioinformatics, which
are applied to anticipating and controlling a wide range of global
health threats that could impact the United States. The Committee
encourages FIC to continue to expand training and research part-
nerships with schools and programs of public health and related
academic institutions in support of this core mission. In addition,
the Committee supports expanding FIC’s role in pandemic pre-
144
paredness and research capacity building, including by strength-
ening international coordination, increasing capacity for computa-
tional modeling and outbreak analytics, and supporting research to
reduce health disparities and improve implementation of health
interventions in low-resource settings.
Global Infectious Disease Research Training Program.—The
Committee recognizes that building a critical mass of researchers
in developing countries is essential to controlling infectious dis-
eases. Such researchers are key to generating new strategies for
disease prevention and treatment. Therefore, the Committee urges
FIC to prioritize funding for the Global Infectious Disease Research
Training Program.
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $497,548,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 497,548,000
The Committee provides $497,548,000 for the National Library of
Medicine [NLM].
Data Initiative.—The Committee supports the transformation of
NLM from its traditional role as a repository of data and research
results to one where it serves as an active hub coordinating the use
of ever-expanding data resources and facilitates researcher access
to advanced analytics, including artificial intelligence and machine
learning techniques. The Committee encourages NLM to expand
the data storage capabilities and datasets necessary to establish a
federated biomedical research data sharing infrastructure that fea-
tures a centralized catalog of data holdings and use models to ad-
vance information science, analytics, and data science, and support
the application of artificial intelligence in biomedical research.
NLM is directed to provide an update on these efforts within 120
days of enactment.
Epitranscriptomics Database Standards.—The Committee recog-
nizes the recent release of the National Academies of Sciences, En-
gineering, and Medicine [NASEM] report ‘‘Charting a Future for
Sequencing RNA and Its Modifications’’ in March 2024. The Com-
mittee notes the report’s recommendation that clear and consistent
standards for data and databases need to be established to facili-
tate data access and sharing. Given that NLM’s National Center
for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] collaborates with the sci-
entific community to support development of standards for data-
bases and biological nomenclature, among other responsibilities,
the Committee urges NCBI to support the establishment of data
and database standards for epitranscriptomics in collaboration with
the scientific community consistent with the NASEM report rec-
ommendation, and include an update on this effort in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ.
NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $928,323,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 938,323,000
The Committee provides $938,323,000, an increase of
$10,000,000, for the National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences [NCATS].
145
Clinical and Translational Science Awards [CTSA] Program.—
The Committee provides $629,560,000 for the CTSA program, the
same as the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Well-resourced and fully
supported U-awards form the backbone of the CTSA program and
any ongoing changes to grants and awards mechanism for CTSAs
should maintain this focus to ensure hubs continue to have flexi-
bility and stability, as well as thrive and provide an effective core
that drives this critical national network forward, including devel-
oping localized partnerships, and effectively training the next gen-
eration of researchers while enhancing research capacity. The Com-
mittee reiterates that NCATS should continue to support at least
60 sites and that any hub that successfully recompetes for funding
should continue to receive at least 95 percent of its previous level
of support, if such an amount is requested. U-awards should con-
tinue to form the primary base of support so that hubs have flexi-
bility and stability, can continue to develop localized partnerships,
and can effectively train the next generation of researchers while
enhancing research capacity. While the Committee recognizes op-
tional funding opportunities which were previously incorporated
into the prior single application offer a higher level of institutional
funding support, NCATS must ensure these opportunities do not
diffuse the focus of CTSAs and create challenges to ongoing na-
tional collaborative. The Committee also notes the work of the
IDeA Clinical and Translational Research centers and urges in-
creased collaboration between these programs.
Collaboration with Business Incubators.—The Committee com-
mends NCATS for working with grantees to leverage its mission by
including nonprofit business incubators that host small to mid-size
life science, research, and biotechnology companies that use serv-
ice-based approaches to nurture and guide their member companies
to success. The Committee urges NCATS to continue proactive out-
reach to redouble its efforts to leverage its mission by exploring op-
portunities or potential collaborations with business incubators
that host small to midsize science, research and pharmaceutical
companies that use service-based approaches to nurture and guide
their member companies to success. The Committee encourages
NCATS to continue to use Administrative Supplements to existing
CTSA contracts to fulfill this objective.
Community-led Health Research/Community partnerships or
ComPASS program.—The Committee applauds NIH for its efforts
to directly fund community organizations to create and test inter-
ventions in partnership with academic researchers who codesign
interventions to improve people’s health, well-being, and quality of
life. The Committee is concerned about the abrupt termination of
this program and encourages the NIH director to reevaluate and
reinvest in the ComPASS and other similar initiatives.
Cures Acceleration Network [CAN].—The Committee continues to
provide $75,000,000 for the CAN to reduce barriers between re-
search discovery and clinical trials.
Full Spectrum of Medical Research.—The Committee applauds
NIH efforts to support and advance the full spectrum of medical re-
search, which ensures breakthroughs in basic science are trans-
lated into therapies and diagnostic tools that benefit patient care
while disseminating cutting-edge information to the professional
146
community. The Committee notes the importance of flagship initia-
tives, including the CTSA program, to these important efforts.
National Clinical Cohort Collaborative [N3C].—The Committee
continues to support N3C’s open-science, privacy-preserving data-
sharing platform to accelerate biomedical research and discovery.
Supported by the CTSA Program, N3C links de-identified electronic
health record data with other types of data such as imaging, mor-
tality, and Medicare and Medicaid data from CMS to answer key
research questions on a variety of diseases, with two diseases being
piloted. The Committee supports the continuation of N3C and en-
courages NCATS to continue coordinating with other HHS agencies
to make N3C available as an underlying common real-world data
platform to drive faster discovery across a range of diseases and
maximize the Federal research investment by creating a reusable
data infrastructure. Within 1 year of enactment, the Committee re-
quests NCATS provide a 5-year strategic plan and recommenda-
tions for expanding the N3C platform.
Rare Disease Research.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant impacts NCATS has in addressing rare disease, directly fund-
ing research that resulted in 55 Investigational New Drugs and 14
approved therapies, and provides a $10,000,000 increase for rare
disease research. The Committee encourages NCATS to leverage
the investments made in NCATS rare disease research to accel-
erate the development of new treatments for the 95 percent of rare
diseases with no approved treatment, to strengthen the innovation
of diagnostics to shorten the average 5 year-long diagnostic odys-
sey, and to lower the nearly $1,000,000,000,000 annual economic
burden of rare diseases. The Committee urges NCATS to increase
funding for rare disease research, helping to grow the newly cre-
ated Division of Rare Diseases Research Innovation and accelerate
the development of new treatments. Finally, the Committee notes
that 11 NCATS’ Rare Disease Clinical Research Network [RDCRN]
renewal grant applications were terminated in April 2025 due to
implementation of a new NIH foreign subaward policy. This deci-
sion jeopardizes more than a decade of progress in clinical trials,
natural history research, and the development of clinical care
guidelines for rare diseases that impact thousands of patients en-
rolled in these studies. The Committee notes that on June 5, 2025,
NIH issued the grant opportunity PAR–25–438 to allow affected
consortia to reapply for funding to be awarded in fiscal year 2025.
The Committee is concerned that NIH has not awarded these
grants, and that funding for these consortia will expire in Sep-
tember 2025. Therefore, within 30 days of enactment and monthly
thereafter, the Committee directs NIH to provide a briefing to the
Committees on Appropriations on efforts to award RDCRN grants
that were submitted in response to PAR–25–438 until funding has
been awarded.
Translational Science.—The Committee recognizes the important
work of NCATS-funded CTSAs in supporting innovation and job
creation. The Committee also understands that many commercially
promising and potentially lifesaving inventions from CTSAs are
often translated into FDA-approved and commercially available
products. The Committee understands that there can be limitations
in commercialization knowledge and resources available. The Com-
147
mittee therefore urges NCATS to continue to work with CTSAs to
provide opportunities to translate research.
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,605,514,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,460,514,000
The Committee provides $2,460,514,000 for the Office of the Di-
rector [OD]. Within this total, $572,401,000 is provided for the
Common Fund, and $12,600,000 is included for the Gabriella Miller
Kids First Research Act (Public Law 113–94).
ADRD Clinical Trial Diversity/Health Equity.—The Committee
recommends that NIH fund or conduct Black/African American-,
Latino/Hispanic- and women- only research studies to better under-
stand the underlying etiology of cognitive impairment and demen-
tia in these groups that have disproportionately higher prevalence
of disease.
Advancing Clinical Trials Through Subawards.—The Committee
is concerned about the impact of the Administration’s policy to pro-
hibit scientists from directing any funding to international research
partners and the impact on clinical trials and human subjects re-
search. Pediatric cancer, rare disease, HIV and infectious disease
research rely on clinical trial participants and biospecimens from
foreign countries in order to aggregate enough samples or patients
for robust research. The Committee directs NIH to allow reim-
bursements and other funding arrangements with research part-
ners abroad to foster pediatric cancer, rare disease, HIV and infec-
tious disease research.
Advisory Councils.—Advisory councils are a fundamental part of
NIH’s grant making process. The Committee notes that NIH re-
cently disbanded or terminated several of its advisory councils and
boards established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act
[FACA] to provide advice and recommendations to the NIH Direc-
tor, Institute and Center [IC] Directors, and senior scientific staff.
This includes the Advisory Committee to the Director [ACD], sev-
eral IC advisory councils, and many other special emphasis panels
and study section review groups, all of which are part of NIH’s
grant making process. The Committee notes that the process for se-
lecting members on FACA Committees is rigorous and time con-
suming, usually requiring 2 years of screening candidates through
a series of background and ethics checks, formally nominating
them, and seeking agency and Department approval. Within 30
days of enactment, the Committee directs NIH to brief the Commit-
tees on Appropriations on the status of NIH’s FACA advisory coun-
cils and boards. Such briefing shall include a detailed list of every
NIH FACA advisory council, board, committee, special emphasis
panel, and study section that has been terminated, disbanded, or
had its members dismissed since December 2024, and a justifica-
tion for each instance. The Committee also directs the NIH Direc-
tor to provide a separate briefing to the Committees on Appropria-
tions on the disbanding of the ACD, and the selection criteria ap-
plied to select new members. Finally, within 90 days of enactment,
NIH is directed to provide a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations regarding the agency’s plan to reconstitute its FACA Ad-
148
visory Councils, particularly any IC Advisory Councils that have
been disbanded or terminated.
Advancing Novel Alternative Methods Research.—The Committee
is encouraged by many of the insights and recommendations of the
Advisory Committee to the Director [ACD] Working Group on Cata-
lyzing the Development and Use of Novel Alternative Methods
[NAMs] to Advance Biomedical Research, detailed in the December
2023 Report to the ACD and accepted by NIH in February 2024.
The Committee acknowledges that NAMs complement under-
standing of human biology and advance human health. Within 18
months of enactment, NIH is urged to publish a report on the allo-
cation of funds specifically designated for research utilizing alter-
natives to animal testing. This report should include an estimate
of the total amount of funding directed towards alternative re-
search methods, the number of funded projects that use alternative
methods, examples of the specific types of alternatives funded, and
examples of research initiatives and their outcomes, including but
not limited to publications, patents, or advances in non-animal
testing methodologies. NIH shall ensure that this report is made
available to the public via NIH’s website and shall ensure the data
is presented in a user-friendly format. NIH is encouraged to add
a new Research, Condition, and Disease, Categorization [RCDC] in
fiscal year 2026 to track NIH spending on NAMs.
Alcohol and Polysubstance Misuse Research.—The Committee is
pleased to see NIH supporting research on alcohol and
polysubstance use, and urges the Director to continue to support
research in this area across the United States. Given the increas-
ing prevalence of polysubstance-involved overdose deaths, particu-
larly among rural and minority communities, the Committee also
encourages the Director to support studies in rural and minority
communities with high rates of mortality involving alcohol and
polysubstance use.
All of Us Research Program.—The Committee provides
$31,000,000 for the All of Us Research Program.
ALS Research, Treatments, and Expanded Access.—The Com-
mittee provides a $25,000,000 increase for ALS research within
NINDS to reduce the burdens of people with ALS as quickly as
possible. It is crucial for people living with ALS and people diag-
nosed with ALS in the future, that NIH dramatically grows its ALS
portfolio and the research workforce with additional grant funding
and increases its focus on research that will lead to measurable
changes in the lives of people living with ALS. The Committee di-
rects NIH to handle funding of expanded access grants as author-
ized by the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies [ACT] for ALS
(Public Law 117–79) as separate, not competitive with, funding for
other research on ALS and includes $100,000,000 for this purpose.
Expanded Access Grants support scientific research utilizing data
from expanded access to investigational drugs for people with ALS
who are not eligible for clinical trials. The Committee requests
NINDS include ALS clinics across the country in an ALS Clinical
Research Network to increase capacity for research utilizing data
from expanded access and other clinical research at geographically
distributed sites. The Committee continues to direct NINDS and
OD to brief the Committees prior to any execution of expanded ac-
149
cess grants or programmatic funding. Once awards are announced,
the Committee directs NINDS and OD to provide the Committees
with an explanation of the funded grants, including a clear break-
down of what the funding is to be used for. Furthermore, after the
review and awards of meritorious applications under section 2, the
Committee directs NIH to apply any unused funds to programs au-
thorized under ACT for ALS including section 3 public-private re-
search partnership. Finally, if sufficient eligible applications are
not received, or NINDS has any reason to believe any funding
should lapse, the ICs are directed to notify the Committees on Ap-
propriations prior to notifications of awards. This notification shall
include: (1) a detailed explanation as to why applications cannot be
funded; (2) the technical assistance provided to applicants to assist
them in submitting eligible grant applications; and (3) a proposed
plan to award funding for other ALS research identified by the
NIH ALS Strategic Priorities prior to the end of the fiscal year.
Alzheimer’s Disease [ADRD] and Parkinson’s [PD].—The Com-
mittee strongly encourages NIA and NINDS to expand the use of
fiscal year 2026 and beyond AD/ADRD funding to fund projects
studying dementia in PD. PD is the second most common and fast-
est growing neurodegenerative disease globally and is characterized
by the abnormal folding of a protein in the brain, which is similar
to what typically occurs in AD/ADRD. Channeling additional re-
sources into research could help to unlock groundbreaking demen-
tia-relevant discoveries in crucial areas like PD and other closely
associated neurological disorders.
Article Processing Charges for NIH–Funded Research.—The Com-
mittee commends NIH for building on prior public access and data-
sharing reforms to initiate a process to address rising Article Proc-
essing Charges [APCs] that scientific journal publishers often
charge NIH-supported scientists to publish the findings of their
federally-funded research. NIH, and the scientists it funds, must be
good stewards of taxpayer dollars and obtain as much research
value as possible from limited resources. The Committee directs
NIH to work with the scientific community to inform development
of an APC allowable charge limit and, as part of that process, to:
account for different publishing models, particularly U.S.based pub-
lishers focused on rigorous peer review and quality checks; support
a robust American scientific research and publishing enterprise
amid unprecedented global competition; and support the aims of
gold standard science by establishing parameters to guard against
potential abuses, including payment of APCs to journals that don’t
prioritize research quality and integrity. Within 90 days of enact-
ment, NIH is directed to brief the Committee on these efforts and
its work to engage scientific journals on reasonable, sustainable
APCs moving forward.
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning [AI/ML].—The Com-
mittee provides $135,000,000 for the Office of Data Science Strat-
egy to support NIH’s efforts to build capacity to leverage AI, ML
and data science to accelerate the pace of biomedical innovation.
The Committee encourages NIH to continue expanding the applica-
tion of AI, ML, and data science across its research portfolio. The
application of AI methods in biomedicine offer promising new ap-
proaches to screen for, detect, and diagnose health conditions, pre-
150
dict disease risk and progression, improve drug discovery, and opti-
mize precision care for patients. However, the AI/ML research field
lacks diversity in its researchers as well as in the data sets that
it uses. Furthermore, new techniques are needed to incorporate
ethics and trustworthiness into the design of new models. These
gaps pose a risk of creating and continuing harmful biases in how
AI/ML is used, how algorithms are developed and trained, and how
findings are interpreted, ultimately leading to continued health dis-
parities and inequities. The Committee supports efforts to increase
diversity in AI/ML, including accelerating grants awarded through
NIH’s AI/ML Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Re-
searcher Diversity [AIM–AHEAD] program. The Committee sup-
ports the memorandum of understanding [MOU] between NIH and
the Department of Energy [DOE] focused on using advanced com-
puting, quantum, and AI/ML for biomedical research and data
sourcing. The Committee encourages NIH to continue coordinating
with DOE to accelerate advances in precision oncology and sci-
entific computing as part of the Cancer Moonshot program. The
Committee continues to support collaboration between NIH and
DOE to bring together biomedical scientists with computer sci-
entists and other data science experts. The Committee also sup-
ports NIH’s contributions to the National AI Research Resource
[NAIRR] and the creation of AI ready datasets for the research
community. The Committee encourages NIH to develop effective AI
education and training pathways for the health research workforce,
including trainees and senior scientists, to ensure the U.S. bio-
medical research workforce remains at the forefront of scientific
discovery. These training resources should support biomedical re-
searchers from diverse populations and backgrounds in the use of
AI technologies to efficiently, accurately, and meaningfully process
data for their research, as well as to participate in multi-discipli-
nary teams to develop new capabilities that advance biomedical AI.
The Committee urges NIH to continue enhancing its infrastructure
capabilities around data, computing, and software across the agen-
cy and within the research community. The Committee also urges
NIH to coordinate with relevant intergovernmental partners to
support this long-term mission.
Autism Research.—The Committee urges the Director to ensure
that fiscal year 2026 NIH spending on research on Autism Spec-
trum Disorders [ASDs] meets the authorized funding level set by
the Autism CARES Act of 2024, and ensure such research address-
es the underlying biology, including genetics, environmental factors
and their interaction, co-occurring medical conditions, and treat-
ment and services needs, and includes the entire population of indi-
viduals with ASD, including those with profound autism. In addi-
tion, the Committee is concerned by reports that the OD awarded
a noncompetitive, multi-million-dollar consulting contract for au-
tism research that resulted in the abrupt termination of NIH’s
Chief Operating Officer. Within 30 days of enactment, NIH is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committee on this incident. Such
report shall include the contract, statement of work, determination
and findings for the sole source justification, award decision docu-
mentation, and stop work order that was issued. Finally, the Com-
mittee notes that the Director’s proposed Autism Real World Data
151
Platform [RWDP] is nearly identical to a proposal for an Alz-
heimer’s Disease Research RWDP that was proposed in 2023 that
Congress expressed serious reservations about at that time. As a
result of its concerns regarding NIH’s ability to carry out an
RWDP, the Committee requested GAO conduct an audit of the pro-
posal. The explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year
2024 appropriations act urged NIH to pause funding any new
awards under the proposal until GAO published a report that was
underway but not yet completed, and to report to the Committees
every 30 days on any effort related to RWDP. GAO’s subsequent
July 2024 report (GAO–24–106886) found that NIH did not imple-
ment key leading practices for cost estimating and project manage-
ment for the RWDP. The report findings show that the cost esti-
mate for the RWDP is likely not accurate, comprehensive, or cred-
ible and that the proposal lacked a governance structure for achiev-
ing the project’s objectives or oversight. NIH then decided, at the
urging of Congress, to not move forward with that proposal. Given
this proposal is nearly identical to that, and NIH has never ad-
dressed the concerns with the earlier proposal, the Committee
strongly urges NIH to pause funding any awards for the Autism
RWDP and report to the Committee every 30 days after the date
of enactment of this act on any effort related to RWDP.
Biomedical Research Facilities.—The Committee continues to
provide $80,000,000 for grants to public and nonprofit entities to
expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or
construct new research facilities as authorized under section 404I
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283k). The Committee
urges NIH to make awards that are large enough to underwrite the
cost of a significant portion of newly constructed or renovated fa-
cilities. The Committee also encourages NIH to allocate no less
than 25 percent of funding for this program to institutions of
emerging excellence, that could include those in IDeA States, to en-
sure geographic and institutional diversity.
Biosecurity in Synthetic Nucleic Acid Synthesis.—The Committee
commends the multiple Federal efforts to advance the adoption of
strong biosecurity standards for synthetic biology technologies. NIH
and other agencies that fund life-sciences research are required to
establish that, as a requirement of funding, synthetic nucleic acid
procurement is conducted through providers or manufacturers that
adhere to the Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening.
Moreover, NIH should also explore approaches to encourage the
purchase of domestically produced synthetic genetic materials and
tools to protect U.S. intellectual property. The Committee requests
an update within 90 days of enactment on NIH’s ongoing work to
advance the adoption of strong biosecurity standards for synthetic
biology technologies.
Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies
[BRAIN] Initiative.—The Committee continues to support the
BRAIN Initiative which is revolutionizing our understanding of the
brain and fostering discoveries, collaborations, and partnerships
that will lead to treatments and cures for brain and central nerv-
ous system diseases, disorders, and injuries. The BRAIN Initiative
is an ambitious program to develop and apply new tools and tech-
nologies to answer fundamental questions about the brain and ulti-
152
mately to inspire new treatments. The BRAIN Initiative promotes
scientific advances that provide opportunities to understand the
structure and function of the brain at an unprecedented level of de-
tail, helping bring advanced treatments for brain disorders to clin-
ical use and paving the way for tools that will fundamentally trans-
form and improve the future of biomedical research. The Com-
mittee provides a $12,000,000 increase for the BRAIN Initiative.
The Committee requests a briefing on the BRAIN Initiative about
the progress and achievements of the key projects and studies it is
supporting with these funds by reporting on their objectives and
anticipated/actual outcomes within 90 days of enactment.
Cell and Gene Therapies.—Newly approved cell and gene thera-
pies provide enormous promise for patients with conditions ranging
from various cancers such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma to
inherited blood disorders like hemophilia, sickle cell disease and
beta thalassemia. Long-term data from clinical trials and real
world experience are needed for researchers, practitioners, and pa-
tients to understand the long-term effects and potential toxicities
associated with these therapies. The Committee encourages NIH to
explore these issues by holding a workshop with the relevant Fed-
eral agency representatives, including FDA and NIH, and expert
stakeholders on this topic and requests an update in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Cephalopod Research.—The Committee recognizes that there are
no federally required welfare standards for the use of cephalopods
in federally-funded research because all invertebrate animals are
excluded from the Public Health Service [PHS] Policy on the Hu-
mane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, which provides certain
welfare standards for vertebrate animals. The Committee recog-
nizes that implementing and complying with the PHS Policy re-
quires reference to guidelines in the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals [the Guide], which does not currently in-
clude cephalopod-specific welfare guidelines, and updates to which
are overseen by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine [NASEM]. The Committee also recognizes that re-
searchers must still justify their use and numbers when proposing
research seeking NIH funding. The Committee acknowledges that
other countries have established oversight requirements for
cephalopods when used in government-funded research. The Com-
mittee encourages NIH to consider developing guidance for the hu-
mane care and use of cephalopods in NIH-supported research, in-
cluding possibly expanding the definition of ‘‘animal’’ in the PHS
Policy to include cephalopods.
Childhood Post-Infectious Neuroimmune Disorders/PANS/PAN-
DAS.—The Committee is concerned that although NIH supports re-
search on Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome
[PANS] and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders As-
sociated with Streptococcus [PANDAS], significantly more needs to
be done. Understanding the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of
these life-threatening diseases is essential to expedite early identi-
fication and intervention, thereby reducing the risk of chronic ill-
ness and associated costs to families, school systems, healthcare
systems, and insurers. PANS/PANDAS research also would further
the understanding of the critical link between neuropsychiatric ill-
153
ness and COVID–19 and other infections. The Committee encour-
ages NIH to continue to prioritize research on PANS/PANDAS and
related to autoimmune encephalitic conditions, and requests an up-
date in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Chimpanzees.—The Committee is pleased that NIH has relocated
the remaining chimps from Holloman Air Force Base in
Alamogordo, New Mexico to Chimp Haven. The Committee under-
scores the importance of compliance with Public Law 106–551, the
Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection
Act, which mandates the retirement of chimpanzees owned or sup-
ported by the Federal Government to appropriate sanctuary care.
The Committee directs NIH to submit a report to the Committee
no later than 180 days after enactment regarding the chimpanzees
transferred from Alamogordo Primate Facility at Holloman Air
Force Base in New Mexico to the Chimp Haven sanctuary in Lou-
isiana. The report shall include a complete accounting of the num-
ber of chimpanzees relocated; the dates of transport and mode of
transportation used; information on the health status of each chim-
panzee prior to transport; a detailed summary of any health com-
plications, injuries, or deaths that occurred during or after the relo-
cation, including the cause(s) of any such outcomes; an assessment
of the current health and wellbeing of the transferred chimpanzees
at Chimp Haven; any additional measure NIH and its contractors
have taken or plan to take to ensure the safe and humane trans-
port of federally owned chimpanzees in the future.
Common Data Elements [CDEs].—The Committee applauds the
Office of Data Science Strategy for issuing a request for informa-
tion [RFI] to stakeholders focused on developing CDEs and for con-
vening a workshop on this topic. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of CDEs in facilitating research activities and fostering
collaboration amongst the research and healthcare communities.
CDEs are instrumental in standardizing data collection, enhancing
data quality, and enabling more effective data sharing and anal-
ysis, particularly in complex areas such as autoimmune and im-
mune-mediated diseases. The Committee encourages NIH to build
upon the RFI and workshop and to develop a plan to work with
stakeholders, particularly in the autoimmune and immune-mediate
communities, to develop and advance the use of CDEs.
Common Data Elements for Women’s Health.—The Committee
recognizes the continued need to develop common data elements
[CDEs] related to women’s health that will help researchers share
and combine datasets, promote interoperability, and improve the
accuracy of datasets when it comes to women’s health. The Com-
mittee encourages the Office of Data Science Strategy [ODSS] to
collaborate with the Office of Research on Women’s Health
[ORWH] and Institutes and Centers to prepare a roadmap for de-
veloping new NIH-endorsed CDEs to capture more data about
women’s health in both research and clinical settings. In addition,
the Committee urges NIH to launch a data resource to better co-
ordinate and integrate investments in women’s health research
across NIH. The Committee encourages ODSS and ORWH to en-
gage outside stakeholders, including professional societies and pa-
tient organizations, in this work, as appropriate. NIH is directed to
154
provide an update on relevant activities within 90 days of enact-
ment.
Common Fund.—The Committee acknowledges the role of the
NIH Common Fund in advancing biomedical research and fostering
innovative research collaborations across various NIH Institutes,
Centers, and Offices to catalyze discovery across all biomedical re-
search, and to create a space where investigators and multiple NIH
Institutes, Centers, and Offices collaborate to address scientific
challenges and opportunities that are high-priority for NIH as a
whole. The Committee encourages the Common Fund to consider
establishing an RNA Project [RNOME] to support this work. The
Committee requests an update on Common Fund projects in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Compensation for Trainees and Early Career Researchers.—The
Committee appreciates that the future of U.S. economic competi-
tiveness and our Nation’s ability to address national, economic, and
health security threats depends on sustaining a robust STEM
workforce. Ensuring individuals from communities that are under-
represented in the STEM field can enter and sustain a career as
part of the STEM workforce is essential to strengthening the re-
search workforce going forward. The Committee is deeply con-
cerned that entrenched financial barriers are increasingly deterring
graduate and postdoctoral students, particularly those from under-
represented communities, from pursuing STEM careers. The lack of
Cost-of-Living Adjustments [COLAs] can make it financially unre-
alistic for postdoctoral scholars to accept positions, particularly in
high-cost areas; areas in which academic medical centers are lo-
cated. The Committee commends NIH for proposing meaningful in-
creases in stipends for postdoctoral scholars. These increases take
a significant step towards returning National Research Service
Awards [NRSA] to their inflation-adjusted pre-pandemic levels and
brings the agency closer to offering real dollar increases in the sti-
pend of early career researchers that are needed to ensure a strong
STEM workforce.
Denying Foreign Access to Americans’ Sensitive Health Data.—
The Committee is concerned that NIH does not have proper proto-
cols to restrict the ability of foreign adversaries from accessing sen-
sitive data within NIH databases. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Director, within 30 days of enactment, to report on its proc-
esses to maintain, update, publish and implement user authentica-
tion protocols to restrict the ability for foreign adversary entities,
as defined in 15 CFR section 7.4, to access the databases.
Developmental Delays.—The Committee continues to provide
$10,000,000 for research on developmental delays, including speech
and language delays in infants and toddlers, characterizing speech
and language development and outcomes in infants and toddlers
through early adolescence. The Committee urges NIH to support
research which may include longitudinal studies, translation of re-
search into clinical practice, and novel approaches to study children
with speech and language delays to provide parents, teachers, pedi-
atricians, and other caregivers with the information they need to
help late talking children grow and thrive in school and other so-
cial environments.
155
Diet and Chronic Disease Research.—The Committee commends
NIH for convening a scientific workshop in August 2024 that ex-
plored the role food and diet play in developing mucosal immunity
for conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and other
digestive and autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases. The Com-
mittee is also aware of the increasing interest in research focused
on preventing Inflammatory Bowel Disease including research on
environmental and dietary factors that may trigger these condi-
tions. The Committee urges NIH to build upon these activities
across NIH and consider opportunities to better coordinate ongoing
and emerging efforts through a Food is Medicine Network or Cen-
ters of Excellence program.
Emerging Technologies.—The Committee commends NIH for
seeking new mechanisms to partner with other Federal agencies,
such as its partnership with the National Science Foundation on
emerging technologies such as quantum information sciences and
quantum technologies, bioengineering and synthetic biology, artifi-
cial intelligence, and digital twins. As these programs are devel-
oped, the agencies are encouraged to find mechanisms to continue
activities at the intersections of robotics, biomechanics, disabilities,
and chronic pain. The National Robotics Initiative supported these
efforts and now that it has sunsetted the agencies should ensure
new mechanisms to foster collaboration between biomedical re-
searchers and engineers, computer and physical scientists, and
other disciplines to ensure progress on critical health challenges
are considered.
Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes [ECHO].—
The Committee includes $180,000,000, for the ECHO program.
ECHO currently funds the Navajo Birth Cohort Study. The Com-
mittee encourages expanding the study to include a larger rep-
resentation of Navajo children in the cohort to allow for a better
understanding of the impacts of environmental exposure in the
Navajo Nation.
Expanding Support for Young Investigators.—NIH has been criti-
cized for funding too many late career scientists while funding too
few early career scientists with new ideas. The Committee is con-
cerned that the average age of first-time R01 funded investigators
remains 42 years old. More than twice as many R01 grants are
awarded to investigators over 65 than to those under 36 years old.
The Committee appreciates NIH’s efforts to provide support for
early-career researchers through several dedicated initiatives, in-
cluding the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award, Next Generation
Researchers Initiative, Stephen Katz award, and the NIH Pathway
to Independence Award. The Committee encourages NIH to con-
tinue supporting these important initiatives and to expand support
for early career researchers by increasing the number of award re-
cipients for these programs in future years. The Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122) directed NIH to pro-
vide a ‘‘professional judgement’’ budget to the Committee to grow
and retain the early career investigator pool, accelerate earlier re-
search independence, and ensure the long term sustainability of
the biomedical research enterprise. Building off of these efforts, the
Committee directs NIH to provide an update on the activities to
grow and retain early career investigators.
156
Facilities and Administrative Costs [F&A].—The F&A cost of a
grant is intended to cover the indirect costs of biomedical research,
ranging from administration and facilities to the cost of equipment
shared across multiple researchers. For example, at research facili-
ties focused on making the next breakthrough in cancer treatment,
indirect costs supply the air handlers that provide the precise con-
ditions needed to generate therapeutic T cells for immunotherapy
trials, complex data systems to analyze and protect patients’
genomic data, and support for the next generation of scientific lead-
ers. The methodology for negotiating indirect costs has been in
place since 1965, and rates have remained largely stable across
NIH grantees for decades. The Committee recognizes that this has
been essential for supporting federally-funded research at institu-
tions across the country. The Committee acknowledges that opti-
mizing indirect cost rates can further enhance the efficiency of re-
search, including benefiting early career researchers and smaller
institutions. But the Committee notes the administration similarly
proposed to cap NIH’s indirect cost rate at 15 percent in 2018,
which Congress rejected by including a general provision prohib-
iting that in the fiscal year 2018 appropriations Act, which has
been continued thereafter. The Committee notes that several major
national associations representing academic and research institu-
tions launched the Joint Associations Group [JAG] on Indirect
Costs to develop transparent, equitable, and efficient alternatives
to the current Federal indirect cost reimbursement system. To-
gether, these subject matter experts from major public and private
research universities, independent research institutes, academic
medical centers, industry, foundations, hospitals, Federal research
laboratories, and leading higher-education associations are devel-
oping new models for funding indirect costs on Federal research
grants as potential replacements for the current Federal F&A reim-
bursement model. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the
JAG’s proposal to develop and implement an optimized, new gov-
ernment-wide model for indirect costs reimbursement and in antici-
pation of that effort maintains its longstanding bill language pro-
hibiting NIH from developing or implementing a modified approach
to funding F&A costs.
Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention.—The Committee pro-
vides $12,500,000 to conduct research on firearm injury and mor-
tality prevention. Given violence and suicide have a number of
causes, the Committee recommends NIH take a comprehensive ap-
proach to studying these underlying causes and evidence-based
methods of prevention of injury, including crime prevention. All
grantees under this section will be required to fulfill requirements
around open data, open code, pre-registration of research projects,
and open access to research articles consistent with the National
Science Foundation’s open science principles. The Director is to re-
port to the Committees within 30 days of enactment of this act on
implementation schedules and procedures for grant awards, which
strive to ensure that such awards support ideologically and politi-
cally unbiased research projects.
Focused Ultrasound.—The Committee understands focused
ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological, relatively safe,
and cost-effective alternative or complement to conventional sur-
157
gery, radiation, or drug-based treatments that holds tremendous
promise to treat numerous debilitating conditions and diseases in-
cluding Alzheimer’s breast cancer, gynecological cancers, uterine
fibroids, and endometriosis, and substance abuse disorder. The
Committee encourages NIH continue to engage with the focused
ultrasound stakeholder community and requests a briefing on ef-
forts to increase focused ultrasound research funding within 120
days of the enactment.
Food As Medicine.—The Committee is aware of the strategic goal
within the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research focused on
improving the use of food as medicine and is interested in how cer-
tain foods, which are prescribed to support management of a spe-
cific condition and administered under physician supervision, im-
pact the lives of patients, for example those with digestive diseases
including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The Committee
urges NIH to support research on the efficacy of ‘food as medicine’
strategies to treat various diseases and conditions.
Forced Swim Test and Tail Suspension Test.—The Committee is
encouraged by NIH efforts to decrease the use of animal models in
research, but remains concerned about the use of certain
neurobehavioral approaches, such as the forced swim test and tail
suspension test, which are known to have poor predictive value for
understanding human mental illness, like depression, or developing
effective therapeutics. The Committee acknowledges that other
countries have limited the use of the forced swim test due to sci-
entific and animal welfare concerns. The Committee urges the NIH
to limit funding for grants involving the forced swim test or tail
suspension test. The Committee also encourages NIH to continue
to increase support for human-specific mental health and behav-
ioral research, including imaging, epidemiological, clinical, com-
putational, and cell-derived approaches, that can provide more
translational insights into the underlying neurobiology of human
mental illness.
Foreign Adversaries.—The Committee is concerned about funding
for research at any laboratory owned or controlled by the govern-
ments of the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, the Russian Federation, the Bolivarian Republic of Ven-
ezuela under the regime of Nicolas Maduro Moros, or any other
country determined by the Secretary of State to be a foreign adver-
sary. The Committee requests a report on any such research within
30 days of enactment.
Foreign Influence.—To support NIH’s efforts to expeditiously
complete grant compliance reviews, the Committee continues to in-
clude $2,500,000 for this activity within the Office of Extramural
Research. The Committee directs NIH to provide biannual briefings
on compliance, oversight, and monitoring reviews where non-com-
pliance related to foreign interference has been identified.
Fund the Person, Not the Project.—While many labs are funded
by R01-equivalent grants, the R35 mechanism arguably allows sci-
entists more flexibility and freedom to pursue the most meritorious
science. The Committee looks forward to reviewing NIH’s plans for
expanding the R35 along with its plans for evaluating the impact
158
on scientific progress, as directed in the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122).
Global Cohort for Alzheimer’s Treatment.—More than 57 million
people worldwide are living with dementia, including more than 7.2
million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease. The disease does not
affect everyone equally: in the United States two-thirds of people
living with Alzheimer’s disease are women. Black people are twice
as likely and Latino people are one and one-half times as likely to
develop Alzheimer’s than Caucasian people. It is believed that
there are disparities in Alzheimer’s disease both between and with-
in nations around the world, including between men and women
and members of different ethnic groups. In order to ensure that
treatments work for the greatest number of people possible, the
Committee urges the National Institutes of Health to provide an
update in the fiscal year 2027 Congressional Justification on activi-
ties related to global cohort studies or networks with high-quality
data on a well-characterized, diverse population, readily available
to researchers. The Committee expects that one potential outcome
for such a cohort or network of global cohorts would be an increase
discovery of targets for drug development and associated biomark-
ers.
Harassment Policies.—NIH has taken major steps over the last
several years to address harassment in biomedical research set-
tings. However, the Committee remains frustrated by statutory
loopholes that fail to protect victims of harassment and prevent
perpetrators from transferring grants between organizations. In
2020, NIH clarified the longstanding requirement for institutions
to seek prior approval when changing personnel on a grant or mov-
ing the grant to a new institution. The request for approval was
expected to mention whether the change was related to concerns
about safety or work environments (e.g. due to concerns about har-
assment, bullying, retaliation, or hostile working conditions). These
notifications allow NIH to make informed decisions about any
changes to awards including requests to transfer awards to a new
institution. Additionally, new authority provided by the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–35) made it man-
datory for institutions to inform NIH of disciplinary actions taken
against senior or key personnel, regardless of whether they prompt-
ed changes including transferring a grant between institutions. If
an ongoing investigation is incomplete and the individual under in-
vestigation leaves their current position, however, NIH lacks the
authority to require recipient organizations to complete the report
or share its findings with the agency. To address this issue, the
Committee has included a new general provision to require institu-
tions that receive NIH funding to complete any investigation un-
dertaken due to concerns about harassment, bullying, retaliation,
or hostile working conditions, even if during the course of the in-
vestigation the individual under investigation leaves their current
position and is no longer employed by the institution. NIH is di-
rected to continue to provide annual updates to the Committees on
holding both NIH-funded institutions and researchers accountable
for such incidents, including through the loss of Federal funding.
In addition, the Committee is concerned that current regulations do
not allow NIH to act quickly and independently to suspend or
159
debar perpetrators. The Committee urges NIH to issue regulations
implementing Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689.
Such regulations would provide NIH with the authority to issue a
government-wide debarment, thereby preventing individuals or en-
tities from participating in any government contracts, subcontracts,
loans, grants, and other assistance programs for a specified period.
Finally, the Committee directs NIH to share investigation reports,
conclusions, and the results of any investigation involving senior/
key personnel on an NIH award due to concerns about harassment,
bullying, retaliation, or hostile working conditions with another
NIH recipient organization on a need-to-know basis.
Health Impacts on Children of Technology and Social Media
Use.—The Committee remains concerned about the impacts of tech-
nology use and media consumption on infant, children, and adoles-
cent development. The Committee appreciates NIH’s ongoing en-
gagement on this important topic and encourages NIH to prioritize
research into the cognitive, physical, and socioemotional impacts of
young people’s use of technologies as well as long-term develop-
mental effects on children’s social, communication, and creative
skills. The Committee also encourages NIH to study potential cor-
relations between increased use of digital media and technologies
and suicidal thoughts and ideation among children. The Committee
encourages NIH to consider different forms of digital media and
technologies, including mobile devices, smart phones, tablets, com-
puters, and virtual reality tools, as well as social-media content,
video games, and television programming. The Committee encour-
ages collaboration between NIMH and NICHD for these activities.
The Committee requests an update on these activities within 120
days of enactment.
INCLUDE Initiative.—The Committee includes no less than
$90,000,000 within OD for the INCLUDE Initiative. The Com-
mittee remains pleased with NIH’s focus on large cohort studies
across the lifespan, novel clinical trials, and multi-year, NIH-wide
research driving important advances in understanding immune
system dysregulation, Alzheimer’s disease, and leukemia that is
contributing to improvements in the health outcomes and quality
of life of individuals with Down syndrome as well as millions of
typical individuals. The Committee requests that NIH provide an
updated plan within 60 days of enactment of this act that includes
a timeline and description of potential grant opportunities and
deadlines for all expected funding opportunities so that young in-
vestigators and new research institutions may be further encour-
aged to explore research in this space. This plan should also incor-
porate an increase in pipeline research initiatives specific to Down
syndrome.
Long COVID Treatments.—The Committee remains concerned
about the economic and overall health impact that Long COVID in-
flicts on the Nation. It is currently estimated that between 6 per-
cent and 19 percent of those infected with SARS–CoV–2 go on to
develop Long COVID, resulting in up to 20 million Americans suf-
fering from this set of debilitating chronic symptoms. Long COVID
is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including severe fa-
tigue, non-restorative sleep, cognitive dysfunction, and widespread
pain. Further, it resembles other post-acute infection syndromes
160
[PAISs], such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic
fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS] and related conditions, known as
chronic overlapping pain conditions [COPCs] or nociplastic syn-
dromes. While the Committee is pleased that NIH’s HEAL and RE-
COVER initiatives plan to target some specific symptoms of Long
COVID, the Committee is concerned that NIH has not expanded
the evaluation of treatments to address many common symptoms
associated with Long COVID either individually or that present as
syndromes which are combinations of symptoms. Furthermore,
NIH’s research program has defined Long COVID narrowly, exclud-
ing many of the common symptoms plaguing Long COVID suf-
ferers. In June 2024, NASEM released the 2024 NASEM Long
COVID Definition, which encompasses extensive lists of the symp-
toms and diagnosable conditions that current science attributes to
Long COVID. The Committee urges NIH to rebalance its research
program to prioritize clinical trials in pursuit of effective treat-
ments and to use the NASEM Long COVID definition to guide its
choice of symptoms and conditions to be address by the candidate
treatments. Such trials should target key symptoms and symptom
complexes associated with Long COVID including widespread pain,
fatigue, non-restorative sleep, brain fog, dizziness, post-exertional
malaise [PEM], postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS]
and loss of taste and smell. Further, the Committee urges NIH to
prioritize the support of clinical trials evaluating therapies for Long
COVID including therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in
treating COPCs or nociplastic syndromes that overlap with Long
COVID.
Lyme Disease and Related Tick-Borne Illnesses.—The Committee
includes not less than $110,000,000, an increase of $10,000,000, for
research into Lyme and other Tick-Borne diseases. The Committee
urges NIH to develop new tools that can more effectively prevent,
diagnose, and treat Lyme disease, including its long-term effects,
and other tick-borne diseases. The Committee encourages the pro-
motion and development of potential vaccine candidates for Lyme
disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Committee urges NIH to
conduct research to better understand modes of transmission for
Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. The Committee encourages
NIH to incentivize new investigators to enter the field of Lyme dis-
ease and other tick-borne disease research. The Committee encour-
ages NIH to coordinate with CDC on publishing reports that assess
diagnostic advancements, methods for prevention, the state of
treatment, and links between tick-borne disease and other ill-
nesses.
Made in America Research Equipment.—The Committee con-
tinues to support efforts to reinforce the Nation’s limited infra-
structure to produce essential products for biomedical research
such as medical devices, equipment, reagents, and consumables.
The Committee strongly encourages NIH to develop a long-term
plan for NIH grantees to give preference to and result in purchases
directly from domestic manufacturers to the maximum extent pos-
sible. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ on steps it has taken to support this goal.
Menopause.—The Committee commends NIH for convening a
stakeholder workshop to discuss research needs, and requests a
161
briefing within 90 days of enactment on remaining knowledge gaps,
or other barriers, related to research, diagnostic testing, and treat-
ments with respect to perimenopause, menopausal symptoms, and
related health outcomes.
Multi-Purpose Prevention Technologies.—The Committee encour-
ages NIH, and particularly NICHD and NIAID, to work with other
Federal, public, and private sector partners to accelerate research,
development and implementation of multipurpose prevention tech-
nologies that are effective, affordable, acceptable, and easy to de-
liver.
Multi-Year Funding of Research Project Grants [RPGs].—Histori-
cally, NIH research grants have been awarded for more than 1
year but funded incrementally wherein each year’s commitment is
obligated from that year’s appropriation provided by Congress. The
Committee notes that the fiscal year 2026 President’s Budget
States that in fiscal year 2026 NIH proposes to continue a fiscal
year 2025 policy to reserve half of the agency’s budget allocation
for competing RPGs for awards that fully fund their outyear com-
mitments as part of the initial grant obligation. The Committee is
concerned about the impact of this policy on application success
rates and that providing grantees with funding for every year of
the RPG upfront would significantly reduce the number of grants
NIH is able to fund. In fiscal year 2025 alone NIH estimates it will
award 3,991 or 40 percent fewer new RPGs and application success
rates for cancer research will decrease from 13.4 percent to 6.8 per-
cent and success rates for NIA-funded research which overwhelm-
ingly supports Alzheimer’s disease research would decrease from

Section 25:
18.0 percent to 6.0 percent. The Committee directs NIH to submit
a report within 60 days of enactment on grants and contracts that
were forward funded for each fiscal year from 2019–2024
disaggregated by Institute, Center, and funding mechanism as well
as on the number of new awards in fiscal year 2025 that were
made under this mechanism by Institute and Center, the fiscal
year 2025 decrease in the number of awards for each Institute and
Center compared to fiscal year 2024, the number of grant applica-
tions from early career researchers received by NIH in fiscal year
2025, and the number and dollar amount of awards made to early
career scientists using the multi-year funding model. Additionally,
NIH is directed to provide the Committee with an analysis of the
types of research funded by this model in fiscal year 2025, and the
selection criteria to identify grants to be funded by the multi-year
approach.
National Security.—The Committee believes that NIH should
consider relevant national security issues when developing and exe-
cuting the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan.
Neurofibromatosis [NF].—The Committee supports efforts to in-
crease funding and resources for NF research and treatment at
multiple Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI,
NICHD, NIMH, NCATS, and NEI. Children and adults with NF
are at elevated risk for the development of many forms of cancer,
deafness, blindness, developmental delays and autism. The Com-
mittee encourages NCI to continue to support a robust NF research
portfolio in fundamental laboratory science, patient-directed re-
search, and clinical trials focused on NF-associated benign and ma-
162
lignant cancers. The Committee also encourages NCI to support
preclinical research and clinical trials. Because NF can cause blind-
ness, pain, and hearing loss, the Committee urges NEI, NINDS,
and NIDCD to continue to support fundamental basic science re-
search on NF relevant to restoring normal nerve function. Based
on emerging findings from numerous researchers worldwide dem-
onstrating that children with NF have a higher chance of devel-
oping autism, learning disabilities, motor delays, and attention
deficits, the Committee encourages NINDS, NIMH, and NICHD to
continue their support of research investigations in these areas.
Since NF2 accounts for some genetic forms of deafness, the Com-
mittee encourages NIDCD to expand its investment in NF2-related
research. NF1 can cause vision loss due to optic gliomas. The Com-
mittee encourages NIH to expand its investment in NF1-focused re-
search on optic gliomas and vision restoration.
New Approach Methodologies.—The Committee supports NIH
Common Fund’s Complement Animal Research In Experimentation
[Complement-ARIE] Program, intended to spur the development,
standardization, validation, and use of new approach methodologies
[NAMs] to more accurately model human biology. The Committee
also encourages NIH, in new Announcements and other indications
of funding opportunities, to continue consideration of NAMs as an
option for areas of preclinical research when it is not appropriate
to use human participants and where the use of NAMs has been
demonstrated to support biomedical discoveries. The Committee
further encourages NIH to collect and make publicly available a re-
port that outlines how the use of vertebrate animal models in agen-
cy research contributes to the mission of NIH as well as efforts by
the agency to encourage the use of new approach methods or strat-
egies. This report should include examples of how other methods
have been used in NIH research to reduce, replace, and refine the
number of vertebrate animals used in research.
NIH-Wide Effort on Women’s Health Research.—The Committee
commends NIH for its cross-cutting effort to transform women’s
health across the lifespan, which will initially be supported by
$200,000,000 from NIH. This NIH-wide effort-a first step to trans-
form the way we approach and fund women’s health research-will
allow NIH to catalyze the ambitious, multi-faceted, interdiscipli-
nary research projects that women need, such as research on the
impact of perimenopause and menopause on heart health, brain
health, and bone health. This coordinated, NIH-wide effort will be
led by OD, ORWH, NIA, NHLBI, NIDA, NICHD, NIAMS, and any
other Institutes and Centers deemed relevant by the NIH Director.
The Committee urges NIH to continue to expand basic, clinical,
and translational research into women’s health, including the
mechanisms of endometriosis and other gynecological conditions, to
identify early diagnostic markers, and develop new treatment
methods. The Committee strongly encourages OD and all Institutes
and Centers to dedicate additional funds and participate in this
cross-cutting effort in fiscal year 2026, with a focus on grant oppor-
tunities to support research and education to improve women’s
health in diverse settings across the United States. NIH is directed
to provide an update on the progress and achievements of the key
projects and studies supported by this NIH-wide effort by reporting
163
on their objectives and anticipated/actual outcomes within 90 days
of enactment. Finally, within 30 days of enactment, the Committee
directs NIH to produce a report on all NIH research grants con-
cerning women’s health that have been terminated or renewals
that have been withheld since January 20, 2025, including the
grant number, grant recipient, and justification for grant termi-
nation or funds withheld. Within 60 days of enactment, the Com-
mittee directs NIH to reinstate those grants that have been termi-
nated, and provide weekly updates to the Committee on these ef-
forts until they are complete.
Notices of Funding Opportunities [NOFOs].—The Committee di-
rects NIH to post monthly on its website a list of the estimated
publishing and award dates of funding opportunities it plans to an-
nounce for the subsequent 6 months. Additionally, to the extent
practicable, the Committee directs NIH to post anticipated pub-
lishing and award dates of future funding opportunities in fiscal
year 2027.
Office of Nutrition Research [ONR].—The Committee supports
ONR’s plan to establish Centers of Excellence in Food Is Medicine
to advance research, education, patient care, and community out-
reach on the role of nutrition in preventing and treating diet-re-
lated chronic diseases. The Committee recognizes that food is medi-
cine services, such as medically tailored meals and produce pre-
scriptions, may improve health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs,
and address health disparities among vulnerable populations. The
Committee encourages NIH to collaborate with existing Food Is
Medicine stakeholders in academia, healthcare, and the nonprofit
sector to leverage their expertise and experience in this field. The
Committee urges NIH to support research on the efficacy of ’food
as medicine’ strategies to treat various diseases and conditions, in-
cluding Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The Committee urges
NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the agen-
cy’s plans to comprehensively invest in food is medicine research,
including through Food is Medicine Centers of Excellence and col-
laborations with existing external stakeholders.
Office of Research on Women’s Health [ORWH].—The Committee
notes bill language that was included in the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103) that funding for ORWH
be made available for direct grant making to address women’s
health research needs that are not being addressed by Institutes
and Centers. The Committee provides $106,480,000 in base funding
for the Office of Research on Women’s Health, an increase of
$30,000,000. The role of ORWH is to improve women’s health re-
search and research on sex and gender influences in health and
disease within the NIH scientific framework to achieve equity in
women’s health across the lifespan. Congress is committed to
prioritizing this research portfolio and ensuring ORWH has the re-
sources it needs to help fulfill its mission. Within this amount, the
Committee allocates $10,000,000 to the Building Interdisciplinary
Research Careers in Women’s Health [BIRCWH] program with the
goal of strengthening the workforce pipeline through mentorship of
early career scientists engaged in women’s health research. Recog-
nizing the impact of the BIRCWH program, the Committee urges
NIH to use these funds to support additional researchers focused
164
on women’s health and sex differences, including research focused
on cancer, maternal health, endometriosis, fibroids and pelvic floor
disorders. The Committee expects NIH to use these funds to en-
hance the BIRCWH program through research on health of women
and female-specific diseases or conditions.
Osteopathic Medical Schools.—Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine
educate 25 percent of all the Nation’s medical students and
prioritize research and training in primary care and rural and un-
derserved healthcare. The Committee understands osteopathic
medical schools and their principal investigators are welcome to re-
view and apply for any NIH funding opportunities in the same way
other organizations seeking NIH support do and that the same is
true for Doctors of Osteopathy [D.O.s] on NIH National Advisory
Councils and study sections. Further, the Committee recognizes the
historic relationship between osteopathic medicine and the re-
search priorities of NCCIH but that D.O.s have been designated on
applications submitted to and awarded from other NIH Institutes
and Centers. The Committee encourages NIH to continue engaging
with researchers from Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, encour-
aging them to apply for available funding opportunities across NIH
Institutes and Centers, and requests an update in the fiscal year
2027 CJ of how Institutes and Centers are expanding research and
representation opportunities for Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine.
Pain and Addiction.—The Committee commends NIH, NIDA,
and NINDS for their focus on addressing addiction and developing
alternatives to opioids for safe and effective pain management
strategies that reduce reliance on opioids. In particular, NIDA and
NINDS’ commitment to research on improved pain management
and prevention, treatment, and recovery from substance use dis-
orders as part of NIH’s HEAL Initiative continues to help fuel the
next generation of scientists and clinicians focused on mitigating
chronic pain with nonaddictive therapies and prevention and treat-
ment of drug addiction. The Committee encourages NIH, NIDA,
and NINDS to continue their efforts through the HEAL Initiative
in fiscal year 2024, with a focus on grant opportunities to support
research and education to improve outcomes for people with both
chronic pain and addiction in diverse settings across the United
States, particularly those located in areas with high incidence of
people at risk for chronic pain, substance use, and overdose.
Parkinson’s Disease.—The Committee applauds the significant
recent advances in PD research made possible in part by public-pri-
vate partnerships like the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for
PD [AMP PD] that is a collaboration between NIH, nonprofit orga-
nizations (The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research
and Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s Disease), and industry
that has led to significant discovery. The goal of AMP PD is to
identify and validate promising biological targets for therapeutics
and to accelerate the development of novel therapies for PD. One
of the AMP PD cohorts, the Michael J. Fox Foundation’s Parkin-
son’s Progression Markers Initiative [PPMI] program, independ-
ently replicated a potential biomarker for PD that may result in
new diagnostics and treatments for this common, life-altering
neurodegenerative disease. Continued partnerships with programs
like PPMI may greatly advance the field of PD research. The Com-
165
mittee encourages NIH and NINDS to continue to participate in
such public-private partnership opportunities with patient advo-
cacy groups and build on these exciting discoveries to accelerate ad-
vances against PD.
Peripheral Neuropathy.—Peripheral neuropathy is a condition
that affects 30 million Americans, many of whom experience con-
siderable pain and disability. The Committee encourages NIH to
develop a coordinated approach to the diagnosis and treatment of
various types of peripheral neuropathy. There are several known
causes, but more research is needed to better understand the mul-
tiple causes and manifestations of this debilitating condition.
Primate Research Centers.—The Committee includes $30,000,000
in funding to remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities
or construct new research facilities for non-human primate re-
source infrastructure, as authorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k.
Psychedelic Research.—The Committee recognizes the increased
interest and need to study psychedelics, including MDMA,
ketamine, and psilocybin, and their potential therapeutic effects.
The Committee encourages NIH to expand its current research
agenda across its Institutes and Centers, potentially by forming a
cross-Institute research group, and to encourage psychedelic re-
search at the NIH Clinical Center. The Committee also encourages
NIH to work with FDA in developing and supporting public-private
collaborations to advance all forms of psychedelic research for
therapeutic purposes.
RCDC Funding Levels.—The Committee provides discretionary
funding for specified programs, projects, and activities [PPAs] ac-
cording to the amounts included in this act and the report accom-
panying this act. For funding levels not specified in this act or the
report accompanying this act, the Committee urges NIH as appro-
priate to maintain consistent funding in fiscal year 2026 for sci-
entific categories included in the Research, Condition, and Disease
Categorization [RCDC] system. The Committee directs NIH to no-
tify the Committees on Appropriations regarding any deviation by
more than 10 percent of the average annual funding level provided
in fiscal years 2019–2024 for any RCDC category, and a justifica-
tion for that deviation. Finally, the Committee directs NIH to pro-
vide quarterly briefings to the Committee on up-to-date RCDC ex-
penditures.
Reducing the Administrative Burden on Researchers.—The Com-
mittee remains concerned about the status of NIH’s implementa-
tion plans following a 2019 final report on administrative burden.
The Committee reiterates the directives described in the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122).
Replication and Reproducibility Experiments.—The Reproduc-
ibility Project in Cancer Biology showed the difficulty in replicating
cancer biology studies published in top journals. Given the impor-
tance of reproducibility in scientific research, the Committee en-
courages NIH to establish a program to fund replication experi-
ments on significant lines of research. The Committee directs NIH
to brief the Committee within 180 days of enactment on the repro-
ducibility efforts NIH will undertake in fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
Research on Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens [ePPPs].—
The Committee commends NIH for its continued work with OSTP
166
and other Federal partners to ensure the safe and secure conduct
of biomedical research, particularly as it relates to ePPPs. NIH is
directed to provide guidance to research institutions regarding its
updated policy through an implementation office, as outlined in the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122). The
Committee continues to provide $1,000,000 for this office to serve
as a main point of contact for research institutions regarding ePPP
policy, and develop tools and training guidance to strengthen risk-
assessment, safety, security, and ethical considerations sur-
rounding proposed ePPP research at research institutions. NIH
shall provide annual reports to the Committee on the progress and
activities of implementation. In addition, NIH is urged to review
and, where appropriate, identify needed relevant authorities when
considering appropriate actions for investigators and research insti-
tutions that fail to follow the research oversight framework under
the policy. NIH may also consider additional approaches for pro-
moting use of these or similar oversight procedures by research in-
stitutions that conduct life sciences research and do not receive
Federal funding. NIH is directed to provide a report on these ac-
tivities within 180 days of enactment.
Research Training and Career Development.—The Committee
continues to be concerned about the health of the research training
and career development pipeline that is crucial to ensuring the
next generation maintains U.S. leadership in medical research and
biotechnology. The challenges facing the full-spectrum of medical
research, including the need for physician-scientists and clinical re-
searchers, are particularly pronounced. NIH is encouraged to en-
hance and otherwise explore opportunities to bolster training
grants, their infrastructures, and related mechanisms, including by
leveraging opportunities in the CTSA program through timely in-
vestment with supplemental resources.
Research Transparency.—As demonstrated over the past several
years, the Committee remains committed to funding NIH research
and ensuring that our Nation’s researchers, particularly our early
career scientists, have the support to make the scientific break-
throughs that may transform healthcare. However, it is critical
that NIH can ensure funds are used for the best possible research
that fulfill the core research mission of NIH. The Committee appre-
ciates that in response to prior language, NIH continues to provide,
in writing made available on a publicly accessible website, that
each grant or agreement promotes efforts to seek fundamental
knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and/or
the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life,
and reduce illness and disability.
Restructuring NIH.—The Committee notes that Congress estab-
lished 24 NIH ICs in statute through section 401 of the Public
Health Service Act (Public Law 106–525). The Committee further
notes that section 401 of the Public Health Service Act (Public Law
106–525) requires that the Secretary provide the HELP Committee
and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Rep-
resentatives 180 days written notice of any determination to re-
structure or reorganize the functions of NIH’s ICs, which the Com-
mittees have not received. The Committee commends NIH for re-
convening the Scientific Management Review Board [SMRB], as di-
167
rected in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations Act, to review the
overall research portfolio of the agency and advise on the use of or-
ganizational authorities, including eliminating ICs, creating new
ones, and reorganizing existing structures. NIH is directed to pro-
vide a report to the Committee no later than 30 days after enact-
ment on SMRB activities, and an annual report on SMRB plans
and activities thereafter.
Spending Practices.—Congress appropriates funding to NIH to
carry out its mission each fiscal year and NIH is statutorily re-
quired to obligate appropriations during their period of availability.
For fiscal year 2025, Congress appropriated $48,301,000,000 to
NIH to carry out the agency’s mission, to remain available for obli-
gation until September 30, 2025 (Public Law 119–4). Within 60
days of enactment, the Committee directs NIH to produce a report
that summarizes the agency’s quarterly spending for fiscal years
2019 through 2025 disaggregated by Institute, Center, and Office
and funding mechanism. This report must be made publicly avail-
able on the agency’s website no later than 120 days after enact-
ment of this act.
NIH Staff.—The Committee recognizes NIH’s unique scientific
expertise, which has propelled the success and dominance of the
U.S. biomedical research enterprise. The Committee notes the
number of political appointees at NIH has increased significantly
and further notes the importance of maintaining staff with the
technical expertise to support the agency’s mission to seek funda-
mental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems
and apply that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and re-
duce illness and disability. Finally, to maintain and recruit the best
and most qualified scientists, clinicians, and experts in their fields
of discipline, it is also crucial that NIH is able to offer competitive
salaries in line with industry, universities, academic medical cen-
ters and hospitals. Therefore, NIH is directed to continue to offer
salary ranges for these employees to a maximum of $350,000 due
to their leadership roles and the much higher compensation earned
by their counterparts in other sectors.
Stopping Tax Dollars from Funding Chinese Military Research.—
The Committee is concerned about research awards funded by NIH
that are associated with Chinese defense entities. Therefore, the
Committee directs NIH to submit a report to the Committee within
180 days of enactment and annually thereafter until September 30,
2026 on all NIH-funded research awards (including intramural re-
search funding as well as both extramural prime and sub-awards)
that involved persons from the People’s Republic of China [PRC].
Study on the Impact of Screen Time on Learning Outcomes.—
Screen time for children rose throughout the COVID–19 pandemic
and has continued to remain high. One study showed that in 2021
teens spent an average of 8.5 hours on screens per day, and chil-
dren from ages 8–12 spent 5.5 hours on screens per day. The Com-
mittee is concerned over the implications of high screen time on
children’s ability to learn and process information in schools and
urges NIH to study the impact of increased screen time on chil-
dren’s learning and developmental outcomes. Further, the Com-
mittee directs NIH to study media consumption in children to de-
termine the impact of online content offered by streaming sites
168
compared to noncommercial educational programming on literacy,
math skills, and workforce readiness. In addition to learning out-
comes, the Committee urges NIH to study whether the type of
media consumed by children is linked to behavioral and social out-
comes.
Support Innovation in Women’s Health.—NIH’s SBIR and STTR
programs are directed to increase investments in supporting
innovators and early-stage small businesses engaged in research
and development on women’s health. NIH is directed to provide an
update on these activities within 120 days of enactment.
Temporomandibular Disorder [TMD].—The Committee notes the
issuance of the TMD Collaborative for Improving Patient-Centered
Translational Research [TMD IMPACT] by NIDCR and the first
step in the implementation of a national consortium for TMD re-
search. The Committee recognizes that TMD is a complex, multi-
system condition and therefore encourages the NIH Director to
work closely with the NIDCR Director to ensure that other Insti-
tutes, Centers, and Offices with the appropriate scientific expertise
participate and support NIDCR as it implements and manages this
project. NIH is encouraged to use the recommendations from the
recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report on TMDs, from the TMJ Patient-led RoundTable efforts, and
from patients themselves as guidelines in the development of this
consortium. The Committee also supports the creation and imple-
mentation of a Patient-Centered Coordinated Registry Network
[CRN] for TMDs, recognizing its critical role in advancing research
and collaboration across Federal agencies. The Committee is en-
couraged that TMD, a long neglected, misunderstood and under-
funded condition is now receiving the attention and support needed
to improve the understanding of TMD and develop evidence-based
treatments and care for this complex condition. The Committee re-
quests an update within 120 days of enactment on the development
and implementation of this large-scale Collaborative to ensure the
full participation of the many government and private entities nec-
essary to successfully launch the Collaborative.
Timely Access to Funds.—The Committee notes the importance of
grant and other award recipients receiving timely access to award-
ed funds. The Committee is concerned about ongoing delays in
awarding NIH fiscal year 2025 appropriated funds and notes that
in July 2025, NIH’s rate of grant awards and overall spending
lagged more than $5,000,000,000 behind the same period in fiscal
year 2024. This scale of slowdown in NIH spending threatens to
disrupt critical biomedical research projects across the country.
Therefore, the Committee directs NIH to award competitive grants
as expeditiously as possible and noncompetitive grant renewals
within 30 days of the end of their period of performance, except in
the case of a grant or award where there has been a finding of fi-
nancial mismanagement, research fraud, or malfeasance. Finally,
the Committee directs NIH to provide grant and other award re-
cipients timely access to their award dollars when they submit a
draw down request to the agency.
Wastewater Surveillance R&D.—The Committee recognizes the
potential and importance of wastewater surveillance in public
health surveillance. Building on the prior NIH-supported efforts,
169
the Committee encourages NIH to continue efforts supporting inno-
vation through developing and improving wastewater surveillance
capabilities including in rural communities.
Women’s Health Research Initiative and NIH-Wide SABV Pol-
icy.—The Committee supports greater investment in research on
conditions unique to or that occur predominantly in women or
manifest themselves differently in women than in men. The Com-
mittee directs NIH to further integrate and prioritize funding for
women’s health across its research portfolio and to study ways to
leverage AI to advance women’s health research. In addition to
NIH efforts to dedicate additional funds for research on women’s
health needs, NIH’s sex as a biological variable [SABV] policy has
helped ensure that research that NIH funds considers women’s
health in the development of study design and in data collection
and analysis. The Committee encourages NIH to track and analyze
progress in integrating SABV into biomedical research, where ap-
propriate, across its Institutes and Centers and to adopt NIH-wide
standards regarding how applicants, reviewers, and grantees
should consider SABV in funding opportunities, research designs,
analyses, and reporting. NIH is directed to provide an update on
relevant activities within 90 days of enactment.
Youth Tobacco Cessation Research.—The Committee recognizes
that despite millions of youth using at least one tobacco product,
there are no FDA-approved tobacco cessation therapies for people
under 17 and few well-studied, evidence-based behavioral interven-
tions for youth tobacco use. The Committee encourages NIH to con-
tinue to support research on effective tobacco cessation modalities
for youth under age 18, including pediatric studies of the safety
and effectiveness of cessation treatments currently approved for
adults. Studies should account for the broad range of tobacco prod-
ucts used by youth, including cessation options for individuals in-
terested in quitting cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and
cigars.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $350,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 350,000,000
The Committee includes $350,000,000, the same as the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level, for Buildings and Facilities. For the fifth
time in as many years, the recommendation does not include au-
thority for NIH to transfer up to 1 percent of its research funding
to the Buildings and Facilities account. This is extraordinary au-
thority for a Federal agency and NIH has yet to provide an expla-
nation for why this mechanism would be appropriate. Funding pro-
vided for research should not be unilaterally transferred without a
sound explanation and robust justification of need. The Committee
commends the agency for continuing to develop a sound capital
planning process and for keeping the Committee informed on such
activities. These efforts have been supported by the Committee
with modifications of section 216 of this act which permit NIH to
use up to $100,000,000 of research funding for alterations and re-
pairs. The Committee directs NIH to continue to provide biannual
updates of its efforts to develop best practices and its maintenance
and construction plans for projects whose cost exceeds $5,000,000,
170
including any changes to those plans and the original baseline esti-
mates for individual projects. Finally, the Committee also directs
NIH to describe in its fiscal year 2027 and future CJs how the
projects requested in its budgets tie to its capital planning process,
including the Research Facilities Advisory Committee’s role in de-
termining which projects are selected for inclusion in the budget.
NIH INNOVATION ACCOUNT, CURES ACT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $407,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 226,000,000
The Committee provides $226,000,000 to be spent from the NIH
Innovation Account for the All of Us precision medicine initiative
and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies [BRAIN] Initiative. The Committee expects NIH
to transfer funding shortly after enactment of this act.
ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY FOR HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,500,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,500,000,000
The Committee provides $1,500,000,000 for the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency for Health [ARPA–H], the same level as fis-
cal year 2025. The Committee continues to believe ARPA–H re-
quires a different culture and mission than NIH’s other 27 Insti-
tutes and Centers. The Committee continues to direct ARPA–H to
provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on its establishment
process, hiring, and scientific priorities and progress. The Com-
mittee expects such briefings to address how ARPA–H’s activities
are designed to advance biomedical research and development and
the mission to create breakthrough technologies, as well as how to
balance long-term trans-disciplinary scientific challenges with
short-term research goals.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS].—The Committee urges
ARPA–H to support $30,000,000 in R&D programs and projects to
develop therapies, targeted therapies, and treatments for ALS and
related neurodegenerative disorders.
Autism RWDP.—Consistent with what the Committee has noted
under this heading in the Office of the Director, and because NIH
has yet to address bipartisan concerns raised with a nearly iden-
tical proposal in 2023, the Committee strongly urges ARPA–H to
pause funding any awards associated with the RWDP. Within 30
days of enactment, the Committee directs ARPA–H to brief the
Committees on Appropriations about any current or proposed
agreements to support an Autism RWDP project at NIH. Finally,
ARPA–H shall notify the Committees on Appropriations at least 30
days in advance of entering into any interagency agreement greater
than $25,000,000 from any appropriation available to ARPA–H to
any other agency or Department. Such notification shall include
the source of funding, including the applicable legislative citation,
a description of the obligation, and a justification for the transfer.
Commercialization Network.—Speeding the translation of innova-
tive health technologies to market is essential for the success of
ARPA–H. This acceleration depends on meaningful collaboration
between researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors across sectors
171
and geographic areas. The Committee applauds the efforts of the
Investor Catalyst Hub in building a robust network that ensures
relevant stakeholders in all regions of the country have a stake in
advancing the commercialization of medical discoveries and ARPA–
H’s innovative agenda. The Committee notes the important role of
funding sprints to rapidly accelerate innovation in targeted priority
areas, by delivering specialized entrepreneurial assistance, com-
mercialization and market readiness programming, and other tar-
geted services for innovators as they seek to translate critical
transformative biomedical and health breakthroughs. The Com-
mittee urges ARPA–H to provide continued funding for the Inves-
tor Catalyst Hub in fiscal year 2026.
Emerging Health Threats.—The Committee recognizes that
ARPA–H plays a unique role in the U.S. science and technology en-
terprise. Modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Agency
[DARPA] and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
Authority [BARDA] but more broadly focused on improving health
outcomes for all Americans, ARPA–H is expected to pursue trans-
formative advances in health research beyond the scope of other
public or private efforts. U.S. citizens and interests can be threat-
ened by endemic and emerging diseases in any part of the world.
The Committee urges ARPA–H to contribute in unique ways to
combating existing and emerging health threats here and abroad,
and to strengthen U.S. science and technology capacity, competi-
tiveness, and leadership.
Increase Access and Reduce Costs for Cell Therapies.—ARPA–H
is charged with accelerating better health outcomes by advancing
innovative research through high potential, high-impact biomedical
and health research. Engineered cell therapies have emerged as
revolutionary therapies to treat selected diseases and malignancies,
including colorectal cancer which is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the United States. Access to engineered
cell therapies is significantly limited because of the current tech-
nical complexities required for such personalized medicine, lengthy
wait times, and the high cost of goods per treatment. ARPA–H’s
Engineering of Immune Cells inside the Body [EMBODY] program
is designed to address those limitations through the development
of novel approaches to the manufacturing of genetically engineered
immune cells, with the goal of developing such therapies at a scale
that significantly increases access to reduce the cost of goods per
treatment. The Committee urges ARPA–H to continue its support
for the EMBODY program.
Long COVID Research.—ARPA–H is urged to invest in Long
COVID research to ensure its high-risk, high-reward research is fo-
cused on drug trials, development of biomarkers, and research that
includes Long COVID associated conditions, such as dysautonomia,
postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS], and myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS]. The Com-
mittee urges ARPA–H to coordinate with NIH on these efforts to
augment NIH’s Long COVID research portfolio. ARPA–H is also
urged to prioritize the support of R&D programs and projects that
can enable clinical trials evaluating therapies which target key
symptoms and symptom complexes associated with Long COVID
including widespread pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, brain fog,
172
dizziness, post-exertional malaise [PEM], POTS and loss of taste
and smell.
Novel Alternative Methods.—The Committee is aware that
ARPA–H’s programs, many of which encompass a wide range of
biomedical research, utilize both animal and non-animal research
methodologies. Each program is led by a Program Manager [PM]
who oversees multiple groups of performers who aim to solve the
same problem through unique approaches. Acknowledging ARPA–
H’s operational model, the Committee urges ARPA–H to require
performers to specify expected use of animals and novel alternative
methods [NAMs] in their proposals, if known. ARPA–H shall aggre-
gate this data for anticipated awards and information from the
Vertebrate Animal Section submissions (required by the Office of
Laboratory Animal Welfare) into a comprehensive annual report
that reflects the methodologies used across their programs, includ-
ing descriptions and rationale for animal models and NAMs used.
This report shall be submitted to the Committee and made publicly
available within 90 days following the conclusion of each project
year. This activity will ensure accountability and transparency
across ARPA–H, fostering ethical research practices while advanc-
ing biomedical innovation.
Public Health Interventions.—The Committee urges the agency to
consider a new program focused on a data system to aid proactive
public health interventions.
Women’s Health.—The Committee was encouraged by ARPA–H’s
announcement of the Sprint for Women’s Health, a $100,000,000
commitment in response to the White House Initiative for Women’s
Health Research to fund transformative research and development
in women’s health. The Committee urges ARPA–H to continue this
important work to address women’s health and accelerate and scale
tools, products, and platforms to improve women’s health outcomes.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
The Committee provides $7,428,917,000 for the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA]. This ap-
propriation includes $133,667,000 in transfers available under sec-
tion 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended) and
$12,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund.
SAMHSA is the public health agency responsible for supporting
mental health programs and behavioral healthcare, treatment, and
prevention services throughout the country.
The Committee continues bill language that instructs the Assist-
ant Secretary of SAMHSA and the Secretary to exempt the Mental
Health Block Grant [MHBG], the Substance Use Prevention Treat-
ment, and Recovery Services Block Grant, and the State Opioid Re-
sponse grant from being used as a source for the PHS evaluation
set-aside in fiscal year 2026.
MENTAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,808,546,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,800,446,000
The Committee provides $2,800,446,000 for mental health serv-
ices. The Committee includes $21,039,000 in transfers available
173
under section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended)
and $12,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Included in this
appropriation is funding for Mental Health Programs of Regional
and National Significance [PRNS], the MHBG, children’s mental
health services, Projects for Assistance in Transition from Home-
lessness [PATH], Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with
Mental Illness [PAIMI], and the National Child Traumatic Stress
Initiative.
Programs of Regional and National Significance
The Committee includes $1,071,853,000 for PRNS within the
Center for Mental Health Services. The Committee’s appropriation
for PRNS includes $12,000,000 in transfers to PRNS from the PPH
Fund. These programs address priority mental health needs by de-
veloping and applying evidence-based practices, offering training
and technical assistance, providing targeted capacity expansion
grants, and changing the delivery system through family, client-ori-
ented, and consumer-run activities.
Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:

988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline [988 Lifeline].—Suicide is a lead-
ing cause of death in the United States, claiming over 49,000 lives
in 2023. The Committee provides $534,618,000 for the 988 Lifeline
and Behavioral Health Crisis Services. This amount includes fund-
ing to continue to strengthen the 988 Lifeline and enable the pro-
gram to continue to respond in a timely manner to an increasing
number of contacts. The 988 Lifeline coordinates a network of inde-
pendently operated crisis centers across the United States by pro-
viding suicide prevention and crisis intervention services for indi-
viduals seeking help. The Committee requests a briefing within 90
days of enactment, and quarterly briefings thereafter, on the 988
Lifeline spend plan and related activities.
988 Performance Metrics.—The Committee directs SAMHSA to
maintain a publically available Web site, to be updated monthly,
which provides data on the total number calls, texts, and chats
routed through 988. The metrics should include the answer rate,
response time, and contact length by contact type and the total
number of contacts by service type.
988 Program Integrity.—The Committee remains concerned
about the suicide rates among youth and young adults. The Com-
mittee recognizes the vital services provided through the 988 Life-
line and the important role of State partners in suicide prevention
and behavioral health. As States establish and develop 988 pro-
grams, the Committee encourages SAMHSA to ensure States have
the flexibility to use a technology platform that allows for low wait
times and that facilitates a seamless coordination with local crisis
and emergency response teams, accommodates a connection to fol-
low-up and community resources, and ensures that sensitive user
data is being safeguarded and protected. The Committee requests
SAMHSA include information on 988 program integrity activities,
including with respect to safeguarding 988 user data and privacy,
and a review of work with States and other 988 program partners
in the 988 Lifeline spend plan briefing.
988 Lifeline Text and Chat-Based Capabilities.—The Committee
encourages SAMHSA to continue to make funding competitively
available to chat and text backup centers to provide the capacity
and infrastructure to handle contacts from vulnerable youth
through calls, chats, and texts, including efforts to improve local
text and chat answer rates. Within the total for the 988 Lifeline,
the Committee continues $10,000,000 for specialized services for
Spanish speakers seeking access to 988 services through texts or
chats. SAMHSA shall make this funding available to one or more
organizations with the capacity and experience to offer culturally
competent, Spanish language text and chat services for mental
health support and crisis intervention.
The Committee supports SAMHSA’s efforts to ensure access to
the 988 Lifeline through various forms of communication, including
phone calls, text and chat functions, and video services through
175
American Sign Language for Americans who are deaf or hard of
hearing.
Adolescent and Young Adult Awareness of the 988 Lifeline.—The
Committee encourages SAMHSA to coordinate with the relevant
Departments and young adult behavioral health stakeholders, such
as stakeholders serving secondary school and postsecondary stu-
dents, to increase adolescent and young adult awareness of 988, in-
cluding via the publication of 988 on newly-printed standard issue
student identification cards.
Specialized Services for Youth.—The Committee restores
$33,100,000 for these services and instructs SAMHSA to follow the
directives included in Senate Report 118–84.
Unified 988 Lifeline Technology.—The Committee is aware that
988 Lifeline crisis contact centers have not all implemented the
unified technology that has been developed by SAMHSA’s 988 Life-
line Network Administrator. The Committee encourages SAMHSA
to inform crisis contact centers within the network about the avail-
ability of the 988 Unified Platform and to urge these same crisis
contact centers to use this technology if there is not a State-ap-
proved unified technology platform.
Youth-to-Youth Peer Support.—The Committee recognizes that
young people are uniquely situated to provide peer support for
teens and young adults who are struggling with their mental
health. The Committee is also aware that youth-to-youth engage-
ment, when conducted by youth with professional support and
training, has proven effective at reaching young people in crisis but
is currently underused across the Nation. The Committee encour-
ages SAMHSA to ensure that the 988 Lifeline maintains appro-
priate capacity, training, and referral capabilities to support youth
who contact the Lifeline for help, including through peer services.
The Committee further encourages SAMHSA to consider
partnering with a nonprofit organization that has delivered youth-
to-youth crisis intervention and hotline services to establish contin-
uous coverage for peer support services.
Eating Disorders.—The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA
to coordinate with HRSA to create a pediatric training model for
pediatric providers for prevention, early intervention, treatment,
and ongoing support protocols for youth with or at-risk of devel-
oping an eating disorder. The Committee requests a briefing within
180 days of enactment of this act on SAMHSA’s work to support
the identification, prevention, and treatment of eating disorders, in-
cluding through a public awareness campaign.
First Responder Mental Health.—The Committee is concerned by
the significant mental and behavioral health challenges faced by
first responders due to the demanding and often traumatic nature
of their work, which results in widespread stress, burnout, and
mental health struggles. The Committee requests a briefing within
180 days of enactment of this act on the steps SAMHSA is taking
to address the mental health challenges faced by first responders.
The briefing should include an analysis about how SAMHSA can
proactively support the well-being of first responders, including
through the use of confidential, peer specialists who can offer im-
mediate emotional support, crisis intervention, resources for mental
176
health treatment, and referrals to ongoing care and peer support
networks.
Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention.—The Committee
provides $43,806,000, of which $12,000,000 is included in transfers
from the PPH Fund, for Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Preven-
tion programs, which will support the development and implemen-
tation of early intervention programs and youth suicide prevention
strategies. Additionally, the Committee includes $11,000,000 for
the Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention Resource Center.
Garrett Lee Smith Campus Suicide Prevention Grant Program.—
The Committee recognizes the importance of addressing mental
health and suicide prevention on college campuses, including at in-
stitutions of higher education that are traditionally under-
resourced. The Committee understands that campus-based student
groups that both educate and train students on primary prevention
and intervention for those at risk of experiencing mental health
and substance use disorders can be beneficial in increasing the
likelihood classmates will seek treatment. The Committee rec-
ommends SAMHSA encourage applicants to seek input from rel-
evant stakeholders, including student-serving mental health groups
on campus, to better reach students in need of support. Addition-
ally, the Committee directs SAMHSA to continue the waiver of
matching funds for minority-serving institutions and community
colleges included in the 2024 funding notice and as directed in Pub-
lic Law 118–47. This will help meet these growing needs and ad-
dress disparities in access to mental health services. The Secretary
may continue to waive such requirement with respect to an institu-
tion of higher education not covered by those definitions, if the Sec-
retary determines that extraordinary need at the institution justi-
fies the waiver.
Healthy Transitions.—The Committee includes $18,451,000 for
the Healthy Transitions program, which provides grants to States
and Tribes to improve access to mental healthcare treatment and
related support services for young people aged 16 to 25 who either
have, or are at risk of developing, a serious mental health condi-
tion.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health.—The Committee pro-
vides $15,000,000 for grants to entities such as State agencies, trib-
al communities, universities, or medical centers that are in dif-
ferent stages of developing infant and early childhood mental
health services. These entities should have the capacity to lead
partners in systems-level change, as well as in building or enhanc-
ing the basic components of such early childhood services, including
an appropriately trained workforce. Additionally, the Committee
recognizes the importance of early intervention strategies to pre-
vent the onset of mental disorders, particularly among children.
Recent research has shown that half of those who will develop
mental health disorders show symptoms by age 14. The Committee
encourages SAMHSA to work with States to support services and
activities related to infants and toddlers, such as expanding the in-
fant and early childhood mental health workforce; increasing
knowledge of infant and early childhood mental health among pro-
fessionals most connected with young children to promote positive
early mental health and early identification; strengthening systems
177
and networks for referral; and improving access to quality services
for children and families who are in need of support.
Interagency Task Force on Trauma Informed Care.—The Com-
mittee includes $2,000,000 to continue the Interagency Task Force
on Trauma-Informed Care as authorized by the SUPPORT Act
(Public Law 115–271). The Committee supports the Task Force’s
authorized activities, including the dissemination of trauma-in-
formed best practices and the promotion of such models and train-
ing strategies through all relevant grant programs. The Committee
encourages the Task Force to collaborate with the National Child
Traumatic Stress Network on these activities.
Mental Health Awareness Training.—The Committee provides
$27,963,000 to continue existing activities, including Mental Health
First Aid. Mental Health Awareness Training and Mental Health
First Aid have allowed Americans, as well as first responders, to
recognize the signs and symptoms of common mental health dis-
orders. In continuing competitive funding opportunities, SAMHSA
is directed to include as eligible grantees local law enforcement
agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical units with a
special emphasis on training for crisis de-escalation techniques.
SAMHSA is also encouraged to allow training for college students,
veterans, armed services personnel, and their family members and
broaden applicable settings for trainings to include non-educational
and non-healthcare settings where appropriate within the Mental
Health Awareness Training program. Additionally, SAMHSA is en-
couraged to prioritize grants to eligible entities that will serve
within States where there is a high prevalence of adverse childhood
experiences and youth substance use disorders.
Mental Health Crisis Response Grants.—The Committee under-
stands the significant need for crisis services in order to divert peo-
ple experiencing a mental health crisis away from the criminal jus-
tice system and into mental health treatment. The Committee in-
cludes $20,000,000 for communities to create or enhance existing
crisis response programs that may include teams of mental health
professionals, law enforcement, emergency medical technicians, and
crisis workers to provide immediate support and stabilization to
those in crisis.
Minority Fellowship Program.—The Committee includes
$11,059,000 to support grants that will increase the number of cul-
turally competent behavioral health professionals who teach, ad-
minister, conduct services research, and provide direct mental ill-
ness services for underserved minority populations. The Committee
understands the importance of increasing the pool of culturally
competent pediatric mental health professionals, including child
and adolescent psychiatrists, to address the Nation’s youth mental
health crisis. The Committee again encourages SAMHSA to
prioritize and increase the number of pediatric behavioral health
treatment providers, including child and adolescent psychiatrists,
selected to participate in the minority fellowship program.
National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.—The Committee in-
cludes $28,200,000 for suicide prevention programs. Of the total,
$26,200,000 is for the implementation of the Zero Suicide model,
which is a comprehensive, multi-setting approach to suicide pre-
vention within health systems.
178
Additionally, suicide is often more prevalent in highly rural areas
and among the American Indian and Alaskan Native populations.
According to CDC, American Indian/Alaska Natives [AI/AN] have
the highest rates of suicide of any racial or ethnic group in the
United States. In order to combat the rise in suicide rates among
this population, the Committee includes $3,400,000 for AI/AN with-
in Zero Suicide.
The Committee also notes with concern that suicide has been the
leading cause of death for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and
Pacific Islander [AANHPI] youth ages 10 through 24 in recent
years. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to examine the preva-
lence and causes of behavioral health conditions among AANHPI
youth, including by identifying ways to address this disparity and
improve access to behavioral healthcare for AANHPI youth.
Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration Grants and
Technical Assistance.—The Committee notes that one of the goals
of the Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration Grant pro-
gram is to improve patient access to bidirectional integrated care
services. The Committee provides $55,877,000 for the program to
promote full integration and collaboration in clinical practice be-
tween behavioral healthcare and primary/physical healthcare, as
well as $2,991,000 for technical assistance, and directs SAMHSA to
fund the psychiatric collaborative care model implemented by pri-
mary care physician practices as authorized under section
1301(i)(2) of division FF of Public Law 117–328. Pursuant to such
law, these technical assistance centers may be funded through co-
operative agreements.
Further, the Committee directs SAMHSA to prioritize popu-
lations with co-occurring conditions of serious mental illness or
substance use disorders, along with chronic physical conditions, in-
cluding those defined as ‘‘special populations’’ under 42 U.S.C.
290bb–42(a)(4). Finally, the Committee directs SAMHSA to coordi-
nate with HRSA to facilitate dissemination of technical information
on screening at-risk patients in integrated care models to Federally
Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics.
Project AWARE.—The Committee provides $140,001,000 for
Project AWARE. This program increases awareness of mental
health issues and connects young people who have behavioral
health concerns and their families with needed services. The Com-
mittee encourages SAMHSA to continue using funds to provide
mental health services in schools and for school-aged youth and
provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Of the amount provided for Project AWARE, the Committee di-
rects SAMHSA to use $17,500,000 for discretionary grants to sup-
port efforts in high-crime, high-poverty areas and, in particular,
communities that are seeking to address relevant impacts and root
causes of community violence and collective trauma. These grants
should maintain the same focus as fiscal year 2024 grants.
SAMHSA is encouraged to continue consultation with the Depart-
ment of Education in administration of these grants. The Com-
mittee requests a report on progress of grantees in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
The Committee recognizes the increased need for school and com-
munity-based trauma services for children, youth, young adults,
179
and their families and the need to support school staff with train-
ing in trauma-informed practices. Within the total for Project
AWARE, the Committee directs $12,000,000 for student access to
evidence-based, culturally relevant, trauma support services and
mental healthcare through established partnerships with commu-
nity organizations as authorized by section 7134 of the SUPPORT
Act (Public Law 115–271).
Project AWARE helps Tribes and tribal organizations to develop
sustainable school-based mental health programs and services.
Within the funds made available for Project AWARE, the Com-
mittee urges SAMHSA to consider the needs of Tribes and tribal
organizations.
School-Based Mental Health Services.—The Committee under-
stands the importance of providing mental health services to stu-
dents, including through annual, school-based mental health and
well-being screenings. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
work with the Department of Education to recommend regular
screenings in public schools that use evidence-based or scientif-
ically validated screening tools routinely used in healthcare sys-
tems, including through a digital platform or application, for use by
students at public schools.
Community Mental Health Services Block Grant
The Committee provides $1,007,571,000 for the Mental Health
Block Grant. This appropriation includes $21,039,000 in transfers
available under section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as
amended).
The MHBG distributes funds to 59 eligible States and territories
through a formula based on specified economic and demographic
factors. Grant applications must include an annual plan for pro-
viding comprehensive community mental health services to adults
with a serious mental illness and children with a serious emotional
disturbance.
The Committee continues bill language requiring that at least 10
percent of the funds for the MHBG program be set aside for evi-
dence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with
early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. The
Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to include in budget jus-
tifications a detailed table showing at a minimum each State’s al-
lotment, name of the program being implemented, and a short de-
scription of the program.
Crisis Set-Aside.—The Committee continues the 5 percent set-
aside within the MHBG for States to implement evidence-based,
crisis care programs to address the needs of individuals in crisis,
including those with serious mental illnesses and children with se-
rious mental and emotional distress. The Committee directs
SAMHSA to continue to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion
of eligible States and Territories, some or all of a set of core crisis
care elements, including 24/7 mobile crisis units, local and State-
wide call centers with the capacity to respond to distressed or suici-
dal individuals, and other programs that allow the development of
systems where individuals can always receive assistance during a
crisis.
180
AI/AN.—The Committee recognizes that AI/AN populations in
the United States have higher rates of illicit drug use, opioid mis-
use, and misuse of prescription drugs compared to other racial
groups. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to consider the needs
of Indian Tribes and tribal organizations within the MHBG.
Children’s Mental Health Services
The Committee provides $130,000,000 for the Children’s Mental
Health Services program. This program provides grants and tech-
nical assistance to support comprehensive, community-based sys-
tems of care for children and adolescents with serious emotional,
behavioral, or mental disorders. Grantees must provide matching
funds and services must be coordinated with the educational, juve-
nile justice, child welfare, and primary healthcare systems. The
Committee continues to include a 10 percent set-aside for an early
intervention demonstration program with persons not more than
25 years of age at clinical high risk of developing a first-episode
psychosis.
Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness [PATH]
The Committee provides $66,635,000 for PATH, which addresses
the needs of individuals with serious mental illness who are experi-
encing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness. Funds are used
to provide an array of services, such as screening and diagnostic
services, emergency assistance, case management, and referrals to
the most appropriate housing environment.
Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness
[PAIMI]
The Committee provides $40,000,000 for PAIMI. This program
helps ensure that the rights of mentally ill individuals are pro-
tected while they are patients in all public and private facilities or
while they are living in the community, including in their own
homes. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula based
on population and relative per capita incomes.
National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative
The Committee provides $98,887,000 for the National Child
Traumatic Stress Initiative, which develops and promotes effective
treatment and services for children and adolescents exposed to a
wide array of traumatic events.
The Committee supports the National Child Traumatic Stress
Network [NCTSN] for building, evaluating, disseminating, and de-
livering evidence-based best practices, including through univer-
sities, hospitals, and front-line providers, to prevent and mitigate
the impact of exposure to trauma among children and families. The
Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure the network maintains its
focus on collaboration, data collection, and the provision of direct
services, and that the NCTSN mission or grant opportunities not
be limited to training only.
181
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics [CCBHC]
The Committee includes $385,500,000 for the CCBHC expansion
program, which allows communities to improve access to mental
health and substance use disorder treatment services.
The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to prioritize re-
sources to entities within States that are able to quickly stand-up
a CCBHC, including those part of the demonstration authorized by

Section 26:
section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014
[PAMA] (Public Law 113–93).
Accreditation.—The Committee urges SAMHSA to examine and
approve accreditation products that certify CCBHCs in having met
requirements as established by SAMHSA. CCBHC grantees should
receive independent accreditation from an approved entity as part
of participation under this program. Funding included under this
program is permitted for grantees’ use to obtain any such required
independent accreditation in lieu of self-attestation for meeting the
CCBHC requirements as a part of reducing paperwork and admin-
istrative burden, and SAMHSA shall consider the costs of accredi-
tation when establishing funding levels for clinics under this grant.
The Committee further permits SAMHSA to use funds under this
program to establish the accreditation process and expand the au-
diences eligible to receive training and technical assistance, to in-
clude (but not limited to) demonstration CCBHCs and CCBHCs
participating in a State-led implementation effort under a Medicaid
State Plan Amendment, waiver, or other Medicaid authority.
Data Infrastructure.—The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
develop a CCBHC data infrastructure and data repository program
while establishing a data reporting partnership with at least one
State currently operating a Statewide CCBHC network. With more
than 500 CCBHCs operating in 46 States, it is incumbent upon the
agency to assure a high level of accountability in concert with ex-
panded access to intensive community-based services for persons
with serious mental illness and substance use disorders. Within 90
days of enactment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing
from SAMHSA on opportunities to undertake this project using the
funds provided.
Integrated Care.—The Committee recognizes that individuals liv-
ing with serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders face
higher risks for developing chronic physical conditions commonly
associated with long-term use of certain mental health medications,
including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and medication-induced
movement disorders. The Committee provides $500,000 to expand
technical assistance to improve integrated care through the
CCBHC State Technical Assistance Center and the CCBHC Expan-
sion Grantee National Training and Technical Assistance Center.
This technical assistance and training will enhance routine screen-
ing, prevention, and early intervention for physical health condi-
tions commonly associated with long-term use of antipsychotic
medications.
Eligible Audiences.—In alignment with the President’s budget re-
quest, the Committee affirms that funding under this line may be
used to support CCBHC technical assistance for CCBHC expansion
grant recipients, State CCBHCs outside of the expansion program,
States in the CCBHC Demonstration program, States planning to
182
be part of the Demonstration, States with CCBHC programs inde-
pendent of the Demonstration, and States considering adopting the
CCBHC model.
Planning Grants.—The Committee permits SAMHSA to use
funds under this program for cooperative agreements for CCBHC
State planning grants, authorized by section 223(c) of PAMA (Pub-
lic Law 113–93), to support States in developing and implementing
certification systems for CCBHCs, establish Prospective Payment
Systems for Medicaid reimbursable behavioral health services, and
prepare an application to participate in a 4-year CCBHC Dem-
onstration program.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,159,298,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,184,298,000
The Committee provides $4,184,298,000 for substance use dis-
order services and treatment programs, including PRNS and the
substance use prevention and treatment block grant to the States.
The Committee includes $81,200,000 in transfers available under

Section 27:
section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended).
Programs of Regional and National Significance
The Committee provides $561,219,000 for PRNS within the Cen-
ter for Substance Abuse Treatment. The Committee includes
$2,000,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act
(Public Law 78–410 as amended).
PRNS include activities to increase capacity by implementing
service improvements using proven evidence-based approaches, as
well as science-to-services activities that promote the identification
of practices thought to have potential for broad service improve-
ment.
Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:

Building Communities of Recovery and Peer Support Networks.—
The Committee urges SAMHSA to promote the expansion of recov-
ery support services and to reduce stigma associated with sub-
stance use disorders. The Committee recognizes the coordinated ef-
forts of this program to connect people in recovery to a wide array
of community resources, including housing services, primary care,
employment resources, among others, and urges the program to ex-
pand its reach to others in need of support. To further support
these recovery community organizations, the Committee continues
$2,000,000 for the National Peer Run Training and Technical As-
sistance Center to provide addiction recovery support to peer net-
works and recovery communities.
Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers.—The Committee in-
cludes $7,000,000, to help ensure that people with substance use
disorders can access proper treatment, as authorized by section
7121 of the SUPPORT Act.
Drug Courts.—The Committee provides $74,000,000 for Drug
Courts. The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to ensure that
all funding for drug treatment activities is allocated to serve people
diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their primary condition.
SAMHSA is further directed to ensure that all drug court recipi-
ents work with the corresponding State alcohol and drug agency in
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the grant. The
Committee further directs SAMHSA to expand training and tech-
nical assistance to drug treatment court grant recipients to ensure
evidence-based practices are fully implemented.
Emergency Department Alternatives to Opioids.—The Committee
includes $8,000,000 to award grants to hospitals and emergency de-
partments to develop, implement, enhance, or study alternatives to
opioids for pain management in such settings as authorized in sec-
tion 7091 of the SUPPORT Act.
First Responder Training.—The Committee provides $59,000,000
for First Responder Training grants. Of this amount, $34,000,000
is set aside for rural communities with high rates of substance use.
In addition, $13,500,000 of this funding is provided to make awards
through a new award competition to rural public and non-profit fire
and EMS agencies to train and recruit staff, provide education, and
purchase equipment (including medications such as naloxone and
protective equipment) as recently reauthorized in the Supporting
and Improving Rural EMS Needs Reauthorization Act (Public Law
118–84). The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure funding is for
new awardees and allows awards in amounts less than the max-
imum award amount to ensure nationwide funding.
Grants to Prevent Prescription Drugs/Opioid Overdoses.—The
Committee recognizes that the number of young Americans dying
due to opioid overdose is rising. The Committee acknowledges the
existing Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdoses pro-
184
gram and encourages the Secretary to expand eligibility to provide
schools access to this program for training and for opioid overdose
reversal agents, such as naloxone.
Medication-Assisted Treatment.—The Committee includes
$111,000,000 for medication-assisted treatment, of which
$14,500,000 is for grants to Indian Tribes, tribal organizations, or
consortia. These grants should target States with the highest age
adjusted rates of admissions, including those that have dem-
onstrated a dramatic age-adjusted increase in admissions for the
treatment of opioid use disorders. The Committee continues to di-
rect the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to ensure that
these grants include as an allowable use the support of medication-
assisted treatment and other clinically appropriate services to
achieve and maintain abstinence from all opioids, including pro-
grams that offer low-barrier or same day treatment options.
Medications for Opioid Use Disorder.—The Committee urges
SAMHSA to include as an allowable use of funds all FDA approved
medications for opioid use disorder and overdose reversal and other
clinically appropriate services to treat opioid use disorder.
Minority Fellowship Program.—The Committee includes
$7,136,000 to support grants that will increase the number of cul-
turally competent behavioral health professionals who teach, ad-
minister, conduct services research, and provide direct substance
use disorder treatment services for minority populations that are
underserved.
Opioid Treatment Program and Regulatory Activities.—The Com-
mittee is aware of the important work conducted by the Division
of Pharmacologic Therapies [DPT] to facilitate the use of medica-
tions for opioid use disorders in combination with other evidence-
based treatment and recovery support services. The Committee is
also aware of the important role State alcohol and drug agencies
play in leading this work at the State level. Therefore, the Com-
mittee urges CSAT/DPT to coordinate consistently with State alco-
hol and drug agencies across DPT’s portfolio to ensure maximum
efficiency and effectiveness.
Opioid Use Disorder Recurrence.—The Committee is concerned
that relapse following withdrawal management from opioids is a
contributing factor to the overdose crisis. The Committee appre-
ciates SAMHSA’s efforts to address this within the Federal grant
population by emphasizing the potential benefits of withdrawal
management for opioid use disorder followed by medication to pre-
vent recurrence and encourages SAMHSA to disseminate and im-
plement this policy in all settings where withdrawal management
is offered, including opioid treatment programs, rehabilitation cen-
ters, and criminal justice settings.
Opioid Use in Rural Communities.—The Committee is aware
that response to the opioid use disorder crisis continues to pose
unique challenges for rural America. Rural areas can struggle with
limited access to care and there is a shortage of health profes-
sionals necessary for identifying, diagnosing, and treating patients
with substance use disorders, as well as assisting individuals in re-
covery. As a result, responding to the opioid crisis in rural America
requires a comprehensive approach, which may involve: an inte-
grated approach to care; collaboration when appropriate with pa-
185
tients and their families; involvement of community partners and
institutions; advancing competency and skills development for
healthcare providers treating people with substance use disorders;
training to provide care in a culturally responsive manner; and the
use of technologies to ensure improved access to medically under-
served areas through the use of telehealth and the addition of
treatment programs where feasible. The Committee encourages
SAMHSA to support initiatives to advance these objectives, specifi-
cally focusing on addressing the needs of individuals with sub-
stance use disorders in rural and medically-underserved areas, as
well as programs that emphasize a comprehensive community-
based approach involving academic institutions, healthcare pro-
viders, and local criminal justice systems.
Pregnant and Postpartum Women Program.—The Committee in-
cludes $38,931,000 for the Pregnant and Postpartum Women pro-
gram, which uses a family-centered approach to provide com-
prehensive residential substance use disorder treatment services
for pregnant and postpartum women, their minor children, and
other family members. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
prioritize States that support best-practice collaborative models for
the treatment and support of pregnant women with opioid use dis-
orders.
Substance Use Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to
Treatment [SBIRT].—The Committee understands that substance
use disorders, including opioid use, typically begin in adolescence,
and that preventing early substance use is an effective strategy to
prevent problems later in life. The Committee is also aware that
SBIRT has been shown to be a cost-effective model for reducing
and preventing underage drinking and other substance use but
that many health providers, especially pediatricians and those in
underserved communities, have not been trained to use the method
effectively. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to use funds for
the adoption of SBIRT protocols in primary care and other appro-
priate settings that serve youth 12 to 21 years of age, as well as
for the adoption of system-level approaches to facilitate the uptake
of SBIRT into routine healthcare visits for adults.
Treatment Assistance for Localities.—The Committee recognizes
the use of peer recovery specialists and mutual aid recovery pro-
grams that support medication-assisted treatment and directs
SAMHSA to support evidence-based, self-empowering, mutual aid
recovery support programs that expressly support medications for
substance use disorder treatment in its grant programs.
Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support.—The Committee
includes $12,000,000 for SAMHSA to continue implementation of

Section 28:
section 7183 of the SUPPORT Act. Additionally, the Committee en-
courages SAMHSA to review the workforce categories eligible for
funding under the Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support
Grant and report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment
of this act on the percentage of current funding allocated to the de-
velopment and training of substance use disorder providers. Sub-
stance use disorder counselors serve a critical role in supporting in-
dividuals as they go through treatment, counseling, case manage-
ment, and other recovery-oriented services. The Committee encour-
ages SAMHSA to review of the eligible workforce categories under
186
this grant and include substance use disorder counselors where ap-
propriate in order to further assist communities in their ability to
grow the workforce pipeline and ultimately increase access to these
services.
Women’s Addiction Services Leadership Institute.—The Com-
mittee is aware that CSAT implemented for 10 years an important
workforce development initiative known as the Women’s Addiction
Services Leadership Institute [WASLI]. The program, which ended
in 2018 due to insufficient funding, strengthened the capacity of
emerging leaders to meet the needs of women with substance use
disorders by developing participants’ leadership skills and creating
a network of the next generation of leaders in women’s addiction
services. A total of 112 emerging leaders graduated from WASLI
and 56 coaches received training in executive coaching. The Com-
mittee supports reinstating WASLI within the Addiction Tech-
nology Transfer Centers in order to close a significant gap in Fed-
eral support to strengthen and retain the women’s substance use
disorder services workforce.
State Opioid Response [SOR] Grants
The Committee provides $1,595,000,000 for grants to States to
address the opioid crisis. Bill language provides not less than 4
percent for grants to Indian Tribes or tribal organizations. The
Committee supports the 15 percent set-aside for States with the
highest age-adjusted mortality rate related to substance use dis-
orders, as authorized in Public Law 117–328. The Assistant Sec-
retary is encouraged to apply a weighted formula within the set-
aside based on State ordinal ranking. Activities funded with this
grant may include treatment, prevention, and recovery support
services. The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to conduct a
yearly evaluation of the program to be transmitted to the Commit-
tees no later than 180 days after enactment of this act. SAMHSA
is directed to make such evaluation publicly available on
SAMHSA’s Web site. The Committee further directs SAMHSA to
continue funding technical assistance within the administrative
portion of the appropriated amounts for the SOR grants, to provide
locally based technical assistance teams as has been done through
the Opioid Response Network. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance and essential work currently being done by the Opioid Re-
sponse Network in delivering technical assistance to State and Ter-
ritory SOR grantees, sub-recipients, and others addressing opioid
use disorder and stimulant use disorder in their communities.
SOR Formula Data.—The Committee remains concerned that the
fatal overdose data used in determining the 15 percent set aside re-
flects all drug poisoning deaths, which does not accurately identify
rates of total overdoses from opioids, including fentanyl. The Com-
mittee urges the Assistant Secretary to consider using data per-
taining to opioid-specific drug overdoses.
SOR Funding Cliffs.—The Committee continues to direct
SAMHSA to avoid significant funding cliffs between States with
similar opioid mortality data and to prevent unusually large
changes in a State’s SOR allocation when compared to the prior
year’s allocation. The Committee acknowledges SAMHSA’s work to
avoid cliffs in recent funding cycles, for instance, by expanding the
187
number of States that are eligible for the 15 percent set aside.
SAMHSA shall submit to the Committees a work plan of the pro-
posed allocation of funds not later than 30 days prior to awarding
grants.
Rural Opioid Technical Assistance Regional Centers [ROTA–R]
Cooperative Agreements.—The Committee directs SAMHSA to
maintain funding for the 10 cooperative agreements under the
ROTA–R program at not less than the fiscal year 2024 level with-
out consolidation of the program.
Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services
[SUPTRS] Block Grant
The Committee provides $2,028,079,000 for the SUPTRS Block
Grant. This appropriation includes $79,200,000 in transfers avail-
able under section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as
amended).
The Committee recognizes the importance of the block grant
given its flexibility to allow States to direct resources to address
the most pressing needs. This funding stream is also critical in as-
sisting States to address all substance use disorders, including, but
not limited to, those related to alcohol, cocaine, and methamphet-
amine. In addition, States may use SUPTRS Block Grant funds to
support medications and recovery support for the treatment of alco-
hol use and other substance use disorders, including to support
peer recovery housing. The Committee also notes the importance of
the block grant’s 20 percent prevention set-aside, which is a vital
source of primary prevention funding. The block grant provides
funds to States to support alcohol and drug use prevention, treat-
ment, and rehabilitation services. Funds are allocated to States ac-
cording to a formula.
Funding Flexibilities.—To address the growing need for sub-
stance use disorder prevention and treatment, States, Territories,
and their communities have been developing innovative ways to en-
gage the millions of people with substance use disorders to access
treatment services. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to imple-
ment funding flexibilities that enables States, Territories, and their
communities the ability to roll over unused SUPTRS dollars, allow-
ing for these innovative programs to continue after they have been
implemented.
Synar Compliance.—The Synar program monitors and enforces
the prohibition on the sale or distribution of tobacco products to mi-
nors by requiring States to conduct random, unannounced inspec-
tions of tobacco retailers to prevent underage purchasing. The
Committee notes that under the new Federal Tobacco 21 law,
States that are out of compliance with Synar risk a 10 percent re-
duction in their SUPTRS Block Grant allocation. The Committee
recognizes the role of Synar implementation under Tobacco 21 to
increase tobacco retailer inspections, conduct retailer education,
and recruit additional personnel to fulfill this public health obliga-
tion.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION

The Committee provides $236,879,000 for the Center for Sub-
stance Abuse Prevention [CSAP], the sole Federal organization
with responsibility for improving accessibility and quality of sub-
stance use prevention services.
The Committee continues to instruct SAMHSA to ensure that all
the funding provided to CSAP, as well as the 20 percent prevention
set aside in the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recov-
ery Services Block Grant, be used only for evidence-based sub-
stance use prevention activities.
Programs of Regional and National Significance
The Committee provides $236,879,000 for PRNS within CSAP.
These programs support the development of new practice knowl-
edge on substance use prevention; identification of proven effective
models; dissemination of science-based intervention information;
State and community capacity building for implementation of prov-
en, effective substance use prevention programs; and programs ad-
dressing new needs in the prevention system.
Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:

Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Prevention of Under-
age Drinking [ICCPUD].—The Committee understands ICCPUD
funding has been used for activities that fall outside its authoriza-
tion as specified in Public Law 109–422. The funding provided in
this act for ICCPUD shall only be used for the purpose of pre-
venting or reducing underage drinking and not for any other pur-
pose.
Minority Fellowship Program Support for Prevention Work-
force.—The Committee directs SAMHSA to award $1,321,000 in
Minority Fellowship Program funds to support a separate preven-
tion fellowship program that will increase the number of culturally
competent prevention specialists to help expand prevention pro-
gramming for underserved minority populations.
Prevention Technology Transfer Centers [PTTC] Network.—The
Committee supports the work of the PTTC Network and efforts re-
lated to certified prevention specialists and the Prevention Fellow-
ship program. This program supported 16 early career prevention
fellows throughout each HHS region where they gained hands on
experience working in State alcohol and drug agencies. Fellows,
189
coached by mentors, developed leadership skills; received training
in professional development; acquired proficiency in core com-
petencies to prepare for certified prevention specialist exams; and
prepared for employment opportunities in the substance use pre-
vention field.
Strategic Prevention Framework.—The Committee provides
$135,484,000 for the Strategic Prevention Framework. Within the
total provided, $125,484,000 is for the Strategic Prevention Frame-
work-Partnerships for Success program, and $10,000,000 is for
Strategic Prevention Framework-Rx. The Strategic Prevention
Framework is designed to prevent the onset of substance misuse
while strengthening prevention capacity and infrastructure at the
State, community, and tribal levels. The Committee recognizes that
substance use prevention is underutilized relative to its ability to
prevent and delay substance use initiation, as well as slow the
pathways to addiction and overdose, and that demand for commu-
nity-based primary prevention resources far outpaces available
funding.
Sober Truth on Preventing [STOP] Underage Drinking Act.—The
Committee provides $14,500,000 for the STOP Act. Of this funding,
$11,000,000 is for community-based coalition enhancement grants,
$2,500,000 is for the National media campaign, and $1,000,000 is
for the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of
Underage Drinking.
Tribal Behavioral Health Grants.—SAMHSA has administered
Tribal Behavioral Health Grants for mental health and substance
use prevention and treatment for Tribes and tribal organizations
since fiscal year 2014. In light of the continued growth of this pro-
gram, as well as the urgent need among tribal populations, the
Committee continues to urge the Assistant Secretary for SAMHSA
to engage with Tribes on ways to maximize participation in this
program.
HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $169.583,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 207,294,000
The Committee provides $207,294,000 for Health Surveillance
and Program Support activities. The Committee includes
$31,428,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS
Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended).
This activity supports Federal staff and the administrative func-
tions of the agency. It also provides funding to SAMHSA’s surveil-
lance and data collection activities, including national surveys such
as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Within the total provided for Health Surveillance and Program

Block Grant Reporting Requirements.—The Committee acknowl-
edges the important role of the Community Mental Health Services
and Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services
Block Grants in supporting States’ efforts to provide resources for
expanded mental health and substance use disorder treatment and
prevention services. The Committee reiterates the request for a re-
port, as included in Public Law 118–47, regarding the lack of trans-
parency and information that is provided to Congress and the pub-
lic about how States are distributing those funds and for what pro-
grams or services they are being used.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—Within the funds included
in this account, $54,611,000 are for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending Items’’ at the end of this Committee Report.
Drug Abuse Warning Network.—The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for the Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN]. Au-
thorized by the 21st Century Cures Act, DAWN is a surveillance
system to monitor emergency department visits in order to help
public health workers, policy makers, and other stakeholders re-
spond effectively to emerging substance use trends.
Health Information Technology.—The Committee understands
that adoption of health information technology [health IT] among
behavioral health providers currently lags behind that of other pro-
vider types and recognizes the benefits of advancing health IT in
behavioral healthcare settings. The Committee supports the efforts
of the Behavioral Health Information Technology Initiative to pilot
the inclusion of behavioral health data elements in health IT with-
in the SUPTRS and Mental Health block grants. The Committee
encourages SAMHSA to explore providing States with flexibility
within the block grant administrative cap to pursue the additional
incorporation of health IT.
National Survey on Drug Use and Health [NSDUH].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of the NSDUH for providing crit-
ical data to inform best practices and public policy on mental
health and substance use. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
continue collecting this data and analyzing trends for high-risk
populations.
Program Support.—The Committee includes $67,600,000 for pro-
gram support, to ensure SAMHSA has the resources and staff to
further its mission.
AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $369,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 345,380,000
The Committee provides $345,380,000 for the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ]. This funding is com-
bined with $133,000,000 in mandatory funding from the Patient-
Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. AHRQ’s mission is to en-
191
hance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health
services, as well as access to such services. AHRQ conducts, sup-
ports, and disseminates scientific and policy-relevant research on
topics, such as promoting high-quality care and patient safety,
eliminating healthcare disparities, using information technology,
and evaluating the effectiveness of clinical services.

HEALTH COSTS, QUALITY, AND OUTCOMES
Health costs, quality, and outcomes [HCQO] research activity is
focused on improving clinical practice, strengthening the healthcare
system’s capacity to deliver quality care, and tracking progress to-
ward health goals through monitoring and evaluation.
Within the total provided for HCQO, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:
Center for Primary Care Research.—The Committee includes no
less than $2,000,000 for the Center for Primary Care Research au-
thorized by 42 U.S.C. 299b–4(b). The Center supports clinical pri-
mary care research, as well as strategies to improve primary care
delivery and advance the development of primary care researchers.
The Committee supports efforts to coordinate research in areas
such as multiple chronic conditions, symptom syndromes such as
Long COVID, behavioral and social health integration, telehealth
in primary care, shared decision-making, and patient experience of
care. The areas of focus should include, but not be limited to, ex-
panding research on persons with multiple co-morbid conditions
and improving primary care in rural and underserved areas and
health equity.
Improving Maternal Health.—The Committee continues to sup-
port AHRQ efforts to address the complex challenges of ensuring
safe and healthy pregnancies and childbirth, particularly for under-
served women who are at substantially higher risk of complication
and death.
Long COVID.—The extensive incidence of individuals suffering
from Long COVID (post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV–2 infection
[PASC]) presents an ongoing challenge to the healthcare system,
patients, and their caregivers. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $10,000,000 to continue the work of the Long COVID Cen-
ters of Excellence and the Long COVID Care Network. The Com-
mittee continues to direct AHRQ to coordinate these efforts with
other federally funded Long COVID research initiatives and to en-
courage robust data collection and data sharing efforts among
agencies and grantees.
Menopause Research.—The Committee provides $5,000,000 for a
Menopause Research to Action Network to scale and accelerate ex-
192
isting and emerging research evidence and care delivery models
into routine clinical practice. The Network shall focus on improving
treatment and management of perimenopause and menopausal
symptoms, as well as related chronic conditions to help improve
mid-life health outcomes among women. In doing so, the Com-
mittee directs AHRQ to: (1) prioritize projects that propose scaling
up evidence-based interventions that have demonstrated potential
for improving care delivery and outcomes; (2) ensure the Network
has the capability to collect and disseminate new findings and best
practices widely, including to rural and underserved areas; and (3)
coordinate these efforts with other Federal healthcare agencies.
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease
[MASLD].—The Committee acknowledges the public health burden
of MASLD and values having a comprehensive understanding of
MASLD. Therefore, the Committee encourages AHRQ, in collabora-
tion with other relevant Federal agency stakeholders, to evaluate
the prevalence, diagnoses, treatments, and complications associated
with MASLD. The Committee requests that such study: (1) assess
the prevalence of MASLD in the United States; (2) assess the costs
associated with individuals diagnosed with MASLD, including the
costs to patients, families, and government programs; (3) assess the
costs and impact on patients and the healthcare system if MASLD
is unaddressed and progresses to metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatohepatitis [MASH], liver failure, poor liver function, or liver
transplant; (4) identify and address barriers to preventing, diag-
nosing, and treating MASLD and MASH; and (5) include an anal-
ysis of any disparities in access to care and other outcomes, such
as health status, among minority populations. The Committee re-
quests that AHRQ provide an interim report on the findings of this
study in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Opioid Research.—The Committee supports AHRQ’s continued
research regarding opioid and substance use disorders, including
efforts focused on management of substance use disorders in pri-
mary care settings.
Patient Safety Data Platform.—The Committee continues to sup-
port AHRQ’s research to address failures in the diagnostic process
and to support continuing and new research to: (1) understand why
diagnostic adverse events occur; and (2) develop interventions, sys-
tems, measures, and new technology solutions to improve diag-
nostic safety and quality. Further, the Committee includes no less
than $4,000,000 to support an accessible Web based, evidence-
based patient safety data platform that provides a comprehensive
compendium of the most up-to-date information on best practices
and evidence-based protocols, research, case studies, and other re-
ports that contribute to improving patient outcomes and strength-
ening health system safety. The platform should be designed to
capture best practices and other relevant information across all
care settings, including out-patient settings and home healthcare,
and should include content that is specifically designed for patients
and their caregivers that is available in a format they can easily
access and understand.
193
United States Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF]
The Committee recommends $11,542,000 for the United States
Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], which works to improve
the health of people nationwide by making evidence-based rec-
ommendations about clinical preventive services. The USPSTF is
comprised of independent national experts in preventive medicine
and primary care who volunteer to serve the public interest. The
Committee directs the members of the USPSTF to continue to up-
hold their mission and commitment to scientific evidence, trans-
parency, and ensuring that Americans have access to affordable
preventive health services supported by a preponderance of sci-
entific evidence.
Medical Innovations.—The Committee continues to note concern
with the USPSTF’s ability to keep pace with medical innovation.
Emerging and innovative screening modalities can further public
health for all Americans and address health inequities by improv-
ing timely access to and compliance with USPSTF-recommended
screenings. The Committee continues to encourage the USPSTF to
utilize the Early Topic Update process described in the USPSTF
procedure manual to review a recommendation on an enhanced
timeframe upon a showing of new evidence. The Committee also
continues to urge the USPSTF to prioritize review of any new
screening test or preventive medication approved or cleared by the
FDA that is a preventive strategy or modality pertaining to, but
not included in, a previous USPSTF recommendation.
Evidence Reviews.—The Committee notes the increasingly com-
plex nature of evidence reviews for recommendations and appre-
ciates AHRQ’s prioritizing this activity within the funds provided.
MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEYS
The Committee provides $72,791,000 for Medical Expenditure
Panel Surveys [MEPS], which collect detailed information annually
from households, healthcare providers, and employers regarding
how Americans use and pay for healthcare. The data from MEPS
are used to develop estimates of healthcare utilization, expendi-
tures, sources of payment, and the degree of health insurance cov-
erage of the U.S. population.
PROGRAM SUPPORT
The Committee provides $58,480,000 for program support. This
activity funds the overall management of AHRQ, including sala-
ries, benefits, and overhead costs.
Agency Activities.—The Committee recognizes the vital role that
AHRQ plays in supporting research that informs and improves the
quality of healthcare for all Americans. The Committee encourages
the Administration to continue funding key activities to the benefit
of patients, health systems, the research enterprise, and other
stakeholders. Within 30 days of enactment and every 30 days
thereafter, AHRQ is directed to provide a monthly briefing to the
Committee on Appropriations regarding agency activities to im-
prove clinical practice and patient safety. The Committee directs
AHRQ to provide 48 hours advance notification of any significant
194
developments and public meetings, including meeting cancellations
or disbandments, related to the activities of the USPSTF.
CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES
GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAID
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................$383,609,399,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 508,148,791,000
The Committee provides $508,148,791,000 in mandatory funding
for Grants to States for Medicaid.
The fiscal year 2026 funding level excludes $261,063,820,000 in
fiscal year 2025 advance appropriations for fiscal year 2026. As re-
quested by the administration, $316,514,725,000 is provided for the
first quarter of fiscal year 2027.
The Medicaid program provides medical care for eligible low-in-
come individuals and families. It is administered by each of the 50
States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Federal
funds for medical assistance are made available to the States ac-
cording to a formula that determines the appropriate Federal
matching rate for State program costs. This matching rate is based
on the State’s average per capita income relative to the National
average and cannot be less than 50 percent.
PAYMENTS TO HEALTHCARE TRUST FUNDS
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................$521,757,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 593,817,000,000
The Committee provides $593,817,000,000 in mandatory funding
for payments to healthcare trust funds.
This entitlement account includes the general fund subsidy to
the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for
Medicare Part B benefits and for Medicare Part D drug benefits
and administration, plus other reimbursements to the Federal Hos-
pital Insurance Trust Fund for Part A benefits and related admin-
istrative costs that have not been financed by payroll taxes or pre-
mium contributions.
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,669,744,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,669,744,000
The Committee provides $3,669,744,000 for CMS program man-
agement, which includes funding for research and evaluations, pro-
gram operations and demonstrations, survey and certification pro-
grams, and Federal administration.
Program Operations
The Committee provides $2,479,823,000 for the Program Oper-
ations account, which covers a broad range of activities including
claims processing and program safeguard activities performed by
Medicare contractors. These contractors also provide information,
guidance, and technical support to both providers and beneficiaries.
Affordable Care Act Notifications.—The Committee continues bill
language requiring the administration to provide detailed enroll-
195
ment figures to the Committees on Appropriations not less than
two full business days before any public release of the information.
Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostics.—The Committee is encouraged
by innovations in diagnostic tools along with treatments for the un-
derlying biology of Alzheimer’s disease and some of its most serious
symptoms. The Committee urges CMS to help facilitate timely and
equitable beneficiary access to these diagnostic tools and services
and encourages continued collaboration between CMS and other
Federal agencies in their collective efforts to shift the standard of
care towards timely and accurate detection and diagnosis.
Alzheimer’s Disease Therapies.—The Committee continues to ex-
press disappointment with CMS’s decision to limit coverage of
FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alz-
heimer’s disease. The Committee urges CMS to reconsider the Na-
tional Coverage Determination policy to provide full access for
Medicare beneficiaries to these FDA-approved Alzheimer’s treat-
ments.
Biology Guided Radiation Therapy [BGRT].—The Committee rec-
ognizes CMS’s efforts to facilitate access to BGRT services but
notes that there are concerns regarding inadequate payment for
BGRT. The Committee encourages CMS to continue to collect ro-
bust claims data and work with stakeholders to establish appro-
priate and sufficient pricing for these services.
Biosimilars.—The Committee notes concerns about the lack of ac-
cess to lower cost biosimilars for Medicare Part D enrollees, includ-
ing the prevalence of formulary exclusions of lower priced
biosimilars and the application of step therapy by some plans. The
Committee notes the potential savings for patients and taxpayers
through swift inclusion of biosimilars on Medicare Part D
formularies. The Committee therefore urges CMS to examine exist-
ing barriers to biosimilar adoption, including Part D and Medicare
Advantage plan practices that impede access to lower priced prod-
ucts. CMS should also provide beneficiary focused education on the
availability of biosimilars on Medicare Plan Finder and real-time
benefit tools, as well as ensure guidance and regulations for Part
D formulary development and design appropriately encourage the
adoption of biosimilars with lower list prices. The Committee di-
rects CMS to make legislative recommendations in the fiscal year
2027 CJ on how Congress could address Part D plan practices that
currently impede access to lower priced products and how to im-
prove patient savings through a greater utilization of biosimilars.
Birthing Friendly Hospitals.—The Committee recognizes the
Birthing Friendly hospital designation as the first ever designation
to describe high quality maternity care and notes the importance
of assisting consumers in choosing hospitals that have dem-
onstrated a commitment to maternal health through the implemen-
tation of best practices that advance healthcare quality, safety, and
access for pregnant and postpartum patients. Within 60 days of en-
actment of this act, the Committee directs CMS to provide a brief-
ing on how the agency will support hospitals and health systems
in earning the designation, update criteria as needed, and addi-
tional steps CMS is taking to address maternal health outcomes
and improve patient care.
196
Breast Cancer Diagnostic Coverage.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of early screening and diagnostic tests for a number
of diseases, including breast cancer, which can be treated success-
fully if caught early. Under current law, health plans and health
insurance are required to provide no-cost coverage for breast cancer
screenings, but not diagnostic testing. The Committee encourages
CMS to evaluate ways to ensure that women have access to ap-
proved diagnostic tests to promote accuracy in diagnoses, lower
treatment costs, and support better outcomes.
Cardiovascular Disease [CVD].—The Committee recognizes that
one in three adults in the United States received care for a cardio-
vascular risk factor or condition in 2023 and that existing research
indicates that elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL–C]
levels can cause atherosclerotic CVD, which can lead to heart at-
tack or stroke. The Committee urges CMS to examine the impact
of adding a quality measure of appropriate LDL–C testing as part
of its Universal Foundation initiative.
Chronic Disease Management.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of coordinated and innovative strategies to address the
prevalence of chronic disease in the United States, as approxi-
mately 40 percent of Americans have multiple chronic conditions.
Despite efforts to increase awareness of certain chronic conditions,
including heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD], the Committee recognizes concerns that many primary
care clinicians lack the support and resources to provide effective
disease management. No later than 180 days after the enactment
of this act, the Committee directs CMS to provide a report on its
actions to increase beneficiary access to chronic disease manage-
ment, inform providers about available resources and payment for
chronic care management services, and identify gaps in current
quality measurement programs to support greater participation in
these programs. Further, the Committee encourages CMS to de-
velop service delivery models to increase access to high quality
chronic disease management, including COPD care.
Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD].—The Committee notes that Medi-
care spends nearly 25 percent of its annual budget on beneficiaries
with a kidney disease diagnosis. The Committee encourages CMS
to work to promote access to early screenings, testing, and diag-
nosis for individuals at high-risk for developing CKD, including fo-
cused efforts on reaching individuals who have developed CKD but
have not yet reached end-stage renal disease.
Coding Intensity.—The Committee notes that Medicare Advan-
tage [MA] payments are risk-adjusted to provide sufficient re-
sources to deliver comprehensive care for individuals with complex
health needs. CMS applies the intensity adjustment equally to all
MA health plans, regardless of the variance in coding intensity
that exists. The Committee encourages CMS to work with Congress
and relevant stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of imple-
menting reforms to coding intensity adjustments that have the po-
tential to enhance payment accuracy and protect patient access.
Cognitive Impairment.—The Committee directs CMS to include a
report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ identifying actions the agency can
take, within existing authorities, to improve early detection of mild
cognitive impairment [MCI] as part of the Medicare Annual
197
Wellness Visit [AWV] and the annual Initial Preventive Physical
Exam [IPPE]. This review should include opportunities to improve
early detection of MCI during the AWV and IPPE by ensuring the
use of evidence-based, reliable, cognitive impairment detection tools
identified by the National Institute on Aging.
Colorectal Cancer Screenings.—The Committee appreciates
CMS’s efforts to reduce barriers to colorectal cancer screening.
However, the Committee remains concerned about increases in
colon cancer incidence and death rates, especially among individ-
uals younger than age 50. The Committee highlights the rec-
ommendation of the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal
Cancer that after the initial screening, asymptomatic individuals
with a personal history of polyps should receive more frequent
colonoscopy exams given the increased risk of new polyps. The
Committee encourages CMS to consider this and other evidence-
based data when reviewing guidelines on colorectal cancer screen-
ing frequency.
Additionally, the Committee is concerned that current implemen-
tation of the Affordable Care Act preventive services mandate does
not consistently guarantee first-dollar coverage of all FDA-ap-
proved bowel preparations when prescribed in connection with a
screening colonoscopy. The Committee encourages CMS to update
its 2016 guidance to clarify coverage of all FDA-approved
colonoscopy preparation products that meet established medical ef-
ficacy guidelines.
Convenient Access Standards.—The Committee notes that exist-
ing convenient access standards for Medicare Part D beneficiaries
based on geographic distance may not take into account all meth-
ods of access to medications. The Committee encourages CMS to
consider appropriate updates to the existing network adequacy
standards and to provide feedback, information, and technical as-
sistance to Congress on policies that could improve patient access
to drugs and pharmacist services, including potential changes to
Part D network adequacy standards.
Critical Access Hospital [CAH] Recertification.—The Committee
acknowledges the importance of CAH designation as a lifeline for
hospitals in rural and remote locations and understands that losing
this status, including through the review and recertification proc-
ess, could jeopardize the viability of facilities that are already oper-
ating on thin financial margins, which could create voids in access
to care for patients in these communities. The Committee directs
CMS to use its existing authorities to work with hospitals that are
expected to lose their CAH designation or have had their CAH des-
ignation revoked within the last 2 years, particularly those hos-
pitals affected by the mileage requirement, to help support con-
tinuity of operations and availability of care at those facilities. The
Committee also directs CMS to consider the proximity of Rural
Emergency Hospitals and classify Rural Emergency Hospitals as a
hospital when recertifying CAHs. Finally, the Committee directs
CMS to provide a report within 180 days of enactment of this act
on the agency’s decision to update the definition of primary roads
in the CY 2023 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System
final rule and the effects of the regulatory change on the number
of CAHs recertified.
198
Disproportionate Share Hospital [DSH] Payments.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that the Federal Medicaid statute generally re-
quires DSH payments to hospitals treating large numbers of low
income patients in every State except Tennessee. The Committee
is concerned that Tennessee as the only State without permanent
funding is at a unique disadvantage and encourages the adminis-
tration to work with Congress to find a permanent solution to en-
sure a Medicaid DSH payment allotment is available to Tennessee.
Further, the Committee recognizes that some hospitals have expe-
rienced fluctuations in their Medicare DSH calculations due to a
variety of factors. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs HHS to provide a briefing on proposals or rec-
ommendations for hospitals to better anticipate Medicare DSH
changes.
Distance to Care.—The Committee is concerned that many Medi-
care and Medicaid beneficiaries have to travel long distances to ac-
cess medical care in many communities. Within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee directs CMS to provide a report
to the Committee about the average distances that beneficiaries
have to travel to access care in each State and actions the agency
is taking to make accessing healthcare easier for beneficiaries.
Emergency Medical Treatment.—The Committee supports med-
ical providers in providing stabilizing care to patients experiencing
a medical emergency regardless of their insurance status or ability
to pay. The Committee encourages CMS to work with hospitals to
ensure that all types of stabilizing care are provided in a timely
manner to patients experiencing an emergency medical condition to
protect patient health.
Ensuring Patient Assistance Counts Toward Out-of-Pocket Lim-
its.—The Committee requests a briefing within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on CMS’s enforcement of the rule in the 2020 HHS
Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters requiring that cost
sharing assistance paid by drug manufacturers on behalf of pa-
tients to reduce their out-of-pocket costs be counted toward the an-
nual limitation on cost sharing.
Essential Medical Devices.—The Committee is concerned by the
healthcare system’s increased reliance on Chinese-made medical
devices and supplies, which could negatively impact domestic man-
ufacturing capacity. The Committee supports efforts to promote
purchases of American-made medical devices and is similarly en-
couraged by CMS payment policies to provide new payment adjust-
ments to hospitals for their share of additional costs incurred for
certain supplies, such as domestically made N95 respirators. The
Committee requests a briefing 1 year after enactment of this act
on the payments for domestic N95 respirator procurement and ad-
ditional efforts by CMS to support domestic procurement of essen-
tial medical devices and supplies, including any new or proposed
supplemental payments for essential medical devices.
Generic Drug Shortages.—The Committee is concerned about ge-
neric drug shortages, particularly those impacting generic sterile
injectables, which include many cancer drugs, emergency medi-
cines, and anesthesiology medications. The Committee encourages
CMS to work with Congress and relevant stakeholders on ana-
lyzing Medicare and Medicaid payment policies’ impact on supply
199
chains and economic incentives for generic drug suppliers, whole-
salers, and healthcare providers.
Genetically Targeted Technologies.—Genetically targeted drugs
include a set of complex small molecule products that target pre-
dominantly rare, genetic-based diseases but can also target broader
populations in novel ways. The Committee recognizes concerns that
subjecting these highly complex drugs to negotiation so early in
their commercialization could disproportionally impact the use of
genetically targeted drugs to treat diseases with high unmet med-
ical need. The Committee encourages CMS to work with stake-
holders to address these considerations.
Graduate Medical Education [GME].—The Committee notes that
Congress has authorized additional GME Medicare positions in re-
cent years for four categories of hospitals: hospitals located in rural
areas; hospitals currently training over their caps; hospitals located
in States with new medical schools; and hospitals serving Health
Professional Shortage Areas [HPSAs]. Within the HPSA category,
the Committee encourages CMS to examine priority consideration
of future slot distribution to teaching hospitals associated with His-
torically Black Medical Schools or facilities physically located in
rural areas.
Ground Ambulance Data Collection.—The Committee recognizes
the work of CMS in establishing the first round of the Ground Am-
bulance Data Collection System and supports ongoing data collec-
tion efforts, including efforts to address stakeholder concerns. The
Committee notes that the Secretary may modify the data collection
instrument to address concerns and directs the Secretary to make
such data publicly available on its Web site, consistent with public
reporting requirements.
Health Insurance Exchange.—The Committee continues bill lan-
guage that requires CMS to provide cost information for the fol-
lowing: Federal Payroll and Other Administrative Costs; Exchange
related Information Technology [IT]; Non-IT Program Costs, includ-
ing Health Plan Benefit and Rate Review, Exchange Oversight,
Payment and Financial Management, Eligibility and Enrollment;
Consumer Information and Outreach, including the Call Center,
Navigator Grants and Consumer Education and Outreach; Ex-
change Quality Review; Small Business Health Options Program
and Employer Activities; and Other Exchange Activities. Cost infor-
mation should be provided for each fiscal year since the enactment
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [ACA]. CMS is
also required to include the estimated costs for fiscal year 2027.
Home and Community-Based Services [HCBS].—The Committee
is supportive of efforts to increase access to care in homes and com-
munities, which includes support for family caregivers and direct
care workers that provide essential care and services. Within exist-
ing resources, the Committee urges CMS to strengthen and expand
access to HCBS, facilitate State planning, encourage innovative
models that benefit the workforce and care recipients, and support
quality and accountability. Further, the Committee encourages
CMS to issue guidance outlining how States can implement inten-
sive home and community-based behavioral health services to ad-
dress the growing behavioral and mental health crisis. The Com-
mittee urges CMS to include in such guidance information regard-
200
ing: (1) best practices from States that have improved the avail-
ability of home and community-based mental health and substance
use disorder services; and (2) potential options for financing and
expanding access to home and community-based mental health and
substance use disorder services.
Hospice and Dementia Care.—The Committee recognizes the
value of hospice care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Re-
lated Dementias [ADRD], including hospice’s potential to both im-
prove quality of life and reduce Medicare expenditures. The Com-
mittee encourages CMS to work with Congress and relevant stake-
holders to ensure that Medicare’s enrollment and eligibility proc-
esses consider the unique nature of dementia care, including by re-
ducing unnecessary barriers to services. The Committee directs
CMS to provide a report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on its efforts
to analyze and address access challenges, including those that may
result from existing protocols or processes, for beneficiaries with
ADRD.
HPV Screenings for Cervical Cancer.—The Committee recognizes
that self-collection has the potential to reach individuals who are
never screened or under screened for HPV, which makes up about
half of women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the
United States. The Committee urges CMS to examine ways to en-
sure that there is appropriate coverage for this screening method-
ology upon FDA approval.
Insulin Pumps.—The Committee recognizes the importance of en-
suring Medicare coverage policies are consistent with current clin-
ical standards of care, including for those with diabetes. The Com-
mittee encourages CMS to review its coverage policies for insulin
pumps to ensure that all requirements, including the measurement
of C-peptide levels or antibody tests, are consistent with clinical
standards of care. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs CMS to provide a briefing on Medicare coverage
of medical devices used to manage diabetes, including insulin
pumps.
Long-term Care Facility Metrics.—The Committee supports ef-
forts to improve the quality of care and outcomes for individuals
served by long-term care facilities, including skilled nursing facili-
ties, and recognizes that many residents of these facilities have a
range of chronic and disabling conditions, including
neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias, neurodegenerative disorders, and serious
mental health issues. In 2021, the HHS Office of Inspector General
found that the current CMS measures related to the use of
antipsychotics are insufficient and do not distinguish appropriate
from inappropriate use. CMS is directed to closely examine the rec-
ommendations from the Inspector General, continue collecting data
on the use of the medications, ensure sufficient documentation by
the patient’s physician and independent facility pharmacist to dem-
onstrate appropriate use of antipsychotics in skilled nursing facili-
ties, and focus oversight on facilities in which trends may signal in-
appropriate use. The Committee requests that CMS provide an up-
date on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Maternal Health.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
rural hospitals in providing maternal healthcare services, edu-
201
cating patients, and ensuring postpartum safety. The Committee is
concerned that insufficient reimbursement, coupled with difficulties
in maternity care provider recruitment and retention, threaten the
viability of these services in rural hospitals. Such factors have con-
tributed to the closures of labor and delivery departments and
growing maternal health deserts. The Committee directs CMS to
provide a briefing to the Committee within 180 days of enactment
of this act detailing insights into closures of labor and delivery de-
partments.
Medicare Payment Systems Modernization [MPSM] Fund.—The
Committee supports efforts by CMS to modernize Medicare’s fee-
for-service claims processing systems portfolio. Doing so will help
the agency lay important groundwork for continued improvements
and efficiencies in service delivery and payments for Medicare
beneficiaries, providers, and claims processors. The Committee di-
rects CMS to include in its fiscal year 2027 CJ status updates on
all ongoing projects undertaken by CMS with respect to MPSM.
Merit-Based Incentive Payment System [MIPS] Feedback Re-
ports.—The Committee urges CMS to improve timely access to
MIPS feedback reports and claims data for providers, consistent
with existing law. In doing so, the Committee requests an update
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on actions CMS has taken to utilize
measures developed by national medical specialty societies, includ-
ing qualified clinical data registries maintained by national medical
specialty societies, for MIPS, MIPs Value Pathways, and alter-
native payment model reporting.
Mobile Stroke Units.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of mobile stroke units [MSUs] in diagnosing and treating acute
strokes in a prehospital setting. The Committee encourages CMS
to examine policies to provide appropriate access to MSU services,
including CT scans and medications, as well as policies that reflect
the unique nature of treatment in a MSU.
Non-addictive Opioid Alternatives.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the high mortality rate due to the opioid overdose epi-
demic and is pleased that FDA approved its first non-addictive
opioid alternative this year. The Committee, however, is concerned
that significant barriers continue to exist for beneficiaries’ access to
treatment for chronic pain. The Committee encourages CMS to
work with Congress on efforts to facilitate access to non-addictive
alternatives to opioids for acute pain treatment and management
and requests a briefing no later than 180 days after enactment of
this act on these efforts.
Non-pharmacologic Treatments for Pain.—Non-pharmacologic
treatments for pain management have shown to be effective in re-
ducing pain and reliance on prescription opioids. The Committee
encourages CMS to support access to non-pharmacologic treat-
ments, like osteopathic manipulative treatment and other alter-
native treatments as appropriate, for back and other pain.
Nutrition Interventions.—The Committee recognizes that healthy
foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, are key to individual
health and well-being, however cost can be a barrier for lower in-
come individuals. Nutrition support interventions, such as produce
prescriptions and medically tailored meals, continue to show great
promise in improving health among food insecure individuals who
202
suffer from chronic, diet-related conditions such as heart disease
and diabetes. Several States have received CMS approval to cover
certain nutritional supports and other services to address health
related social needs in certain circumstances; and in November of
2023, CMS published additional guidance and a framework out-
lining these State opportunities. The Committee encourages CMS,
in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health, to partner with stakeholder organizations, including quali-
fied academic institutions, to assist States in implementing nutri-
tional support and other health related social needs initiatives to
increase access to healthy foods.
Organ Procurement Organization [OPO] Performance.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that in recent years, CMS has taken steps to in-
crease oversight of OPOs, including by establishing new methods
to evaluate performance and issuing rules to decertify OPOs falling
below the median performance on certain metrics. The Committee
remains extremely concerned by the findings of a recent investiga-
tion by HHS that revealed practices by a major OPO that com-
promised patient safety. CMS has a considerable responsibility for
ensuring that OPOs operate in a safe, fair, and efficient manner
that is transparent, accountable, and effective. Patients are also at
risk if OPOs are unable to operate due to stringent or unworkable
requirements from CMS. As CMS continues to work with OPOs to
ensure that the organ donation system promotes patient safety and
operates effectively, the Committee encourages the agency to
prioritize outreach and education to stakeholders; alleviate disrup-
tion; ensure that OPOs can effectively expand into new service
areas, when necessary; and issue clarifying guidance. CMS is di-
rected to continue to promote accountability, identify
vulnerabilities, and issue strict corrective actions as needed to en-
sure that any donation processes do not continue if patient safety
concerns arise.
Organ Recovery Cost Reimbursement.—The Committee notes that
OPO Recovery Centers can increase the number of organs available
for transplantation and intensive care unit bed capacity for living
patients. The Committee recognizes that there are concerns with
the current reimbursement methodology for organ transportation
and recovery, including concerns that the methodology may serve
as a financial disincentive to utilize OPO Recovery Centers effec-
tively. Therefore, the Committee encourages CMS to assess exist-
ing policies to ensure that transplant centers are appropriately re-
imbursed for furnishing deceased donor organ management and re-
covery services.
Peripheral Artery Disease [PAD] Amputation Prevention Initia-
tive.—An estimated 21.0 million Americans have PAD, and ap-
proximately 200,000 of them suffer avoidable amputations every
year because of the disease. CMS is encouraged to promote ampu-
tation prevention services at hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers,
and office-based centers that focus on: (1) patient risk modification
and management; (2) early screening, detection, and surveillance;
(3) testing and treatment for PAD; and (4) improving care coordina-
tion for individuals at high risk for amputation.
Pharmacy Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees.—The Com-
mittee is concerned about the dramatic increase of retroactive
203
pharmacy price concessions commonly referred to as ‘‘pharmacy di-
rect and indirect remuneration [DIR] fees’’ in Medicare Part D. The
fees are often assessed weeks or even months after a prescription
has been filled, preventing pharmacies from knowing at the time
of dispensing what their true reimbursement will be for that pre-
scription. The Committee commends HHS and CMS for aiming to
address the DIR issue and urges continued administrative action
and oversight to further address this issue while working to pre-
vent financial strain on community pharmacies.
Physician Fee Schedule Codes.—When adjusting the number of
relative value units needed to account for coding changes, new data
on relative value components, or payment for new services, the
Committee notes that CMS may overestimate or underestimate uti-
lization, and therefore the overall cost of such changes, resulting in
substantial adjustments to physician fee schedule payments re-
quired by budget neutrality. The Committee encourages GAO to
study CMS estimates of the utilization of selected new fee schedule
codes over the last 10 years, data on related adjustments to the fee
schedule for these years, the effects of CMS utilization estimates
relative to actual utilization figures on physician fee schedule pay-
ments and spending for those services, and other items determined
appropriate by the Comptroller General.
Prescription Digital Therapeutics [PDT].—The Committee recog-
nizes the use of PDTs to treat conditions like substance use dis-
order, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, insomnia, major de-
pression, diabetes, stroke, schizophrenia, and cancer. The Com-
mittee encourages CMS to work with stakeholders and Congress to
promote appropriate access to PDTs.
Program of All-Inclusive Care.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the Program of All-Inclusive Care [PACE], which en-
ables medically complex older adults with significant long-term
care needs to remain living at home. Given the increasing need for
home and community-based care for older adults and those living
with disabilities, the Committee encourages the CMS to examine
ways to increase access to PACE services for Medicare bene-
ficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, and dually eligible individuals.
Protecting Medicare Beneficiary Access to Therapy.—The Com-
mittee is concerned with the HHS Office of Inspector General’s
findings that payors have denied or delayed timely Medicare bene-
ficiary access to medically necessary medication through the use of
‘‘utilization management.’’ The Committee acknowledges the timely
opportunity for the agency to improve transparency around the use
of utilization management and encourages CMS to take a holistic
approach to protecting beneficiary access to medication therapy, in-
cluding enhanced oversight and review of the use of utilization
management by Medicare Part D plan sponsors. The Committee
supports the administration’s engagement with stakeholders to ad-
dress these issues and requests an update in the fiscal year 2027
CJ on actions the agency is taking to better protect Medicare bene-
ficiaries by enhancing its oversight of and transparency related to
the use of utilization management by Part D plans to ensure no ad-
verse impacts to beneficiary access to therapies.
Psychosocial Rehabilitation Model.—The Committee notes the
health, economic, and overall societal benefits associated with alle-
204
viating social isolation among people with serious mental illness
[SMI]. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Committee re-
quests that CMS provide a report on how the agency could address
loneliness and social isolation and other social drivers of health
through community-based models and how the Measures Manage-
ment System will test the feasibility of patient-reported outcome
measures related to social isolation and loneliness that could be in-
cluded in current and future value-based models.
Quality Measures.—The Committee appreciates CMS’s efforts to
ensure that the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries is of the
highest quality and understands that the agency partners with ex-
ternal entities to develop, validate, update, and maintain measures.
The Committee is concerned that the process to update screening
measures is not keeping pace with advances in science and practice
that can improve patient access to identification of undetected dis-
ease leading to earlier treatment. The Committee urges CMS to le-
verage its existing authority to utilize evidence-based guidelines to
update screening measures in a timely and efficient manner and
requests an update on improving screening measurements in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Reducing Costly Osteoporotic Fractures.—The Committee con-
tinues to note that current Medicare payment policies may not be
adequate to encourage comprehensive care to reduce osteoporosis-
related bone fractures. Therefore, the Committee encourages CMS
to establish a clear payment mechanism for evidence-based post-
fracture care that has been shown to reduce the rates of costly sec-
ondary fractures through improved screening, treatment initiation
and adherence, patient and caregiver education and counseling,
and comprehensive falls prevention strategies. Further, the Com-
mittee is concerned that postmenopausal osteoporosis [PMO] is re-
sponsible for nearly 2.0 million fractures every year in the United
States for women age 65 and older, and two out of three women
with PMO at high risk for fracture will break a bone in their life-
time. However, only one in six women receive osteoporosis treat-
ment in the months following an osteoporotic fracture. The U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] has recommended the
use of bone measurement testing to screen both women age 65 and
older for osteoporosis and postmenopausal women younger than 65
who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, but nationwide screening
of this high-risk population is lacking. The Committee directs CMS
to provide recommendations in the fiscal year 2027 CJ for changes
to CMS policies that could increase access to PMO care.
Reducing False-Positive Sepsis Blood Cultures.—The Committee
is aware that more than 40 percent of blood culture tests used to
diagnose blood stream infections, like sepsis, are false-positive re-
sults due to blood culture contaminations from a patient’s skin.
These false-positive test results can lead to serious morbidity and
mortality among misdiagnosed patients, significant spending on
unnecessary treatment, and the overuse of antibiotics. The Com-
mittee requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act
for CMS to provide an update on its efforts to review and adopt a
blood culture contamination rate measure.
205
Risk Corridor Program.—The Committee continues bill language
to prevent the CMS Program Management appropriation account
from being used to support risk corridor payments.
Reusable Respirators.—The Committee recognizes the use of re-
usable respirators within the hospital setting and encourages CMS
to examine ways to support their increased utilization when appro-
priate.
Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery [SRS].—The Committee re-
mains concerned that inadequate payments for robotic SRS and
robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy may threaten patient
access to this important treatment option for many types of cancer
in both the hospital and freestanding cancer settings. The Com-
mittee urges CMS to protect Medicare beneficiary access to these
services, which can safely deliver life-saving and life-changing can-
cer treatment in a timely and cost-efficient manner, improving pa-
tient compliance and reducing burdens on patients, providers, and
the healthcare system.
Rural and Critical Access Hospitals.—The Committee is con-
cerned that 25 rural hospitals have closed since 2021 and that 46
percent of rural hospitals are operating at a financial loss. The
Committee directs CMS to suggest options in the fiscal year 2027
CJ that would allow vulnerable, rural hospitals, including those
with Critical Access Hospital designation, to receive relief in the
near-term, as well as a new payment system that can ensure that
more hospitals serving rural and underserved populations can oper-
ate in a more financially sustainable way.
School-Based Services [SBS].—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of SBS in promoting the health of children and adoles-
cents. As more States look to expand SBS, the Committee encour-
ages CMS to examine State reporting requirements and review and
update reporting systems to better collect information about SBS
for students beyond what is provided pursuant to a student’s indi-
vidualized education program or individualized family services pro-
gram. Further, the Committee supports the work of the CMS Tech-
nical Assistance Center [TAC] to support education agencies and
reduce administrative burdens, particularly for small and rural
schools. Within 30 days of enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects CMS, in coordination with the Department of Education, to
provide a briefing on actions taken to expand access to SBS.
Stark Law Compliance.—The Committee is concerned that the
definitions of ‘‘commercially reasonable’’ and ‘‘fair market value,’’
which were updated in 2021 are not being applied during the re-
view of certain hiring practices by hospitals. The Committee en-
courages the agency to apply these updated definitions as estab-
lished in the CMS Final Rule ‘‘Medicare Program; Modernizing and
Clarifying the Physician Self-Referral Regulations’’ to help support
value-based care.
State Information Technology [IT] and Data Systems.—The Com-
mittee notes significant new demands on the data and IT systems
that support State Medicaid programs. The Committee directs the
CMS Administrator to work with governors and State Medicaid di-
rectors to implement effective strategies to reduce preventable cov-
erage losses and improve the accuracy of eligibility determinations.
Such an approach should include timely technical assistance and
206
promoting use of technology, electronic data sources, artificial intel-
ligence, and personnel to reduce data siloes, streamline
verifications, enhance data matching, uphold beneficiary privacy,
and upgrade system capacity.
Supplemental Oxygen.—The Committee notes that in 2018, CMS
developed a set of clinical data elements to identify the data nec-
essary to support medical necessity of supplemental oxygen claims
and allow for electronic prescribing of supplemental oxygen. CMS
has not approved of the use of this electronic template, and the
clinical data elements template and electronic prescribing has yet
to be implemented. Within 60 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs CMS to provide a briefing on updates to the e-
prescribing of supplemental oxygen, including a process and
timeline for provider adoption. The briefing should also include in-
formation on CMS’s efforts to work with community stakeholders
to improve access to supplemental oxygen.
Vaccine Coverage.—The Committee encourages CMS to ensure
that its regulations fully implement Section 2713 of the PHSA and
align with the statutory intent of such section, which generally re-
quires commercial insurance coverage of CDC-recommended vac-
cines without cost-sharing. CMS is directed to provide a report to
the Committee and post on a publicly available Web site no later
than 180 days after enactment of this act, on steps it will take to
ensure Section 2713 is fully implemented.
Whole Child Health.—The Committee recognizes the efforts of
the Integrated Care for Kids Model to improve the quality of care
for children covered by Medicaid and notes the importance of ad-
dressing the root causes of poor physical and mental health in chil-
dren served by Medicaid and CHIP. The Committee encourages
CMS to examine further efforts to advance pediatric payment and
delivery models that support disease prevention and improve
health, including through a whole child health demonstration pro-
gram.
State Survey and Certification
The Committee provides $397,334,000 for State Survey and Cer-
tification activities, which ensure that institutions and agencies
providing care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries meet Fed-
eral health, safety, and program standards. On-site surveys are
conducted by State survey agencies, with a pool of Federal sur-
veyors performing random monitoring surveys.
Annual Reports.—The Committee continues to direct CMS to pro-
vide, in the fiscal year 2027 CJ, a report to the Committees regard-
ing operational milestones and funding activities under this head-
ing. Such reports shall, at a minimum, include quarterly obliga-
tions, unobligated balances (including a breakdown of committed
and uncommitted balances), and expenditures of current year dis-
cretionary budgetary authority by originating statute. Such reports
shall also include operational metrics, such as those found on pages
82 and 85 of the fiscal year 2025 CJ, regarding the numbers and
rates of survey and complaint visits by provider type for the appli-
cable quarter.
207
Federal Administration
The Committee provides $772,533,000 for Federal Administra-
tion, which funds the majority of CMS’s staff and operating ex-
penses for routine activities, such as planning, implementing, eval-
uating, and ensuring accountability in the programs administered
by CMS.
HEALTHCARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $941,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 941,000,000
The Committee provides $941,000,000, to be transferred from the
Medicare trust funds, for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control ac-
tivities. The Committee recommendation includes a discretionary
base amount of $311,000,000 and an additional $630,000,000 in re-
sources through a budget cap adjustment, in alignment with the
parameters set forth in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.
Proactively identifying healthcare waste, fraud, and abuse con-
tinues to be a priority for the Committee.
ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND FAMILY
SUPPORT PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,924,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,147,000,000
The Committee provides $4,147,000,000 in fiscal year 2026 man-
datory funds for Child Support Enforcement and Family Support
programs. In addition, the Committee provides $1,800,000,000 in
advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027.
These funds support States’ efforts to promote the economic secu-
rity of low-income families, including administrative expenses,
matching funds, and incentive payments to States for child support
enforcement; grants to States to help establish and administer ac-
cess and visitation programs between noncustodial parents and
their children; payments to territories for benefits to certain aged,
blind, or disabled individuals; and temporary benefits for certain
repatriated citizens.
LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,025,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,045,000,000
The Committee provides $4,045,000,000 for the Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. LIHEAP provides
home heating and cooling assistance to low-income households.
Sudden, significant, and unexpected decreases in annual funding
for States, even when based in part on changes in home energy
costs or other formula factors, can be difficult for States to manage.
Accordingly, the Committee continues to limit year-to-year fluctua-
tions in allocations to States.
LIHEAP Formula Report.—Within 120 days of enactment of this
act, ACF is directed to submit to the Committees on Appropriations
and make publicly available a report evaluating the program’s for-
mula and allocations of funding among States, including specifying
208
the methods and data sources used to determine the grant amounts
provided to each State, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories
and commonwealths, and Indian Tribal organizations. The report
should also include an assessment of available data, how the pro-
gram provides assistance for both heating and cooling including
any recommendations for formula updates, and the percentage of
eligible households served, average assistance amount, and per-
centage of home energy costs covered by that amount by each
State.
LIHEAP Funding Release.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of the timely release of LIHEAP funding, particularly in
the fall as States finalize their plans for energy assistance for the
upcoming year. The Committee includes bill language requiring
ACF to release at least 90 percent of LIHEAP funds to States by
November 1, consistent with current practice.
LIHEAP Workforce.—The Committee notes that sufficient staff
funding for the LIHEAP office has been provided and strongly
urges ACF to address any vacancies that will affect program oper-
ations or its ability to fulfill its statutory responsibility to provide
home heating and cooling assistance to low-income households Na-
tionwide.
Technical Assistance and Program Administration.—Within the
total, the Committee includes up to $9,600,000 for program integ-
rity and oversight efforts, of which a portion is intended to continue
to support a formula system, which will allow ACF to provide esti-
mates more readily when requested by the Committee.
REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,327,214,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,691,033,000
The Committee recommends $5,691,033,000 in base discretionary
funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance [REA] programs.
These programs provide a variety of benefits and services to refu-
gees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, immigrants arriving on
Special Immigrant Visas [SIV], trafficking victims, and torture vic-
tims (collectively referred to below as ‘‘refugees’’). These programs
also provide temporary care and services for unaccompanied chil-
dren apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security [DHS]
or other law enforcement agencies, who have no lawful immigration
status in the United States until they can be placed with a parent,
guardian, or other sponsor while awaiting adjudication of their im-
migration status.
The Committee recommendation continues the directive to pro-
vide monthly updates to the Committees on Appropriations of ar-
rivals each month by category, including refugees, asylees, Cuban
and Haitian Entrants, SIVs, and unaccompanied children. Such up-
dates shall include any changes in estimated funding needs as a re-
sult of changing trends.
The Committee believes that the USRAP serves as a reflection
of U.S. humanitarianism as well as the Nation’s strategic interests.
The program provides for the safe resettlement of some of the most
vulnerable refugees and not only saves lives but also strengthens
our National security by providing support and shared responsi-
bility for strategic allies and regions.
209
The Committee notes the need to maintain a baseline of capacity
and encourages HHS, to the extent practicable, to ensure that re-
settlement agencies are able to maintain their infrastructure and
capacity at a level to continue to serve new refugees, previously ar-
rived refugees, and other populations of concern who remain statu-
torily eligible for integration services, and to ensure that there is
capacity for future arrivals to be adequately served.
Community Engagement and Quarterly Consultation.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that quarterly consultations and regular commu-
nity engagement are critical to support refugee integration and en-
courages HHS to pursue efforts to ensure robust participation in
regular community consultations.
Mental Health and Trauma Informed Care.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of ORR providing trauma informed, cul-
turally appropriate, comprehensive care to the individuals it
serves, including unaccompanied children, refugees, victims of traf-
ficking, and survivors of torture. Accordingly, the Committee en-
courages ORR to partner with an outside organization with exper-
tise in providing such care to evaluate the mental healthcare needs
of ORR-eligible populations and any ongoing gaps and challenges
in current mental health provision across populations ORR serves.
Spend Plan and Briefings.—The Committee directs ORR to re-
sume providing quarterly spend plans for the Unaccompanied Alien
Children [UAC] program with actual and estimated obligations by
major category, at the same level of detail that has been provided
in previous years. The Committee further expects at least this level
of detail to be included in future budget justifications. The Com-
mittee also directs the Director of ORR to resume providing weekly
briefings to the Committees, as has long been the practice.
Transitional and Medical Services
The Committee recommendation includes $564,000,000 for Tran-
sitional and Medical Services. This program provides grants to
States and nonprofit organizations to provide cash and medical as-
sistance to arriving refugees, as well as foster care services to un-
accompanied minors.
Matching Grant Program.—The Committee continues to support
the Matching Grant [MG] program and strongly encourages HHS
to continue steps that have been previously taken to improve the
program to address administrative challenges that can limit the
program’s reach and effectiveness.
Refugee Support Services
The Committee recommendation includes $307,201,000 for Ref-
ugee Support Services [RSS]. This program provides a combination
of formula and competitive grants to States and nonprofit organiza-
tions to help refugees become self-sufficient and address barriers to
employment.
The Committee strongly encourages ORR to the greatest extent
possible to allocate RSS funding based on the best data available
that reflects actual needs of providing services to newly arrived ref-
ugees. The Committee directs ORR to include information in its fis-
cal year 2027 CJ on what flexibilities ORR has applied in allo-
210
cating funding to better reflect needs and any ongoing limitations
in doing so.
Education, Training, and Career Opportunities.—The Committee
encourages ORR to ensure all eligible populations are made aware
of the variety of education, training, and career opportunities avail-
able to them through ORR or other Federal partners, including
adult education, credential evaluation, pre-apprenticeship, and reg-
istered apprenticeship programs. The Committee encourages ORR
to continue to collaborate with the Departments of Education and
Labor to ensure that new arrivals receive information about these
employment and training opportunities within the first 90 days
after arrival.
Preferred Communities.—The Committee supports the Preferred
Communities program, which supports intensive case management
and other services to address the needs to particularly vulnerable
refugee populations.
Victims of Trafficking
The Committee recommendation includes $30,755,000 for Victims
of Trafficking programs. These programs support a national net-
work of organizations that provide a variety of services-including
case management, counseling, benefit coordination, and housing as-
sistance-for victims of commercial sex and forced labor trafficking.
Within this amount the Committee recommendation includes no
less than $5,000,000 for the National Human Trafficking Hotline
(Hotline). The Committee notes concern with reports that the Hot-
line has not consistently and promptly reported tips, when appro-
priate and consistent with Federal and State law, of trafficking of
adults to law enforcement. The objectives of the Hotline include
providing information and service referrals to victims of trafficking
using a trauma-informed, victim-centered approach; and notifying
law enforcement agencies of potential cases of human trafficking as
well as instances when a trafficking victim is in imminent danger,
and documenting emerging trafficking schemes to assist in the de-
tection and investigation of trafficking cases.
It is critical that that the Hotline maintain a person-centered ap-
proach focused on the victim’s well-being and those who utilize the
Hotline’s services and wish to be anonymous should stay anony-
mous when it is safe and appropriate to do so. The Committee also
notes that Hotline plays an important role in notifying law enforce-
ment of potential trafficking when that is appropriate. Accordingly,
the Committee directs ACF to ensure the Hotline is complying with
applicable laws and policies regarding the operation of the Hotline,
assisting victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons, and re-
ferring potential cases of trafficking to law enforcement including
reporting all third-party tips of potential human trafficking to
State and local law enforcement when the signaler appears to be
in imminent danger.
Unaccompanied Alien Children
The Committee recommendation includes $4,770,077,000 in base
funding for the UAC program. The UAC program provides tem-
porary care for children who have no lawful immigration status in
the United States and who have been apprehended by DHS with-
211
out a parent or a guardian. HHS provides care for children until
they can be placed with a parent or other sponsor living in the
United States pending resolution of their immigration status.
Influx Care Facilities [ICFs].—The Committee continues to direct
ORR to ensure that ICFs will only be used in the future when ab-
solutely necessary and directs ORR to include in its fiscal year
2027 CJ estimates of how much it will spend on ICFs, its estimated
capacity needs, the methodology it uses and factors it considers
when estimating ICF capacity needs, and in what specific cir-
cumstances it will activate capacity in ICFs. The Committee also
directs that if ICFs are needed in the future, HHS will ensure they
have the physical infrastructure to provide developmentally appro-
priate care for children, including appropriate space for education
services, and confidential space for the provision of healthcare,
mental healthcare, and legal services.
Services for Children in ORR Care.—The Committee directs ORR
to ensure it is providing developmentally appropriate, trauma-in-
formed, culturally competent care in the least restrictive setting.
The Committee encourages ORR to work with residential care pro-
viders, disability experts, and child welfare experts to ensure ad-
herence to Federal, State, and local laws related to standards of
care for children, including children with disabilities. Finally, the
Committee recognizes that unaccompanied children often share ex-
tensive personal information to case managers, clinicians, or other
adults while in ORR care, and directs ORR and its grantees and
contractors to protect sensitive personal information, behavioral
health records, and mental health records consistent with all appli-
cable child welfare laws, regulations, and licensing requirements.
Office of the Ombuds.—The Committee strongly supports efforts
to increase independent oversight of the UAC program. Accord-
ingly, the Committee supports the Office of the Ombuds, to provide
independent oversight of the UAC program, and child-welfare fo-
cused recommendations to ORR and the Secretary regarding the
care of unaccompanied children.
Post-Release Child Welfare Services.—The Committee supports
the expansion of child-welfare focused post release services, and in-
creasing the percentage of children receiving in-person ORR-funded
post-release services and home studies conducted by child welfare
professionals. These services are critical to ensuring that children
are in safe and appropriate homes after they have been released
from ORR’s care. The Committee directs ORR to provide monthly
briefings to the Committees on the number of children receiving
ORR-funded post-release services and the types of services pro-
vided, and on the number of children receiving child welfare checks
from other Federal agencies, the data relied on for determining
which children should receive such child welfare checks, and the
outcomes of such child welfare checks.
Access to Counsel and Child Advocates.—The Committee directs
ORR to provide access to counsel consistent with the TVPRA of
2008, which recognizes that unaccompanied children are a particu-
larly vulnerable population requiring dedicated and uninterrupted
access to counsel in their immigration proceedings, including to
safeguard them from trafficking and exploitation. The Committee
also continues to direct ORR to ensure in-person Know Your Rights
212
presentations and legal screenings, administered by qualified pro-
viders, for every child in ORR custody and access to legal counsel
for any child in prolonged ORR-care. The Committee also continues
to direct ORR to ensure that legal services will be in person absent
exigent circumstances. The Committee directs ORR to provide
monthly briefings on the status of all contracts relating to the pro-
vision of these services.
Prioritization of Small-Scale, Community- and Family-Based
Placements.—The Committee continues to direct ORR to prioritize
the placement of children in small-scale, community- and family-
based care providers, including transitional foster care, small group
homes, and long-term foster care. The Committee directs ORR to
include information in its fiscal year 2027 CJ on its actual and
planned capacity by program type.
Report.—The Committee directs ORR to continue to submit bian-
nual reports to the Committees that include the number of UACs
that remain in HHS care for longer than 1 year and the number
of UACs that HHS has released to sponsors. The report should also
include an explanation of the methods ORR uses to follow-up with
unaccompanied children after releasing them to a sponsor, includ-
ing the follow-up method used and number of attempts made. The
Department shall make such a report available on its website.
Home Studies.—The Committee strongly encourages ORR to con-
duct a home study for every potential sponsor. The Committee di-
rects ORR to brief the Committees of jurisdiction, within 30 days
of enactment of this act, on the timeline and steps it will take to
meet the recommendations of the OIG report, ‘‘Gaps in Sponsor
Screening and Follow-up Raise Safety Concerns for Unaccompanied
Children’’ and to provide a report to the Committee within 90 days
of enactment of this act on the feasibility of conducting an in-per-
son home study for every potential sponsor and a full accounting
of minors that ORR has not been able to contact as part of safety
and well-being calls.
Youth Aging Out of ORR Care.—The Committee directs ORR to
have developed a concrete post-18 plan for every 17-year-old unac-
companied child in ORR care at least 30 days in advance of their
18th birthday to ensure that an appropriate placement has been
identified and arranged for the child, along with any necessary so-
cial support services, prior to discharge from ORR. The Committee
directs ORR to ensure that it is complying with its obligation to
protect children’s private and confidential information in fulfilling
its obligation to engage in post-18 planning for children aging out
of ORR care.
Length of Care.—The Committee directs ORR to continue to pro-
vide daily information to the Committees on the number of children
referred to ORR care and weekly reports that include information
on the length of care. In addition, the Committee directs ORR to
post publicly on its website each month the average length of care
for children in its custody.
Victims of Torture
The Committee recommendation includes $19,000,000 for the
Victims of Torture program to provide support to non-profit organi-
213
zations providing direct support to torture survivors and their fam-
ilies.
PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT
BLOCK GRANT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,746,387,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,831,387,000
The Committee provides $8,831,387,000 for the Child Care and
Development Block Grant [CCDBG], a formula grant to States that
provides financial assistance to families to help pay for child care,
and otherwise improve the quality of child care programs.
Data Reporting.—The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2026
CJ included fiscal year 2022 data regarding the number of children
and families served by CCDBG. The Committee is concerned by the
lag in this data reporting and requests a briefing, no later than 180
days after enactment, on the challenges relative to collecting this
data and recommendations for improving its timeliness.
Native Hawaiian Child Care Programs.—The Committee re-
quests a report within 90 days of enactment of this act providing
the rationale of the funding allocation for past three grant cycles
of the Native Hawaiian Non-Profit Organization Child Care Grant,
and a plan to align funding with the Native Hawaiian service pop-
ulation in subsequent awards.
SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,700,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,700,000,000
The Committee provides $1,700,000,000 for the Social Services
Block Grant [SSBG], a flexible source of funding that allows States
to provide a diverse array of services to low-income children and
families, the disabled, and the elderly in order to reduce poverty.
The Committee recognizes that Family Resource Centers provide
direct assistance to families through parenting support and edu-
cation, navigation of care and social services, mental health coun-
seling, early learning and afterschool activities, family financial
planning, and job training. The Committee notes that preliminary
data shows promise in this area, with a 63 percent reduction in
child abuse cases and a $4.93 return for every tax dollar invested,
according to current research. The Committee supports States that
choose to use a portion of their SSBG funding to support services
and programs at school and community-based Family Resource
Centers to strengthen families through a localized, family-centered
approach.
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,789,089,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,900,140,000
The Committee provides $14,900,140,000 for Children and Fami-
lies Services programs. These funds support a variety of programs
for children, youth, and families; Native Americans; survivors of
child abuse, neglect, and domestic violence; and other vulnerable
populations.

Head Start
The Committee provides $12,356,820,000 for Head Start. Head
Start provides grants directly to local organizations to provide com-
prehensive early childhood education services to children and their
families, from before birth to age 5.
Designation Renewal System [DRS].—The Committee continues
to encourage HHS to consider the unique challenges faced by Head
Start grantees in remote and frontier areas when reviewing such
grantees’ compliance with health and dental screening require-
ments as part of the DRS.
Facility Improvement Funding and Report.—The Committee con-
tinues to strongly encourage ACF to ensure that all Head Start
grantees are aware of any funding opportunities, or funding other-
wise available, for making capital improvements to their facilities.
Further, the Committee continues to encourage ACF to standardize
this process so all grantees have equal opportunity to apply and
are aware of priorities and eligible uses of such funds. Additionally,
the Committee directs the Office of Head Start to issue a report,
no later than 180 days of enactment of this act on the state of
Head Start facilities including any repair, renovation, rebuilding,
and replacement of Head Start facilities that is necessary to pro-
vide a safer and welcoming environment for children and staff.
Freely Associated States.—The Committee includes bill language
to establish Head Start programs in the Republic of the Marshall
215
Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, as authorized in
the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2024 (Public
Law 118–42).
Native Hawaiian Programs.—The Committee recognizes the Fed-
eral trust responsibility to the Native Hawaiian Community, and
that the provision of comprehensive early childhood education is
critical to advancing that responsibility. The Committee also notes
that the Secretary is required to report on facilities for Native Ha-
waiian Head Start programs. As such, without any current Native
Hawaiian Head Start programs, the Committee directs ACF to pro-
vide technical assistance to potential Native Hawaiian Head Start
providers interested in applying for Head Start funding opportuni-
ties. Identified providers shall be operated by a Native Hawaiian
Organization or a Native Hawaiian Educational Organization for
the purpose of serving Native Hawaiian children and families, in-
cluding Native American language immersion programs. ACF is di-
rected to brief the Committee on these efforts no later than 180
days after such a funding opportunity is made public.
Regional Office Closures.—The Committee is aware of the closure
of five Head Start regional offices across the country, which could
impact Head Start centers previously served by those offices. The
Committee requests a report within 60 days of enactment detailing
the justification for the closures, the process for reassigning grant-
ees to new regional offices and the notice provided to grantees, and
an analysis of the impact of the closures on agency operations.
Timely Notice of Awards.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the timely release of funding award notices for Head Start
grantees. The Committee includes new bill language directing the
Office of Head Start [OHS] to award funding for continuation
awards and new award cycles that continue previous activities
under existing awards no later than the day following the expira-
tion of the period of performance. For grants in the Designated Re-
newal System, OHS may extend the current award in lieu of pro-
viding a new award for the purposes of finalizing negotiations with
the grantee.
Tribal Colleges and Universities-Head Start Partnership Pro-
gram.—The Committee includes $8,000,000 for the Tribal Colleges
and Universities-Head Start Partnership Program.
Preschool Development Grants
The Committee provides $315,000,000 for Preschool Development
Grants. This program, as authorized in the Every Student Succeeds
Act (Public Law 114–95), provides competitive grants to States to
improve the coordination, collaboration, and quality of existing
early childhood programs; improve the transition from early child-
hood programs to kindergarten; implement evidence-based prac-
tices; improve professional development for early childhood pro-
viders; and generally improve educational opportunities for chil-
dren.
The Committee encourages ACF to continue to support States
that choose to use a portion of their renewal grant funding to
award sub-grants to programs in a mixed delivery system across
the State, particularly for low-income and disadvantaged children
216
prior to entering kindergarten, or to improve the quality of local
programs through the enhancement of early childhood systems.
The Committee requests a report, no later than 180 days after
enactment of this act, on the efforts undertaken by grant recipients
in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 to strengthen early care and edu-
cation systems in their respective States. The report should also in-
clude a table, detailing the number of planning and renewal grants
by State for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. For renewal grants, the
table should include which year each grantee falls within the 3-
year cycle.
Dual Language Learners [DLL].—The Committee encourages
ACF to support States that choose to develop high-quality and cul-
turally competent dual immersion preschool programs through Pre-
school Development Grants. The Committee encourages a focus on
training, professional development, and postsecondary education
for all caregivers, teachers, and directors to meet the needs of
DLLs through dual language acquisition, engaging culturally and
linguistically diverse families, home language support, and cul-
turally and linguistically appropriate assessment.
Consolidated Runaway and Homeless Youth Program
The Committee provides $125,283,000 for the Consolidated Run-
away and Homeless Youth program. This program supports the
Basic Centers program, which provides temporary shelter, coun-
seling, and after-care services to runaway and homeless youth
under age 18 and their families; the Transitional Living Program,
which provides longer-term shelter and services for older youth;
and a national toll-free runaway and homeless youth crisis hotline.
The Committee continues to support the ability of grantees to
provide prevention services such as counseling and case manage-
ment, regardless of their enrollment in residential services. The
Committee urges ACF to advise grantees that they are not re-
quired to enroll youth in shelter or residential services, nor require
the young person to physically travel to the grantee’s location in
order for an at-risk youth to receive prevention and supportive
services.
Timely Notice of Funding Opportunities.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the timely release of notices of funding op-
portunities for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs.

Section 29:
Section 531 directs the timely issue notices of funding opportunities
and awards. The Committee further directs ACF to issue separate
funding opportunities for the Street Outreach Program, Basic Cen-
ter Program, Transitional Living Program, and Maternity Group
Homes.
Education and Prevention Grants to Reduce Sexual Abuse of Run-
away Youth
The Committee provides $21,000,000 for Education and Preven-
tion Grants to Reduce Sexual Abuse of Runaway and Homeless
Youth. This program provides competitive grants for street-based
outreach and education services for runaway and homeless youth
who are subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual
abuse or exploitation.
217
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment State Grants
The Committee provides $105,091,000 for the Child Abuse Pre-
vention and Treatment State Grant program. This program pro-
vides formula grants to States to improve their child protective
service systems.
Infant Plans of Safe Care.—Within the total, the Committee in-
cludes $60,000,000 to help States continue to develop and imple-
ment plans of safe care as required by section 106(b)(2)(B)(iii) of
the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (Public Law 93–
247). The Committee again urges HHS to support States in their
implementation of the plans by providing specialized, non-punitive
family support services for infants and their birth parents affected
by substance use disorders to reduce the need for child welfare or
foster care system involvement. The Committee recognizes the in-
tent of plans of safe care and encourages these plans to be put into
place before the birth of a child to foster the best outcome for the
baby. The Committee continues to direct HHS to provide technical
assistance to States on best-practices in this area to address the
health, developmental, housing, and treatment needs of infants and
their parents and to evaluate States’ activities on plans of safe
care. The Committee also encourages HHS to provide technical as-
sistance to States on best practices for developing notification sys-
tems that are distinct and separate from the system used in the
State to report child abuse and neglect in order to promote a public
health response to infants affected by substance use disorders, and
not for the purpose of initiating an investigation of child abuse or
neglect. The Committee also encourages HHS to ensure such tech-
nical assistance includes an emphasis on the role of public health
focused plans of safe care in reducing racial disproportionality in
child protective services investigations and removals.
Child Abuse Discretionary Activities
The Committee provides $36,000,000 for Child Abuse Discre-
tionary Activities. This program supports discretionary grants for
research, demonstration, and technical assistance to increase the
knowledge base of evidence-based practices and to disseminate in-
formation to State and local child welfare programs.
Child Abuse Hotline.—The Committee continues funding for this
program.
Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention
The Committee provides $70,660,000 for the Community-based
Child Abuse Prevention program. This program provides formula
grants to States that then disburse funds to local community-based
organizations to improve local child abuse prevention and treat-
ment efforts, including providing direct services and improving the
coordination between State and community-based organizations.
The Committee recognizes the importance of prevention and en-
courages funds to be used for primary prevention activities and to
engage in partnerships at the State and local level to reduce child
abuse and neglect and provide supports to families.
218
Child Welfare Services
The Committee provides $268,735,000 for Child Welfare Services.
This formula grant program helps State and Tribal public welfare
agencies improve their child welfare services with the goal of keep-
ing families together. These funds help States and Tribes provide
a continuum of services that prevent child neglect, abuse or exploi-
tation; allow children to remain with their families, when appro-
priate; promote the safety and permanence of children in foster
care and adoptive families; and provide training and professional
development to the child welfare workforce.
The Committee understands that children at risk of entering fos-
ter care achieve better outcomes when families are able to provide
a safe and stable environment for their children, thereby allowing
children to stay safely at home. The Committee acknowledges
ACF’s recent regulatory efforts to allow Title IV–E foster care
agencies to claim Federal financial participation for the administra-
tive cost of an attorney providing legal representation to eligible
children and certain other individuals involved in foster care and
other civil legal proceedings.
Child Welfare Research, Training, and Demonstration
The Committee provides $21,984,000 for child welfare research,
training, and demonstration projects. This program provides grants
to public and nonprofit organizations for demonstration projects
that encourage experimental and promising types of child welfare
services, as well as projects that improve education and training
programs for child welfare service providers.
Driver’s License Program Foster Youth.—The Committee encour-
ages the establishment of a demonstration expanding foster care
and adoption assistance programs to provide driving preparation
assistance to foster youth and related training for foster parents,
as well as assistance to States and Tribal organizations for age-ap-
propriate foster youth to, among other things, obtain automobile in-
surance, complete driver’s education, obtain a driver’s license, and
purchase a vehicle.
Extending Foster Care.—The Committee recognizes the positive
educational, behavioral, social, and health outcomes associated
with participation in extended foster care under Title IV–E. The
Committee encourages GAO to update and expand its 2019 report
entitled ‘‘States with Approval to Extend Care Provide Independent
Living Options for Youth up to Age 21,’’ and provide a review of
States’ implementation of extended foster care under Title IV–E,
including options for youth to reenter the foster care system, eligi-
ble populations, living options and access to these options, and
model of case management. Additionally, such report shall include
input from youth participating in extended foster care, case man-
agers, and State child welfare services agency staff.
Strengthening State ICWA Compliance.—The Committee recog-
nizes the important role State child welfare agencies play in ensur-
ing the safety of Indian children who come into contact with the
State child welfare system. The Committee appreciates the work of
the Children’s Bureau and the Tribal Engagement Team to support
State compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA]
through technical assistance and through grants to develop strong
219
working relationships between States and tribes. The Committee
encourages continued staffing of this team to ensure the ability to
fulfill trust obligations to Native children and families The Com-
mittee continues $3,000,000 for State-Tribal partnership grants to
build collaborations between States and tribes to better address the
ongoing challenges Tribal communities face. Further, the Com-
mittee encourages ACF, in coordination with the relevant Federal
agencies, to develop guidance for States to better serve Indian chil-
dren who come into contact with the child welfare system. This
guidance may include best practices on the timely identification of
Indian children and extended family members; timely notice to
Tribes of State child custody proceedings; foster care or adoptive
placements of Indian children; and case recordkeeping as it relates
to transfers of jurisdiction, termination of parental rights, and in-
sufficient active efforts, as defined by ICWA. The Committee in-
structs the Children’s Bureau and the Tribal Engagement Team to
brief the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enact-
ment regarding implementation of the Indian Child Welfare Act.
Adoption Opportunities
The Committee provides $53,000,000 for the Adoption Opportuni-
ties program. This program funds discretionary grants to help fa-
cilitate the elimination of barriers to adoption and provide tech-
nical assistance to help States increase the number of children
adopted, particularly children with special needs.
The Committee recognizes that adoption arrangements at risk of
a disruption or dissolution that would result in a foster care place-
ment are eligible for funding under the Family First Prevention
Services Act. However, no programs expressly designed to meet the
needs of these families have been approved by the Title IV–E Pre-
vention Services Clearinghouse. The Committee directs not less
than $2,000,000 for the evaluation of such programs that could
qualify for funding under the Family First Prevention Services Act
and aim to meet the evidence standards established by the Title
IV–E Prevention Services Clearinghouse in accordance with the
Family First Prevention Services Act. The Committee encourages
ACF to prioritize the evaluation of programs with existing evidence
and to support studies that can be completed as rapidly as possible
while meeting the evidence standards of the Title IV–E Prevention
Services Clearinghouse.
The Committee provides $2,000,000 to continue the National
Adoption Competency Mental Health Training Initiative. This ini-
tiative supports ongoing resources for a national organization with
the capacity and expertise to continuously evaluate and update the
training curriculums, and will provide all States, tribes, and terri-
tories the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the curricu-
lums are appropriately used by State child welfare and mental
health professionals.
Adoption-Sensitive Clinical Care [ASCC].—The Committee en-
courages HHS to continue and enhance dissemination of this train-
ing to hospital-based professionals and other healthcare workers.
National Center for Adoption Competent Mental Health Serv-
ices.—The Committee recognizes the need for States to improve ac-
cessibility of mental health services that are responsive to the
220
needs of all youth in the care of the child welfare system and in
adoption/guardianship homes. The Committee continues to support
the work of the National Center for Adoption Competent Mental
Health Services to help States bridge the gap between child welfare
and mental health systems and better meet the complex needs of
vulnerable youth.
National Training and Development Curriculum [NTDC].—The
Committee directs HHS to provide $1,000,000, the same as the fis-
cal year 2024 enacted level, for the NTDC as directed in the ex-
planatory statement that accompanied Division D of Public Law
118–47.
Support for Birth Parents.—The Committee recognizes that birth
parents who voluntarily place their children for adoption often ben-
efit from post-adoption counseling, support, and resources. The
Committee supports programs that provide support groups, re-
sources, and services to birth parents.
Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments
The Committee provides $75,000,000 for the Adoption and Legal
Guardianship Incentive Payments program. This program provides
formula-based incentive payments to States to encourage them to
increase the number of adoptions of children from the foster care
system, with an emphasis on children who are the hardest to place.
Social Services Research and Demonstration
The Committee provides $71,063,000 for Social Services Research
and Demonstration. These funds support research and evaluation
of cost-effective programs that increase the stability and economic
independence of families and contribute to the healthy development
of children and youth.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—Within the funds included
in this account, $41,051,000 shall be for the Congressionally Di-
rected Spending projects, and in the amounts, as specified in the
table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending Items’’ at the end
of this Committee Report.
Diaper Distribution Grant Demonstration.—The Committee con-
tinues to provide $20,000,000 for the purposes of carrying out a di-
aper distribution grant program. The diaper distribution program
will provide grants to social service agencies or other non-profit or-
ganizations specifically for diaper and diapering supply needs.
Institutional Child Abuse Study.—The Committee provides
$2,000,000 and directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
[NASEM] to conduct a study to examine the state of youth in youth
residential programs and make recommendations. Pursuant to the
contract, NASEM shall issue a report informed by the study con-
ducted that includes identification of the nature, prevalence, sever-
ity, and scope of child abuse, neglect, and deaths in youth residen-
tial programs, including types of abuse and neglect, causes of
abuse, neglect, and deaths, and criteria used to assess abuse, ne-
glect, and deaths; identification of all funding sources for youth res-
idential programs; and identification of existing barriers in policy
for blending and braiding of funding sources to serve youth in com-
munity-based settings.
221
Preventing Youth Homelessness.—The Committee includes
$5,000,000 to continue the preventing youth homelessness dem-
onstration program to identify and implement strategies and serv-
ices for youth between ages 12 and 26 in order to prevent home-
lessness, including strategies designed to serve youth and young
adult populations with a high likelihood of imminently experi-
encing homelessness, housing instability, or other forms of victim-
ization such as human trafficking to include individuals
transitioning out of foster care, the juvenile justice system, or a
residential behavioral health system.
The Committee directs that a portion of funds be made available
to State agencies, tribes, counties, cities, other units of local gov-
ernment, or community-based organizations for planning and im-
plementation demonstration grants to provide primary prevention
for youth and young adults at risk of homelessness. Grantees shall
show collaboration with youth with lived expertise in project design
and implementation and funds may be used to support the estab-
lishment and operation of local youth advisory boards. The remain-
ing funds shall be used to support the demonstrations through
evaluation, training, and technical assistance. The Committee rec-
ognizes the important work accomplished by the one-time Runaway
and Homeless Youth prevention demonstration program and urges
the Family and Youth Services Bureau to continue to support those
efforts through a portion of the preventing youth homelessness
demonstration program.
Native American Programs
The Committee provides $60,500,000 for Native American pro-
grams. These funds support a variety of programs to promote self-
sufficiency and cultural preservation activities among Native Amer-
ican, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander organi-
zations and communities.
Native American Language Preservation.—Within the total, the
Committee includes $15,000,000 for Native American language
preservation activities, including no less than $6,000,000 for Native
American language immersion programs, as authorized by section
803C(b)(7)(A)-(B) of the Native American Programs Act (Public Law
88–452).
Tribal Programs.—The Committee notes the importance of inte-
grated and tribally-determined, high-quality early childhood serv-
ices for Tribal children and their families. The Committee requests
a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this act on the benefits
of allowing Tribes to fully integrate funding across Head Start,
CCDBG, and the Tribal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood
Home Visiting programs.
Community Services Block Grant
The Committee provides $770,000,000 for the Community Serv-
ices Block Grant [CSBG]. CSBG is a formula grant to States and
Indian tribes to provide a wide-range of services to alleviate causes
of poverty in communities and to assist low-income individuals.
States are required to pass on at least 90 percent of these funds
to local community-based organizations, the vast majority of which
are community action agencies.
222
Community Economic Development
The Committee provides $22,383,000 for the Community Eco-
nomic Development program. Community Economic Development
grants fund non-profit, Community Development Corporations that
help communities address the needs of low-income individuals and
families by creating employment and business development oppor-
tunities.
Rural Community Facilities
The Committee provides $12,000,000 for the Rural Community
Facilities program. The Rural Community Facilities program pro-
vides grants to regional non-profit organizations to provide tech-
nical assistance to small, low-income rural communities, that are
not served by other similar Federal programs, to help manage, de-
velop, and improve safe drinking and waste water facilities.
National Domestic Violence Hotline
The Committee provides $20,500,000 for the National Domestic
Violence Hotline. This national, toll-free hotline provides critical
emergency assistance and information to victims of domestic vio-
lence 24 hours a day.
The Committee provides continued support for the StrongHearts
Native Helpline, which provides critical support and resources to
meet the unique legal and cultural needs of American Indians and
Alaska Natives affected by domestic violence.
Family Violence Prevention and Services
The Committee provides $240,000,000 for Family Violence Pre-
vention and Services programs. These funds support programs to
prevent family violence and provide immediate shelter and related
assistance for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and
their dependents.
Culturally Specific Services for Domestic Violence and Sexual As-
sault.—The Committee continues $7,500,000 for culturally specific,
community-based organizations to provide culturally specific series
for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.
Family Violence Prevention and Services Resource Centers.—The
Committee understands the benefits of Family Violence Prevention
and Services Resource Centers to support communities in building
local responses and services for domestic violence survivors. The
Committee includes $2,000,000 for the Alaskan Native Women’s
Resource Center, $2,000,000 for the Native Hawaiian Resource
Center on Domestic Violence, and $2,000,000 for the National In-
digenous Women’s Resource Center to support critical networking
and coalition building between these communities across the State
and the Nation.
Intersection of Domestic Violence, Mental Health, Substance-use
Coercion, Housing Instability, and Child Welfare Involvement.—The
Committee recognizes that research has consistently demonstrated
that experiencing abuse by an intimate partner is associated with
a wide range of mental health and substance use-related con-
sequences, and it is not uncommon for an abusive partner to under-
mine efforts to maintain their recovery or intentionally use their
partner’s struggles with mental health against them. The Com-
223
mittee supports the work of the Office of Family Violence and Pre-
vention Services to invest in targeted support for families affected
by domestic violence at the intersection of domestic violence, hous-
ing insecurity, mental health and substance use conditions, while
ensuring families remain together through recovery and prioritize
the best interests of children exposed to violence in the home.
Sexual Assault Technical Assistance Initiative.—The Committee
strongly recommends providing $2,500,000 for technical assistance
grants to providers with extensive knowledge of and demonstrated
expertise in sexual assault prevention and response to support all
Office of Family Violence and Prevention Services grantees in serv-
ing victims of sexual assault.
Chafee Education and Training Vouchers
The Committee provides $44,257,000 for the Chafee Education
and Training Voucher program. This program supports vouchers to
foster care youth to help pay for expenses related to postsecondary
education and vocational training.
Disaster Human Services Case Management
The Committee provides $1,864,000 for Disaster Human Services
Case Management. This program assists States in establishing the
capacity to provide case management services in a timely manner
in the event of a disaster. It ensures that States are able to meet
social service needs during disasters by helping disaster victims
prepare recovery plans, referring them to service providers and
Federal Emergency Management Agency contacts to identify need-
ed assistance, and providing ongoing support and monitoring
through the recovery process.
Program Administration
The Committee provides $209,000,000 for the Federal costs of ad-
ministering ACF programs.
PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $417,515,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 482,515,000
The Committee provides $482,515,000 for the Promoting Safe
and Stable Families program. The Committee provides
$420,000,000 in mandatory funds authorized by the Social Security
Act (Public Law 74–271) and $62,515,000 in discretionary appro-
priations.
This program enables States to operate coordinated programs of
family preservation services, time-limited family reunification serv-
ices, community-based family support services, and adoption pro-
motion and support services.
Family First Clearinghouse.—The Committee provides
$2,750,000 for the Family First Clearinghouse. The Committee con-
tinues to recognize the need to support research into programs that
provide rigorous evaluations of established foster care prevention
and family support programs within the child welfare population,
including programs that support adoption arrangements at risk of
a disruption or dissolution that would result in foster care place-
ment, provide mental health prevention and treatment services,
224
substance abuse prevention and treatment services, in-home parent
skill-based programs, and kinship navigator programs.
PAYMENTS FOR FOSTER CARE AND PERMANENCY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,768,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,843,000,000
The Committee recommends $6,843,000,000 in mandatory funds
for Payments for Foster Care and Permanency. In addition, the
Committee recommends $3,800,000,000 in advance mandatory
funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. These funds sup-
port programs that assist States with the costs of maintaining eli-
gible children in foster care, prepare children for living on their
own, assist relatives with legal guardianship of eligible children,
and find and support adoptive homes for children with special
needs.
ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING
AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,518,774,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,528,679,000
The Committee provides $2,528,679,000 for the Administration
for Community Living [ACL], which includes $27,700,000 to be
transferred to ACL from the PPH Fund.
ACL was created with the goal of increasing access to community
support for older Americans and people with disabilities. It is
charged with administering programs authorized under the Older
Americans Act [OAA] (Public Law 116–131) and the Developmental
Disabilities Act (Public Law 106–402), as well as promoting com-
munity living policies throughout the Federal Government for older
Americans and people with disabilities. The Committee continues
to fund the Senior Medicare Patrol Program through the Health
Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account.
Home and Community-Based Supportive Services
The Committee provides $410,000,000 for the Home and Commu-
nity-Based Supportive Services program. This program provides
formula grants to States and territories to fund a wide-range of so-
cial services that enable seniors to remain independent and in their
homes for as long as possible. State agencies on aging award funds
to designated area agencies on aging that, in turn, make awards
to local service providers. This activity supports services such as
transportation, adult day care, physical fitness programs, and in-
home assistance.
Senior Centers.—Senior centers play an important role in pro-
viding programs to combat isolation and loneliness, which can be
risk factors for depression, substance use disorder, and even sui-
cide. The Committee encourages ACL and the State and local agen-
cies administering programs funded through the OAA to provide
ample funding to senior centers to support their general operations
and for programming that promotes the health and well-being of
seniors, including fitness and falls prevention programs, nutrition
classes and consultations, and foot clinics.
225
Preventive Health Services
The Committee provides $26,339,000 for Preventive Health Serv-
ices. This program funds activities such as medication management
and enhanced fitness and wellness programs. These programs help
seniors stay healthy and avoid chronic disease, thus reducing the
need for costly medical interventions. The Committee maintains
bill language that requires States to use these funds to support evi-
dence-based models that enhance the wellness of seniors.
Protection of Vulnerable Older Americans
The Committee provides $26,658,000 for grants to States for the
Long-term Care Ombudsman program and the Prevention of Elder
Abuse program. Both programs provide formula grants to States to
prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older individuals.
The Ombudsman program focuses on the needs of residents of
nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, while the elder
abuse prevention program targets the elderly community at large.
National Family Caregiver Support Program
The Committee provides $209,000,000 for the National Family
Caregiver Support program. Funds appropriated for this activity
establish a multifaceted support system in each State for family
caregivers, allowing them to care for their loved ones at home for
as long as possible. States may use funding to provide information
to caregivers about available services, assistance to caregivers in
gaining access to services, caregiver counseling and training, res-
pite care to enable caregivers to be temporarily relieved from their
caregiving responsibilities, and limited supplemental services that
fill remaining service gaps.
National Family Caregiver Strategy.—The Committee provides
$3,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000, to support demonstration
grants that develop, test, and scale models that implement commit-
ments and recommended actions from the National Strategy to
Support Family Caregivers. The Committee directs ACL to provide
a briefing for the Committee on Appropriations no later than 90
days after enactment of this act with an update on the implemen-
tation of this effort.
Native American Caregiver Support Program
The Committee provides $12,000,000 to carry out the Native
American Caregiver Support program. This program provides
grants to Tribes for the support of American Indian, Alaskan Na-
tive, and Native Hawaiian families caring for older relatives with
chronic illness or disability, as well as for grandparents caring for
grandchildren.
Congregate and Home-Delivered Nutrition Services
The Committee provides $565,342,000 for congregate nutrition
services and $381,342,000 for home-delivered meals. These pro-
grams address the nutritional needs of older individuals, thus help-
ing them to stay healthy and reduce their risk of disability. Funded
projects must make home-delivered and congregate meals available
at least once per day, 5 days a week, and each meal must meet a
minimum of one-third of daily dietary requirements. While States
226
receive separate allotments of funds for congregate meals, home-de-
livered meals, and supportive services, they have flexibility to
transfer funds between these programs.
Community-Based Organizations.—The Committee recognizes
the important work of community-based organizations that provide
home-delivered and congregate meals and act as a point of social
connection for vulnerable older adults. The Committee encourages
State units on aging and area agencies on aging to continue to
work with experienced, community-based organizations, such as
Meals on Wheels programs, when selecting local nutrition pro-
viders and distributing OAA funding.
Nutrition Services Incentives Program [NSIP].—The Committee
provides $112,000,000 for NSIP. NSIP augments funding for con-
gregate and home-delivered meals provided to older adults. States
and Tribes may choose to receive all or part of their funding in the
form of commodities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Aging Grants to Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations
The Committee provides $38,264,000 for grants to Native Ameri-
cans. This program provides grants to eligible Tribal organizations
for the delivery of nutrition and supportive services to Native
Americans.
In-Home Modifications.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of in-home services in facilitating the ability of older individ-
uals to remain at home. The Committee encourages ACL to better
understand these needs in Native American communities and en-
courages ACL to undertake an evaluation of the level of need for
in-home services that include accessible home modifications for
older individuals who are Native Americans. In doing so, ACL
should also examine the extent to which current ACL programming
is able to meet such needs.
Native American Nutrition and Support Services.—The Com-
mittee is aware of concerns regarding potential barriers to Indian
Tribes accessing programs and resources under title VI and title III
of the OAA. The Committee encourages ACL to convene with stake-
holders to understand these concerns and work to ensure that pro-
grams and resources are reaching Tribal members.
Aging Network Support Activities
The Committee provides $30,461,000 for Aging Network Support
activities. These funds support activities that expand public under-
standing of aging and the aging process, apply social research and
analysis to improve access to and delivery of services for older indi-
viduals, test innovative ideas and programs, and provide technical
assistance to agencies that administer programs authorized by the
OAA.
Holocaust Survivor Assistance.—The Committee provides
$8,500,000 for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance program, which
provides supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors and
their families, and to other older adult populations that have been
exposed to and impacted by traumatic events, including aging mili-
tary veterans, first responders, victims of childhood and domestic
violence, and survivors of man-made or natural disasters.
227
Housing-Based Care Management Models.—The Committee is
supportive of efforts to maintain, expand, or adapt evidence-based,
existing population health models serving older adults and young
adults with a disability. The Committee encourages ACL to explore
the feasibility of housing-based care management models that are
scalable, increase primary care access for low-income Medicare and
dual eligible beneficiaries on a continuous longitudinal basis, re-
duce the rate of growth in Medicare spending and nursing home
driven Medicaid costs, and benefit those living in any type of pub-
licly assisted housing and the surrounding community where resi-
dents have chronic health conditions and are in need of preventive
health programs.
Alzheimer’s Disease Program
The Committee provides $16,800,000, including $14,700,000 to be
transferred from the PPH Fund, for the Alzheimer’s Disease Pro-
gram which includes Demonstration Grants to States and the Alz-
heimer’s Disease Initiative. Within this funding, the Committee
supports the continuation of the National Alzheimer’s Call Center,
which is available in all States, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
year-round, to provide expert advice, crisis counseling, care con-
sultation and information referral services in at least 140 lan-
guages, for persons with Alzheimer’s disease, their family members
and informal caregivers. The Committee provides no less than
$2,000,000 to continue the National Alzheimer’s Call Center.
Lifespan Respite Care
The Committee provides $11,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000,
for the Lifespan Respite Care program. The Lifespan Respite Care
program provides grants to States to expand respite care services
to family caregivers, improve the local coordination of respite care
resources, and improve access to and quality of respite care serv-
ices, thereby reducing family caregiver strain.
Chronic Disease Self-Management Program
The Committee provides $8,000,000 to be transferred from the
PPH Fund to ACL for the Chronic Disease Self-Management Pro-
gram [CDSMP]. This program assists those with chronic disease
with education to manage their conditions and improve their
health status. Topics covered by the program include nutrition; ap-
propriate use of medications; fitness; and effective communications
with healthcare providers. Multiple studies have shown CDSMP to
result in significant and measurable improvements in health and
quality of life, as well as reductions in hospitalizations and emer-
gency room visits.
Elder Falls Prevention
The Committee provides $7,500,000, including $5,000,000 to be
transferred from the PPH Fund, for Elder Falls Prevention activi-
ties at ACL. Preventing falls will help seniors stay independent
and in their homes and avoid costly hospitalizations and hip frac-
tures, which frequently lead to nursing home placement.
228
Elder Rights Support Activities
The Committee provides $33,874,000 for Elder Rights Support
activities, which support programs that provide information, train-
ing, and technical assistance to legal and aging services organiza-
tions in order to prevent and detect elder abuse and neglect.
Aging and Disability Resource Centers
The Committee provides $8,619,000 for Aging and Disability Re-
source Centers. These centers provide information, one-on-one
counseling, and access for individuals to learn about their long-
term services and support options with the goal of allowing seniors
and individuals with disabilities to maintain their independence.
State Health Insurance Assistance Program
The Committee provides $55,242,000 for State Health Insurance
Assistance Programs, which provide accurate and understandable
health insurance information to Medicare beneficiaries and their
families.
Paralysis Resource Center
The Committee provides $10,700,000 for the Paralysis Resource
Center [PRC]. This program has long provided essential, com-
prehensive information, and referral services that promote inde-
pendence and quality of life for the over five million people living
with paralysis and their families. The Committee directs ACL to
support the National PRC at not less than $10,000,000.
Limb Loss
The Committee provides $4,200,000 for the Limb Loss program,
which supports programs and activities to improve the health of
people with limb loss and promote their well-being, quality of life,
prevent disease, and provide support to their families and care-
givers. Maintaining these programs is critical to support inde-
pendent living within the disability community across their life
course.
Traumatic Brain Injury
The Committee provides $13,118,000 for the Traumatic Brain In-
jury program. The program supports implementation and planning
grants to States for coordination and improvement of services to in-
dividuals and families with traumatic brain injuries. Such services
can include pre-hospital care, emergency department care, hospital
care, rehabilitation, transitional services, education, employment,
long-term support, and protection and advocacy services.
Developmental Disabilities State Councils
The Committee provides $81,000,000 for State Councils on Devel-
opmental Disabilities. These Councils work to develop, improve,
and expand the system of services and supports for people with de-
velopmental disabilities at the State and local level. Councils en-
gage in activities such as training, educating the public, building
capacity, and advocating for change in State policies with the goal
of furthering the inclusion and integration of individuals with de-
velopmental disabilities in all aspects of community life.
229
Technical Assistance.—The Committee directs ACL to provide not
less than $800,000 for technical assistance and training for the
State Councils on Developmental Disabilities. In addition, the Com-
mittee encourages ACL to consult with Developmental Disabilities
Assistance and Bill of Rights Act [DD Act] stakeholders prior to an-
nouncing opportunities for new technical assistance projects and to
notify the Committee prior to releasing new funding opportunity
announcements, grants, or contract awards with technical assist-
ance funding.
Developmental Disabilities Protection and Advocacy
The Committee provides $45,000,000 for protection and advocacy
programs for people with developmental disabilities. This formula
grant program provides funds to States to establish and maintain
protection and advocacy systems that protect the legal and human
rights of persons with developmental disabilities who are receiving
treatment, services, or rehabilitation.
Proper Settings of Care.—The Committee encourages ACL to con-
sider the needs and desires of patients, families, caregivers, legal
representatives, and other stakeholders, as well as the need to pro-
vide proper settings for care, in its enforcement of the DD Act.
Voting Access for Individuals with Disabilities
The Committee provides $10,000,000 to improve voting access for
individuals with disabilities. This program provides grants to pro-
tection and advocacy organizations to ensure that individuals with
disabilities have the opportunity to participate in every step of the
electoral process, including registering to vote, accessing polling
places, and casting a vote.
Developmental Disabilities Projects of National Significance
The Committee provides $12,250,000 for projects of national sig-
nificance to assist persons with developmental disabilities. This
program funds grants and contracts that develop new technologies
and demonstrate innovative methods to support the independence,
productivity, and integration into the community of persons with
developmental disabilities.
University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities
The Committee provides $43,119,000 for the University Centers
for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities [UCEDDs] to continue
to meet their obligations under the DD Act. UCEDDs provide train-
ing, technical assistance, service, research, and information dis-
semination to people with disabilities, their families, State and
local government agencies, and providers, to build the capacity of
communities and create improvements in the service delivery sys-
tem for people with I/DD and other disabilities, including those
from underrepresented populations. The funding also will support
technical assistance to strengthen and support the National net-
work of UCEDDs as they disseminate research, training, and prac-
tices nationwide.
230
Independent Living
The Committee provides $128,183,000 for the Independent Liv-
ing program, which helps ensure that individuals with disabilities
can live productive and independent lives in society. Funding helps
States sustain, improve, and expand independent living services
and establish and support a network of centers for independent liv-
ing.
National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabili-
tation Research [NIDILRR]
The Committee provides $119,000,000 for the NIDILRR, which
supports research and activities that help to maximize the full po-
tential of individuals with disabilities in employment, independent
living, and social activities. NIDILRR is the only government entity
charged to focus on the whole person with a disability and their
ability to function independently and maintain a high quality of life
among all personal, societal and environmental factors. The appro-
priation continues funding to support the Traumatic Brain Injury
Model Systems National Data and Statistical Center.
Assistive Technology
The Committee provides $40,000,000 for Assistive Technology
[AT]. AT provides States with funding to support individuals with
disabilities of all ages to obtain devices and services that will in-
crease, maintain, or improve their functional capabilities. With the
reauthorization of the 21st Century Assistive Technology Act, the
Committee supports implementation to meet the increased demand
for access to assistive technology for people with disabilities and
older adults. In doing so, the Committee eliminates the alternative
financing program that duplicates resources already available
under the 21st Century Assistive Technology Act.
Program Administration
The Committee provides $41,000,000 for program administration
at ACL. These funds support salaries and related expenses for pro-
gram management and oversight activities.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—The Committee includes
$13,968,000 for aging and disability services projects, as specified
in the table at the end of this Committee Report.
Grant Tables.—The Committee notes with disappointment, the
failure to include in its fiscal year 2026 Congressional Justification
[CJ], relevant formula and competitive grant award tables and out-
come and output tables. It is critically important for Congress to
conduct oversight of appropriated funding for formula and competi-
tive grants. In the fiscal year 2027 CJ, the Committee directs ACL
to include grant tables and outcome and output tables, consistent
with the fiscal year 2025 CJ.
Report.—Within 60 days of enactment of this act and every 60
days thereafter, the Committee directs ACL to provide a report de-
tailing the status of funding for Congressional Directed Spending
projects for the previous three fiscal years. Such a report shall be

ADMINISTRATION FOR STRATEGIC PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
The Committee provides $3,616,597,000 for the Administration
for Strategic Preparedness and Response [ASPR]. This appropria-
tion supports the activities of ASPR and other components within
the Office of the Secretary to prepare for the health consequences
of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including pan-
demic influenza.
Department of Defense Coordination.—The Committee under-
stands the critical role of the Department of Defense [DoD] in the
larger U.S. Government and private sector efforts to address chem-
ical, biological, radiological, and nuclear [CBRN] threats as well as
emerging infectious diseases. The DoD possesses unique capabili-
ties that contribute to interagency efforts to prevent, detect, and re-
spond to outbreaks of infectious disease worldwide. The Committee
encourages prioritizing and aligning investments in medical coun-
termeasures among all Federal stakeholders to ensure that effec-
tive countermeasures are developed to meet both military and civil-
ian needs, and to prevent potential duplication of efforts. The Com-
mittee urges ASPR and DoD to coordinate to leverage private in-
dustry expertise to meet these needs.
Health Security and Preparedness.—Global health crises includ-
ing Ebola, COVID–19, mpox, and avian influenza, have highlighted
weaknesses in our National ability to respond to biothreats. Within
1 year after enactment, ASPR shall deliver a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations on all-hazards preparedness at HHS. The
report must include an integration of preparedness and future re-
sponse plans from the National Disaster Medical System [NDMS],
National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Cen-
ter [NETEC], and others relevant HHS programs.
Interagency Alignment of Biomedical Countermeasures Research
and Development.—The Committee has prioritized investments in
R&D of biodefense medical countermeasures through several dif-
ferent HHS components, depending on their particular missions
and areas of expertise; however, there are no rigorous mechanisms
in place to ensure the alignment of medical countermeasures re-
quirements, priorities, projects, and project transitions across each
of the agencies responsible for various phases of product develop-
ment, including basic research, preclinical development, advance
development, and procurement. The Committee urges ASPR to co-
ordinate with the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness
and Response [OPPR], and interagency partners that comprise the
Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, to
improve alignment and efficiency of medical countermeasures re-
search and development activities across Federal agencies, espe-
cially to ensure the end-to-end development of needed products,
technologies, or platforms. ASPR is encouraged to work with
NIAID, BARDA, FDA, CDC, related efforts of the Department of
Defense’s biodefense R&D programs, and similar R&D programs
funded by the Department of Energy.
Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise
[PHEMCE].—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
PHEMCE in ensuring the Nation’s preparedness for CBRN and
emerging infectious disease threats. The Committee directs ASPR
232
to continue to partner with PHEMCE interagency partners in the
execution of those functions. The Committee further directs ASPR,
working with PHEMCE and intelligence community partners, to
provide an annual classified threat briefing to the Committees on
Appropriations, and as situations arise that may materially impact
our medical countermeasure enterprise. This advisory committee
should encompass a diverse array of external partners to ensure
comprehensive expertise in addressing various threats, thus for-
tifying the Nation’s overall preparedness. To the extent practicable,
PHEMCE’s strategic planning and decision-making around stock-
pile needs, requirements, and interactions with other government
agencies and the communication of such decisions should be made
in concert with the advisory committee considering the inputs from
private partners. ASPR is directed to report to the Committee with-
in 120 days of enactment to provide an update on these activities,
including efforts to engage industry representatives.
Reporting.—The Committee directs ASPR to brief the Commit-
tees on Appropriations monthly regarding activities funded by this
act and other available appropriations. The agency shall notify the
Committees on Appropriations at least 24 hours in advance of any
obligation greater than $25,000,000 from any appropriation avail-
able to ASPR. The agency shall also notify the Committees on Ap-
propriations at least 24 hours in advance of any grant or contract
termination greater than $25,000,000 from any appropriation avail-
able to ASPR. Such notification shall include the source of funding,
including the applicable legislative citation, a description of the ob-
ligation, and a justification for the termination, if applicable. In ad-
dition, ASPR shall submit two separate monthly reports in elec-
tronic format summarizing the details of any grant or contract obli-
gations and terminations to the Committees on Appropriations.
Such reports shall be due not later than 30 days after the end of
each month and shall be cumulative for the fiscal year with the
most recent obligations or terminations listed at the top. Further-
more, ASPR shall include in this monthly report the current inven-
tory of COVID–19 therapeutics, as well as the deployment of these
therapeutics during the previous month as reported by States and
other jurisdictions until the inventory is expended. Finally, ASPR
shall also notify the Committees on Appropriations at least 24
hours in advance of any funding transfer greater than $25,000,000
from any appropriation available to ASPR to any other agency or
Department. Such notification shall include the source of funding,
including the applicable legislative citation, a description of the ob-
ligation, and a justification for the transfer.
Report on Essential Medicines Risk Assessment.—The Committee
requests the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaries of De-
fense and Homeland Security as well as the Director of the Office
of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, to submit a report
within 18 months of enactment of this act, assessing the FDA’s up-
dated Essential Medicines List. Specifically, the report shall assess
and identify, to the extent available: (1) key starting materials and
excipients used in manufacturing the active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients and drugs on the essential medicines list; (2) the names of
the active pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs on the essential
medicines list that rely on high-risk foreign suppliers for more than
233
50 percent of production; (3) current domestic manufacturing capa-
bilities for drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients on the es-
sential medicines list, including their key starting materials and
excipients, and any cost-effective manufacturing technologies, in-
cluding advanced manufacturing, that should or should not be con-
sidered; (4) national security risks, including cybersecurity threats
and critical infrastructure designations; (5) any deficiencies, lack of
authorities, or limitations in policy or process that limit the De-
partments of Health and Human Services, Defense, or Homeland
Security to address any national security risks in the pharma-
ceutical supply chain; and (6) how the Departments of Health and
Human Services, Defense, or Homeland Security will mitigate such
national security risks, including through its use of the Defense
Production Act.
Rural Medical Autonomy.—The Committee is fully aware of the
challenges facing emergency medical response to natural or man-
made disasters in rural areas. Resources are often limited and re-
mote, leading to delays in treatment that result in poor outcomes.
The role of autonomous systems can be invaluable, quickly pro-
viding life-saving tools across a range of medical applications such
as drone delivery of critical medical supplies and drugs, as well as
autonomous air and ground systems that evaluate safety in a
chem-bio, electrical hazard or fire environment. Autonomous sys-
tems can be paired with telemedicine capabilities to deliver real-
time connectivity between emergency responders and Level 1 trau-
ma centers and other emergency medicine professionals. ASPR is
directed to report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment
on efforts to develop, test and demonstrate the role that autono-
mous systems can play to improve emergency medical applications
in rural America.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND PROCUREMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,135,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,127,991,000
The Committee provides $3,127,991,000 for ASPR’s Research,
Development, and Procurement activities. This appropriation sup-
ports the advanced research, development, regulatory approval,
and procurement of life-saving medical products-drugs, vaccines,
therapeutics, diagnostics, and medical devices—that are collectively
known as medical countermeasures [MCMs]. These MCMs serve as
life-saving technologies during public health emergencies involving
CBRN threats and other emerging threats, while advancing the
day-to-day public health and medical capabilities. In addition to de-
veloping these products, this appropriation also supports ensuring
certain qualifying MCMs and medical supplies are stockpiled to be
ready to deploy when needed.
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority
[BARDA]
The Committee recommendation includes $1,015,000,000 for
BARDA. BARDA supports the advanced development of vaccines,
therapeutics, diagnostics and devices for potential serious public
health threats, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nu-
clear threats, pandemic influenza, and emerging and re-emerging
234
infectious diseases. BARDA played a critical role in the COVID–19
and Mpox outbreak responses, and swiftly acted in response to re-
cent Marburg, Sudan, and Ebola Zaire outbreaks. The Committee
encourages BARDA to expand its portfolio of partnerships for
broader success.
Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee continues to
support advanced research and development of broad-spectrum
antimicrobials, particularly for multi-drug resistant pathogens, and
next-generation therapeutics that address the increasing incidence
of antimicrobial resistance.
Antimicrobial Resistance Research Using Bispecific Agents.—The
Committee understands that research exists to develop therapies
that directly engage the host immune system to kill bacterial cells,
mirroring treatments in proven cancer drugs. Such an approach
may open the door to new variations of treatment, allowing for
more personalized and more precise medicinal treatments. The
Committee encourages BARDA to invest in these and additional
novel ways to treat bacterial infections that reduce or circumvent
the antimicrobial resistance seen with conventional antibiotics.
Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Partnership [BioMAP].—The
Committee appreciates BARDA taking steps to strengthen our Na-
tion’s MCM enterprise, including through the BioMaP and supports
efforts to expand domestic manufacturing infrastructure for MCMs.
Given the global nature of certain clinical research, development,
and manufacturing activities, it is critical for BARDA to strength-
en, expand, and make progress in onshoring these programs. With-
in 120 days of enactment, BARDA shall brief the Committee on
BARDA’s plans in fiscal year 2025 to support the onshoring of
MCM development activities, including actions taken by BioMaP.
Blood Supply.—The Committee remains concerned about the vul-
nerability of the blood supply after the peak COVID shortages and
the HHS Advisory Committee on Blood and Tissue Safety and
Availability report indicating that the blood supply faces significant
threats and challenges. The Committee supports the report’s rec-
ommendation to implement new technologies to improve the safety
and reliability of the blood supply. The BARDA strategic objective
to develop next generation blood products must go beyond treat-
ment of radiation injuries and be expanded to include products that
can be used regardless of the patient’s blood group, expand avail-
ability to all hospitals, prevent shortages, and be suitable for use
throughout the continuum of care including first responders. Suit-
able products that are in clinical trials should be considered a pri-
ority for funding. The Committee urges BARDA to expand the de-
velopment of freeze-dried hemostatic products, especially platelet-
derived products, to include a wide range of indications encom-
passing treatment of hemorrhagic disease, use in general surgery,
obstetrics, and trauma. Further, the Committee recommends con-
sideration for investments in next generation blood products should
be prioritized based on the clinical stage of development to ensure
a rapid deployment of product(s) which fulfill existing capability
gaps for a resilient blood supply. The Committee encourages the
Secretary to consider a pilot project to expand manufacturing ca-
pacity such that a regional cryopreserved platelet [CPP] pilot pro-
gram can be established in an at-risk geographic location. The Sec-
235
retary shall provide a biannual report to the Committee detailing
the progress on these efforts.
CBRN Threats.—The Committee expresses deep concern regard-
ing the heightened risks posed by CBRN weapons worldwide. The
Committee provides robust funding for BARDA’s core national se-
curity mission to protect Americans against these deliberate, man-
made threats. The Committee urges ASPR to prioritize the develop-
ment and stockpiling of critical CBRN vaccines, treatments, and
diagnostics to ensure uninterrupted access to these life-saving
MCMs within the Strategic National Stockpile [SNS]. The Com-
mittee encourages ASPR to engage more frequently with private
sector partners to speed the development of new MCMs and stock-
piling of existing MCMs against CBRN threats.
Clostridioides difficile [C. diff].—The Committee recognizes that
C. diff infections are an urgent problem in patient care settings, re-
sulting in 476,000 infections which cause 20,500 deaths annually
in the United States. Currently, one in six patients diagnosed with
C. diff will be re-diagnosed in the subsequent 2–8 weeks and one
in 11 people over the age of 65 diagnosed with healthcare associ-
ated C. diff infection die within 1 month. The Committee strongly
encourages BARDA to support research and clinical trials for the
development of a novel treatment for C. diff that prevents anti-
biotic resistance and recurrent infection, as seen in existing treat-
ments.
Diagnostic Rapid Response Initiative [DxR2].—Biological threats
remain a persistent and evolving danger, requiring robust and
proactive preparedness measures. The Committee is encouraged by
HHS and BARDA leadership in developing the DxR2. It is critical
that BARDA moves forward expeditiously to establish an afford-
able, scalable solution that leverages or enhances existing commer-
cial infrastructure to address these ongoing national security
threats. This program strikes the necessary balance, safeguarding
public health while strengthening the Nation’s capacity to respond
effectively to emergencies with a long-term, affordable, and sustain-
able approach. Continued investment in DxR2 is essential to en-
hancing our National ability to rapidly respond to biothreat inci-
dents. BARDA is encouraged to maintain this important program
as a priority within the PHEMCE portfolio.
Fungal Threats.—The Committee also recognizes the health se-
curity threat presented by rising global fungal infection rates and
increasing antifungal resistance. The Committee urges BARDA to
consider its role in protecting Americans from fungal infections by
reviewing vaccine, drug, and therapeutics in the development pipe-
line with specific consideration for partnerships to develop fungal
products.
Infectious Diseases.—The Committee supports robust funding for
BARDA’s naturally occurring infectious disease programs, includ-
ing emerging infectious diseases, AMR, and pandemic influenza.
The Committee encourages BARDA to account for low-resource set-
tings and vulnerable populations, such as children and neonates, in
its funding decisions to produce tools that have wide applicability
for many geographies in the United States and globally that lack
advanced health infrastructure. The Committee encourages ASPR
to project its spending on emerging infectious diseases, AMR, and
236
pandemic influenza in its annual 5-year budget plan. The Com-
mittee requests that BARDA continue publicly updating its re-
search portfolios to include pathogen, product, phase, and funding
data for all its programs, and to provide the underlying data in
tabular form. Finally, the Committee requests BARDA provide a
report within 180 days of enactment on its role to date in equip-
ping the United States to address potential, naturally occurring, or
engineered infectious agents that risk the health, security, eco-
nomic wellbeing and lives of Americans.
Infectious Disease Outbreaks With Pandemic Potential.—The
Committee supports robust funding for BARDA to engage in public-
private partnerships to support advanced R&D of innovative plat-
form technologies and MCM programs focused on (but not limited
to) vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other MCMs for emerg-
ing infectious diseases, including novel pathogens and viral fami-
lies with pandemic potential. The Committee encourages ASPR to
prioritize the identification and development of promising tech-
nologies that can be leveraged to address a range of future patho-
gens, including virus families with significant pandemic potential.
In addition, the Committee directs BARDA to allocate no less than
$10,000,000 in fiscal year 2025 to support the Disease X Medical
Countermeasure Program at BARDA for expeditious development
of MCMs against priority viral families, including those effective
against novel pandemic pathogens.
Next Generation Smallpox Biodefense.—As tensions with coun-
tries of concern continue to increase, the Committee recognizes the
need to ensure preparedness against biological terror threats. The
Committee is concerned about the ongoing threat smallpox poses to
both national security and public health, and recognizes there are
existing gaps in vaccination and treatment, that would prevent a
timely and effective response in the event of an outbreak. The
Committee is aware of advancements in next generation thera-
peutics for smallpox, specifically monoclonal antibody drugs, which
could address safety and efficacy issues associated with products
currently available in the stockpile. Therefore, the Committee
urges ASPR to prioritize the advanced development of monoclonal
antibody drug products for the treatment of smallpox. Additionally,
to ensure the government is investing in safe and effective medical
countermeasures, the Committee urges ASPR to partner with ap-
propriate Federal agencies like NIH to conduct a review of natural
and engineered resistance of biothreat agents in the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile. ASPR is directed to update the Committee on
these efforts within 1 year of enactment.
Preventing Respiratory Infections in Hospitals.—The Committee
is concerned about the continued public health threat posed by
healthcare-associated infections [HAIs], especially respiratory infec-
tions that are the greatest contributor to HAIs. Respiratory HAIs
are directly responsible for deaths and rising healthcare costs; con-
tribute to the growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance by increas-
ing the use of antibiotics and antivirals; and severely strain our
healthcare systems during times of pandemics or potential bio-at-
tacks. The Committee therefore encourages BARDA to prioritize ef-
forts to advance respiratory technologies like ultraviolet [UV] res-
pirators intended for use by patients in hospital and healthcare fa-
237
cility settings who have respiratory infections, which eliminate
pathogens in exhaled breath and thereby stop the spread of these
infections.
Securing BARDA’s Partnerships from Malign Actors.—The Com-
mittee directs BARDA to submit a report to the Committees within
180 days of enactment on all partnerships with entities that are
based in the People’s Republic of China [PRC] or under the juris-
diction of the PRC government and their subsidiaries. The report
shall include partnerships spanning the entire scope of BARDA’s
work including the development of vaccines, drugs, therapies, and
diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies such as
CBRN accidents, incidents and attacks; pandemic influenza [PI],
and emerging infectious diseases [EID]. Additionally, the report
shall include the type of agreement that BARDA has entered into
with a PRC entity, the scope of the agreement, the length of the
agreement, and what data or information has been or will be
shared with the BARDA partner.
Tuberculosis [TB].—Drug resistant TB is identified as a serious
threat level pathogen to the United States by the Combating Anti-
biotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator [CARB–X].
As drug resistant TB cases are on the rise globally, the threat to
the United States also grows and BARDA’s investment in new TB
diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines is critical. The Committee requests
an update on BARDA’s investments in drug resistant TB research
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Project Bioshield Special Reserve Fund
The Committee recommendation includes $825,000,000 for
Project Bioshield. The Committee is committed to ensuring the Na-
tion is adequately prepared against chemical, biological, radio-
logical, and nuclear attacks. These funds support the acquisition of
promising MCMs developed through BARDA contracts for the most
serious public health threats.
Strategic National Stockpile
The Committee includes $980,000,000 for the Strategic National
Stockpile [SNS].
Acute Radiation Syndrome [ARS].—The Committee notes ASPR
has the responsibility of developing and procuring MCMs for natu-
rally occurring and intentional threat agents while ensuring that
these are quickly available in the event of an emergency, and that
these threats include nuclear and radiological events. The Com-
mittee is concerned, however, that ASPR/SNS has only been able
to meet 45 percent of the published requirement to protect Ameri-
cans from ARS. Considering the risks associated with international
supply chains and recent geopolitical developments, the Committee
directs ASPR/SNS to prioritize domestically sourced FDA-approved
MCMs for ARS and thermal burns. Additionally, given the antici-
pated delays in treatment initiation due to the extended time need-
ed to deploy personnel and MCMs in the event of a nuclear or radi-
ological incident, the Committee urges ASPR/SNS to prioritize
FDA-approved countermeasures with an extended treatment win-
dow. Such countermeasures should be effective for deployment at
least 48 hours after a radiological event and when administered in
238
the absence of blood products and other hospital level supportive
care. The Committee requests a report within 30 days of enactment
that includes an update on ASPR’s plans to ensure existing ARS
products are maintained at a level that meets the requirement and
secure the continued availability of a diverse set of domestically
manufactured countermeasures that will be effective under ex-
pected conditions of deployment and use.
Antimicrobial Resistance Class Review System.—The Committee
encourages ASPR, in coordination with the Food and Drug Admin-
istration [FDA] and Centers for Disease Control [CDC], to imple-
ment a class review system to regularly assess the safety, efficacy,
and vulnerability to antimicrobial resistance of existing SNS assets
that could be used to respond to CBRN and public health threats
and to support efforts to maintain an inventory of medical counter-
measures appropriate to respond to the continued evolution of anti-
microbial resistant organisms.
Made in America Strategic National Stockpile.—The Committee
is concerned about the Nation’s limited infrastructure to produce
essential products such as medical devices, medical equipment,
pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equipment [PPE]. The
Committee strongly urges ASPR to develop a long-term sustainable
procurement plan that gives preference to and results in purchases
directly from domestic manufacturers to the maximum extent prac-
ticable.
Medical Countermeasure Stockpile Preparedness.—The most re-
cent Medical Countermeasures Preparedness Review, submitted to
Congress as part of the required annual threat-based review of the
SNS, found the Department has not met medical countermeasure
stockpiling requirements for numerous public health threats. Fur-
thermore, the review demonstrated how the SNS often relies on
decades-old products to fulfill other stockpiling requirements. The
SNS is a key pillar in the Nation’s broader strategy to protect the
American people against man-made threats—like anthrax and
smallpox—as well as natural disasters. Gaps in the stockpile’s pre-
paredness against these threats jeopardizes national security.
Within 180 days of enactment, the Committee requests a briefing
from ASPR regarding progress made by the Department in ad-
dressing the stockpile shortfalls identified by the Medical Counter-
measures Preparedness Review.
Poxvirus Countermeasures.—The Committee commends ASPR for
their role in the successful campaign to stop the 2022 MPox out-
break in the United States by deploying medical countermeasures
that were previously developed, purchased and stockpiled for small-
pox preparedness. The Committee is concerned however that there
may now be an insufficient supply of poxvirus vaccine for
immunocompromised individuals as well as poxvirus treatments in
the stockpile, especially in light of the continued national security
threat of an intentional or accidental release of smallpox. The Com-
mittee urges ASPR to prioritize replenishment of MCMs used dur-
ing the MPox outbreak and requests a briefing within 60 days of
the date of enactment on the stockpiling requirements for poxvirus
vaccine and therapeutics as included in the 2022 Medical Counter-
measure Preparedness Report, submitted to Congress as part of the
required annual threat based review of the SNS.
239
Replenishing Influenza Antivirals.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the perennial threat of pandemic influenza, which
could be exacerbated by expiring antivirals in the SNS. The Com-
mittee strongly urges HHS to diversify and replenish its stockpile
of emergency influenza antivirals to ensure the Nation has mul-
tiple current treatment options in the event of an influenza pan-
demic.
Resupply of Nerve Agent Countermeasures.—The Committee re-
mains concerned that the Nation is not sufficiently prepared for the
threats posed by chemical weapons and nerve agents, particularly
threats to the American public. Anti-convulsant medicines provide
a key means of treatment, yet the SNS currently stockpiles only
diazepam auto-injectors, all of which expired in October 2023. The
Committee notes each of ASPR’s fiscal year 2023, 2024, and 2025
congressional justifications requested funding to procure FDA-ap-
proved next generation midazolam auto-injectors to resupply the
SNS. However, the Committee is concerned that ASPR does not in-
tend to execute the appropriated funds for FDA-approved
midazolam auto-injectors from fiscal year 2023 or 2024 and reiter-
ates the request for a report included in the Further Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–47). Therefore, the Com-
mittee urges ASPR to take appropriate steps to resupply the ex-
pired stock of anti-convulsant medicines in the SNS.
Reusable Respirators.—The Committee recognizes the substantial
evidence supporting the value of strategic stockpiling of reusable
respirators, as documented by the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine. These respirators provide enhanced
protection compared to disposable surgical and N95 masks through
their superior face-seal characteristics. They provide superior de-
fense for emergency service and other critical infrastructure per-
sonnel against infectious diseases, biological weapons, and chemical
agents. Due to their longer operational lifetime and extended shelf-
life when compared with disposable masks, reusable respirators are
also more cost-effective to stockpile. Stockpiling American made re-
usable respirators will also ensure that first responders have rapid
access to effective protective equipment and not be solely depend-
ent on foreign supply chains and disposable products.
Shelf-life Extension Program [SLEP].—The Committee remains
concerned with aging products in the SNS and the use of the SLEP
for MCMs. While the SLEP can result in cost savings and effi-
ciencies, it is not a substitute for the timely replenishment of aging
products in stockpile. For example, the most recent Medical Coun-
termeasures Preparedness Review, submitted to Congress as part
of the required annual threat-based review of the SNS, found that
ASPR often relies on decades-old products to fulfill current
PHEMCE stockpiling requirements. The Committee remains con-
cerned that efforts to achieve cost savings through SLEP could neg-
atively impact the distribution of, patient adherence to, and ulti-
mately consumer confidence in products in the SNS used during an
emergency. In the annual SNS threat-based review, the Secretary
will include the quantity of each countermeasure that is beyond 10
years of the initial FDA expiration date and the number of these
aged products in the SLEP that have no industry sponsor.
240
State Strategic Stockpiles.—The Committee supports a State
stockpile program, as authorized in Public Law 117–328, to supple-
ment the Federal SNS by allowing States to secure appropriate
drugs, vaccines, and other biological products, medical devices, and
other medical supplies necessary to respond to a public health
emergency or a major disaster. This may include products for re-
gional threats such as mosquito-borne diseases and natural disas-
ters such as hurricanes, tornados, blizzards, or extreme drought or
international threats. The Committee recognizes the importance of
guidance to States on how best to establish, expand, procure, re-
plenish, maintain, and manage State stockpiles, while ensuring ap-
propriate collaboration with the Federal SNS. ASPR is directed to
report to the Committees within 180 days of enactment to provide
an update on plans to issue guidance related to state stockpiles.
The Committee notes that empowering States to support their own
stockpiles and to stockpile products that may not be procured on
the Federal level will improve States’ ability to protect their spe-
cific populations and appropriately prepare for and respond to
emergencies. Therefore, ASPR is encouraged to establish, expand,
or maintain a State stockpile program for States’ specific and
unique needs, while ensuring such a program is appropriately co-
ordinating with the Federal SNS. The Committee directs ASPR to
include an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on its plans to imple-
ment the program, including providing a draft budget. ASPR is di-
rected to report to the Committee on their plans no less than 15
days prior to releasing a funding opportunity announcement.
SNS Resource Allocation Strategy and Guidance.—The Com-
mittee urges ASPR to enhance transparency on the process for re-
questing resources from the SNS and how product is allocated to
those requesting support during declared public health emer-
gencies. Within 1 year of enactment, the Committee directs ASPR
to provide a briefing on efforts to implement activities to support
transparency and information on how to request support and how
allocation of resources is determined.
SNS Transparency.—In prior years, the Committee has provided
the SNS with funding increases on top of the tens of billions of dol-
lars it received during the COVID–19 pandemic. Yet, the Com-
mittee continues to hear significant concerns with the SNS’ con-
tracting bandwidth and its ability to execute on contracts in a time-
ly manner. In addition, as products move through development and
are approved by BARDA, which is publicly disclosed, the Com-
mittee does not have visibility into which products are entering the
stockpile and when. Therefore, the Committee directs ASPR to in-
clude in its monthly briefings to the Committee information on
which products approved by BARDA are being stockpiled. The
briefing should be accompanied by a semiannual report on the con-
tracts executed in the past 6 months. This should be an ongoing
listing that will allow the Committee to continuously track prod-
ucts as they move through the development pipeline from BARDA
through the lifecycle of product replenishment for all products in
the SNS. Such semiannual reports shall include a forecasting of
products that ASPR reasonably expects will move from BARDA to
the stockpile over the next year.
241
Temperature Sensitive Products.—The Committee encourages
ASPR to ensure that vaccines, drugs, and other temperature sen-
sitive products are packaged, stored, and distributed using best
practices for appropriate temperature control, including through
the use of temperature monitoring technologies that may be placed
on individual packaging.
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness
The Committee recommendation includes $307,991,000, for Pan-
demic Influenza Preparedness. This funding supports efforts to
modernize influenza research and development of vaccines and
next-generation influenza medical countermeasures, preparedness
testing and evaluation, as well as critical domestic vaccine manu-
facturing infrastructure.
Biotechnology Platform Technologies.—The Committee directs the
Department to focus on developing and validating biotechnology
platform technologies that may be capable of addressing a variety
of health security threats, including emerging infectious diseases.
The success of Operation Warp Speed highlighted the effectiveness
of platform technologies to rapidly accelerate the development and
manufacturing scale-up of novel vaccines and therapeutics to ad-
dress evolving or unknown threats. There is an urgent need for a
suite of similar bio-platform technologies. Recognizing the chal-
lenges of developing single MCMs to address a wide range of
known and unknown threats, the Committee underscores the im-
portance of early-stage development and validation of innovative,
platform-based technologies to the point where ASPR would be con-
fident in the ability of the platform to achieve such results, without
developing a specific product for a specific threat.
Test-to-Treat.—The Committee believes the test-to-treat model,
which was implemented for COVID–19 in retail pharmacies and
health clinics, can make other infectious disease treatments avail-
able more quickly and reduce disease transmission and illness se-
verity. The availability of accurate diagnostics and the rapid pre-
scription of treatments is especially critical given the recent co-cir-
culation of multiple respiratory diseases during the winter season.
The Committee believes the test-to-treat model should be evaluated
for the confluence of influenza, COVID–19 and RSV, given the
availability of multiple diagnostic tests and antivirals. The Com-
mittee directs HHS to submit a report to Congress within 120 days
of enactment on the findings of the NIH Home Test-to-Treat dem-
onstration for influenza, lessons learned from the COVID–19 Fed-
eral Retail Pharmacy Program, and the design of a potential test-
to-treat demonstration for COVID–19, influenza, and RSV to serve
vulnerable populations.
OPERATIONS, PREPAREDNESS, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $499,606,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 488,606,000
The Committee provides $488,606,000 for ASPR’s Operations,
Preparedness, and Emergency Response activities. This appropria-
tion supports the operations and logistics capabilities across
ASPR’s programs as well as the tools and resources necessary to
support its emergency preparedness and response mission. This in-
242
cludes ASPR’s financial management, acquisition, information tech-
nology, and its suite of integrated Federal medical response capa-
bilities that is prepared to respond when disaster strikes.
Supply Chain Control Tower [SCCT] Program.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of the SCCT Program, a voluntary col-
laboration between distributor partners and ASPR, to provide par-
tial visibility for supply chain monitoring and readiness. In addi-
tion to providing insights for demand and supply forecasting, the
Committee encourages ASPR to coordinate with FDA and CDC to
use the SCCT to monitor the availability of a broader list of essen-
tial health and medical products.
Preparedness and Emergency Operations
The Committee includes $31,154,000 for Preparedness and Emer-
gency Operations. The Preparedness and Emergency Operations
account funds the Office of Emergency Management, which sup-
ports the full spectrum of emergency management responsibilities,
including planning, coordination, logistics, training, and responding
to planned events and unplanned incidents.
National Disaster Medical System
The Committee includes $78,904,000, for the National Disaster
Medical System [NDMS] to improve the disaster readiness of the
Nation by better coordinating existing assets with States and re-
gions.
Mission Zero.—The Committee includes $4,000,000, for civilian
trauma centers to train and incorporate military trauma care pro-
viders and teams into care centers.
Pediatric Disaster Care.—The Committee includes $7,000,000, to
support the pediatric disaster care program.
Public Health Preparedness Equipment.—The Committee in-
cludes $2,000,000 for ASPR to maintain next generation air mobil-
ity solutions that will ensure more cost-effective health delivery
systems.
Prepositioning Response Medical Caches Outside the Contiguous
United States.—The Committee recognizes the geographic distance
of Hawaii and the U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands [USAPI] and the
need to pre-position emergency medical resources in Hawaii to
mitigate risks associated with disrupted transportation networks,
communications, and supply chains. The Committee urges ASPR to
maintain its prepositioning of response medical caches in Hawaii to
serve the State and USAPI. These medical caches should have a
minimum capability to support up to two 38-person Disaster Man-
agement Assistance Teams, in order to provide immediate support
to Hawaii and the USAPI during a public health or disease re-
sponse.
Health Care Readiness and Recovery
The Committee’s recommendation includes $309,055,000, an in-
crease of $4,000,000, for Health Care Readiness and Recovery
[HCRR], formerly the Hospital Preparedness Program. The HCRR
portfolio includes critical programs and activities that strengthen
healthcare sector readiness to provide innovative, coordinated, and
lifesaving care in the face of emergencies and disasters. The Com-
243
mittee believes this funding should be carefully coordinated within
communities to continue to provide our Nation’s hospitals and
emergency responders the necessary tools to respond quickly and
collaboratively to public health emergencies. Within HCRR, the
Committee includes $240,000,000, for cooperative agreements, crit-
ical support to State, local, and regional partners to advance
healthcare system preparedness and response.
Biocontainment Care Capabilities.—The Committee requests a
briefing within 60 days of enactment on the planning and design
resource requirements of Next Generation Biocontainment Care
Capabilities at a leading civilian NDMS medical surge pilot site, as
called for in section 741 of the National Defense Authorization Act
for fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Committee supports ASPR’s
Portable Biocontainment Units, and requests the briefing include
estimated funding needs for developing a regional capability to
transport highly infectious patients during infectious disease out-
breaks. This capability would enable medical personnel to provide
safe, reliable, timely patient evacuation and transportation.
Collaborative Learning Models.—The Committee notes the use of
technology-enabled collaborative learning models, such as Project
ECHO, during the COVID–19 pandemic and encourages ASPR to
leverage these solutions in its healthcare emergency preparedness
and response.
EMS Preparedness and Response Workforce Shortage Program.—
The Committee urges ASPR to address the crippling EMS work-
force shortage, including in underserved, rural, and Tribal areas
and/or address health disparities related to accessing prehospital
ground ambulance healthcare services, including critical care trans-
port. The Committee encourages ASPR, in consultation with the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of EMS, to
develop a national pilot program of grants to governmental and
non-governmental EMS organizations to support the recruitment
and training of emergency medical technicians and paramedics in
underserved, rural, and Tribal areas and/or addressing health dis-
parities related to accessing prehospital ground ambulance
healthcare services.
National Special Pathogen System [NSPS].—The Committee in-
cludes $7,500,000, to continue to support the National Emerging
Special Pathogens Training and Education Center [NETEC], and
$21,000,000 to continue to support existing Regional Emerging
Special Pathogen Treatment Centers [RESPTCs] and Special
Pathogen Treatment Centers [SPTCs] to prepare for future pan-
demic threats. Funding will support efforts to maintain and im-
prove the Nation’s preparedness against highly infectious pathogen
threats. Funding will continue to be available to NETEC and
RESPTCs for readiness to respond to outbreaks of infectious dis-
eases, for additional treatment centers, for special pathogen med-
ical transport and further establish the National Special Pathogen
Systems of Care tier network.
Regional Disaster Health Response System.—The Committee in-
cludes $7,000,000 to support ASPR’s efforts to improve disaster
readiness by better coordinating healthcare infrastructure and sys-
tems with States and across regions. The Committee urges ASPR
to continue improving regional readiness efforts to increase re-
244
gional ability to respond to threats, leverage local, State, and Fed-
eral healthcare assets across coalition and State lines, and improve
communications and coordination among participating agencies.
Trauma Care Readiness and Coordination.—The Committee in-
cludes $4,000,000 to support the efforts of States and consortia of
States to coordinate and improve emergency medical services and
trauma care during a public health emergency. ASPR shall use
these funds to award up to five grants to eligible entities for the
purpose of carrying out research and demonstration projects to sup-
port the improvement of emergency medical services and trauma
care in support of the duties and functions included in 42 U.S.
Code Section 1A300hh–10 (b)(4)(C) of the Public Health Service
Act.
Medical Reserve Corps
The Committee recommendation includes $6,240,000 for the
Medical Reserve Corps [MRC] program, which is a national net-
work of local volunteer doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and
other community members. The Committee appreciates that fund-
ing for MRCs has historically been provided to local units quickly
and effectively, thereby allowing for grants to help build and sus-
tain local communities’ ability to prepare for and respond to emer-
gencies. The Committee encourages ASPR to continue this locally-
driven approach and to allocate this funding and any remaining
funding from the American Rescue Plan Act via established mecha-
nisms that provide funds directly to local MRC units, which are
made up of representatives from their communities.
Industrial Based Management and Supply Chain [IBMSC]
The Committee provides $10,000,000 for ASPR’s Pandemic Pre-
paredness and Biodefense activities. This appropriation supports
the permanent establishment of the Industrial Based Management
and Supply Chain Office to ensure that critical supplies are manu-
factured in the United States. It also provides resources to bolster
pandemic preparedness and biodefense against new and emerging
threats, which may include investments to accelerate advanced de-
velopment of investigational vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics;
support emergency manufacturing of critical MCMs and ancillary
supplies; and, to the extent feasible, invest in the expansion of the
domestic medical supply chain.
The Committee recognizes that deployment of cutting-edge man-
ufacturing technology is an essential component of a feasible path-
way toward a resilient domestic manufacturing base for medicines,
active pharmaceutical ingredients, and diagnostics. The Committee
directs that this funding shall be used to continue and expand on-
going work to build and validate advanced manufacturing proc-
esses and facilities capable of storing, producing, and deploying es-
sential medicines and diagnostics in the event of a national health
emergency.
Medical Countermeasures Domestic Manufacturing.—The Com-
mittee supported BARDA’s investment to accelerate the expansion
of domestic manufacturing capacity for ancillary supplies, like nee-
dles and syringes, during the COVID–19 pandemic. ASPR should
continue to support domestically-produced medical counter-
245
measures by investing in domestic capacity to manufacture essen-
tial medical products. ASPR should also explore ways to support
the market for these products by deploying a variety of stockpiling
methods, including vendor managed inventory strategies and bulk
purchases. The Committee directs ASPR to provide details in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts it has made or will make to support
domestic capacity for essential medical products, like needles, sy-
ringes, and blood collection products.
Diagnostic Manufacturing.—The Committee remains concerned
investments made by U.S. headquartered diagnostic companies for
end-to-end domestic manufacturing during the COVID–19 pan-
demic are being undone without warm-base investment. Therefore,
the Committee directs the ASPR to invest in public-private part-
nerships and create policies for flexible contracting with U.S. diag-
nostic test manufacturers to create a sustainable warm-base and
supply chain for end-to-end domestic manufacturing.
Improving Biomanufacturing Capabilities.—The Committee
urges ASPR to increase coordination with relevant Manufacturing
USA institutes to address pandemic preparedness, CBRN defense,
and emerging biopharmaceutical manufacturing strategies. Such
coordination will aim to develop, demonstrate, and deploy tech-
nologies and response capabilities to improve public health and
medical preparedness.
Industrial Base Manufacturing and Supply Chain.—The Com-
mittee provides funding for ASPR’s continued Pandemic Prepared-
ness and Biodefense activities. This appropriation supports the per-
manent establishment of the Industrial Based Management and
Supply Chain Office to ensure that critical supplies are manufac-
tured in the United States. It also provides resources to bolster
pandemic preparedness and biodefense against new and emerging
threats, which may include investments to accelerate advanced de-
velopment of investigational vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics;
support emergency manufacturing of critical MCMs and ancillary
supplies; and, to the extent feasible, invest in the expansion of the
domestic medical supply chain. The Committee urges ASPR to
prioritize the development of new Abbreviated New Drug Applica-
tion [ANDA] by a domestic manufacturer for priority essential
drugs in shortage or at risk of shortage to have domestic manufac-
turers able to produce a drug if it goes into shortage.
The Committee recognizes that cutting-edge manufacturing tech-
nology is an essential component of a resilient domestic manufac-
turing base for medicines, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and
diagnostics. The Committee urges ASPR to use this funding to con-
tinue ongoing work to build and validate advanced manufacturing
processes and facilities capable of storing, producing, and deploying
essential medicines and diagnostics in the event of a national
health emergency.
Prioritizing Domestic Producers of Essential Medicines.—The
Committee is concerned about drug shortages of essential medi-
cines. Therefore, the Committee urges ASPR to utilize U.S. manu-
factures that are producing critical medicines, like the antibiotic
amoxicillin, over non-U.S. producers.
Rapid Detection of Bioterrorism Agents.—The Committee is con-
cerned that the Nation is not prepared to rapidly detect biological
246
agents, such as anthrax, tularemia, melioidosis, glanders, and
plague, even though BARDA has successfully supported develop-
ment of diagnostic technologies that detect such biothreats, in some
cases simultaneously. The Committee strongly urges ASPR to
prioritize partnerships with domestic manufacturers capable of pro-
ducing rapid diagnostics that can detect such threats and develop
a diagnostic testing preparedness plan for use during public health
emergencies, disasters, and other serious public health threats.
Strengthening Domestic Manufacturing and Production.—The
Committee commends ASPR for its support of industrial base man-
agement capabilities launched during the COVID–19 pandemic, in-
cluding global supply chain situational awareness, market capabili-
ties, rapid acquisition execution, and coordination of Defense Pro-
duction Act [DPA] and Emergency Support Function [ESF]—8 au-
thorities. This work has been essential to creating a secure and re-
silient domestic supply of quality and affordable essential medi-
cines and PPE. These strategic investments in domestic tech-
nologies and industries ensure our Nation’s health and biosecurity.
However, the Committee remains concerned about the Nation’s
limited infrastructure to produce essential products such as med-
ical devices, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and PPE. The Committee
supports efforts by ASPR to expand upon the domestic industrial
base to end the reliance on foreign sourced medical equipment,
PPE, diagnostic tests, medical devices, and to secure the pipeline
for critical medicines, including antibiotics. The Committee directs
IBMSC to use available funds to continue and expand ongoing
work to build and validate advanced manufacturing processes and
facilities capable of storing, producing, and deploying essential
medicines in the event of a national health emergency. IBMSC
should seek opportunities to expand domestic manufacturing facili-
ties with end-to-end capabilities to produce bulk drug substance,
support platform technologies for MCMs, and provide fill-finish ca-
pacity. The Committee urges ASPR to use available funds to sup-
port manufacturers in building, expanding, upgrading, modifying,
and/or recommissioning facilities in the United States to increase
manufacturing capacity of critical medicines or their active phar-
maceutical ingredients. The Committee directs ASPR to provide de-
tails in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts it has made to support
domestic capacity for essential medical products.
Trusted Domestic Vaccine Supplier Capability.—The Committee
continues to recognize the need for domestic manufacturing of key
biological starting materials [KSM], including plasmid DNA and
mRNA, antibodies, and other MCMs, to ensure timely response to
unanticipated health emergencies. Therefore, the Committee en-
courages ASPR to expand domestic manufacturing of KSMs and
collaborate with U.S. companies that have pharmaceutical capabili-
ties to ensure the development and stockpiling of synthesized medi-
cines for future pandemics and biothreats.
Warm-Base Manufacturing.—The Committee supports warm-
base surge production capacity contracts with domestic manufac-
turers, including NIOSH-approved N95 respirators and other do-
mestic PPE manufacturers who received Federal funding to expand
manufacturing capacity during the COVID–19 pandemic. ASPR is
encouraged to maintain domestic manufacturing surge capacity
247
and capabilities to prepare for, or respond to, an existing or poten-
tial public health emergency or otherwise address threats that pose
a significant level of risk to national security.

AD/RD Early Intervention.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to prioritize early interventions for Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias, and to identify and implement a com-
prehensive set of actions to assess risk factors for cognitive decline
and dementia. Such an assessment should emphasize historically
underserved communities, including individuals with Down syn-
drome. Actions should include: conducting health risk assessments;
identifying opportunities to address known risk factors; examining
incentives to promote brain health; providing payments for preven-
tion and care delivery models that incorporate brain health as part
of care and treatment of other conditions; and examining the devel-
opment and implementation of quality measures specifically related
to brain health.
Alzheimer’s Advisory Council.—The Committee is encouraged by
the Department’s leadership to ensure that risk reduction is part
of our Nation’s plan to end Alzheimer’s disease and continues fund-
ing for the Advisory Council on Alzheimer’s Research, Care and
Services. The Committee notes the Department is required to hold
quarterly Advisory Council meetings and issue a yearly strategic
248
plan, per the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (Public Law 111–
375) and directs the Department to do so. More than 3 years ago,
the Secretary announced that the 2021 plan update would include
a sixth goal [Goal Six] of reducing risk factors for Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. The Committee requests a briefing within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on progress made toward meeting that goal. The
briefing should include information on funding allocated toward
achieving Goal Six; how progress is being measured and tracked;
and an overview of how HHS and other Federal agencies are imple-
menting prevention strategies and working with non-governmental
organizations to meet Goal Six.
Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee continues to
support the administration’s proposal to combat antibiotic-resistant
infections by strengthening national One Health surveillance ef-
forts, encouraging the development of innovative diagnostic tests
for resistant bacteria, and accelerating the development of new
antibiotics, other therapeutics, and vaccines. Within 60 days of en-
actment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing detailing
how HHS and its agencies are coordinating their AMR-related ef-
forts, as well as domestic and international AMR trends.
Bereavement Care.—The Committee is concerned that individuals
and families often suffer severe health, social, and economic de-
clines following the death of a loved one, be it a child, sibling,
spouse, or parent. The Committee encourages the Secretary to co-
ordinate efforts across HHS to advance bereavement care for fami-
lies, including interventions or programs that could help coping or
adaptive processing.
Biotech Reagents.—The Committee is concerned by the increased
reliance on foreign imports of active pharmaceutical ingredients,
which are often made from U.S. exports of basic organic chemicals
and biochemical reagents. The Committee encourages the Secretary
to consult with drug manufacturers, scientific experts, and across
Federal agencies to compile a list of organic chemicals and bio-
chemical reagents required to produce active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients, biopharmaceutical treatments, and other medicines listed
on the World Health Organization’s essential medicines list. Fur-
ther, the Secretary should examine, to the extent possible, addi-
tional medical and non-medical industrial uses of such identified
reagents.
Budget Requests.—The Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide current and valid hyperlinks to all HHS budget requests for
the previous five fiscal years, including all operating divisions
budget requests, on the HHS Website.
Children’s Interagency Coordinating Council.—The Committee
recognizes the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation’s
[ASPE] role in supporting the work of the Children’s Interagency
Coordinating Council. The Committee continues current funding at
$3,000,000 for the Interagency Council’s activities. The Committee
requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act on the
Interagency Council’s activities, including efforts to establish a per-
manent leadership structure and identify officials from key agen-
cies across the government who will participate as members of the
council.
249
Chronic Numbness and Pain after Mastectomy.—The Committee
recognizes research demonstrating that long-term impacts after
mastectomy can lead to significant functional impairment and
quality of life issues for breast cancer survivors. The Committee is
aware of technological procedure advancements that can restore
normal breast functions, such as sensation, and improve functional
impairment, physical safety, and quality of life for breast cancer
survivors. The Committee encourages the Secretary, in collabora-
tion with other relevant HHS agencies, to explore technological ad-
vances impacting health outcomes after mastectomy and requests
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ about this issue.
Communications With the Committee.—The Committee relies on
its relationship with the Assistant Secretary for Financial Re-
sources [ASFR] and agency budget offices to make decisions about
how to best allocate budget resources and provide oversight over
how taxpayer dollars are spent. ASFR has a responsibility to en-
sure that the Committees receive accurate and timely information
including by ensuring that individual agencies and operating divi-
sions provide program-specific information in a timely manner
upon request. The Committee directs ASFR to improve the quality
and timeliness of the information it provides, including by reform-
ing and streamlining internal clearance processes, and allowing in-
dividual budget offices and congressional liaisons to communicate
directly with the Committee as they have done historically. Given
the current inadequate levels of communication and transparency
provided by congressional liaisons at ASFR, upon enactment, the
Committee directs the heads of each operating division to provide
no less than monthly briefings to the Committees. In addition, the
Committee directs the budget offices of each operating division to
provide monthly briefings to the Committees.
Coordination and Mitigation of H5N1.—The Committee recog-
nizes the ongoing impact of H5N1. Within 60 days of enactment of
this act and every 60 days thereafter, the Committee directs HHS,
in coordination with CDC, NIH, ASPR, FDA, USDA, and other rel-
evant Federal entities to provide a briefing on: (1) progress in miti-
gating H5N1 outbreaks, including USDA’s progress in imple-
menting its five-pronged strategy; (2) current Federal efforts to co-
ordinate with State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners to iden-
tify and mitigate the spread of the virus through testing and sur-
veillance or other means, including any limitations in carrying out
these efforts; (3) current Federal efforts to collaborate with global
partners in responding to H5N1 outbreaks around the world; and
(4) projected demand, capacity, and stockpiles for critical medical
products, including PPE and antivirals, needed in response to a po-
tential pandemic.
Dietary Guidelines.—The Committee recognizes that existing re-
search has shown that ultra-processed plant-based alternatives to
dairy are not nutritionally equivalent, and that consumers may not
fully understand the nutritional differences between dairy and
plant-based alternatives. The Secretary should ensure that the
process for developing the 2025 Dietary Guidelines includes rec-
ommendations that are based on the preponderance of scientific
and medical evidence consistent with section 5341 of title 7 of the
U.S. Code, and that it is fully transparent and includes a balanced
250
representation of individuals who are unbiased and free from con-
flicts of interest.
Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign.—The Committee con-
tinues funding at $1,000,000 for the Embryo Adoption Awareness
Campaign to educate Americans about the existence of frozen
human embryos (resulting from in-vitro fertilization), which may
be available for donation/adoption to help other couples build their
families. The Committee includes bill language permitting these
funds to be used to provide medical and administrative services to
individuals adopting embryos, deemed necessary for such adop-
tions, consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations.
Ending the HIV Epidemic.—The Committee continues support
for this initiative but is concerned by a lack of quantifiable data
showing outcomes of a program started in 2019. Therefore, the
Committee directs HHS to: (1) provide a spend plan to the Commit-
tees no later than 60 days after enactment of this act, to include
resource allocation by State; (2) brief the Committees on the fiscal
year 2026 plans no later than 90 days after enactment of this act;
(3) provide the Committees an update on the program’s perform-
ance data since the beginning of the initiative through the latest
available data, making sure to address each of the initiative’s goals
and performance metrics, no later than 180 days after enactment
of this act and updated annually throughout the life of the initia-
tive.
Faith and Community-Based Organizations.—The Committee
notes the impact of ongoing efforts and local partnerships to pro-
mote healthcare access and address chronic health challenges in
underserved communities. The Committee encourages HHS to
maintain and advance these partnerships, including with houses of
worship and community organizations.
Food is Medicine.—The Committee continues to provide
$2,000,000 to support ongoing efforts in OASH for the Food is Med-
icine [FIM] project to implement a Federal strategy to reduce nutri-
tion-related chronic disease, address food insecurity, and improve
health outcomes. The Committee encourages HHS to maintain and
regularly update the knowledge hub and to collaborate with other
Federal agencies on best practices, tools, and guidance related to
FIM interventions, including design, implementation, and evalua-
tion of pilot programs. Given the potential to improve patient care
and lower healthcare costs, particularly for individuals with chronic
and costly illness, the Committee encourages the Office of Sec-
retary to convene stakeholders and coordinate activities and de-
velop a national action plan to help increase access to medical foods
and medical nutrition therapy.
The Committee appreciates that the Administration is
prioritizing this initiative in alignment with its Make America
Healthy Again goals. The Committee also notes that various agen-
cies throughout the Department currently have or plan to under-
take FIM-related programs. Consequently, the Committee directs
the Secretary to coordinate FIM activities across the Department
and explore how to align these initiatives in a synchronized strat-
egy. Further, the Committee notes the importance of research and
evidence to examine policies that support reimbursement and scal-
ing of FIM interventions in healthcare. Therefore, the Committee
251
urges the Secretary to coordinate and consult with other Federal
departments with expertise in nutrition such as USDA, VA, and
IHS to continue to look towards innovative approaches to improve
access to FIM. Finally, given the important role of nutrition edu-
cation in expanding access to FIM, the Committee encourages the
Department to continue to pursue all opportunities to engage with
medical accrediting bodies and State continuing medical education
[CME] organizations to further incorporate nutrition competencies
into training requirements.
Global Health Research.—The Committee requests an update in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ on how CDC, FDA, BARDA, NIH, including
the Fogarty International Center, and other agencies jointly coordi-
nate global health research activities with specific metrics to track
progress and collaboration toward agreed upon health goals.
Group Purchasing Organizations’ [GPOs] Role in Prescription
Drug Costs.—The Committee seeks to better understand the influ-
ence of pharmacy benefit managers [PBMs] and their respective
GPOs on prescription drug pricing. The Committee encourages the
Secretary, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and
the CMS Administrator, to examine the role and impact of GPOs
employed by PBMs in negotiating prescription drug pricing, re-
bates, and fees associated with formulary placement by the PBM,
including options for enhancing transparency and oversight of
PBM–GPO arrangements. The Committee directs the Secretary to
provide the Committees a briefing within 120 days of enactment
and a final report no later than 1 year after the enactment of this
act.
Health Data Coordination.—The Committee notes the potential
for improving health and wellness through new technologies that
measure broad biomarkers, digital data, and other health span,
longevity, and status indicators. The Committee encourages the
Secretary to coordinate with officials from the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy and Department of Defense to
identify and coordinate Federal investments in technology and re-
search to generate and make use of health data for the purpose of
improving health and wellness while ensuring the continued pro-
tection of individually identifiable health information, including the
development of new technologies to generate data on health states
from biological samples and artificial intelligence systems that can
better integrate health data.
Hospital Cybersecurity Infrastructure.—The Committee recog-
nizes that cybersecurity has been one of the most significant in-
vestments hospitals have had to make in the past decade in terms
of technology, workforce, and insurance. As the number of health-
related cyber-attacks increase, hospitals are reporting that cyber
insurance premiums are increasing at a rate of 20–50 percent per
year. The Committee encourages the administration to work with
hospitals, especially small and rural providers, and other
healthcare stakeholders prior to finalizing any new cybersecurity
standards.
Housing-Related Supportive Services.—Individuals who have se-
rious and complex health challenges, including mental health and
substance use disorders, and chronic medical conditions, require
additional supports to maintain stable housing. The Committee
252
supports coordination between the Department of Housing and
Urban Development [HUD], CMS, SAMHSA, ACL, and ASPE to
provide direct technical assistance to communities leveraging exist-
ing programs, like Medicaid, to cover and provide housing-related
supportive services and behavioral healthcare. The Committee di-
rects HHS and HUD to jointly brief the Committees on Appropria-
tions on this effort within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Infectious Diseases.—The Committee recognizes the crucial role
HHS plays in advancing progress in the prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment of infectious diseases. Within 1 year of enactment of this
act, the Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to Con-
gress detailing the steps that HHS and its agencies are taking to
accelerate progress in the fight against infectious disease both do-
mestically and globally, including progress combatting tuberculosis,
influenza, avian flu, antimicrobial resistance, sepsis, valley fever,
Lyme disease, and other existing and future viral, bacterial, fungal,
and parasitic infections. Such report shall include up-to-date de-
tailed spending on each disease area by agency and operating divi-
sion and comparisons to prior fiscal years.
Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Promotion of Optimal
Birth Outcomes.—The Committee continues to provide $2,000,000
to provide regular progress reports on activities and outcomes of
HHS programs directed toward improving maternal health out-
comes.
LymeX.—The Committee continues to provide $5,000,000 to ad-
vance public-private partnerships and innovation in Lyme disease
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through the HHS Office of the
Chief Technology Officer.
Maternal Health.—Research continues to demonstrate that the
United States has higher rates of maternal mortality and adverse
maternal health outcomes than peer countries. The Committee re-
mains concerned by these findings, and directs HHS to prioritize
efforts to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce maternal
mortality by expanding the maternity care workforce, developing a
maternal health quality outcomes measure, and enhancing
postpartum social supports for families. Further, the Committee di-
rects HHS to focus on efforts to improve coordination across mater-
nal health programs and requests a report within 180 days of en-
actment of this act detailing plans to further such collaboration and
leverage agency expertise.
Mental Health Grants Dashboard.—The Committee encourages
the Secretary to establish and operate an interactive, user friendly,
Internet website-based dashboard that improves public access to
information about Federal grants related to mental health and sub-
stance use disorder, including for potential applicants for such
grants.
National Parkinson’s Project.—The Committee is encouraged by
the Department’s implementation of the National Parkinson’s
Project, as created by the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable
Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act (Public Law
118–66). Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department
shall provide a report on the projected costs of full implementation
of the act and describe steps the agency will take to implement the
253
act, as well as an update on activities of the Advisory Council on
Parkinson’s Research, Care, and Services.
Neglected Tropical Diseases.—The Committee notes that the in-
creasing presence of Neglected Tropical Diseases [NTDs] in the
United States, particularly among the Nation’s most vulnerable
populations, represents a significant health and economic burden.
Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Committee requests
a briefing on HHS’ efforts to assess the incidence and prevalence
of NTDs and identify gaps in research and development impeding
the Nation’s ability to combat these threats.
Mental Health Parity.—The Committee encourages the Secretary
to support State insurance departments for the implementation of
mental health parity as authorized in Public Law 117–328.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund [NEF].—The Committee directs the
Secretary to prioritize obligations from resources in the NEF for
projects currently underway. The Secretary should complete out-
standing projects in a timely manner and prior to funding new
projects. As part of the annual CJ, the Department is directed to
include the anticipated balances available for transfer into and
uses of the NEF for the current and budget fiscal years. Addition-
ally, the Department is directed to provide the Committees quar-
terly reports for all ongoing projects. The report shall include the
following for each project: a description and timeline for each
project; the date the project was notified to the Committees; total
obligations to date; obligations for the prior fiscal year; anticipated
obligations for current fiscal year; any expected future obligations;
and the total unobligated balance in the NEF. In addition, the
Committee requests biannual reports on expired balances that are
eligible for transfer to the NEF. Such report shall include the
Treasury Account Fund Symbol, program name, unobligated bal-
ance, and unexpended balance. Such report shall be transmitted 30
days after the close of the second quarter and within 45 days after
the close of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
Obesity.—The Committee notes that the CDC formally recognizes
obesity as a disease and recommends that it should be treated with
evidence-based therapies. Intensive behavioral therapy, improved
diet and nutrition, and medication, in addition to surgical proce-
dures, can lead to weight loss and have the potential to improve
health outcomes for those with obesity-related health conditions in-
cluding diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. Addi-
tionally, evidence points to rural areas and communities of color as
having a higher rate of disease burden. Obesity is a preventable
condition with a significant potential for reduction in burden of dis-
ease with adequate investment in proven prevention measures. The
Committee encourages HHS to take a comprehensive approach to
preventing and treating obesity as a chronic disease, including col-
laborating with other Federal agencies and conducting an evalua-
tion of the work and research being done across HHS agencies on
the costs, risks, and benefits of preventive measures and treat-
ments, and uptake of medications such as GLP–1 agonists. The
Committee requests a briefing on this effort within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Payment Management System [PMS].—The Committee notes
with concern reports of payment delays and disruptions from the
254
PMS, which can cause significant challenges and inefficiencies for
states and local organizations administering Federal programs.
Within 30 days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs
HHS to brief the Committees on the status of the PMS and any
technical improvements that HHS has made to improve payees
ability to use the PMS to access funds in a timely manner. The
Committee further directs HHS to immediately notify the Commit-
tees of any PMS outages or technical problems exceeding 48 hours,
and any payment delays or disruptions in the PMS distribution of
funds exceeding 14 days for individual payees, including any delays
resulting from Executive Order 14158 or Executive Order 14222.
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Risk Assessment.—The Committee
directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaries of De-
fense and Homeland Security, as well as with the Director of the
Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, to provide a
risk assessment of the pharmaceutical supply chain within 18
months of enactment of this act. The assessment shall be done in
coordination with the private sector and examine drugs, including
generic drugs, to identify a list of medicines: (1) that are reason-
ably likely to be required to respond to a public health emergency
or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear [CBRN] threat; (2)
whose shortage would pose a significant threat to the U.S.
healthcare system or at-risk populations; and (3) whose shortage
would pose a risk to national security. The assessment shall also
assess and identify: (1) key starting materials and excipients used
in manufacturing the active pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs
on the list; (2) current domestic manufacturing capabilities; (3) crit-
ical vulnerabilities, including cybersecurity threats; and (4) any de-
ficiencies, lack of authorities, or limitations in policy or process
that limit the ability of the Departments of HHS, Defense, or
Homeland Security to address vulnerabilities in the pharmaceutical
supply chain and how it will mitigate such vulnerabilities.
Psychedelic Therapies.—The Committee encourages the Secretary
to examine evidence-based care models for psychedelic or
entactogenic-assisted therapies for treatment of mental health and
substance use disorders. Specifically, HHS should assess the im-
pact of current policies, oversight, and regulatory structures on
care quality and patient outcomes; the cost implications of scaling-
up models of care; focus areas for future Federal research; and care
delivery best practices as well as challenges and opportunities in
implementing these care delivery models in Federal health pro-
grams. The Committee requests an update on these activities in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the contributions of the United States Public Health Serv-
ice Commissioned Corps [USPHSCC] in providing public health
and medical expertise and in responding to public health crises do-
mestically and abroad. The nation’s ability to respond to future
health crises is hindered without adequate funding to sustain the
active duty and reserve components. The Committee encourages
the Secretary to continue to fund the USPHCSS to adequately
carry out their unique mission as the only uniformed service with
a public health mission.
255
Rare Diseases.—The Committee recognizes that multiple Federal
departments, agencies and programs exist to address the needs of
people impacted by rare diseases and improve the lives of members
of the rare diseases community. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of enhanced coordination and collaboration across the
Federal Government and encourages the Secretary to initiate ef-
forts to focus on optimizing rare disease activities across the Fed-
eral Government and assess all Federal agency activities con-
cerning rare diseases.
Reimbursements for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists
[CRNAs].—The Committee is aware of recent efforts to reduce re-
imbursement for CRNA provided anesthesia, in conflict with sec-
tion 2706(a) of the Public Health Service Act. The Committee di-
rects the Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor
to take appropriate action to address this issue and protect access
to anesthesia services for rural and underserved communities.
Reorganizations.—The Department has long collaborated with
the Committee on any reorganization proposals, including on the
substance of the proposal and on the technical elements of aligning
appropriations language with the organizational and functional
structure of the Department. The Committee shares the Depart-
ment’s goal of improving the health of all Americans and remains
committed to working with the Department on shared priorities.
However, the Committee is concerned by the lack of information
provided thus far on HHS’ current plans for reorganization, espe-
cially in light of Department personnel actions that resulted in
statutorily required activities being stalled. The Department’s pro-
grams touch the lives of nearly every American and it is para-
mount that any reorganization improves HHS’ ability to carry out
its responsibilities, including carrying out the programs, projects,
and activities funded in this act in a timely manner.
Rural Health Strategy.—The Committee recognizes the persistent
disparities in health outcomes and access to care between rural and
urban communities. These disparities are often driven by factors
such as workforce shortages, geographic isolation, and facility clo-
sures. The Committee directs the Secretary, in coordination with
CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and CMS, to develop a coordinated rural
health strategy. Within 90 days of enactment, the Committee re-
quests a report outlining all existing Department-funded activities
specifically targeting rural communities, including those focused on
technical assistance, service delivery, workforce, and research, as
well as rural-specific components embedded in broader programs.
Additionally, the Committee urges the Secretary to ensure the ex-
periences of rural communities are accurately captured and ad-
dressed in Department-supported research, data collection, and
program evaluation efforts, including public data releases.
Rural News Media and Advertising Campaigns.—The Committee
continues to recognize the critical role local media plays in deliv-
ering public health messages to small or rural communities. There-
fore, the Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that local
media in small or rural markets are part of Federal public health
advertising campaigns. To further this goal, the Committee directs
the Secretary, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Pub-
lic Affairs and the Department’s media buyer contractors, to utilize
256
local news media in small or rural areas for HHS and its related
agencies’ public advertising campaigns to reach citizens with key
health messages. Local media includes newspapers, including non-
daily newspapers; television; and radio. Within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee directs the Office of the Secretary
to provide a briefing on the efforts of the Department in its utiliza-
tion of local media in small and rural areas as part of the Depart-
ment’s public health advertising campaigns for fiscal year 2026 and
future fiscal years, and the amount of money allocated to local
media in small and rural areas for fiscal year 2025 broken down
by Statewide newspapers, non-daily newspapers, TV and radio. The
Committee also directs the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in
consultation with the CDC’s Office of Rural Health to undertake a
review of the use of local media in small and rural communities in
a HHS public health advertising campaign in fiscal year 2026 in
several States to better understand the role of local media as a key
delivery system to reach small and rural communities with impor-
tant health messages. The Committee requests a report detailing
this review within 1 year of enactment of this act.
Sleep Disorders.—The Committee notes the lack of dedicated
sleep health and sleep disorders activities across HHS despite the
number of Americans affected, the economic cost and burden of ill-
ness, and the connection between sleep and serious chronic dis-
eases, including obesity and heart disease. HHS is encouraged to
establish a coordinating effort to promote sleep health and provider
education and awareness of sleep disorders.
Smoking Cessation.—The Committee acknowledges the Depart-
ment’s commitment to combatting chronic disease and notes that
this priority issue cannot be adequately addressed without advanc-
ing innovation in smoking cessation treatment to help all patients,
including those with chronic diseases, be more effective in their
quit attempts and treatment outcomes. Within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing from the De-
partment on the specific actions it will take working with the FDA
to incorporate a focus on smoking cessation treatment innovation
in the Department’s work to help Americans be healthy.
Staffing Reports.—The Committee provides funding levels across
HHS for the Department and its operating divisions to carry out
their statutory responsibilities including carrying out the programs,
projects, and activities funded in this act in a timely manner. With-
in 30 days of enactment of this act and monthly thereafter, the
Committee directs the Department to submit a staffing report in
Excel table format to the Committees which shall include the num-
ber of on-board staff for each operating and staff division as of the
end of fiscal year 2024, the end of fiscal year 2025, and monthly
thereafter. For each operating and staff division this shall include
the number of competitive service, excepted service (delineated by
schedule A, B, C, D, and title 42), and detailees. For HRSA, this
shall include the number of on-board staff at the program, project,
and activity level disaggregated by Bureau. For CDC, this shall in-
clude the number of on-board staff disaggregated by Center, Pro-
gram, and Office. For NIH, this shall include the number of on-
board staff at the program, project, and activity level,
disaggregated by Institute, Center, and Office. For ACF, this shall
257
include the number of on-board staff disaggregated by Program and
Office. For ACL, this shall include the number of on-board staff
disaggregated by the Center, Office, Administration, and Institute
level. The Committee notes that these monthly staffing reports
should demonstrate the Department and agencies’ progress in com-
ing into compliance with the directives included in this report. Ad-
ditionally, as required under section 228 of this act, the Depart-
ment shall provide the Committees on a biannual basis an excel
table which includes the names, titles, grades, agencies or divi-
sions, and date of hire of all of the political appointees that were
employed by the Department during the previous 180 days.
Substance Use Disorder Treatment Outcomes.—The Committee
recognizes that long-term, evidence-based outcomes research on
various treatment modalities for substance use disorder is limited.
The Committee directs the Department to expand and coordinate
evidence-based, long-term outcomes research for different modali-
ties of treatment and recovery support for substance use disorder
treatment. Such research should consider measures of mortality,
morbidity, and physical health, as well as quality-of-life measures,
such as employment, criminal justice involvement, family relation-
ships, and stable housing. The Department is further directed to
conduct research across the demographic populations of people with
substance use disorders, including those that have historically been
under-researched.
Vector Borne Diseases.—The Committee commends the Depart-
ment for the 2024 release of the National Public Health Strategy
to Prevent and Control Vector Borne Diseases in People and en-
courages continued collaboration and innovation to reach targeted
public health outcomes for the United States, including the target
of reducing the number of Lyme disease cases (laboratory con-
firmed) 25 percent by 2035.
Wuhan Institute of Virology.—The Committee is encouraged by
the actions taken to debar the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chi-
nese Academy of Sciences Capital Construction and EcoHealth Alli-
ance, Inc. from participating in United States Federal Government
programs and ensure that they are unable to receive Federal Gov-
ernment funding, pursuant to 42 CFR 180.800. Accordingly, this
bill does not include funding for either entity.
The Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the
Committee within 30 days of enactment of this act regarding com-
pliance with the debarment, any updates on debarment pro-
ceedings, as appropriate, and ways the Department is ensuring
that Federal funds are not awarded to entities based on evidence
that provides cause for suspension under 2 CFR 180.700 and

Section 30:
180.800.
Teen Pregnancy Prevention
The Committee provides $101,000,000 for the Teen Pregnancy
Prevention Program [TPPP]. This program supports competitive
grants to public and private entities to replicate evidence-based
teen pregnancy prevention approaches and develop and evaluate
new and innovative approaches to prevent teen pregnancy and
STIs among adolescents. In addition, the recommendation includes
$6,800,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act.
258
TPPP.—The Committee includes $900,000 for ASPE to support
the TPPP Evidence Review. The Evidence Review is an inde-
pendent, systematic, rigorous review of evaluation studies that in-
forms grant making and provides a clearinghouse of evidence-based
programs for other Federal, State, and community initiatives.
Office of Minority Health
The Committee provides $70,835,000 for the Office of Minority
Health [OMH]. The Office focuses on strategies designed to de-
crease health disparities and to improve the health status of racial
and ethnic minority populations in the United States. OMH estab-
lishes goals and coordinates all departmental activity related to
identifying and disseminating innovative and effective approaches
for improving health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority indi-
viduals.
Within the total provided for OMH, the Committee provides not
less than the following amounts:

Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
[AANHPI] Youth Mental Health.—The Committee notes with con-
cern that suicide has been the leading cause of death for AANHPI
youth ages 10 through 24 in recent years. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to examine the prevalence and causes of be-
havioral health conditions among AANHPI youth, including by
identifying ways the Department can address this disparity and
improve access to behavioral healthcare for AANHPI youth.
Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of promoting Indigenous solutions to ad-
vance health, and continues to provide $4,000,000 for the Center
for Indigenous Innovation and Health. The Committee recognizes
the Center’s efforts to partner with institutions of higher education
with a focus on Indigenous health research, education, and policy
among American Indians and Alaska Natives, as well as a focus on
Indigenous health policy and innovation among Native Hawaiians
and Pacific Islanders. The Committee encourages the Center to
both continue and expand these efforts, including by focusing on
improving health outcomes for Indigenous youth.
Middle Eastern and North African [MENA] Communities.—The
Committee recognizes that accurate and representative health data
may improve the ability for underserved populations to receive
greater access to healthcare services. The Committee encourages
the Department to examine access to its programs and initiatives
for Middle Eastern and North African [MENA] populations, includ-
ing by assessing gaps in previously collected data on race and eth-
nicity.
National Lupus Training, Outreach, and Clinical Trial Edu-
cation [Lupus Program].—The Committee continues to provide
$2,000,000 for the Lupus Program to eliminate health disparities,
259
improve health outcomes, and encourage participation in clinical
trials among minority populations affected by the disease.
Promoting Language Access Services.—The Committee continues
no less than $4,000,000 to support the development of methods of
informing limited English proficient [LEP] individuals about their
right to and the availability of language access services. The Com-
mittee supports the Department’s efforts to improve external com-
munications, which should include mediums such as television and
radio, to reach LEP communities. The Committee encourages the
Department to review communication practices and create uniform
applications across all HHS agencies to strengthen communication
practices to include digital, television, and radio advertising when
working with LEP communities.
Improving Maternal Health Outcomes.—The Committee con-
tinues to provide $10,000,000 to support community-based and
other eligible organizations located in geographic areas with high
rates of adverse maternal health outcomes, particularly among ra-
cial and ethnic minority families. The Department should support
activities that include but are not limited to identifying evidence-
based and evidence-informed practices for: addressing non-medical
factors that affect health outcomes; promoting evidence-based
health literacy and pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting education
programs; providing support from perinatal health workers; and
providing culturally congruent, linguistically appropriate, and trau-
ma-informed training to perinatal health workers.
Minority HIV/AIDS
The Committee provides $56,000,0000 for the Secretary’s Minor-
ity HIV/AIDS Fund [MHAF] to strengthen and expand services
provided by minority-serving community-based organizations
[CBOs] for HIV education and awareness campaigns, testing, pre-
vention, linkage to care, and engagement in care to racial and eth-
nic minority individuals at risk for or living with HIV in order to
address the decline in HIV testing and the challenges with linkage
to and retention in care and treatment that occurred during the
COVID–19 pandemic. Funding may be prioritized for minority-
serving CBOs in the South, which has the highest burden of HIV
of any region nationwide. The Committee includes $5,000,000 in
funding for the Tribal set aside within the MHAF.
Office of Women’s Health
The Committee provides $42,140,000 for the Office of Women’s
Health [OWH]. This office develops, stimulates, and coordinates
women’s health research, healthcare services, and public and
healthcare professional education across the Department. It ad-
vances important crosscutting initiatives and develops public-pri-
vate partnerships, providing leadership and policy direction to ad-
dress the disparities in women’s health.
Within the total provided for OWH, the Committee provides not
less than the following amounts:

Access to Lactation Support Services.—The Committee continues
to support HHS’ initiatives to improve access to lactation support
services for all women who choose to breastfeed. The Committee
notes that despite guidance from the HHS Women’s Preventive
Services Initiative recommending that families receive comprehen-
sive lactation support services to optimize the successful initiation
and maintenance of breastfeeding, many families struggle to gain
access to quality lactation care. The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2023 (Public Law 117–328) included funding for HHS to
enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM] to provide an evidence-based,
non-partisan analysis of the macroeconomic, health, and social
costs of U.S. breastfeeding rates and national breastfeeding goals.
The Committee expects that this analysis should also examine how
health insurers have implemented comprehensive lactation serv-
ices, the standards set to determine reimbursement rates for
breastfeeding supplies and services, and the current best practices
used to provide coverage to help women breastfeed.
Combatting Violence Against Women.—The Committee includes
$10,100,000 to combat violence against women through the State
partnership initiative. This program provides funding to State-level
public and private health programs to partner with domestic and
sexual violence organizations to improve healthcare providers’ abil-
ity to help victims of violence and improve prevention programs.
The Committee continues to recommend OWH create a State-level
pilot program to incentivize substance use disorder treatment pro-
viders to be trained on intimate partner violence.
Eating Disorders.—The Committee remains concerned that eat-
ing disorders have one of the highest fatality rates of any psy-
chiatric illness, with girls and women at heightened risk for devel-
oping an eating disorder during their lifetime. The Committee rec-
ognizes the efforts of OWH to address eating disorders, and con-
tinues to provide $750,000 for such efforts. The Committee encour-
ages OWH to address early detection and treatment protocols for
women and girls with or at-risk of developing an eating disorder,
and to examine the lack of pediatric and adolescent screening in
the primary care and pediatric settings. Further, the Committee
encourages OWH to convene with relevant Federal agencies and
stakeholders to ensure coordination among Federal efforts to ad-
dress eating disorders research, prevention, intervention, and treat-
ment, and gather recommendations for better administration of ex-
isting Federal programs.
Pregnant and Lactating Women’s Advisory Committee.—The
Committee provides no less than $200,000 for the Pregnant and
Lactating Women’s Advisory Committee. The Committee requests
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on progress and Federal ac-
tivities undertaken to implement the Task Force on Research Spe-
cific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women [PRGLAC] rec-
261
ommendations and recommendations for further implementation of
PRGLAC recommendations.
Reporting on Access to Medical Forensic Exams.—The Committee
provides $5,000,000 to OWH to support grants to States and Tribes
to collect data and report on access to medical forensic exams for
sexual assault survivors, in order to implement sections 503 and
504 of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of
2022 (Public Law 117–103). OWH should work collaboratively with
States and Tribes, and using data-driven approaches, identify areas
for improvement in healthcare delivery systems providing forensic
examinations to survivors of sexual assault.
Stillbirth Working Group.—The Committee provides $1,750,000
under the Office of the Secretary to support the continued imple-
mentation of the recommendations of the Stillbirth Working Group.
The Committee directs the Department to prioritize (1) improved
data collection and surveillance systems including the moderniza-
tion of fetal death reporting and interstate data harmonization, (2)
identification of evidence-based risk reduction strategies, especially
in disproportionately affected populations, and (3) initiatives to
support maternal mental health and bereavement care. The De-
partment is directed to submit an update to the Committee no later
than 180 days after enactment of this act on the status of imple-
mentation efforts and remaining gaps.
Women’s Health Research Study.—To address the persistent gaps
in knowledge of women’s health and improve access to care, the
Secretary should continue to coordinate with NIH and NASEM in
support of research that explores the proportion of research on con-
ditions that are more common or unique to women. This research
should establish how these conditions are defined and ensure that
it captures conditions across the lifespan and determine the appro-
priate level of funding that is needed to address gaps in women’s
health research at NIH and submit to Congress a report containing
the findings and recommendations of the study no later than 18
months after enactment of this act.
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration
Cybersecurity
The Committee provides $100,000,000 for information technology
cybersecurity in the Office of the Chief Information Officer and
HHS-wide to strengthen the Department’s cybersecurity posture.
These funds provide continuous monitoring and security incident
response coordination for the Department’s computer systems and
networks.
Office of National Security
The Committee provides $8,983,000 for the Office of National Se-
curity to support strategic all-source information, intelligence, de-
fensive counterintelligence, insider threat intelligence, enterprise
supply chain risk management, security for classified information,
and communications security support across the Department.
These funds sustain the Department’s security and threat aware-
ness and its ability to respond swiftly and effectively to national
and homeland security threats.
262
Office of Global Affairs
The Committee provides $7,009,000 for the HHS Office of Global
Affairs to support its work to lead global health diplomacy and pol-
icy coordination efforts for HHS to strengthen U.S. health security
and pandemic preparedness.
OFFICE OF MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $196,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 196,000,000
The Committee provides $196,000,000 for the Office of Medicare
Hearings and Appeals [OMHA]. This Office is responsible for hear-
ing Medicare appeals at the Administrative Law Judge [ALJ] level,
which is the third level of Medicare claims appeals. OMHA ensures
that Medicare beneficiaries who are dissatisfied with the initial de-
cisions about their benefits or eligibility can appeal and exercise
their right to a hearing in front of an ALJ.
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $69,238,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 69,238,000
The Committee makes available $69,238,000 in transfers avail-
able under section 241 of the PHS Act, to the Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology [ONC]. ONC is re-
sponsible for coordinating Federal health information systems and
collaborating with the private sector to develop standards for a na-
tionwide interoperable health information technology infrastruc-
ture.
Health Information Exchanges [HIE].—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of electronic health data as a critical piece to
address the health needs and care delivery challenges of diverse
communities. The Committee strongly encourages HHS to work
with States to designate existing neutral, trusted, and nonprofit
HIEs to be the State’s health data utility [HDU]. HDU models are
designed and implemented in alignment with States’ policies and
priorities to address the needs of a broader health and healthcare
ecosystem. A HDU can be defined as one or more entities, guided
by a diverse stakeholder governance structure, that combine, en-
hance, and exchange disparate electronic health data sets for treat-
ment, care coordination, quality improvement, population health,
public health emergencies, and other public and community health
purposes. The Committee recognizes that each State designated
HDU is essential in establishing a national framework that fulfills
a current gap in healthcare by implementing a comprehensive dig-
ital health infrastructure as a public utility that will support data
sharing between public and private health data stakeholders. The
Committee directs HHS to leverage existing authorities, funds, and
other resources to construct policy and regulations that strengthen
existing HIE infrastructure to facilitate their transition into HDUs.
If necessary, the Committee encourages the Secretary to issue pol-
icy guidelines, or best practices, to encourage each State to des-
ignate a HIE or HIEs to be a State’s HDU.
263
Information Blocking Guidance.—The Committee recognizes that
ONC’s rule to implement the interoperability and information
blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114–
255) took significant steps forward to give patients greater access
to and improve the electronic flow of electronic health information
across care settings. Given the significant penalties and other con-
sequences for information blocking, the Committee urges ONC to
continue providing regulated entities and other affected stake-
holders clear, practical guidance regarding foundational concepts in
the rule, including activities that are not regarded as information
blocking.
Standards for Interoperability.—The Committee continues to in-
clude not less than $5,000,000 to support interoperability and infor-
mation sharing efforts related to the implementation of Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources standards or associated im-
plementation standards. ONC is responsible for coordinating Fed-
eral health information systems and collaborating with the private
sector to develop standards for a nationwide interoperable health
information technology infrastructure.
Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement
[TEFCA].—The Committee notes that during fiscal year 2025, the
Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National Co-
ordinator for Health Information Technology [ASTP/ONC] ex-
panded the implementation of the Trusted Exchange Framework
and Common Agreement [TEFCA]. The Committee notes that the
intention of this framework is to provide policies, procedures, and
technical standards necessary to exchange patient records and
health information between providers, state and regional health in-
formation exchanges, and Federal agencies. The Committee, how-
ever, recognizes concerns regarding unintended consequences, in-
cluding the potential for consolidation. The Committee emphasizes
that TEFCA needs to remain a voluntary means of data exchange
as authorized under section 4003 of the 21st Century Cures Act
(Public Law 114–255). The Committee requests a briefing by ASTP/
ONC within 60 days of enactment of this act on its planned ongo-
ing implementation of TEFCA.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $87,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 87,000,000
The Committee provides $87,000,000 for the HHS Office of In-
spector General [OIG].
OIG conducts audits, investigations, and evaluations of the pro-
grams administered by the Department’s operating and staff divi-
sions, including the recipients of the Department’s grant and con-
tract funds. In doing so, OIG addresses issues of waste, fraud, and
abuse and makes recommendations to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the Department’s programs and operations.
Digital Health Innovation.—The Committee notes that OIG ad-
dresses issues of waste, fraud, and abuse and makes recommenda-
tions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Depart-
ment’s programs and operations. The Committee also notes that ex-
isting regulations, such as the anti-kickback statute, have not been
updated to account for new digital health tools and technologies.
264
Through the statutory authority found in section 1128B(b) of the
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1320a–7b(b)), the Committee en-
courages the Inspector General to put forth recommendations, in-
cluding safe harbor exemptions, that modernize and improve access
to care using digital health technologies while protecting against
waste, fraud, and abuse. The Committee requests a briefing by the
Inspector General within 60 days of enactment of this act on rec-
ommendations to remove regulatory barriers that impede health in-
novation and access to care.

TITLE III
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
Any references in this title of the Committee Report to the ‘‘Sec-
retary’’ or the ‘‘Department’’ shall be interpreted to mean the Sec-
retary of Education or the Department of Education, respectively,
unless otherwise noted.
EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $19,107,790,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 19,157,790,000
The Committee provides $19,157,790,000, for programs in the
Education for the Disadvantaged account. Funds appropriated in
this account primarily support activities in the 2026–2027 school
year.
Grants to Local Educational Agencies
The Committee provides $18,456,802,000, for the title I–A grants
to local educational agencies [LEAs] program. Title I–A grants to
LEAs provide supplemental education funding, especially in high-
poverty areas, for LEAs to provide extra academic support to help
raise the achievement of eligible students or, in the case of school-
wide programs in which the vast majority of students participate
in title I–A programs, help all students in high-poverty schools
meet challenging State academic standards. Title I–A grants are
distributed through four ESEA formulas in amounts provided by
this act: basic, concentration, targeted, and the education finance
incentive grant [EFIG].
Of the funds available for title I–A grants to LEAs, up to
$5,000,000 shall be available on October 1, 2025, for transfer to the
Census Bureau for poverty updates; $8,229,490,000 will become
available on July 1, 2026; and $10,841,177,000 will become avail-
able on October 1, 2026. The funds that become available on July
1, 2026, and October 1, 2026, will remain available for obligation
through September 30, 2027.
School Support and Improvement.—The Committee appreciates
steps the Department has taken to improve compliance with ESEA
requirements for school support and improvement. These include
the targeted monitoring of ESEA provisions, additional rounds of
targeted monitoring on school improvement requirements, and
issuance of comprehensive guidance on school support and improve-
ment requirements. The Department must continue to increase its
efforts to ensure compliance of these requirements at all levels, in-
cluding through additional technical assistance, support, and moni-
toring. This should also include consideration of the least burden-
some ways to monitor, support, and ensure compliance of SEA,
LEA, and school support and improvement requirements.
(268)
269
The Committee also believes more transparency is needed
around findings and implementation of corrective actions from com-
prehensive and targeted monitoring of ESEA school support and
improvement requirements and the use of section 1003 school sup-
port and improvement funds. While the Department’s website has
information on its monitoring protocol and reports, it lacks trans-
parency on all of its monitoring activity, including on implementa-
tion of corrective actions that bring SEAs and LEAs into compli-
ance with the law’s requirements. The Committee directs the De-
partment to update its 2024 Report to Congress with implemented
actions and continue to provide public reporting of the Depart-
ment’s findings and actions it is requiring or recommending SEAs
to take in response to all monitoring and performance reviews of
State implementation of title I–A of the ESEA. This must include
findings from both comprehensive and targeted program moni-
toring, and the implementation of corrective actions and rec-
ommendations from such monitoring. Further, the Committee di-
rects the Department to publish the results of targeted monitoring
of State compliance with provisions under title I–A, including re-
port cards, for individual States on its website within 30 days of
providing such findings to SEAs. Finally, the Committee encour-
ages the Department to act to improve the reporting of section
1003 funds, particularly the evidence-based interventions required
to be implemented, the student populations supported, and the out-
comes achieved. The Committee requests a briefing not later than
60 days after enactment on the Department’s completed actions
and plans to continue making progress toward improved SEA,
LEA, and school implementation of related requirements and the
additional high-quality educational opportunities being made avail-
able to students for whom such opportunities are not currently
available.
State Reservation for Administration of Title I.—The Committee
bill includes new language that increases the amount of title I–A
funds States reserve for administration of parts A, C, and D of title
I of the ESEA. The new language provides each State with admin-
istrative resources of the greater of $500,000 or 1 percent of its al-
lotment under such parts of title I and each outlying area with a
reservation of $60,000. In addition, the new language requires the
1 percent reservation calculation to be updated to reflect the fiscal
year 2015 enacted appropriations for such programs.
Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grants
The Committee provides $194,000,000 for the Comprehensive
Literacy State Development Grants program. This program pro-
vides competitive grants to SEAs that then subgrant at least 95
percent of such funds to eligible entities to support efforts to im-
prove the literacy skills of children and students from birth
through 12th grade in high-need schools and early education pro-
grams in a State for each of several age bands through implemen-
tation of evidence-based practices and interventions.
Evidence-Based Instruction for Students with Language-Based
Learning Disabilities.—The Committee is aware ESEA requires the
Secretary to prioritize applications proposing evidence-based activi-
ties to develop or enhance comprehensive literacy instruction plans
270
that ensure high-quality instruction and effective strategies in
reading and writing for children from early childhood education
through grade 12. The Committee requests the Department to de-
scribe in the fiscal year 2027 CJ how grantees plan to use funds
for activities designed to strengthen and enhance teacher training
on the identification of language-based learning disabilities and
evidence-based methods of literacy instruction for students with
language-based learning disabilities.
Innovative Approaches to Literacy
The Committee provides $30,000,000 for the Innovative Ap-
proaches to Literacy program. This program provides competitive
grants to national not-for-profit organizations and school libraries
for providing books and childhood literacy activities to children and
families living in high-need communities.
The Committee continues to direct the Department to reserve no
less than 50 percent of funds under this program for grants to de-
velop and enhance effective school library programs, which may in-
clude providing professional development to school librarians,
books, and up-to-date materials to high-need schools. School library
programs increase access to a wide range of print and electronic re-
sources and provide learning opportunities for all students, particu-
larly those who are less likely to have access to such materials at
home. The Committee also encourages the Department to use a
portion of the funds under this program for grants to pediatric lit-
eracy programs that are provided during well-child visits by med-
ical providers trained in research-based methods of early language
and literacy.
In addition, the Committee directs the Department to ensure
that grants are distributed among eligible entities that will serve
geographically diverse areas, including communities that are rural,
Tribal, or where English is not the primary language. The Com-
mittee also encourages the Department to include a priority for ini-
tiatives that support biliteracy and multilingual approaches or pro-
vide professional development in multilingual education for exist-
ing school staff and teachers.
Migrant Education Program
The Committee provides $375,626,000 for the title I Migrant
Education program. This funding supports grants to SEAs to en-
sure that migratory children receive full and appropriate opportu-
nities to meet the same challenging State academic standards that
all children are expected to meet and help such children overcome
educational disruption and other factors that inhibit the ability of
such children to succeed in school. Funding also supports activities
to improve interstate and intrastate coordination of migrant edu-
cation programs, as well as identify and improve services to the mi-
grant student population.
Neglected and Delinquent
The Committee provides $49,239,000 for the Neglected and De-
linquent program. This program, authorized under subpart 1 of
title I–D of the ESEA, provides financial assistance to SEAs for
education services to neglected and delinquent children and youth
271
in State-run institutions and for juveniles in adult correctional in-
stitutions. States are authorized to set aside at least 15 percent,
but not more than 30 percent, of their Neglected and Delinquent
program funds to help students in State-operated institutions make
the transition into locally operated programs and to support the
successful reentry of youth offenders who are age 20 or younger
and have received a secondary school diploma or its recognized
equivalent. The Department is authorized to reserve up to 2.5 per-
cent of the appropriation for national activities, including technical
assistance. The Committee continues to urge the Department to in-
crease its direct and technical assistance support to further assist
grantees in their efforts to improve and report on program out-
comes.
Special Programs for Migrant Students
The Committee provides $52,123,000 for Special Programs for
Migrant Students, which consist of the High School Equivalency
Program [HEP] and the College Assistance Migrant Program
[CAMP]. HEP projects are 5-year grants to institutions of higher
education and other nonprofit organizations to recruit migrant stu-
dents ages 16 and older and provide the academic and support
services needed to help them obtain a high school equivalency cre-
dential and subsequently gain employment, attain admission to a
postsecondary institution or a job training program, or join the
military. CAMP projects are 5-year grants to institutions of higher
education and nonprofit organizations to provide tutoring, coun-
seling, and financial assistance to migrant students during their
first year of postsecondary education in order to support postsec-
ondary education program completion. The Committee urges the
Department to accelerate the program development timeline so no-
tices inviting applications can be issued early enough for the De-
partment to make new and non-competing continuation awards be-
fore July 1.
IMPACT AID
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,625,151,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,625,151,000
The Committee provides $1,625,151,000, for the Impact Aid pro-
gram. Impact Aid provides financial assistance to LEAs affected by
the presence of Federal activities and federally owned land. These
LEAs face unique challenges because they must educate children
living on federally owned land, such as military bases, while feder-
ally owned property is also exempt from local taxes, a primary
source of revenue for LEAs. LEAs also enroll students residing on
private property whose parents may be exempt from paying sales
and income taxes, reducing the revenue available to support these
LEAs.
Basic Support Payments
The Committee provides $1,474,000,000 for the Basic Support
Payments program. Under this statutory formula, payments are
made on behalf of all categories of federally-connected children to
compensate school districts for lost tax revenue.
272
Payments for Children With Disabilities
The Committee bill provides $48,316,000 for Payments for Chil-
dren With Disabilities. Under this program, additional payments
are made for certain federally connected children eligible for serv-
ices under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA].
Facilities Maintenance
The Committee provides $4,835,000 for Facilities Maintenance.
This activity provides funding for emergency repairs and com-
prehensive capital improvements to certain school facilities owned
by the Department and used by LEAs to serve federally connected
military dependent students. Funds appropriated for this purpose
are available until expended.
Construction
The Committee provides $19,000,000 for eligible LEAs for school
construction activities allocated through the authority for competi-
tive grants to LEAs under section 7007(b) of the ESEA. The bill
also allows the funds to be available for obligation through Sep-
tember 30, 2027.
Payments for Federal Property
The Committee provides $79,000,000 for Payments for Federal
Property. These payments compensate LEAs specifically for rev-
enue lost due to the removal of Federal property from local tax
rolls, regardless of whether any federally connected children attend
schools in the LEA.
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $5,776,178,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,781,178,000
The Committee provides $5,781,178,000 for the School Improve-
ment Programs account.
Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants
The Committee provides $2,190,080,000 for Supporting Effective
Instruction State Grants. States and LEAs may use funds for a
range of activities related to the certification, recruitment, profes-
sional development, and support of teachers and administrators.
Activities may include reforming teacher certification and licensure
requirements, addressing alternative routes to State certification of
teachers, recruiting teachers and principals, improving equitable
access to effective teachers, and implementing teacher mentoring
systems, evaluation and support systems, merit pay, and merit-
based performance systems. These funds may also be used by LEAs
to hire teachers to reduce class sizes.
The appropriation for this program primarily supports activities
associated with the 2026–2027 academic year. Of the funds pro-
vided, $508,639,000 will become available on July 1, 2026, and
$1,681,441,000 will become available on October 1, 2026. These
funds will remain available for obligation through September 30,

Section 71:
2027.
273
Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers
The Committee provides an appropriation of $1,329,673,000 for
the Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers pro-
gram. Funds are allocated to States by formula, which in turn,
award at least 95 percent of their allocations to LEAs, community-
based organizations, and other public and private entities. Grant-
ees use these resources to establish or expand community learning
centers that provide activities offering significant extended learn-
ing opportunities, such as before and after-school programs, rec-
reational activities, drug and violence prevention, and family lit-
eracy programs for students and related services to their families.
Centers must target their services to students who attend schools
that are eligible to operate a school-wide program under title I of
the ESEA or serve high percentages of students from low-income
families.
The Committee is aware of concerns with the lack of efficiency
and the delivery process within the 21st Century Community
Learning Center program, and urges the Department to examine
the distribution of funds through State departments of education to
ensure that their competitive grant and reporting process is
streamlined, adheres to congressional intent, is void of additional
regulations, and does not disadvantage rural schools, including but
not limited to, creating barriers to partnership with non-profit or-
ganizations. Furthermore, the Department is directed to report to
the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act on its
progress and findings and any additional measures taken to ad-
dress the program’s overall standards.
State Assessments Grants
The Committee provides $380,000,000 for the State Assessments
Grants program. This program provides formula grants to States
for the development and implementation of standards and assess-
ments required by the ESEA, including improving such assess-
ments through the adoption of through-course assessments and
other innovative assessments that meet ESEA’s requirements. This
program may assist States and LEAs in carrying out audits of their
assessment systems to eliminate low-quality or duplicative assess-
ments. It also provides competitive grants to States, including con-
sortia of States, to improve the quality, validity, and reliability of
academic assessments. These competitive grants may also be used
to support State planning leading to an Innovative Assessment
Demonstration Authority [IADA] application. The appropriation in-
cludes more than the statutorily required amount for formula
grants that would be available for competitive grants for state as-
sessments [CGSA].
Report on Improvements in Assessments.—The Committee recog-
nizes that assessments serve different purposes, ranging from
formative purposes to inform classroom instruction to summative
purposes to inform school accountability and improvement. CGSA
was authorized to support grantees seeking to improve both forma-
tive and summative assessments, depending on needs within their
States. The Committee directs the Department, through IES, to re-
port on innovative work it has or is supporting on assessments, in-
cluding through awards made through fiscal year 2025 under the
274
CGSA program. The report shall include an analysis of the assess-
ment work undertaken by recent CGSA grantees, any best prac-
tices that have emerged from CGSA grantees and how the Depart-
ment has shared and will continue to share those and other best
practices with other States in order to help all States improve their
assessments, how CGSA grantees have used funds to support IADA
work, how CGSA grantees have improved assessments for English
learners and students with disabilities, how CGSA grantees are
supporting through-course assessments to provide more real time
data to educators and parents, and how CGSA grantees are devel-
oping more culturally aware and responsive assessments. Such re-
port shall also describe how the Department is supporting, moni-
toring, and evaluating the CGSA program and its grantees and in-
clude recommendations for how ongoing innovative assessment
work can better support learning in classrooms, while maintaining
the importance of annual, statewide, summative assessment data
that produces disaggregated results for students and their families.
The Committee requests an initial update on this work not later
than 180 days after enactment of this act.
Education for Homeless Children and Youth
The Committee recommends $129,000,000 for carrying out edu-
cation activities authorized by title VII, subtitle B of the McKinney-
Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This program provides assistance
to each State to support an office of the coordinator of education
for homeless children and youth to develop and implement State
plans for educating children and youth experiencing homelessness,
and to make subgrants to LEAs to support the education of those
children and youth. Grants are made to States based on the total
that each State receives in title I–A grants to LEAs. States must
subgrant not less than 75 percent of funds received to LEAs and
may reserve remaining funds for State level activities. Under the
McKinney-Vento Homeless Children and Youth Program, SEAs
must ensure that children and youth experiencing homelessness
have equal access to the same free public education, including a
public preschool education, as is provided to other children and
youth.
The Committee bill continues to include language providing an
additional 12 months for educational agencies and institutions to
obligate and expend EHCY funds.
The Committee directs the Department to issue guidance clari-
fying that funds provided under title VII, subtitle B of the McKin-
ney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act may be used for the provision
of extraordinary or emergency assistance needed to enable home-
less children and youths to attend school and participate fully in
school activities as allowed under law. This shall include paying for
short-term, temporary emergency housing (such as a hotel or motel
room) on a case-by-case basis if reasonable and necessary to facili-
tate school attendance, and as a last resort when other funding
sources are not readily available.
Training and Advisory Services
For Training and Advisory Services authorized by title IV of the
Civil Rights Act (Public Law 88–352), the Committee provides
275
$6,575,000. The funds provided will support awards to operate re-
gional equity assistance centers [EACs]. EACs provide services to
LEAs, SEAs, and other customers upon request. Activities include
disseminating information on successful practices and legal re-
quirements related to nondiscrimination in educational programs
on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin and evidence-
based activities to improve access to high-quality educational set-
tings for all students, particularly students facing the greatest bar-
riers.
Native Hawaiian Education
The Committee provides $45,897,000 for the Education for Na-
tive Hawaiian program. In addition, the Committee bill continues
a provision that clarifies the use of funds for administrative costs.
The Committee bill provides $650,000 for the Native Hawaiian
Education Council, which is an increase of $150,000 for the Council
to fulfill the statutory requirement for data collection.
The Committee bill continues the set-aside of funds made avail-
able for the Education for Native Hawaiians program for grants for
construction, renovation, and modernization of any public elemen-
tary school, secondary school, or structure related to a public ele-
mentary school or secondary school, that serves a predominantly
Native Hawaiian student body. The Committee intends should
funds be available for new awards that they shall be made competi-
tively available to organizations in need of assistance with infra-
structure improvement for increased capacity to serve a predomi-
nantly Native Hawaiian student body.
Alaska Native Education
The Committee provides $44,953,000 for the Alaska Native Edu-
cation. These funds help address the unique educational needs of
Alaska Native schoolchildren. Funds are used for the development
of supplemental educational programs to benefit Alaska Natives.
Outreach and Program Responsiveness.—The Committee directs
the Department to make every effort to ensure that grants are
awarded well in advance of the school year, to maximize grantees’
ability to hire the necessary staff and have their programs ready
to go with the start of Alaska’s school year in mid-August. The
Committee continues to direct the Department to ensure that Alas-
ka Native Tribes, Alaska Native regional non-profits, and Alaska
Native corporations, particularly those that have received no or few
grants under this program, have the maximum opportunity to suc-
cessfully compete for grants under this program by providing these
entities multiple opportunities for technical assistance in devel-
oping successful applications for these funds, both in Alaska and
via various forms of telecommunications. The Committee also
strongly encourages the Department to include as many peer re-
viewers as possible who are Alaska Natives or who have experience
with Alaska Native education and Alaska generally on each peer
review panel.
Use of Funds.—The Committee continues bill language that al-
lows funding provided by this program to be used for construction
and overrides the authorizing statute’s requirement to make non-
competitive awards to certain organizations.
276
Rural Education
The Committee provides $225,000,000 for rural education pro-
grams. The Committee directs rural education funding to be equal-
ly divided between the Small, Rural School Achievement Program,
which provides funds to LEAs that serve a small number of stu-
dents, and the Rural and Low-Income School Program, which pro-
vides funds to LEAs that serve concentrations of poor students, re-
gardless of the number of students served.
The Rural Education Achievement Program [REAP] is the only
dedicated Federal funding stream for supporting rural schools. In
2020, the Department announced that some LEAs were using alter-
native poverty data to demonstrate eligibility for the Rural and
Low-Income School Program in place of the U.S. Census Bureau’s
Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as required by section
5221(b)(1)(A)(i) of the ESEA. The Department had routinely accept-
ed these data since the program was created in 2002. In fiscal
years 2021, 2022, and 2023, those LEAs that would have been
eliminated abruptly from eligibility were held harmless at a declin-
ing rate that would have continued to fall through fiscal year 2027.
In fiscal year 2024, bill language was included to hold the affected
LEAs harmless at the fiscal year 2023 level. The Committee has
also increased funding for REAP in the fiscal year 2021 through
2024 bills and includes an increase of $5,000,000 for this fiscal
year. The Committee understands that changes to eligibility for
funding received under this program create very significant chal-
lenges for several LEAs and States, at no fault of their own, and
therefore continues to include bill language that will hold the af-
fected LEAs harmless at the fiscal year 2023 level during this fiscal
year.
Comprehensive Centers
The Committee provides $50,000,000 for the Comprehensive Cen-
ters program. These funds provide support to a network of com-
prehensive centers that are operated by research organizations,
agencies, institutions of higher education, or partnerships thereof.
Centers provide training and technical assistance identified in an-
nual State service plans to build the capacity of SEAs and the Bu-
reau of Indian Education [BIE], and through them LEAs, and
schools, to provide a high quality education to all students.

Section 72:
Section 202 of the Educational Technical Assistance Act of 2002
requires centers to report on their activities and the SEAs and
LEAs assisted during the preceding year. The Committee requests
the Secretary post these reports not later than 180 days after en-
actment of this act.
The Committee is supportive of the work of the centers in sup-
porting SEAs, LEAs, Tribal Education Agencies, and schools in se-
lecting, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based programs,
policies, practices, and interventions to improve academic achieve-
ment and addressing corrective actions or results from audit find-
ings and ESEA program monitoring. Further, centers play an im-
portant role in supporting State and local efforts to close oppor-
tunity gaps and improve educational outcomes, particularly for stu-
dents attending schools implementing comprehensive support and
improvement or targeted or additional targeted support and im-
277
provement activities. The Committee directs the Department to
brief the Committee not later than 60 days after enactment on how
center annual service plans and center services are addressing
school support and improvement activities of SEAs and LEAs.
Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants
The Committee provides $1,380,000,000 for Student Support and
Academic Enrichment [SSAE] Grants. This program provides for-
mula grants to States based on each State’s share of title I–A
grants, which then sub-grant to LEAs, to help improve academic
achievement by supporting activities that provide students with a
well-rounded education, ensure safe and supportive learning envi-
ronments, and use technology to improve instruction.
Technical Assistance and Capacity Building.—The Committee
notes the limited information provided in the fiscal year 2026 CJ
on expenditures for the 2 percent set-aside for technical assistance
and capacity building from prior year appropriations. The reserva-
tion for technical assistance and capacity building shall be used to
support SEAs and LEAs in carrying out authorized activities under
this program identified by SEAs and LEAs. In future CJs, the De-
partment shall continue to provide current and planned expendi-
tures for this reservation and include a plan for how resources will
be spent to provide technical assistance and to build the capacity
of SEAs and LEAs.
Report on Use of Funds.—The Committee directs the Department
to obtain and examine data on State and local expenditures, out-
lined by specific authorized activities, and provide information
about how LEAs plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their activi-
ties. The Committee directs the Department, within 180 days after
the enactment of this act, to provide a briefing to the Committee
on implementation of this directive.
INDIAN EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $194,746,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 194,746,000
The Committee provides $194,746,000 for Indian Education pro-
grams.
Grants to Local Educational Agencies
For grants to LEAs, the Committee provides $110,381,000. These
funds provide financial support to elementary and secondary school
programs that serve Indian students, including preschool children.
Funds are awarded on a formula basis to LEAs, schools supported
and operated by the Department of the Interior/Bureau of Indian
Education, and in some cases directly to Indian Tribes.
Special Programs for Indian Children
The Committee provides $72,000,000 for Special Programs for In-
dian Children. Funds are used for demonstration grants to improve
Indian student achievement from early childhood education
through college preparation programs, and for professional develop-
ment grants for training Indians who are preparing to begin ca-
reers in teaching and school administration.
278
The Department is directed to use no less than $5,000,000 of
funds available to continue the teacher retention-initiative in-
tended to help address the shortage of Indian, Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian educators and to expand their impact on students’
education. The initiative must support teacher leadership models
as a method to increase the retention of effective, experienced In-
dian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian teachers. Outcomes and
models of culturally-responsive teacher leaders participating in this
program must have their growth and effectiveness measured and
these findings shall support the development of evidence-, research-
and culturally responsive teacher leadership models. The Depart-
ment is directed to publish such findings within a year of enact-
ment of this act.
National Activities
The Committee provides $12,365,000 for National Activities.
Funds are used to expand efforts to improve research, evaluation,
and data collection on the status and effectiveness of Indian edu-
cation programs, and to continue grants to Tribal educational de-
partments for education administration and planning. The bill in-
cludes language allowing more than 20 percent of these funds to
be used for grants for Native American Language Immersion. The
Committee bill also continues language from the current appropria-
tions act, which allows the Secretary to make such awards for a pe-
riod not to exceed 5 years.
Native American Language Immersion Programs.—The Com-
mittee provides not less than $4,500,000 for Native American Lan-
guage Immersion programs. This amount will support new and
continuation awards in fiscal year 2026. Funds for the Native
American Language Immersion program shall continue to be allo-
cated to all types of eligible entities, including both new and exist-
ing language immersion programs and schools, to support the
greatest possible geographical distribution and language diversity.
Further, the Department shall continue to give the same consider-
ation to applicants that propose to provide partial immersion
schools and programs as to full immersion, as the local Tribes,
schools, and other applicants know best what type of program will
most effectively assist their youth to succeed.
Native American Language Resource Centers.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of the Native American Languages Re-
source Centers, and that such centers are integral to supporting
the revitalization of such Native American languages, including by
encouraging and supporting the use of Native American languages
as a medium of instruction. In addition, the Committee recognizes
the need to encourage and support early childhood education pro-
grams, elementary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of
higher education to include Native American languages in the cur-
riculum as the primary mode of instruction, and in the same man-
ner as other world languages, including through cooperative agree-
ments and distance education, and to grant proficiency in Native
American languages the same full academic credit as proficiency in
other world languages. The Committee recommendation includes
$2,390,000 to continue to carry out the policy set forth in Public
279
Law 117–335 and direction provided in prior fiscal years to estab-
lish Native American Language Resource Centers.
INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,115,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,183,647,000
The Committee provides $1,183,647,000 for programs within the
Innovation and Improvement account.
Education Innovation and Research
The Committee provides $235,000,000 for the Education Innova-
tion and Research [EIR] program. This program supports the cre-
ation, development, implementation, replication, and scaling up of
evidence-based, field-initiated State and local innovations designed
to improve student achievement and attainment for high-need stu-
dents. EIR incorporates a tiered evidence framework that provides
early-phase, mid-phase, and expansion and replication grants. This
supports interventions throughout the pipeline, from smaller
grants for early stage projects that are willing to undergo rigorous
evaluation to test their efficacy to larger grants to scale-up proven-
effective interventions that have demonstrated significant impacts
through at least one rigorous evaluation.
Briefing Requirement.—The Committee directs the Department
brief the Committees on the fiscal year 2026 funding opportunities
available under this program, including any proposed priorities, not
less than 14 days prior to publication in the Federal Register.
Grant Priorities.—The Committee notes there is significant de-
mand from the field to test many types of strategies and to exam-
ine promising techniques that can be scaled-up in different set-
tings. For example, the EIR program can be a highly effective tool
for developing innovative solutions to critical problems, such as
worsening teacher shortages, widening achievement gaps, and dis-
parate access to advanced courses for promising students. The pro-
gram could also support scalable STEM initiatives that serve rural
and economically transitioning communities, including those pro-
grams that integrate agricultural technology, data science, and
project-based learning to strengthen workforce readiness and
teacher capacity. The Committee also supports EIR funds being
used for grants for evidence-based projects that foster knowledge
and promote the development of foundational skills that support
schools and parents to prepare students to be informed, thoughtful
and productive individuals ready to succeed in school and life. The
Committee directs funds to continue to support diverse and field-
initiated interventions such as the ones noted above, rather than
a single nationwide program or award focused solely on one area
of educational innovation.
School Support and Improvement.—The Committee recognizes
that funds under section 1003(a) of the ESEA are meant to support
schools that are currently identified for support, consistent with
the statutory requirements for identifying schools for CSI, ATSI,
and TSI, but continuing to build the evidence base for school im-
provement efforts in schools that have exited status and are no
longer identified is also important. The Committee encourages the
280
Department to prioritize grants to LEAs meeting EIR requirements
that would support capacity-building and school improvement ac-
tivities for schools that have exited improvement status.
Rural Set-Aside.—The Committee supports the required 25 per-
cent set-aside within EIR for rural areas and encourages the De-
partment to take steps necessary to ensure the set-aside is met and
that EIR funds are awarded to diverse geographic areas. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to invest in rural, high-need
communities by ensuring grants are awarded to a diverse set of in-
stitutions, affecting varied geographic locations, including areas
with substantial minority students, which have submitted high
quality applications meeting EIR program requirements.
Charter School Program
The Committee provides $440,000,000 for the Charter School
Program [CSP]. This program supports the start-up, replication,
and expansion of high-quality public charter schools prepared to ef-
fectively serve all students. The Committee also include a new gen-
eral provision allowing the Department to transfer up to
$60,000,000 from the nonrecurring expenses fund to the CSP for
additional CSP activities as allowed under this act.
Program Activities.—The Committee continues bill language pro-
viding increased flexibility within the program to effectively re-
spond to the changing needs of the sector and increase the likeli-
hood that Federal funds will be invested in high-quality charter
schools prepared to serve all students effectively. Both the author-
izing statute and prior year appropriations bills dictated the use of
the appropriation in ways that prevented the Department from al-
locating funds based on the number of high quality applications in
grant competitions and emerging needs of the field. To facilitate
this, the Committee directs the Department to run competitions for
charter school programs on similar cycles. The language will con-
tinue to allow the Department to allocate not more than
$140,000,000 for replication and expansion of high-quality charter
schools through the Charter Management Organization [CMO] pro-
gram established in ESEA.
The bill also allocates not less than $60,000,000 for Facilities
Grants under section 4304, including the Credit Enhancement pro-
gram. The Committee is supportive of construction and renovation
of charter school facilities, including storm shelters, safe rooms,
and other infrastructure improvements such as fortified roof and
wall construction to improve windstorm, tornado, and hurricane re-
silience. The bill also provides not more than $16,000,000 for na-
tional activities to provide technical assistance, disseminate best
practices, and evaluate the impact of the charter school program.
Finally, funds are available for use under 4305(a)(2) for Developer
grants and under section 4303 for State Entity grants. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to provide a briefing on its planned
use of flexibility provided not later than 14 days prior to the an-
nouncement of any notice of proposed priorities, notice inviting ap-
plications for CSP activities, and announcement of grant awards.
No-Cost Extensions.—The Committee is aware that recipients of
grants under the CSP are sometimes unable to complete their
projects within the original project period, often for reasons beyond
281
their control (such as lower than anticipated subrecipient applica-
tions received, trouble obtaining charter school authorization, and
delays in Department approval of charter school authorizers, uses
of funds, or the allocation of subgrant funds). The Committee
strongly urges the Department to act favorably on requests for
longer extensions in these situations, including for States receiving
a new award in fiscal year 2025, particularly when an extension
would enable the completion of subgrants made late in the grant
period or when it is clear that the delays in carrying out project
activities were largely unavoidable by the grantees and, thus, that
requests likely meet the requirements of section 75.261 of the
EDGAR regulations. The Committee directs the Department to
brief the Committee on the Department’s response to this concern
within 90 days of publication of this report and to provide an up-
date in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the Department’s implementa-
tion of any changes in practice related to this issue.
Pre-application Support.—The Committee is aware that there is
currently no source of consistent public funding to support the ap-
plication phase of developing a new public charter school. Yet re-
search shows that this kind of pre-application support results in
stronger charter school applications, higher authorization rates,
and more effective school openings. The Committee urges the De-
partment to support activities such as pre-application webinars and
best practice resources to enable potential applicants to develop
proposals meeting all ESEA requirements, including in creating
new public charter schools prepared to expand opportunities for
children with disabilities, English learners, and other traditionally
underserved students to attend charter schools and meet chal-
lenging State academic standards.
State Entity Subgrantees.—Under the CSP, State Entities receive
competitive grants that are subsequently distributed as subgrants
to support the opening of new charter schools, the replication of
high-quality charter schools, and the expansion of high-quality
charter schools. As required by ESEA, when eligible State Entities
apply for these grants, they include in their applications the pro-
jected number of subgrants that they expect to make in each of
those three categories. After completing their subgrant competi-
tions, however, State Entities will typically find that they must de-
viate from their initial projections in order to support the highest-
quality applicants, regardless of category. The Committee notes
State Entities received awards based on the quality of their appli-
cations, including projections of schools to be opened. However, if
the State Entity attempts to but is unable to implement the ap-
proved plan, the timely approval of amendments to subgrant pro-
jections could facilitate the most effective use of these resources in
creating high-quality public educational options for students. The
Committee directs the Secretary to allow State Entities to diverge
from their original projections after conducting competitions that
do not meet subgrant projections in their approved application, in
order to fund the highest-quality subgrant applicants that meet all
Federal requirements. The Committee further directs the Depart-
ment to report on the implementation of this directive in next
year’s CJ.
282
Technical Assistance.—The Department is directed to continue to
support and evaluate flexibility in the availability and effective use
of CSP State Entity technical assistance resources; evaluate how
such funds are used to ensure subgrantees are equipped to meet
the needs of all students, and specifically students with disabilities
and English learners as required by law; and, brief the Committees
not later than 90 days after enactment of this act on its actions
and continued plans to effectively oversee the CSP program.
Uses of Funds.—The Committee notes that grant recipients
under the Charter Schools Grants to State Entities program often
encounter delays in their implementation of their grants because of
uncertainty over whether certain uses of funds are allowable under
the ESEA and while the Department goes through the process of
reviewing individual costs for compliance monitoring. For example,
while section 4303(h) allows funding of ‘‘appropriate, non-sustained
costs when such costs cannot be met from other sources’’, it is often
unclear whether specific costs should be considered sustained or
non-sustained, with the confusion sometimes emanating from un-
clear language in the State statutes that provide funding for char-
ter schools. In other situations, a funding category such as ‘‘educa-
tor compensation’’ could encompass activities that are either sus-
tained or non-sustained, depending on the manner in which those
activities are carried out.
The Committee therefore strongly urges the Department to re-
solve these spending issues in a timely manner and in a manner
that provides grantees with maximum flexibility consistent with
the statute. The Department shall allow State Entities to support
all activities listed under section 4303(h), including transportation,
renovation, and staff expenses, so long as they contribute to the ob-
jective of developing, implementing, expanding, and replicating
high-quality charter schools. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to brief the Committee on the Department’s response to this
concern within 90 days of publication of this report and to provide
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the Department’s imple-
mentation of any changes in practice related to this issue.
Magnet Schools Assistance
The Committee provides $139,000,000 for the Magnet Schools
Assistance program. This program supports grants to LEAs to es-
tablish and operate magnet schools that are part of a court-ordered
or federally approved voluntary desegregation plan. Magnet schools
are designed to attract substantial numbers of students from dif-
ferent social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. Grantees
may use funds for planning and promotional materials; salaries of
instructional staff; transportation, as long as such expenses are
sustainable beyond the grant period and not a significant portion
of the grant; and the purchase of technology, educational materials,
and equipment.
Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants
The Committee provides $60,000,000 for Teacher and School
Leader Incentive Grants. This program provides competitive grants
to eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or expand
human capital management systems or performance-based com-
283
pensation systems in schools. Funds can be used for a wide-range
of activities, including developing or improving evaluation and sup-
port systems that are based in part on student achievement; pro-
viding principals with necessary tools to make school-level deci-
sions; implementing a differentiated salary structure based on a
variety of factors; improving the recruitment and retention of effec-
tive teachers, principals, and other school leaders; and instituting
career advancement opportunities that reward effective teachers,
principals and other school leaders.
Ready-To-Learn Television
The Committee provides $28,500,000 for the Ready-to-Learn Tel-
evision program. This program is designed to facilitate student aca-
demic achievement by leveraging the power and reach of public tel-
evision to develop and distribute educational video programming,
and digital content, for preschool and elementary school children
and their parents, caregivers, and teachers.
Arts in Education
The Committee provides $31,500,000 for the Arts in Education
program. The funding is used for a program of competitive awards
for assistance for arts education, including professional develop-
ment for arts educators, teachers and principals; developing and
disseminating accessible instructional materials and arts-based
educational programming; and for national and community out-
reach activities that strengthen relationships among LEAs, schools,
communities and arts organizations. Funds also are used for eval-
uation and dissemination activities.
National Program.—The Committee recommendation includes no
less than $8,000,000 for a national program grant competition. The
Committee includes bill language intended to ensure the Depart-
ment does not administer the Arts in Education program activities
in a consolidated grant competition as it did in fiscal year 2021.
The language further requires the Department to use not less than
$8,000,000 for an Arts in Education National Program competition
following priorities and program requirements of the fiscal year
2022 competition.
Javits Gifted and Talented Students
The Committee provides $16,500,000 for the Javits Gifted and
Talented Students Education program. Funds are used for awards
to State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher edu-
cation, and other public and private agencies for research, dem-
onstration, and technical assistance activities designed to enhance
the capability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the spe-
cial educational needs of gifted and talented students. Under
ESEA, the Department gives priority to making awards for projects
that include evidence-based activities or that develop new informa-
tion to improve the capacity of schools to operate gifted and tal-
ented education programs or to assist schools in identifying and
serving traditionally underserved students
284
Supporting Effective Educator Development
The Committee provides $90,000,000 for the Supporting Effective
Educator Development [SEED] program. SEED provides competi-
tive grants to improve teacher and principal effectiveness by sup-
porting pathways that help teachers, principals, or other school
leaders with non-traditional preparation and certification obtain
employment in underserved LEAs; providing evidence-based profes-
sional development; and making services and learning opportuni-
ties freely available to LEAs.
Effective School Leaders.—The Committee recognizes the signifi-
cant impact of effective school principals and other school leaders
on student achievement and other student outcomes, and believes
the SEED program provides important support for helping ensure
that more highly trained school leaders are available for service in
schools that have concentrations of students from low-income fami-
lies. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary to continue to
use a portion of funds made available for SEED for new awards
supporting the preparation of principals and other school leaders.
American History and Civics Education
The Committee provides $23,000,000 for American History and
Civics Education, including $3,000,000 for Presidential and Con-
gressional Academies for American History and Civics and
$20,000,000 for American History and Civics Education National
Activities.
Presidential Academies for the Teaching of American History and
Civics offer residential workshops to elementary and secondary
school teachers to strengthen their knowledge through instruction
and interaction with primary scholars and accomplished teachers
in these fields. The Congressional Academies for Students of Amer-
ican History and Civics provide similar workshops to students to
enrich their understanding of American history and civics.
Statewide Family Engagement Centers
The Committee provides $20,000,000 for Statewide Family En-
gagement Centers. This program provides competitive grants to
statewide organizations to promote and implement evidence-based
family engagement activities in education programs, and provide
training and technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, schools, and other
organizations for carrying out such activities.
Congressionally Directed Spending
The Committee provides $100,147,000 for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table at the end of this Committee Re-
port.
SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $457,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 416,000,000
The Committee provides a total of $416,000,000 for activities to
promote safe schools, healthy students, and citizenship education.
285
Promise Neighborhoods
The Committee provides $91,000,000 for the Promise Neighbor-
hoods program. This program awards competitive grants to not-for-
profit, community-based organizations for the development of com-
prehensive neighborhood programs designed to combat the effects
of poverty and improve educational and life outcomes for children
and youth, from birth through college. Each Promise Neighborhood
grantee serves a high-poverty urban neighborhood or rural commu-
nity. Grants are for up to 5 years, with the final 2 years of funding
contingent on grantee performance against program- and project-
level performance objectives. Further, grants may be extended an
additional 2 years beyond the 5-year project period contingent on
grantee performance. The bill continues to provide extended avail-
ability of these funds, to allow the Department more flexibility for
the timing of new awards and maximize the time for grantee plan-
ning activities.
Promise Neighborhoods Extensions.—The Committee directs the
Department to use any available fiscal year 2026 funds, not being
used for continuation awards, only for 2-year extension grants to
high quality Promise Neighborhood grantees that have dem-
onstrated improvements in program performance indicators or for
new 5-year implementation awards. If the Departments runs a
grant competition for new 5-year awards, it is directed to allow pre-
viously awarded grantees with programs that may have recently
expired to compete for additional funding for the same neighbor-
hood, provided they have at least 5 years of successfully submitting
GPRA data, demonstrated improvements in Promise Neighbor-
hoods indicators, and justify the need for additional funding for
their continued implementation of high quality plans and evidence-
based activities.
School Safety National Activities
The Committee provides $190,000,000 for School Safety National
Activities, including up to $5,000,000 as necessary for Project
SERV, which provides assistance to schools and institutions of
higher education to respond and recover in the aftermath of violent
or traumatic events disrupting the learning environment. School
Safety National Activities funding also supports several grant and
technical assistance activities intended to improve the safety,
health, and well-being of all students. The Committee requests a
briefing not later than 14 days prior to the issuance of any notice
inviting applications or notice of proposed priorities.
Mental Health Service Professional Development Grant Program
and School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program.—With
the goal of addressing the shortage of school-based mental health
professionals in our Nation’s elementary and secondary schools by
expanding the pipeline of these professionals and improving dis-
tricts’ ability to recruit and retain these professionals, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to allocate all funds not required for
continuation awards or Project SERV awards to be equally split be-
tween the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration
Grant Program and the School-Based Mental Health Services
Grant to increase the number of well-trained school counselors,
school social workers, and school psychologists, or other mental
286
health professionals qualified to provide school-based mental health
services. The Committee recognizes the significant impact of sub-
stance use disorders and adverse childhood experiences on the
mental health and academic success of students. Therefore, the
Committee encourages the Department to continue to prioritize
grants to eligible entities with demonstrated need, which should in-
clude States with a high prevalence of adverse childhood experi-
ences and youth with substance use disorders.
Full Service Community Schools
The Committee provides $135,000,000 for Full-Service Commu-
nity Schools. This program provides support for the planning, im-
plementation, and operation of full-service community schools that
improve the integration, accessibility, and effectiveness of services
for children and families, particularly for children attending high-
poverty schools, including high-poverty rural schools.
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $890,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 890,000,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $890,000,000 for the
English Language Acquisition [ELA] program.
The Department makes formula grants to States based on each
State’s share of the Nation’s limited-English-proficient and recent
immigrant student population. The program is designed to increase
the capacity of States and school districts to address the needs of
these students. The authorizing statute requires that 6.5 percent of
the appropriation be used to support national activities, which in-
clude professional development activities designed to increase the
number of highly qualified teachers serving limited-English-pro-
ficient students; and a National Clearinghouse for English Lan-
guage Acquisition and Language Instructional Programs. National
activities funds are available for 2 years.
Briefing.—The Committee recognizes that every State has
English language learners who rely on targeted instruction and
dedicated programmatic support to access the curriculum and meet
academic standards. The Committee notes the role that the former
Office of English Language Acquisition played in managing the Na-
tive American and Alaska Native Children in Schools grants, Na-
tional Professional Development grants, and the National Clearing-
house for English Language Acquisition program as well as pro-
viding technical assistance to States and enforcing title III require-
ments of the ESEA. The Committee intends for these activities to
continue as the Department carries out its statutory responsibil-
ities under ESEA with respect to English learner students and re-
quests a briefing not later than 90 days after enactment on the De-
partment’s implemented actions and plans to improve outcomes for
English learners, which shall also include information on staffing
levels and fulfillment of statutory requirements.
SPECIAL EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,467,264,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,517,264,000
287
The Committee provides an appropriation of $15,517,264,000 for
special education programs. The Committee notes the important
role that the Office of Special Education Programs [OSEP] plays in
ensuring States’ compliance with IDEA and requests an update in
the fiscal year 2027 congressional justification on OSEP’s IDEA
monitoring and technical assistance support efforts maintained by
funding provided in this act.
Grants to States
The Committee provides $14,263,704,000 for IDEA part B Grants
to States. This program provides formula grants to assist States,
outlying areas, and other entities in meeting the costs of providing
special education and related services for children with disabilities.
States pass along most of these funds to LEAs, but may reserve
some for program monitoring, enforcement, technical assistance,
and other activities. The appropriation for this program primarily
supports activities associated with the 2026–2027 academic year.
Of the funds available for this program, $4,980,321,000 will become
available on July 1, 2026, and $9,283,383,000 will become available
on October 1, 2026. These funds will remain available for obligation
through September 30, 2027.
Preschool Grants
The Committee provides $420,000,000 for Preschool Grants. This
program provides formula grants to States to assist them in mak-
ing available special education and related services for children
with disabilities aged 3 through 5. States distribute the bulk of the
funds to LEAs. States must serve all eligible children with disabil-
ities aged 3 through 5 and have an approved application under the
IDEA.
Grants for Infants and Families
The Committee provides $540,000,000 for the Grants for Infants
and Families program under part C of the IDEA. Part C of IDEA
authorizes formula grants to States, outlying areas, and other enti-
ties to implement State-wide systems for providing early interven-
tion services to all children with disabilities, ages 2 and younger,
and their families. IDEA also gives States the option of extending
eligibility for part C services to children 3 and older if they were
previously served under part C and will continue to be served until
entrance to kindergarten.
State Personnel Development
The Committee provides $38,630,000 for the State Personnel De-
velopment program. Ninety percent of funds must be used for pro-
fessional development activities. The program supports grants to
SEAs to help them reform and improve their personnel preparation
and professional development related to early intervention, edu-
cational, and transition services that improve outcomes for stu-
dents with disabilities.
Technical Assistance and Dissemination
The Committee provides $39,345,000 for Technical Assistance
and Dissemination. This program supports awards for technical as-
288
sistance, model demonstration projects, the dissemination of useful
information, and other activities. Funding supports activities that
are designed to improve the services provided under the IDEA.
National Transition Technical Assistance Center for Students and
Youth with Disabilities.—The Committee notes the National Tran-
sition Technical Assistance Center for Students and Youth with
Disabilities has supported state special education and vocational
rehabilitation personnel in improving practices that promote better
outcomes, specifically leading to competitive integrated employ-
ment for students and youth with disabilities, by providing infor-
mation, tools, and assistance in the use of evidence-based practices.
The Committee notes the IDEA requires the Secretary to make
competitive grants to, or enter contracts or cooperative agreements
with eligible entities to disseminate information about innovative,
effective, and efficient curricula designs, instructional approaches,
and strategies, and identify positive academic and social learning
opportunities, that provide effective transitions between edu-
cational settings or from school to post-school settings, and the Re-
habilitation Act of 1973 allows the Secretary to provide grants to,
or enter into contracts with, eligible entities to improve transition
from education, including postsecondary education to employment,
particularly in competitive integrated employment, for youth who
are individuals with significant disabilities. The Committee re-
quests the Department provide an update on the required work,
outcomes, and multi-year goals and objectives of the center in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Personnel Preparation
The Committee provides $115,000,000 for the Personnel Prepara-
tion program. Funds support competitive awards to help address
State-identified needs for personnel who are qualified to work with
children with disabilities, including special education teachers and
related services personnel. The program is required to fund several
other broad areas, including training leadership personnel and per-
sonnel who work with children with low-incidence disabilities, and
providing enhanced support for beginning special educators.
Parent Information Centers
The Committee provides $33,152,000 for Parent Information
Centers. This program makes awards to parent organizations to
support parent training and information centers, including commu-
nity parent resource centers. These centers provide training and in-
formation to meet the needs of parents of children with disabilities
living in the areas served by the centers, particularly underserved
parents, and parents of children who may be inappropriately iden-
tified.
Technology and Media Services
The Committee provides $31,433,000 for Technology and Media
Services. This program makes competitive awards to support the
development, demonstration, and use of technology and educational
media activities of value to children with disabilities.
289
Special Olympics Education Programs
The Committee provides $36,000,000 to support activities author-
ized by the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act. This
funding supports efforts to expand Special Olympics programs and
the design and implementation of Special Olympics education pro-
grams that can be integrated into classroom instruction and are
consistent with academic content standards.
REHABILITATION SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,533,156,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,647,295,000
Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants
The Committee provides $4,504,096,000 in mandatory funding
for Vocational Rehabilitation [VR] State Grants. State Grants as-
sist States in providing a range of services to help persons with
physical and mental disabilities prepare for and engage in mean-
ingful employment. The Committee provides an increase in VR
State Grants according to the CPI–U, consistent with the author-
izing statute.
Disability Innovation Fund [DIF].—The Committee directs the
Department to use a portion of DIF funds for competitive grants,
to be awarded in coordination with the Office of Disability Employ-
ment Policy, to eligible entities in partnership with State VR agen-
cies for innovative strategies that significantly increase competitive
integrated employment of youth and adults with disabilities. The
Committee expects this will focus on expanding the capacity and
the State network of eligible entities providing employment sup-
ports in States, prioritizing States that have returned funds to RSA
or States from the two lowest quintiles of labor force participation
rates for people with disabilities.
The Committee directs the Department to continue to brief the
Committees on Appropriations; the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate; the Committee on Edu-
cation and Workforce of the House of Representatives; the Com-
mittee on Finance of the Senate; and the Committee on Ways and
Means of the House of Representatives at least every 6 months
with updates on activities funded within DIF.
Client Assistance State Grants
The Committee provides $13,000,000 in discretionary funds for
Client Assistance State Grants. This program funds State formula
grants to help VR clients or client applicants understand the bene-
fits available to them. States must operate client assistance pro-
grams to receive VR State Grant funds.

ing programs. These programs support activities designed to in-
crease employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities
by expanding and improving the availability and provision of reha-
bilitation and other services. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes no less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for parent in-
formation and training programs.
Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights
The Committee provides $20,150,000 for the Protection and Ad-
vocacy of Individual Rights program. This program provides grants
to agencies to protect and advocate for the legal and human rights
of persons with disabilities who are ineligible for the protection and
advocacy services available through the Developmental Disabilities
Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (Public Law 106–402) or the Pro-
tection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (Pub-
lic Law 99–319).
Supported Employment State Grants
The Committee provides $22,548,000 for the Supported Employ-
ment State Grants Program. This program provides grants to
States to provide supported employment services for individuals
with the most significant disabilities, including youth with disabil-
ities.
Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind
The Committee provides $33,317,000 for Independent Living
State Grants. This program supports assistance to individuals over
age 55 to help them adjust to their blindness and continue to live

work of agencies.
SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $43,431,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 43,431,000
The Committee provides $43,431,000 to help support American
Printing House for the Blind [APH].
APH provides educational materials to students who are legally
blind and enrolled in elementary and secondary education pro-
291
grams to help enable such students to fully participate in and ben-
efit from education programs. The Federal subsidy provides ap-
proximately 65 percent of APH’s total sales income. Materials are
distributed free of charge to schools and States through per capita
allotments based on the total number of students who are blind.
Materials provided include accessible textbooks, assistive tech-
nologies and other educational aids in Braille, large type, recorded
form, and computer applications. Appropriated funds may be used
for staff salaries and expenses, as well as equipment purchases and
other acquisitions, consistent with the purpose of the act to Pro-
mote the Education of the Blind (Public Law 45–186).
The Committee includes funding for APH to develop and dis-
tribute assistive technologies, books in accessible formats, specially
designed educational aids, and the training and support necessary
to assist educators, parents and students who are blind or visually
impaired to participate in and benefit from education programs. In
addition, within amounts provided for APH, the Committee in-
cludes up to $5,000,000 to support production and distribution of
an innovative braille and tactile display product developed by the

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 92,500,000
The Committee provides $92,500,000 for the National Technical
Institute for the Deaf [NTID].
NTID, located on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Tech-
nology in Rochester, New York, was created by Congress in 1965
to provide a residential facility for postsecondary technical training
and education for persons who are deaf. NTID also provides sup-
port services for students who are deaf, trains professionals in the
field of deafness, and conducts applied research.
Regional STEM Center.—The Committee includes up to
$9,500,000 to continue NTID’s current Regional STEM Center part-
nership. The STEM Center program expands NTID’s geographical
reach and improves access to postsecondary STEM education and
employment for students who are deaf or hard of hearing in under-
served areas. This has included professional development for teach-
ers, developing relationships with business and industry to promote
employment opportunities, and preparing students to be successful
in STEM fields.
GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $167,361,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 167,361,000
The Committee provides $167,361,000 for Gallaudet University.
The Committee continues to include bill language allow Gallaudet
to use up to $15,000,000 of its appropriation for allowable construc-
tion activities.
Gallaudet University is a private, not-for-profit institution offer-
ing undergraduate and continuing education programs for students
292
who are deaf, as well as graduate programs in fields related to
deafness for students who are hearing and deaf. The university
conducts basic and applied research related to hearing impair-
ments and provides public service programs for the deaf commu-
nity.
This funding also supports the Model Secondary School for the
Deaf, which serves as a laboratory for educational experimentation
and development; disseminates curricula, materials, and models of
instruction for students who are deaf; and prepares adolescents
who are deaf for postsecondary academic or vocational education or
the workplace. The university’s Kendall Demonstration Elementary
School develops and provides instruction for children from infancy
through age 15.
Early Language Acquisition Project [ELAP].—The Committee in-
cludes $8,500,000 to continue the National expansion of ELAP
through the Gallaudet University regional centers, of which the
current partner is a regional center. ELAP supports early language
acquisition for children from birth through age three who are deaf
or hard of hearing. This program also supports activities to im-
prove early language acquisition training for early educators, care-
takers, and other professionals and allows Gallaudet to expand and
build on its current research in this area, and test and evaluate
interventions in diverse geographic areas.
CAREER, TECHNICAL, AND ADULT EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,181,436,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,181,436,000
Career and Technical Education
The Committee provides $1,452,269,000 for Career and Technical
Education [CTE] programs.
State Grants.—The Committee provides $1,439,848,000 for CTE
State grants. Funds provided under the State grant program assist
States, localities, and outlying areas to expand and improve their
CTE programs and ensure equal access to CTE for populations
with special needs. Persons assisted range from secondary students
in pre-vocational courses through adults who need retraining to
adapt to changing technological and labor market conditions. Per
the authorization of the program, after reservations for required
set-asides and small State minimums, funds are distributed to a
baseline level of the amount awarded to each State in fiscal year
2018, with any remaining funds allocated according to a formula
based on State population and State per capita income.
Under the Indian and Hawaiian Natives programs, competitive
grants are awarded to federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal
organizations and to organizations primarily serving and rep-
resenting Hawaiian Natives for services that are additional to what
these groups receive under other provisions of the Perkins Act
(Public Law 88–210).
Of the funds available for this program, $648,848,000 will be-
come available July 1, 2026, and $791,000,000 will become avail-
able on October 1, 2026. These funds will remain available for obli-
gation until September 30, 2027.
293
National Activities.—The Committee provides $12,421,000 for na-
tional activities, including up to $6,100,000 for Innovation and
Modernization grants.
The Committee notes that section 114(d)(2) of the Perkins Act re-
quires the Department to use funds appropriated for national ac-
tivities for ‘‘a series of research and evaluation initiatives for each
year for which funds are appropriated.’’ The Committee directs the
Department to provide a briefing to the Committees, the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the
House Committee on Education and Workforce no later than 90
days after enactment on the Department’s implementation of the
requirements under section 114(d)(2) of the Perkins Act, including
past and planned uses of funds for research and evaluation initia-
tives. The Committee directs the Department to provide a list of
the research and evaluation initiatives carried out with such funds
for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026, the amounts planned or
obligated for each initiative, and the timeline for competition of
each such initiative as well as planned uses for funds in fiscal year
2027 in the fiscal year 2027 CJs.
The Committee continues to encourage the Department to work
with the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Commerce to develop
a pilot project to increase the quality of, and participation in, CTE
programs related to the skills needed for new submarine construc-
tion.
The Committee strongly encourages the Department to include a
priority for projects that include, as a component of an innovative
career and technical education program, evidence-based school-
based mentoring activities focused on providing students with the
skills and experiences needed to be successful in the workplace in
any new competitions under the Innovation and Modernization
grants authority.
The Committee requests the Department provide a briefing to
the Committees 180 days after enactment detailing any plans the
Department has to include a priority for grants that support the
establishment of online savings accounts as authorized under the
Innovation and Modernization Grants authority in section 114(e) of
the Perkins Act.
The Committee recognizes the importance of preparing students
for postsecondary education and the workforce, including through
the Career Connected High School Program as described in the
Federal Register on August 14, 2023 (88 Fed. Reg. 54908). This
program provides students with access to dual enrollment, work-
based learning opportunities, in-demand industry credentials, and
career navigation systems, and prioritizes opportunities for stu-
dents from families with low incomes and students living in rural
areas to complete high-quality career pathways that culminate
with an associate, bachelor’s or advanced degree or completion of
a Registered Apprenticeship program after high school. The Com-
mittee urges the Department to continue to support this program
through the Innovation and Modernization Grants authority.
Adult Education
The Committee provides $729,167,000 for Adult Education pro-
grams.
294
Adult Education State Grants.—The Committee recommendation
provides $715,455,000 for Adult Education State Grants which pro-
vide funding for States for programs that assist adults in becoming
literate and in obtaining the skills necessary for employment and
self-sufficiency.
National Leadership Activities.—The Committee provides
$13,712,000 for adult education national leadership activities.
The Committee encourages the Department to support technical
assistance that will help build the evidence-base of adult education
programs, including supporting States in prioritizing rigorously
evaluated programs and the development of rigorous evidence such
as funding randomized control trials, quasi-experimental studies
and other evaluation methods that provide for a causal under-
standing of the effects of programs.
The Committee also encourages the Department to prioritize ac-
tivities that reengage adults who have dropped out of the labor
force, with a priority on States that have low labor participation
rates.
STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $24,615,352,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 24,615,352,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $24,615,352,000 for
programs under the Student Financial Assistance account.
Federal Pell Grant Program
The Committee provides $22,475,352,000 in current year discre-
tionary funding for the Pell grant program. This funding combined
with the additional $10,500,000,000 provided to support the discre-
tionary costs of the program in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
(Public Law 119–21) will ensure the Pell grant program does not
face a funding shortfall in fiscal year 2026.
The Committee recommendation includes $6,335 for the discre-
tionary portion of the maximum Pell grant award. Combined with
mandatory funding, under current law, this would provide a total
maximum award of $7,395 for the 2026–2027 award year.
Pell Grant Restoration and Prison Education Program.—The
Committee continues to recognize the value of the Pell Grant in
supporting effective prison education programs for incarcerated in-
dividuals, reducing recidivism rates, and saving taxpayer dollars by
reducing the overall cost of incarceration. The Committee directs
the Department to provide technical assistance that encourages ad-
ditional institutions to establish a Prison Education Program [PEP]
and work to transition all former Second Chance Pell experimental
sites to become a PEP. In addition, the Committee strongly encour-
ages the Department to coordinate with the Bureau of Prisons,
State departments of corrections, county and local jail administra-
tors, and accrediting agencies to enroll new PEP providers. The
Committee directs the Department to publish a publicly available
list of approved PEPs on a quarterly basis so that incarcerated stu-
dents, corrections officials, and policymakers have a public source
of information about PEP availability.
295
The Committee also encourages the Department to develop and
provide technical assistance and guidance to institutions of higher
education on how to support formerly incarcerated students as they
leave prison, reenter society, and reenroll in postsecondary edu-
cation. This guidance should address evidence-based strategies for
helping formerly incarcerated people to secure housing, employ-
ment, and other Federal benefits, as well as re-enroll in college, ac-
cess Federal and State financial aid, and secure campus housing
and student employment. The Department should convey to insti-
tutions of higher education that they should work to ensure that
every student who participates in a Prison Education Program is
able to reenter their communities successfully post-release.
Workforce Pell Grants.—The Committee directs the Department
to collect and report to Congress, no later than 270 days after en-
actment of this act and each year thereafter, a complete list of in-
stitutions of higher education and programs at such institutions
that have gained eligibility for Workforce Pell Grants, as enacted
under Public Law 119–21, and for each eligible institution or pro-
gram, the information obtained by the Department for each such
program used to determine whether such programs meet each met-
ric associated with the program eligibility criteria described under

Section 73:
section 481(b)(3)(A)(iv) of the Higher Education Act [HEA] (Public
Law 89–329), as amended. The Department is further directed to
provide quarterly briefings to the Committees, the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House
Committee on Education and Workforce on the implementation of
Workforce Pell, including how the Department will verify the com-
pletion, job placement rates, and tuition and fees compared with
the value-added earnings of each program.
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program
The Committee provides $910,000,000 for the Supplemental Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant [SEOG] program. The SEOG program
provides funds to institutions of higher education for need-based
grants to students. Institutions must contribute at least 25 percent
toward SEOG awards.
Federal Work-Study Program
The Committee bill provides $1,230,000,000 for the Federal
Work-Study [FWS] program. This program provides grants to insti-
tutions of higher education to help undergraduate, graduate, and
professional students meet the costs of postsecondary education
through part-time employment. Institutions must provide at least
25 percent of student earnings.
Within the total for FWS, the Committee recommendation in-
cludes $11,053,000, for the Work Colleges program authorized
under section 448 of the HEA.
STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,058,943,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,058,943,000
The Committee provides $2,058,943,000 for the Student Aid Ad-
ministration account. These funds are available until September
296
30, 2027, and support the Department’s student aid management,
including administration and operation, expenses.
The Committee directs the Department to provide a detailed
spend plan of the planned uses of funds in this account within 45
days of enactment, and to provide quarterly briefings on its imple-
mentation not later than 10 days prior to the start of the quarter.
This shall continue to include, but not be limited to, detailed break-
outs by baseline operations and development efforts; and servicing,
student aid core systems, IT activities, and other Office of Federal
Student Aid [FSA] activities. These spend plans should also include
details on major activities, including the Unified Servicing and
Data Solution [USDS], the Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility
Reform [SABER] initiative, and implementation of the FUTURE
Act, FAFSA Simplification Act, Joint Consolidation Loan Separa-
tion Act, Stop Student Debt Relief Scams Act, and One Big Beau-
tiful Bill Act, and other activities as appropriate. Further, the
spend plan shall include a crosswalk to activities funded under ad-
ministrative costs and servicing activities, and any reallocation of
funds between those two activities shall be treated as a reprogram-
ming of funds, and the Committees shall be notified in advance of
any such changes.
The Committee includes updated bill language requiring the De-
partment to provide monthly briefings on Federal student loan
servicing and repayment. Additionally, the Department is directed
to continue to notify the Committees of awarded contract Change
Requests from the preceding month by the 10th day of the next cal-
endar month regarding changes to student loan servicing.
Briefing Requirement.—The Committee directs the Secretary to
continue providing monthly briefings and reports to the Commit-
tees and to the Committees on Education and Workforce of the
House of Representatives and on Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions of the Senate on student aid administrative activities and
data for Federal student loans during fiscal year 2026, including
implementation of the higher education provisions in the One Big
Beautiful Act. Information in the briefings and reports should also
include, but not be limited to, borrower status, including the per-
centage of total borrowers and the percentage of at-risk borrowers
(defined as borrowers who have one or more of the following risk
factors: a previous history of default, missing a payment in the first
3 months of entering repayment, not completing their degree pro-
gram, or pausing payments multiple times) in repayment by repay-
ment plan; the percentage of borrowers and the percentage of at-
risk borrowers who are delinquent or not making payments; share
of borrowers at-risk of defaulting on their student loans currently
in active repayment (defined as repayment that is not in deferment
or forbearance), by repayment plan; average and median amount
repaid through the duration of repayment by repayment plan; aver-
age and median income of borrowers who receive forgiveness
through IDR; share of borrowers making $0 payments; metrics on
communications with borrowers who are severely delinquent in
their loans, including open and click through rates for emails and
repayment actions; the Department’s progress on processing the
backlog of IDR applications; and any changes to communications
with borrowers based on data or behavioral economics assumptions
297
gathered during communications campaigns. The Committee fur-
ther directs the Department to include updates on its campaign
around resumed collections of student loans, including the mecha-
nisms used in the communications campaign and outcomes of such
campaign including number of borrowers reached, actions taken,
the number of borrowers who have called the Debt Management
and Collections System call center, and the number of borrowers
who have exited default as a result of the communications cam-
paign in the monthly reports and briefings provided. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department to produce and broadly dissemi-
nate an accessible public report that summarizes this data on an
annual basis.
College Scorecard.—The Committee recognizes the value of insti-
tution-level outcomes data, including graduation rates, student
loan repayment rates, and post-college earnings data for higher
education accountability and directs the Department to maintain
the College Scorecard and update the College Scorecard’s data no
less than once annually. The Committee also encourages the De-
partment to continue refining the existing measures to maximize
transparency about postsecondary educational opportunities and
outcomes for students.
FAFSA Data.—The Committee directs the Department to main-
tain and expand the frequency and detail of FAFSA reporting, in-
cluding quarterly Application Volume Reports, on the FSA Student
Aid Data Center. This data shall include, at minimum: (1) The
number of FAFSA submissions and completions processed by FSA
and disaggregated by State, demographic characteristics, secondary
school, and postsecondary school; (2) The number of submissions
which contained inaccuracies thereby requiring resubmission to the
Department; and (3) The amount of Federal student aid disbursed
disaggregated by type of aid. The Department shall post the quar-
terly FAFSA reports no later than 60 days after the end of each
applicable quarter.
FAFSA Administration.—The Committee appreciates the
progress FSA has made regarding implementation of the FAFSA
Simplification Act, including the strong customer service statistics
for the past 6 months, but remains concerned about the adminis-
tration of the FAFSA and is interested in ensuring that the level
of customer service being provided to students and their families
by FSA is adequate. During previous application cycles, financial
aid applicants and financial aid administrators faced a number of
problems, including with the functionality of the FAFSA form, ac-
curacy of the application of the Federal financial aid formula, the
transmission of data to institutions of higher education to accu-
rately process financial aid, availability of corrections, long call cen-
ter wait times, and the capabilities of FAFSA contractors to ad-
dress some issues. It is essential that the Department continue on
its current path to ensure sufficient staffing and support for
FAFSA implementation to avoid any disruptions to the continued
administration of the 2025–2026 FAFSA and the upcoming launch
of the 2026–2027 FAFSA. While the use of technology, including
artificial intelligence, is helpful, it cannot replace the need for expe-
rienced Department staff who have knowledge and expertise in the
administration of financial aid and technical product development.
298
The Committee directs the Department to ensure full functionality
for the 2026–2027 FAFSA when it launches by October 1, 2025.
This functionality shall include FAFSA processing, school receipt of
processed FAFSAs, processing of paper FAFSAs, and FAFSA cor-
rection functionality for applicants, institutions of higher education,
and States. In advance of the October 1st launch, the Committee
urges a timely release of the Federal student aid estimator, the
FAFSA demonstration site, communication and training materials,
a user-friendly Pell look-up table, eligibility and technical guides,
and a quick, effective, and secure process for attaining an FSA ID.
Funds provided under this account should be allocated to improve
customer service, including by conducting rigorous consumer test-
ing as required by law. The Committee directs the Department to
continue to provide monthly briefings on FAFSA administration,
including on the timeline for the launch of the 2026–2027 FAFSA,
consumer testing, FSA ID creation, transmission of ISIRs, and
availability of corrections. Should the launch of the form be delayed
after October 1 of the year prior to the upcoming award year, the
Department shall provide the Committees, the Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Com-
mittee on Education and Workforce with written notification and a
written timeline for the upcoming FAFSA launch no later than 10
days after enactment of this act and continue to update the written
notification and written timeline every week until complete.
Federal Fund and Guaranty Agency Reporting.—Not later than
180 days after enactment, the Department is directed to produce
and make publicly available on the FSA Data Center, a report re-
garding the Federal Funds authorized under section 422A of the
HEA. The Committee directs such report to include the following
for each guaranty agency: total amount in the Federal Fund avail-
able for expenses, a list of expenses (detailed by amount and type)
from the previous fiscal year from the Federal Fund, the total
amount the Secretary transferred to the Operating fund in the pre-
vious fiscal year, changes in the Federal Fund and forecasted per-
formance of the guaranty agencies, and how the Department en-
sures effective oversight of the Federal Fund. The report shall also
include, for each guaranty agency, how much from the Federal
Fund was expensed to Project Success for the previous fiscal year,
a list of Project Success partner institutions for that fiscal year, a
summary by partner institution of what Project Success funds were
spent on in that fiscal year, and for each guaranty agency and
partner institution (as applicable), the metrics the Department is
using to evaluate the effectiveness of the Project Success funds,
how the Department selected current Project Success partner enti-
ties, and how many students were served by each Project Success
partner entity. Finally, the report should include what is commu-
nicated to Guaranty Agencies when Federal funds are released for
any grantmaking or programmatic purposes, including about the
duration of project performance, the timely outlaying of funds for
agreed upon activities, what percent of funds are allowed be held
onto by Guaranty Agencies for administrative or indirect costs, and
how the Department ensures Guaranty Agencies are adhering to
basic grantmaking standards and requirements such as the stand-
299
ards and requirements other entities are required to adhere to in
EDGAR.
Financial Aid Data.—The Committee notes that FSA retains
sensitive information on millions of Americans and reminds the De-
partment of its obligation to fulfill all statutory requirements re-
garding data sharing and privacy. While data-sharing can produce
important new insights and reduce administrative burden for appli-
cants and recipients of Federal benefits, unlawful or inappropriate
access of such data undermines the trust that individuals place in
the government to use the data responsibly and legally. Within 30
days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs FSA to pro-
vide a report detailing the agency’s compliance with the Privacy
Act of 1974, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act,
and other applicable statutes governing the use and disclosure of
individual financial aid data (including data in the National Stu-
dent Loan Data System, the Financial Management System, and
the FAFSA processing system), including the Internal Revenue
Code, the HEA, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act. Such report shall also include an overview of any data-sharing
agreements signed or amended between FSA and other Federal
agencies in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, a list of any instances
where personally identifiable information was shared with another
Federal agency without a data sharing agreement in place in fiscal
years 2025 and 2026, including a description of what data was
shared, with whom data was shared, for what purpose, and under
what statutory authority. The report shall also include a descrip-
tion of the procedures FSA has put in place to ensure individual
financial aid data is not accessed by unauthorized persons, inappro-
priately used, or shared outside of FSA in unauthorized ways.
Higher Education Data Reporting.—The Committee notes that
accurate information about costs and outcomes in postsecondary
programs is vital to students and their families as they make one
of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. The Committee di-
rects the Department to fully implement and enforce all statutory
data reporting and collection requirements under the HEA, includ-
ing the requirement to update and improve the Integrated Postsec-
ondary Education Data System [IPEDS], the requirement that in-
stitutions of higher education participate in Federal data collec-
tions, including IPEDS, and maintaining the expanded IPEDS data
elements required by the HEA.
Identity Verification.—The Committee recognizes the need for
identity verification procedures to ensure Federal student aid is
being properly provided to eligible students. However, the Com-
mittee notes the burden increased identity verification procedures
could pose to first-generation and first-time FAFSA filers. There-
fore, the Committee directs the Department to support institutions
of higher education and students experiencing any difficulties with
the new verification processes.
Institutional Oversight.—The Committee directs the Department
to continue to update and post all regularly produced public report-
ing on the FSA Student Aid Data Center related to oversight of in-
stitutions of higher education. FSA should review applicable stat-
utes and regulations to determine if any of the reports mandate
specific reporting actions and update public websites accordingly.
300
Interagency Coordination for Benefits Outreach and Financial
Aid.—The Committee notes that students and families would ben-
efit from additional information on public and tax benefit programs
that can help them meet their basic needs and cost of attendance,
and that the recipients of public and tax benefit programs would
benefit from information on financial aid to help them enroll in
higher education. The FAFSA Simplification Act supports inter-
agency coordination to conduct outreach for such purposes under

Section 74:
sections 483(c)(3) and 485E(c) of the HEA, respectively. Within 60
days of enactment, the Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide a briefing on the status of implementation of these provisions,
including interagency coordination with Federal agencies, and
other efforts to expand notifications to students about public and
tax benefit programs. Further, the Committee strongly encourages
the Department to promote such outreach through direct and reg-
ular notices to financial aid applicants, technical assistance to in-
stitutions, and communications with States.
Maintaining Higher Education Transparency and Research.—The
Committee is concerned by reports that existing higher education
research and data collection organizations are being limited con-
trary to Congressional intent under the FAFSA Simplification Act.
Collecting and publishing timely and relevant student access and
outcome data that does not publicly release personally identifiable
information and related analyses through mechanisms such as
third-party research agreements, agency surveys, and administra-
tive data collections with strong privacy protections have been and
continue to be essential for the planning, administration, operation,
and evaluation of the student aid programs and higher education
grant programs. Additionally, students and their families benefit
from targeted outreach and enrollment into public and tax benefit
benefits for which they may be eligible and which help them afford
the cost of college. Such data uses do not result in publicly dis-
closing personally identifiable information. The Committee urges
the Department to maintain secure data collection, reporting that
does not publicly release personally identifiable information, pri-
vacy-protected research, and interagency data-sharing for students’
educational purposes only, including tax information such as in-
come and family size, as part of the administration of the Federal
student aid programs under the HEA. Further, the Committee di-
rects the Department to issue guidance to reaffirm such data uses
to further transparency, research, evaluation, and accountability in
higher education while still ensuring student privacy. Further, the
Committee directs the Department to permit the secure use of stu-
dent and family tax data and issue guidance on Federal tax infor-
mation data use, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service
guidelines, to satisfy Federal data collection and reporting require-
ments.
Office of the Chief Economist.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of the work of the Office of the Chief Economist. The Com-
mittee encourages FSA to collaborate with the Office of the Chief
Economist to develop research and data analysis that will support
informed policymaking, including studying measures of labor mar-
ket outcomes of graduates by program and institution type; ana-
lyzing the types of borrowers who have received or are making
301
progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness; and how meas-
ures of short-term repayment outcomes relate to long-term repay-
ment outcomes.
Ombudsman.—The Committee notes that the Student Loan Om-
budsman is required under section 141 of the HEA and plays a
critical role in supporting borrowers. The Committee directs the
Secretary to provide a briefing to the Committees, the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House
Committee on Education and Workforce on the Department’s
progress on addressing unanswered complaints submitted to the
ombudsman. The Committee also directs the Department to include
the following information in the annual report required under sec-
tion 141: data demonstrating the activities and effectiveness of the
ombudsman function, the number of complaints received, the num-
ber of cumulative open complaints, the number of pending com-
plaints that have received an initial response, and the number of
complaints resolved.
Promoting Safe Campuses.—The Committee is concerned by re-
ports of increased discrimination on college campuses, including
hate crimes motivated by anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim prejudice.
As FSA conducts its fiscal year 2026 work on enforcement of the
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act [Clery Act], including complaint assessments,
media assessments, and program reviews, the Committee encour-
ages FSA to include institutions where known anti-Semitic or anti-
Muslim hate crimes have occurred during the 2024–2025 academic
year in such assessments and reviews. The Committee further en-
courages the Department to issue appropriate and timely fines for
violations of the Clery Act.
PSLF Processing.—The Committee is interested in receiving in-
formation regarding PSLF processing. The Committee directs the
Secretary to continue including information in the monthly loan re-
payment briefings for the Committees, the Senate Committee on
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Committee
on Education and Workforce on the Department’s progress on proc-
essing PSLF in fiscal year 2025. The Committee also directs the
Department to provide updated data on the FSA Student Aid Data
Center on the number of PSLF applications processed, approved, or
denied on a quarterly basis.
Return of Title IV Funds.—The Committee continues to encour-
age the Department to pursue efforts to simplify and streamline
the Return of Title IV Funds process for institutions of higher edu-
cation and students.
State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements.—The Committee
notes that State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements [SARAs],
with strong consumer protections, can serve as an efficient and ef-
fective provider of uniform requirements for postsecondary distance
education. SARAs can expand educational choice for students to
adapt to a changing professional landscape, enable institutions to
provide more efficient and consistent distance education to a broad-
er range of students, and reduce institutional costs and bureauc-
racy. The Committee urges the Department to continue to support
these agreements, including supporting the expansion of SARAs, as
appropriate, for Federal financial aid or regulatory purposes, so
302
long as such SARAs are accompanied by strong consumer protec-
tions and maintain the ability of States to exercise regulatory au-
thority over such SARAs serving students in their States.
State-Based and Non-Profit Servicing Organizations.—The Com-
mittee continues to note that many State-based and non-profit
servicing organizations have demonstrated and specialized experi-
ence in helping struggling borrowers, and continues to encourage
the Department and Federal student loan servicers to work with
state and nonprofit organizations to help student and parent bor-
rowers repay their Federal student loans.
STOP Act Implementation.—The Committee is concerned that
the Department has not fully implemented the Student Debt Relief
Scams Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–251), also known as the STOP
Act, which requires the Department to enable third-party data sys-
tem access to NSLDS as described in section 485B(e) of the HEA
to ensure attorneys, State officials, and others have information to
support student borrowers in addressing issues with their students
loans. The Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing
no later than 90 days after enactment to the Committees, the Sen-
ate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the
House Committee on Education and Workforce on implementation
of the STOP Act, including how many requests the Department has
received for third-party access to NSLDS.
Unaccompanied Homeless Youth and Other Students Without
Parent or Family Support.—The Committee continues to be con-
cerned that youth who do not have parental support are experi-
encing significant challenges completing the FAFSA and financial
aid process. Students experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness and
who do not have documentation have been incorrectly categorized
as provisionally independent and have been arbitrarily limited in
how they can document their experience with homelessness in pre-
vious FAFSA cycles. The Committee directs the Department to
work with institutions of higher education to correct these errors
for the 2026–2027 cycle. The Committee directs the Department to
make publicly available the data about unaccompanied homeless
youth and foster youth required by the FAFSA Simplification Act
under section 483(c)(1)(D) of the HEA within 60 days of enactment
of this act. The Committee further directs the Department to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees, the Senate Committee on
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Committee
on Education and Workforce within 90 days of enactment on how
the Department reviews and conducts oversight on institutions of
higher education that have high rates of unfulfilled requests for
unaccompanied homeless youth determinations.

ment; and purchase of educational materials.
The Committee continues to support funding for programs that
promote and support collaboration between Hispanic-serving insti-
tutions and LEAs that serve a significant number or percentage of
Hispanic or Latino students for the purpose of improving edu-
cational attainment, including increasing high school graduation
rates and postsecondary enrollment, transfer, and completion rates
among Hispanic or Latino students, such as by strengthening path-
ways to postsecondary and workforce development programs.
Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Ameri-
cans.—The Committee provides $27,451,000 for competitive, 5-year
grants to HSIs to help Hispanic Americans gain entry into and suc-
ceed in graduate study. Institutions may use funding to support
low-income students through outreach programs; academic support
services; mentoring and financial assistance; acquisition, rental, or
lease of scientific or laboratory equipment; construction and other
facilities improvements; and purchase of educational materials.
The Committee continues to encourage the Department to
prioritize awards for projects that support consortiums of HSIs that
award PhDs to develop and test new models of cross-institutional
partnerships that facilitate mutually reinforcing activities, such as
resource-sharing learning communities, mentorship programs for
PhD students, graduate research experiences, faculty mentor ca-
pacity-building, and other uses associated with the pursuit and
completion of PhDs by Hispanic students.
Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities
[HBCUs].—The Committee provides $400,966,000 for the Strength-
ening HBCUs program. The program makes formula grants to

ening HBGIs program. This program provides 5-year grants to pro-
304
vide scholarships for low-income students and academic and coun-
seling services to improve student success. Funds may also be used
for construction, maintenance, and renovation activities; the pur-
chase or lease of scientific and laboratory equipment; and the es-
tablishment of an endowment.
Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions [PBIs].—The
Committee provides $22,412,000 for the Strengthening PBIs pro-
gram. This program provides 5-year grants to PBIs to plan and im-
plement programs to enhance their capacity to serve more low- and
middle-income students.
Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions [AANAPISIs].—The Committee pro-
vides $18,682,000 for competitive grants to AANAPISIs that have
an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent
Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander students.
Grants may be used to improve their capacity to serve Asian Amer-
ican and Native American Pacific Islander students and low-income
individuals.
Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Insti-
tutions [ANNHs].—The Committee provides $24,555,000 for the
Strengthening ANNHs program. The purpose of this program is to
improve and expand the capacity of institutions serving Alaska Na-
tive and Native Hawaiian students and low-income individuals.
Funds may be used to plan, develop, and implement activities that
encourage faculty and curriculum development; improve adminis-
trative management; renovate educational facilities; enhance stu-
dent services; purchase library and other educational materials;
and provide education or counseling services designed to improve
the financial and economic literacy of students or their families.
The Committee includes new bill language that will permit ANNH
grantees to use funding for construction and maintenance of class-
rooms, libraries, and other instructional facilities.
Strengthening Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Institu-
tions.—The Committee provides $11,462,000 for this program,
which serves institutions that enroll at least 10 percent Native
American students and at least 50 percent low-income students.
This program helps institutions plan, develop, and implement ac-
tivities that encourage faculty and curriculum development; im-
prove administrative management; renovate educational facilities;
enhance student services; and purchase library and other edu-
cational materials. The Committee includes new bill language that
will permit grantees to use funding for construction and mainte-
nance of classrooms, libraries, and other instructional facilities.
Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities
[TCCUs].—The Committee provides $51,807,000 for this program.
Tribal colleges and universities rely on a portion of the funds pro-
vided to address developmental needs, including faculty develop-
ment, curriculum, and student services. Funds can also be used for
construction and renovation. The Committee notes that our Na-
tion’s Tribal colleges and universities have significant unmet infra-
structure needs. Tribal colleges are also uniquely situated-they
often lack access to State funding and other resources available to
other public institutions of higher education.
305
Strengthening Master’s Degree Programs at Historically Black
Colleges and Universities.—The Committee provides $20,037,000
for this program, authorized by section 723 of the HEA. This pro-
gram provides grants to specified colleges and universities making
a substantial contribution to graduate education opportunities at
the master’s level in mathematics, engineering, the physical or nat-
ural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing,
allied health, or other scientific disciplines.
International Education and Foreign Language Studies
The bill provides a total of $80,664,000 for International Edu-
cation and Foreign Language Studies programs. Funds are used to
increase the number of experts in foreign languages and area or
international studies to meet national security needs through visits
and study in foreign countries.
Domestic Programs.—The Committee provides $70,353,000 for
domestic program activities related to international education and
foreign language studies under title VI of the HEA. Funds are used
to support centers, programs, and fellowships. The Committee
urges the Secretary to preserve the program’s longstanding focus
on activities and institutions that address the Nation’s need for a
strong training and research capacity in foreign languages and
international studies, including increasing the pool of international
experts in areas that are essential to national security and eco-
nomic competitiveness.
Overseas Programs.—The Committee provides $10,311,000 for
overseas programs authorized under the Mutual Educational and
Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (Public Law 87–256), popularly
known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. Funding is provided for group,
faculty, or doctoral dissertation research abroad, as well as special
bilateral projects. Grants focus on training American instructors
and students to improve foreign language and area studies edu-
cation in the United States.
Model Transition Programs for Students With Intellectual Disabil-
ities into Higher Education
The Committee provides $13,800,000 for the Model Transition
Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities into Higher
Education [TPSID] program. The TPSID program provides competi-
tive grants to institutions of higher education or consortia of insti-
tutions of higher education to enable them to create or expand high
quality, inclusive model comprehensive transition and postsec-
ondary programs for students with intellectual disabilities. The
Committee directs the Department to ensure the TPSID program
maintains support for a national Coordinating Center and a tech-
nical assistance center to translate and disseminate research and
best practices to IHEs more broadly.
Minority Science and Engineering Improvement
The Committee provides $16,370,000 for the Minority Science
and Engineering Improvement program. Funds are used to provide
discretionary grants to institutions with minority enrollments
greater than 50 percent to purchase equipment, develop curricula,

vocational institutions to ensure continued and expanding opportu-
nities for Indian students.
Federal TRIO Programs
The Committee provides $1,191,000,000 for Federal TRIO pro-
grams, which provide a variety of services to improve postsec-
ondary education opportunities for low-income individuals and
first-generation college students. This includes: Upward Bound
which offers disadvantaged high school students academic services
to develop the skills and motivation needed to pursue and complete
a postsecondary education; Student Support Services which pro-
vides developmental instruction, counseling, summer programs,
and grant aid to disadvantaged college students to help them com-
plete their postsecondary education; Talent Search which identifies
and counsels individuals between ages 11 and 27 regarding oppor-
tunities for completing high school and enrolling in postsecondary
education; Educational Opportunity Centers [EOC] which provide
information and counseling on available financial and academic as-
sistance to low-income adults who are first-generation college stu-
dents; and the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement
Program which supports research internships, seminars, tutoring,
and other activities to encourage disadvantaged college students to
enroll in doctoral programs.
The Department is directed to allocate funding for each of the in-
dividual TRIO programs at no less than the following levels: Talent
Search $190,182,000; Upward Bound $380,830,000; Veterans Up-
ward Bound $22,253,000; Upward Bound Math-Science

The Department is also directed to ensure that the notices invit-
ing applications for new awards for the Talent Search and Edu-
cational Opportunity Centers grant competitions are published no
later than December 1, 2025. The Department is further directed
to take steps necessary to issue grant award notifications for all
TRIO programs (both new and non-competing continuation award
notices) no later than June 30, 2026.
TRIO and Justice-Impacted Students.—The Committee recog-
nizes that EOCs have a long history of helping justice-impacted
adults to enroll in college. The restoration of Pell Grants for people
in prison presents an opportunity for EOCs to reach more students.
The Committee encourages the Department to provide technical as-
sistance and guidance to EOCs on best practices for supporting jus-
tice-impacted students, including examples of programs that can
serve as models to others. In addition, the Committee encourages
307
the Department to consider how other TRIO programs can support
justice-impacted students and provide guidance to institutions of
higher education.
Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro-
grams [GEAR UP]
The Committee provides $388,000,000 for GEAR UP, which pro-
vides grants to States and partnerships of colleges, middle and
high schools, and community organizations to assist cohorts or stu-
dents in middle and high schools serving a high percentage of low-
income students. Services provided help students prepare for and
pursue a postsecondary education.
The Committee directs the Department to announce Notices In-
viting Applications for New Awards for State Grants and Partner-
ship Grants in the Federal Register. In such notice for State
Grants, the Committee directs the Department to uphold the long-
standing guidance that States may only administer one active
State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is directed to pro-
vide written guidance in the Federal Register notifying applicants
that only States without an active State GEAR UP grant, or States
that have an active State GEAR UP grant that is scheduled to end
prior to October 1, 2026 will be eligible to receive a new State
GEAR UP award funded in whole or in part by this appropriation.
In making new awards, the Department shall ensure that not less
than 33 percent of the new award funds are allocated to State
awards, and that not less than 33 percent of the new award funds
are allocated to Partnerships awards, as described in section 404(b)
of the HEA. The Secretary is further directed to ensure that no re-
quest from a State Grant applicant to receive an exception to the
GEAR UP scholarship described in section 404E(b)(2) of the HEA
shall be denied on the basis of 34 CFR 694.14(c)(3).
Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need
The Committee provides $23,547,000 to support the Graduate
Assistance in Areas of National Need [GAANN] program. GAANN
supports fellowships through 3-year competitive grants to graduate
academic departments and programs in scientific and technical
fields and other areas of national need as determined by the Sec-
retary. Fellowship recipients must have excellent academic records
and high financial need and must be pursuing doctoral degrees or
the highest graduate degrees in their academic field. Each fellow-
ship consists of a student stipend to cover living costs and an insti-
tutional payment to cover each fellow’s tuition and other expenses.
Institutions of higher education must match 25 percent of the grant
amount.
Teacher Quality Partnership Program
The Committee provides $65,000,000 for the Teacher Quality
Partnership [TQP] program. The TQP program helps improve the
quality of teachers working in high-need schools and early child-
hood education programs by supporting teacher preparation and
residency programs.
The Committee recognizes the need to remove barriers to entry
to the teaching profession in order to address teacher shortage
308
issues. Therefore, the Committee urges the Department to
prioritize grants to eligible grantees that assist in removing such
barriers by providing need-based scholarships or grants and aca-
demic supports to help teacher candidates successfully complete
preparation programs and meet state licensure requirements.
The Committee recognizes the increasing number of and demand
for ‘‘Grow Your Own’’ teacher preparation programs in our Nation.
The Committee urges the Department to continue to support ‘‘Grow
Your Own’’ teacher preparation programs, with a focus on pro-
grams that increase recruitment efforts in local communities, pro-
vide high quality pathways into the profession, improve teacher re-
tention, and improve student outcomes.
The Committee also notes the need to ensure future teachers are
well trained in data literacy, including how to use data in the class-
room to differentiate instruction and improve student outcomes.
The Committee urges the Department to prioritize TQP funding for
applicants that seek to develop data literacy skills in future teach-
ers.
Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools
The Committee provides $75,000,000 for the Child Care Access
Means Parents in Schools [CCAMPIS] program. This program pro-
vides competitive grants to institutions of higher education to es-
tablish or support campus-based child care programs, to help sup-
port needs and participation of low-income parents in post-sec-
ondary education.
The Committee directs the Department to prioritize grants to eli-
gible entities serving a significant percentage of Pell-eligible or
other low-income students. The Committee urges the Department
to prioritize grants to eligible entities that propose flexible child
care arrangements (such as evening, weekend, and drop-in child
care) in any future competition. The Committee further urges the
Department to prioritize grantees who will conduct direct outreach
to parenting students regarding State and Federal public benefits,
the Child Tax Credit, and education tax benefits for which the stu-
dent parent may be eligible. The Committee also urges the Depart-
ment to require new grantees to collect data on the total number
of parenting students enrolled at the institution and the number of
parenting students served by CCAMPIS grant funds. Additionally,
the Committee strongly encourages the Department to assist grant-
ees in leveraging other funding opportunities to help parenting stu-
dents afford child care, by providing technical assistance and other
support to grantees.
Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education
The Committee provides $146,000,000 for the Fund for the Im-
provement of Post-Secondary Education. Within the total provided
for the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education, the
following amounts are available for the following activities:

Basic Needs Systems Grants.—The Committee recommendation
includes $10,000,000 for competitive grants to IHEs (as defined in

Section 75:
section 101 of the HEA), consortia of such IHEs, systems of higher
education, or States to advance systemic solutions to identify, ad-
dress, and prevent student basic needs insecurity. Such grants
shall include one or more of the following activities: establishing
processes to automatically identify and conduct outreach to stu-
dents who may be eligible for public and tax benefit programs; con-
ducting surveys or assessments of student basic needs security, in-
cluding surveys of student needs conducted upon enrollment; pro-
viding referrals or case management to students to enroll in local,
State, and Federal public and tax benefit programs; or coordinating
and collaborating with government and community-based organiza-
tions to execute such activities. Activities may also include pro-
viding direct services such as temporary or affordable housing, free
or subsidized food, access to on-campus childcare, emergency finan-
cial aid, and connecting students to mental and behavioral health
services, so long as such activities are part of systemic plan to ad-
dress and prevent student basic needs insecurity. The Committee
directs the Department to prioritize eligible entities enrolling or
serving a significant percentage of Pell-eligible or other low-income
students, including community colleges, HBCUs, and other MSIs.
Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program.—The
Committee recommendation includes $9,000,000 for the Centers of
Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program.
National Center for Information and Technical Support for Post-
secondary Students with Disabilities.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $2,000,000 for the continued operation of
the National Center for Information and Technical Support for
Postsecondary Students with Disabilities, also known as the Na-
tional Center for College Students with Disabilities, as authorized
under section 777(a) of the HEA.
Open Textbook Pilot.—The Committee recommendation includes
$7,000,000 for the Open Textbook Pilot program. The Committee
directs the Department to issue a notice inviting applications, allow
for a 60-day application period, and make a significant number of
grant awards under the same terms and conditions as in prior
years. The Committee further directs the Department to prohibit
institutions of higher education receiving grants from charging stu-
dents course material fees for any course utilizing free open text-
books, including equitable access fees or inclusive access fees. The
Committee also directs the Department to ensure that any data
collected from grantees about the performance of the open textbook
pilot program does not include data from courses subject to such
course material fees, unless such data is clearly disaggregated from
data on the use of free open textbooks.
Postsecondary Student Success Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $40,000,000 for competitive Postsecondary
310
Student Success Grants, to scale evidence-based practices and re-
forms to improve postsecondary retention and completion rates
among underserved students. These funds support grants to States,
TCCUs, and systems of institutions of higher education to imple-
ment or expand evidence-based, statewide, and institutional level
practices and reforms that improve student outcomes, including en-
rollment, retention, transfer, and completion among underserved
students including students of color, low-income students, students
with disabilities, students in need of remediation, first generation
college students, homeless youth, foster youth, and student par-
ents. The Committee directs the Department continue to carry out
this program as a tiered-evidence competition, and require rigorous
independent evaluations of grantee projects. The Committee fur-
ther directs the Secretary to prioritize the awarding of Postsec-
ondary Student Success grants to institutions of higher education
that serve a significant percentage of Pell-eligible or other low-in-
come students and that have a demonstrated commitment to imple-
menting evidence-based strategies to improve student outcomes for
such underserved students.
Research and Development Infrastructure Investments at HBCUs,
TCCUs, and MSIs.—The Committee recommendation includes
$38,000,000 to increase the capacity of HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs
to conduct innovative research in emerging technology and indus-
tries. These funds support planning and implementation grants de-
signed to promote transformational investments in research infra-
structure, such as physical infrastructure, capital improvement, re-
search-related equipment, and hiring and retaining of faculty and
research-related staff.
Rural Postsecondary and Economic Development Grant Pro-
gram.—The Committee recommendation includes $40,000,000 for
competitive grants to States, institutions of higher education, con-
sortia of such institutions, or non-profit organizations to support
rural students in the enrollment, retention, transfer, and comple-
tion of postsecondary education through the Rural Postsecondary
and Economic Development [RPED] Grant Program. The Com-
mittee recognizes that rural-serving institutions and communities
face unique challenges and barriers. In particular, smaller, rural-
serving colleges, universities and non-profit organizations may
have significantly fewer staff, and less experience, in preparing to
respond to Federal grant opportunities. The Committee encourages
the Department to consider ways to better support rural applicants
by recognizing the unique challenges facing rural communities, in-
cluding but not limited to providing greater flexibility, longer appli-
cation timelines, and targeted technical assistance for RPED
grants. The Committee further urges the Secretary to prioritize the
awarding of RPED grants to rural applicants that serve a signifi-
cant percentage of Pell-eligible or other low-income students.
Congressionally Directed Spending
The Committee provides $226,974,000 for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table at the end of this Committee Re-
port.
311
Hawkins Centers of Excellence
The Committee provides $15,000,000 for Hawkins Centers of Ex-
cellence. This program supports the expansion and improvement of
teacher education programs at HBCUs and other MSIs in order to
support diverse, well-prepared, and effective educators.
The Committee recognizes the importance of high-quality teacher
preparation for student learning and teacher retention, and there-
fore directs the Secretary to prioritize grants to eligible institutions
that propose to establish or scale up high-quality teacher prepara-
tion pathways that offer extensive preservice clinical training and
mentoring by exemplary teachers in grade and subject areas
deemed high need by their state. The Committee also recognizes
the value of a diverse teacher workforce and directs the Secretary
to prioritize grants to eligible institutions that commit to providing
scholarships or grants, based on financial need, as well as academic
supports to help teacher candidates successfully complete the prep-
aration program and state licensure requirements, and to publicly
report on these efforts and outcomes.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $304,018,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 254,018,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $254,018,000 for
Howard University. Located in the District of Columbia, Howard
offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees through
12 schools and colleges. The university also administers the How-
ard University Hospital. The Committee includes, within the funds
provided, not less than $3,405,000 for the endowment program.
Howard University Hospital.—Within the funds provided, the
Committee includes $27,325,000 for Howard University Hospital.
The hospital provides inpatient and outpatient care, as well as
training in the health professions. It also serves as a major acute
and ambulatory care center for the District of Columbia and func-
tions as a major teaching facility attached to the university. The
Federal appropriation provides partial funding for the hospital’s op-
erations. The Committee notes the reduction of $50,000,000 for the
hospital reflects the fulfillment of the planned Federal contribution
in fiscal year 2025 to support construction of the new hospital.
COLLEGE HOUSING AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES LOANS PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $298,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 298,000
The Committee provides $298,000 for Federal administration of
the CHAFL, College Housing Loans, and Higher Education Facili-
ties Loans programs. Prior to fiscal year 1994, these programs pro-
vided financing for the construction, reconstruction, and renovation
of housing, academic, and other educational facilities. While no new
loans have been awarded since fiscal year 1993, costs for admin-
istering the outstanding loans will continue through 2030. These
funds will be used to reimburse the Department for administrative
expenses incurred in managing the existing loan portfolio.
312
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING
PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $20,678,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 20,678,000
The Committee provides $20,678,000 for the HBCU Capital Fi-
nancing Program. The HBCU Capital Financing Program makes
capital available to HBCUs for construction, renovation, and repair
of academic facilities by providing a Federal guarantee for private
sector construction bonds. Construction loans will be made from
the proceeds of the sale of the bonds.
The Committee includes $20,150,000 for loan subsidy costs in
guaranteed loan authority under this program. This will support
an estimated $500,000,000 in new loan volume in fiscal year 2026.
In addition, the Committee includes $528,000 for administrative
expenses.
INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $793,106,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 793,106,000
The Committee provides $793,106,000 for the Institute of Edu-
cation Sciences [IES]. This amount includes $73,500,000 for admin-
istrative expenses and centralized support costs for IES. The bill
also includes a rescission of $25,000,000 in previously appropriated
funds for program administration.
This account supports education research, development, dissemi-
nation, utilization and evaluation; data collection and analysis ac-
tivities; the assessment of student progress; and administrative ex-
penses related to such activities. Funds provided to IES are avail-
able for obligation for 2 fiscal years.
Under the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 [ESRA], Con-
gress established IES to provide national leadership in expanding
fundamental knowledge and understanding of education from early
childhood through postsecondary study. ESRA requires IES, in car-
rying out its mission, ‘‘to compile statistics, develop products, and
conduct research, evaluations, and wide dissemination activities in
areas of demonstrated national need and ensure that such activi-
ties conform to high standards of quality, integrity, and accuracy
and are objective, secular, neutral, and nonideological and are free
of partisan political influence’’ and it is the Committee’s expecta-
tion that IES will meet those statutory duties and obligations this
year and have plans in place to continue doing so in the future.
Program Administration.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $73,500,000 for administrative expenses and centralized
support costs. Section 310 of this act ensures sufficient funding for
centralized support costs is available and properly charged to this
appropriation. The Committee directs the Department, IES, and
NCES to work together to provide in the fiscal year 2027 and fu-
ture CJs, as well as the fiscal year 2026 operating plan, the
amount for NCES administrative expenses supported by this pro-
gram administration appropriation necessary to meet statutory du-
ties and obligations.
Administrative and Staffing Plan.—Not later than 30 days after
enactment of this act and each quarter thereafter, the Committee
313
directs the IES Director and NCES Commissioner to submit admin-
istrative and staffing plans for their respective centers outlining
staffing ceilings by national center, the factors considered in allo-
cating staffing ceilings by national center, actual FTE by national
center, and an explanation by national center for FTE changes
from the preceding quarter. Additionally, the Committee directs
the IES Director and NCES Commissioner (with Department and
NAGB input as necessary) to describe the planned use of resources
and FTEs to meet all statutory deadlines and requirements of
ESRA related to education statistics, data collections, research,
evaluations, assessments, surveys, and reports.
Cybersecurity and other Requirements.—The Committee notes the
importance of IES’s statutorily-required activities related to cyber-
security, privacy, accuracy, and confidentiality. The Committee di-
rects the required administrative and staffing plan to include a de-
scription of implemented actions and a plan and associated
timeline for future actions needed to comply with applicable re-
quirements.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DISSEMINATION
The Committee provides $245,000,000 for education research, de-
velopment, evaluation, and national dissemination activities. These
funds support activities that are aimed at expanding fundamental
knowledge of education and promoting the use of research and de-
velopment findings in the design of efforts to improve education
outcomes for students.
Accelerate, Transform, and Scale Initiative.—The Committee sup-
ports steps IES has taken to use funds for creating scalable, high
impact solutions to improve education outcomes for all learners and
eliminate persistent achievement and attainment gaps, including
through pilot efforts modeled on Federal advanced research
projects agencies. This includes the updated Transformative Re-
search in the Education Sciences program, which is supporting
partnerships between researchers, industry professionals, and edu-
cation agencies to propose transformative solutions to intractable
education problems leveraging advances in technology combined
with research insights from the learning sciences. The Committee
requests quarterly updates on progress on the initiative including
the Seedlings to Scale program.
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Lit-
eracy Study.—Recent NAEP and Program for the International As-
sessment of Adult Competencies scores show a troubling decline in
literacy achievement for public school students and adult learners.
The Committee shares the Administration’s stated priority to im-
prove literacy outcomes and includes $1,500,000 for the Director to
enter into an agreement with the NASEM to conduct a study of lit-
eracy attainment across the life-course, which shall include an
analysis of factors that contribute to the current state of literacy
attainment in the U.S., what is known about how to improve lit-
eracy attainment across the life-course, and implications for the
well-being of individuals, communities, as well as national security
and global competitiveness. The report shall include recommenda-
tions for Federal, state, and local policy and practice that take the
varied landscape of how Americans develop literacy into account
314
and how best to maintain literacy attainment, including for English
learners and students with disabilities.
STATISTICS
The Committee provides $121,500,000 for data gathering and
statistical analysis activities at the National Center for Education
Statistics [NCES].
NCES is headed by a Commissioner appointed by the President
and has statutory authority without supervision or approval of the
Director for carrying out the work of NCES. The Commissioner
also serves as the Department’s Chief Statistical Officer under the
Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018. NCES
collects data on educational institutions at all levels, longitudinal
data on student progress, and data relevant to public policy. NCES
also provides technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, and postsec-
ondary institutions. Activities are carried out directly and through
grants and contracts.
Information on College Admissions.—The Committee is aware of
the lack of data available demonstrating how legacy status, or rela-
tionship to alumni of the institution, factors in first-time, first-year,
degree-seeking admissions decisions. Starting with the 2022–2023
IPEDS admission surveys, NCES began to ask if IHEs consider leg-
acy status. The Committee appreciates that NCES will continue to
ask if IHEs consider legacy status in the IPEDS Admissions sur-
vey. The Committee encourages NCES to consider collecting data
on applications, admission, and enrollments by applicants with leg-
acy status at institutions eligible to participate in Title IV pro-
grams under the HEA and those IHEs that also provide legacy
preferences according to their IPEDS response.
National Postsecondary Student Aid Study [NPSAS].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the critical role NCES is statutorily required to
undertake through the administration of NPSAS and the impor-
tance of the postsecondary information NPSAS provides to re-
searchers, policymakers, and the public. The Committee believes
that NPSAS plays a vital role in postsecondary empirical research
and analysis and directs NCES to maintain the study’s current col-
lection frequency of every 4 years and, to the extent practicable, to
continue the administrative-only collection, as was done for
NPSAS:18–AC, in the 2 years in between the full collection. NCES
is directed to brief the Committees not later than 60 days after en-
actment of this act on how they intend to come into compliance
with this directive.
Privacy.—The Committee notes the importance of maintaining
privacy when collecting data for statistical purposes. The Com-
mittee supports the statutory requirements in ESRA regarding the
collection, dissemination, and handling of data to ensure confiden-
tiality and prevent unauthorized disclosure. The Committee is also
aware that Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Effi-
ciency Act is no longer among the privacy assurances that NCES
is following when collecting data. Not later than 30 days after en-
actment, NCES is directed to brief the Committees on how the De-
partment will continue to assure privacy is maintained when col-
lecting data.
315
School Pulse Panel.—The Committee appreciates the timely in-
formation made available through the School Pulse Panel survey
initiated during President Trump’s first term. Prior to its develop-
ment, the Department did not have basic information about the
status of school operations, staffing vacancies, access to school
based mental health services, and other useful information for pol-
icy makers and the public to understand about the nearly real-time
operation of our Nation’s schools. The Committee requests a brief-
ing within 180 days of enactment on steps NCES could take to
make timely information once again available.
REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL LABORATORIES
The Committee provides $53,733,000 to continue support for the
Regional Educational Laboratories [REL] program.
The laboratories are responsible for promoting the effective use
and development of knowledge and evidence in broad-based sys-
temic strategies to increase student learning and well-being and
further school improvement efforts. The Committee urges IES to
continue its efforts to strengthen the connections between practi-
tioners and the research community, so that federally supported re-
search is timely, relevant, and responsive to the needs of the field,
helps build capacity of LEAs and SEAs to effectively integrate evi-
dence use in decision-making and is effectively utilized in education
policy and practice.
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
The Committee provides $64,255,000 for research and innovation
in special education conducted by the National Center for Special
Education Research [NCSER].
The Center addresses gaps in scientific knowledge to improve
policies and practices in special education and early intervention
services and outcomes for infants, toddlers, and children with dis-
abilities. The Committee directs NCSER to continue to fund longi-
tudinal studies and other research initiatives to support States in
recruiting and training special and general educators and special-
ized support personnel so that students with disabilities can access
universally designed and inclusive classrooms designed to provide
accessible instruction, curricula, materials, and assistive tech-
nology, and receive specialized services and supports consistent
with the IDEA.
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDIES AND EVALUATIONS
The Committee provides $13,318,000 for special education stud-
ies and evaluations.
This program supports competitive grants, contracts, and cooper-
ative agreements to assess the implementation of IDEA. Funds are
also used to evaluate the effectiveness of State and local efforts to
deliver special education services and early intervention programs.
STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEMS
The Committee provides includes $28,500,000 for the Statewide
Data Systems program.
316
This program supports competitive grants to SEAs to support the
development, maintenance, and expansion of State longitudinal
data systems. Support for these systems will further strengthen
State data infrastructure and linkages; contribute to improved data
access, and use for evidence-based policymaking; and build capacity
in States to secure and protect data. Early childhood, postsec-
ondary, and workforce information systems may be linked to such
systems or developed with program funds. The bill also continues
to allow up to $6,000,000 to be used for awards to improve data
coordination, quality, and use, including support for the Privacy
Technical Assistance Center that serves as a resource on privacy
issues for SEAs and LEAs, the postsecondary education commu-
nity, and others engaged in building and using education data sys-
tems.
ASSESSMENT
The Committee provides $193,300,000 to provide support for the
National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], a congres-
sionally mandated assessment created to measure and report the
educational achievement of American students in a range of sub-
jects and analyze trends over time.
Within the funds appropriated, the Committee recommends
$8,300,000 for the National Assessment Governing Board [NAGB],
which is responsible for formulating policy for NAEP.
The Committee recommendation continues support of
$10,000,000 for research and development investments activities to
modernize and innovate assessments while reducing future pro-
gram costs. NAGB and NCES should continue to consult with the
authorizing and appropriations committees of Congress as it con-
siders strategies, including those identified by NASEM, in achiev-
ing cost efficiencies in and upgrades of its assessment program.
Further, the Committee requests that the fiscal year 2027 CJ and
fiscal year 2026 administrative and staffing plan describe imple-
mented and planned strategies for cost efficiencies and necessary
research and development projects.
Assessment Schedule.—The Committee notes the new voluntary
assessment schedule for NAEP approved by the NAGB on April 21,

Section 76:
2025. The Committee requests regular updates on NCES’s progress
in implementing the new schedule.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $419,907,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 379,907,000
The Committee provides $379,907,000 for program administra-
tion. Funds support personnel compensation and benefits, travel,
rent, communications, utilities, printing, equipment and supplies,
automated data processing, and other services required to award,
administer, and monitor Federal education programs. Support for
program evaluation and studies and advisory councils is also pro-
vided under this account.
Accreditation.—Congress, under section 496(a)(4)(A) of the HEA,
requires that accreditors respect the stated mission, including reli-
317
gious missions, of institutions of higher education. The Committee
requests, within 180 days of enactment, a report describing the
steps accreditors currently take to comply with section 496(a)(4)(A)
and how such current practices could be improved. The report
should also include any recommendations the Department or Con-
gress could take to improve oversight of accreditors’ compliance
with section 496(a)(4)(A).
Campus Antisemitism.—The Committee is deeply concerned with
continued reports of increased discrimination and harassment on
college campuses, including incidences of antisemitic discrimination
and harassment. The Committee encourages the Department to
continue to offer guidance to institutions of higher education for
the development of campus policies to combat religiously-based dis-
crimination, harassment, and other incidents. The Committee also
encourages the Department to offer guidance to institutions of
higher education to encourage the prompt reporting of instances in
which a member of the University community violates the institu-
tion’s policies regarding discrimination and harassment, any dis-
ciplinary actions taken by the institution in response to such viola-
tions, and how the reporting of such violations and disciplinary ac-
tions is conducted in a manner that complies with all applicable
privacy laws and policies.
Citizenship and Civics Postsecondary Education.—The Com-
mittee is concerned by recent surveys indicating that more than 70
percent of Americans lack a basic understanding of the structure
of government and rights and responsibilities of citizens in our de-
mocracy. As an educated citizenry is critical to our system of de-
mocracy, the Committee urges the Department to support institu-
tions of higher education in their efforts to increase student knowl-
edge of, and service to, American civil society.
College Costs.—The Committee is concerned by the increase in
college costs over the past 20 years and how those increases have
contributed to growing student loan debt. The Committee notes
that the Department annually publishes the College Affordability
and Transparency List as required by the HEA. The College Afford-
ability and Transparency List provides valuable information for
students and families on the most and least expensive IHEs by
both published tuition and net price. The Committee directs the
Department to ensure that this important resource is prominently
displayed on the Department’s website, including on the College
Scorecard website. The Committee encourages the Department to
use recently reported data from institutions of higher education to
develop detailed estimates of net prices by program for students of
different income levels, and to incorporate those measures on the
College Affordability and Transparency List and the College Score-
card. The Committee also encourages the Department to note on
the College Scorecard profile of any IHE, such IHE’s inclusion on
the College Affordability and Transparency List, if applicable.
Competitive Grant Priorities for Rural Areas.—The Committee
continues to encourage the Department to continue efforts to en-
sure competitive grants are reaching rural areas so that support
and solutions developed with Federal funding are relevant to and
available in such areas.
318
Comprehensive Literacy Resources.—The Committee believes it is
important for all educators to be prepared to provide high-quality
comprehensive literacy instruction for students. Free online com-
prehensive literacy resources with a specific focus on children in
kindergarten through sixth grade that are evidence-based and
build upon existing programs that leverage public partnerships and
multidisciplinary tools could assist educators with being more pre-
pared to provide such instruction.
EDFacts.—The Department’s EDFacts system centralizes per-
formance data supplied by SEAs with other data, which enables
the use of performance data to inform decisionmaking and re-
search. This system includes State-reported information from re-
quired assessments that is reported in a standard format, allowing
researchers to measure school improvement that is comparable for
all schools and LEAs. The Committee encourages the Department
to reinstate the more detailed reporting on assessments, which was
in effect through 2019, to allow SEAs, LEAs and schools to monitor
their performance against similar entities and continue to act to
improve their results.
Education Research Data Access.—The Committee directs the
Department to respond to all properly filed requests for education
research data access-restricted or otherwise-within a reasonable
timeline. The Committee requests a report not later than 30 days
after the end of the fiscal year on the number of properly filed re-
quests, the number of data access requests granted, and the aver-
age time for processing such requests.
Educator Reporting.—The Committee commends the Depart-
ment’s work to support implementation of and enforce the require-
ments in section 1111(g)(1)(B) of the ESEA. The Committee directs
continued efforts by the Department to work with each State to
publicly report in an accessible manner not less than every 2 years
progress made to ensure low-income and minority children enrolled
in public schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffec-
tive, out-of-field, or inexperienced teachers. The Committee re-
quests a briefing not later than 60 days after enactment of this act
on the Department’s planned support and monitoring efforts and
corrective actions and recommendations implemented by States.
Evidence-Based Grant Making.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to use demonstrated evidence of effectiveness as part of
the selection criteria through its Education Department General
Administrative Regulations, consistent with authorizations, for all
competitive grant programs. Further, non-competitive formula
grant funds have a range of evidence requirements and preferences
and the Committee directs the Department to support entities re-
ceiving funding through those programs through enhancements to
its technical assistance and support activities.
Foreign Influence.—Under section 117 of the HEA, institutions of
higher education receiving Federal financial assistance are re-
quired to disclose gifts from, or contracts with, foreign sources if
the value is $250,000 or more. They must also disclose ownership
or control by a foreign source. The Committee strongly urges the
Department to work with IHEs to ensure they are fully complying
with this statutory requirement. The Department shall report to
the Committee on any steps that it has taken to address undue for-
319
eign influence within IHEs and K–12 schools and any actions that
it has taken to ensure IHEs are fully complying with section 117
of the HEA. The Department shall also report to the Committee on
the presence and influence of Confucius Institutes and Confucius
Classrooms and their successor programs as well as the amount of
Federal funding for foreign language studies that IHEs with a Con-
fucius Institute or a successor program have received in the last
decade and whether such Federal funding was utilized by the Con-
fucius Institute or successor program.
Foundation for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.—The Com-
mittee continues to believe that the execution of the Foundations
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act will enhance the evidence-
building capacity of Federal agencies, strengthen privacy protec-
tions, improve secure access to data, and provide more and higher
quality evidence to policymakers. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Department to continue to include in the fiscal year 2027 and
future CJs updates on the implementation and planned implemen-
tation of such act for the current and future budget years.
Grant Payment Conditions.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to provide the Committees with notification 3 days prior to
putting more than a quarter of the all grantees in individual pro-
grams on route payment or instituting any other grant payment
condition to more than a quarter of all grantees in any individual
program. The Committee further directs the Department to provide
quarterly reports to the Committees on the number of grantees on
grant payment conditions by program, disaggregated by grant pay-
ment condition type. Such report shall also detail how long the
grantees have been on route payment status and the reasons for
placement in such status.
High-Quality Tutoring/Title I Evidence-Based Interventions.—
The Committee notes that research shows that using high-quality,
evidence-based tutoring programs with evidence of effectiveness, as
defined in the 2015 reauthorization of the ESEA, can significantly
improve achievement levels in reading and math. These proven
systems include three to five sessions a week, integrated as part
of the school day, delivered by a human tutor in person or virtually
to a group of one to not more than four students at a time; and
use a well-structured process, high-quality materials designed for
tutoring during the school day, ongoing professional development
and coaching for tutors, and assessment tools to benchmark stu-
dent achievement. Proven tutoring models can bring struggling stu-
dents up to the achievement level of their peers. The Committee
encourages the Department to promote and provide technical as-
sistance to LEAs and support partnerships between LEAs and edu-
cation-related community-based organizations to implement evi-
dence-based tutoring models.
Information Collection Activities.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of trusted, transparent, timely, disaggregated, and com-
parable data on how schools and districts are meeting the needs of
the students they serve and directs the Secretary to ensure that
the Department is fulfilling its responsibilities as required by law.
Legacy and Donor-Affiliated Admissions Practices.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to work with accrediting agen-
cies to assess whether accreditors consider preferences given to ap-
320
plicants based on alumni or donor affiliation in their review of in-
stitutional admissions policies, and to provide recommendations on
how these practices could be addressed through existing accredita-
tion standards.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund.—As part of the annual CJ, the De-
partment is directed to include the anticipated balances available
for transfer into and uses of the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund
[NEF] for the current and budget fiscal years. Additionally, the De-
partment is directed to provide the Committees quarterly reports
for all ongoing projects. The report shall include the following for
each project: a description and timeline for each project; the date
the project was notified to the Committees; total obligations to
date; obligations for the prior fiscal year; anticipated obligations for
current fiscal year; any expected future obligations; and the total
unobligated balance in the Fund. In addition, the Department is re-
quired to provide biannual reports on expired balances that are eli-
gible for transfer to the NEF. Such report shall include the Treas-
ury Account Fund Symbol, program name, unobligated balance,
and unexpended balance. Such report shall be transmitted 30 days
after the close of the second quarter and within 45 days after the
close of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
Pooled Evaluation Authority.—The Committee requests that the
Department provide a report to the Committee on the planned use
of pooled evaluation funds under section 8601 of the ESEA, con-
sistent with the required plan under such section, not later than
15 days prior to any transfer of funds. The Committee also directs
the Department to provide a report to the Committee on the
planned use of pooled evaluation funds under section 309 of this
act not later than 15 days prior to any transfer of funds.
Post-Secondary Transfer Articulation Agreements.—Transfer ar-
ticulation agreements between community colleges and 4-year
IHEs can play an important role in promoting access, affordability,
and completion in higher education. The Committee encourages the
Department to gather input from States that have implemented
comprehensive statewide programs to determine best practices for
implementation, enhancement, or scaling-up of agreements. The
Department should also seek input from States that do not have
comprehensive statewide programs to identify barriers to scaling-
up agreements. This information should be disseminated to States
by the Department with the goal of further enhancing or imple-
menting statewide transfer articulation agreements.
Program Priorities and Requirements.—The Committee notes
that authorizing laws contain program priorities and requirements
across a range of formula and competitive grant programs. The
Committee expects the Department to adhere to those priorities
and requirements when developing and issuing notices inviting ap-
plications and program guidance and administering multi-year
grants.
Protecting Personally-Identifiable Information.—The Committee
continues to direct the Department to ensure that its employees,
contractors, and grantees, including States that receive funds from
Statewide Longitudinal Data System grants, adhere to the strictest
and highest standards for protecting personally identifiable infor-
mation.
321
Reports to Congress.—The Department is directed to provide 5
business days’ notice to the Committee before release of any con-
gressionally directed report.
Responsiveness to GAO.—The Committee notes that there have
been prior engagements where the Department unnecessarily de-
layed in providing GAO with timely and complete information in
response to GAO requests. The Committee directs the Department
to provide timely and complete information to GAO on its engage-
ments within timeframes as GAO may specify. The Committee fur-
ther directs GAO to develop timeliness criteria to measure the De-
partment’s responsiveness to GAO requests for information. GAO
activities are crucial to Congressional oversight, and the develop-
ment of such criteria will assist GAO in the timely completion of
work. GAO should consult with the Department, as GAO deter-
mines appropriate, in developing such criteria.
Secondary Education Workforce Development Programs.—The
Committee supports State and local efforts to improve the align-
ment of workforce development efforts with secondary education,
including supporting expanded industry-recognized skills instruc-
tion, training, and other work-based learning opportunities to ad-
dress workforce development needs in in-demand industries and ca-
reer pathways leading to quality jobs, specifically in fields with
high, unmet demand like maritime and advanced manufacturing.
The Committee encourages the Department to support efforts for
secondary schools to partner with institutions of higher education,
business, workforce development organizations, and industry orga-
nizations seeking to develop education programs designed to lead
to or prepare individuals for high-demand careers in maritime and
advanced manufacturing.
Staffing Report.—Not later than 30 days after enactment, the
Department is directed to provide the Committee with a staffing
report identifying the total FTE and non-personnel allocations sup-
ported by the student aid administration, office for civil rights, and
office inspector general appropriations, and the FTE and non-per-
sonnel allocations for each program office supported by the pro-
gram administration appropriation provided by this act. In addi-
tion, the Department shall provide on a monthly basis the number
of on-board staff, attrition, approved hires not yet on-boarded and
projected full-year FTE usage, including approved hires, and actual
non-personnel expenses, for each program office supported by, and
in total for, the each of the student aid administration, program ad-
ministration, office for civil rights, and office inspector general ap-
propriations provided in this act. The monthly reports should be
detailed by competitive (including career SES) and excepted (in-
cluding noncareer and limited term SES) service staff. The Depart-
ment shall also provide the Committee on a biannual basis an excel
file which includes the names, titles, grades, program office, and
date of hire of all of the political appointees that were employed by
the Department during the previous 180 days.
OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 140,000,000
322
The Committee provides $140,000,000 for the Office for Civil
Rights [OCR]. OCR is responsible for the enforcement of laws that
prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin,
sex, disability, and age in all programs and institutions that re-
ceive financial assistance from the Department. To carry out this
responsibility, OCR investigates and resolves discrimination com-
plaints, supports civil rights data collection, monitors desegregation
and equal educational opportunity plans, reviews possible discrimi-
natory practices by recipients of Federal education funds, and pro-
vides technical assistance to recipients of funds to help them meet
these civil rights requirements.
The Committee notes the importance of OCR in enforcing Fed-
eral civil rights laws and directs the Department to continue to
post a list of all open investigations and case resolution documents.
The Committee also requests that OCR provide the Committee
with quarterly reports on the average case processing timelines for
each category of directed investigations and compliance reviews
and the number and type of complaints dismissed, opened for in-
vestigation, closed, or resolved.
Combatting Antisemitism.—The Committee is concerned by re-
ports of increased discrimination, including antisemitic harass-
ment, in our Nation’s education system. The Committee directs
OCR to ensure timely processing of all current and incoming
shared ancestry complaints and directed investigations, including
those relating to antisemitism. The Committee further directs the
Department to provide the Committees with quarterly reports on
the status of OCR shared ancestry investigations, including those
related to antisemitism, and an initial report no later than 30 days
after enactment of this act. Such reports should include a brief
overview, including timeline, status of the investigation, and any
actions taken by OCR.

TITLE IV
RELATED AGENCIES
COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR
SEVERELY DISABLED
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,124,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,124,000
The Committee provides $13,124,000 for the Committee for Pur-
chase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled [Commis-
sion], of which no less than $3,150,000 shall be made available for
the Office of Inspector General.
The Commission provides employment opportunities to approxi-
mately 40,000 Americans who are blind or severely disabled each
year. The primary purpose of this program is to increase the em-
ployment opportunities for people who are blind or have other se-
vere disabilities and, whenever possible, to prepare them to engage
in competitive employment. Encompassing nearly $4,000,000,000 in
products and services procured, it is the Federal Government’s
largest employment program for the severely disabled.
Reports.—Consistent with the explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328, the Committee directs the Commis-
sion to submit in an electronic format quarterly reports on CNA
Fees and CNA Expenditures, due no later than 60 days after the
end of the fiscal quarter, to the Committees on Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform and Education and the Workforce of the House of
Representatives, Committees on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the
Senate, and Committees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.
CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE
The Corporation for National and Community Service [CNCS]
was established to enhance opportunities for national and commu-
nity service. CNCS administers programs authorized under the Do-
mestic Volunteer Service Act (Public Law 93–113), the National
and Community Service Trust Act (Public Law 103–82), and the
SERVE America Act (Public Law 111–13). Grants are awarded to
States, public and private nonprofit organizations, and other enti-
ties to create service opportunities for students, out-of-school youth,
adults, and seniors.
The Committee provides CNCS a total program level of
$1,252,806,000.
Staffing Report.—Not later than 30 days after enactment, CNCS
is directed to provide the Committee an operating plan identifying
(324)
325
the total FTE, contract support, and non-personnel allocations sup-
ported by each appropriations account, including operating ex-
penses, salaries and expenses, and office of inspector general for
each agency department and office supported by each of these ap-
propriations provided by this act. In addition, CNCS shall provide
on a monthly basis the number of on-board staff, including FTEs
and contractors, attrition, approved hires not yet on-boarded and
projected full-year FTE usage, including approved hires, and actual
non-personnel expenses, for each agency department and office sup-
ported by, and in total for each appropriations account, including
operating expenses, salaries and expenses, and office of inspector
general, provided in this act. The monthly reports should be de-
tailed by service type (including excepted or appointment) and ap-
pointment type (including permanent, term, temporary, and career
SES) for all agency staff. The Department shall also provide the
Committee on a biannual basis an excel file which includes the
names, titles, pay bands, agency department or office, and date of
hire of all of the employees in a position in the excepted service
employed by the Department during the previous 180 days.
Timely Notice of Awards.—Historically, CNCS has posted notices
of funding opportunities early in the year to give grantees time to
submit high quality applications and effectively plan for the use of
grant funds. The Committee directs CNCS to ensure funding oppor-
tunity announcements for competitive grant programs funded in
this act are published no later than January 1, 2026 and directs
CNCS to make every effort to award funds for competitive grant
programs funded under this Act no less than 60 days prior to the
expiration of their period of availability. Additionally, the Com-
mittee directs CNCS to award renewal and non-competing continu-
ations prior to the end of the period of performance, except in the
case of a grant or award where there has been a finding of finan-
cial mismanagement, research fraud, or malfeasance. Finally, the
Committee notes the inclusion of report language directing CNCS
to provide a report to the Committees listing all grants during the
previous month for which a scheduled non-competing continuation
or renewal award was not made within 14 days of the end of the
previous period of performance, including an explanation for the
delay.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $975,525,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 975,525,000
The Committee provides $975,525,000 for the operating expenses
of CNCS.
Volunteers in Service to America [VISTA]
The Committee provides $103,285,000 for VISTA. This program
provides capacity building for small, community-based organiza-
tions with a mission of combating poverty. VISTA members raise
resources, recruit and organize volunteers, and establish and ex-
pand programs in housing, employment, health, and economic de-
velopment activities.
326
National Senior Volunteer Corps
The Committee provides $236,917,000 for the National Senior
Volunteer Corps programs, a collection of programs that connect
Americans older than the age of 55 with opportunities to contribute
their job skills and expertise to community projects and organiza-
tions. These programs include the Retired Senior Volunteer Pro-
gram, the Foster Grandparent Program, and the Senior Companion
Program.
AmeriCorps State and National Grants
The Committee provides $635,323,000 for AmeriCorps State and
National Grants, which provide funds to local and national organi-
zations and agencies to address community needs in education,
public safety, health, and the environment. Each of these organiza-
tions and agencies, in turn, uses its AmeriCorps funding to recruit,
place, and supervise AmeriCorps members. AmeriCorps members
receive a modest living allowance and other benefits proportional
to their level of time commitment.
Alumni Engagement Activities.—The Committee notes significant
Congressional and stakeholder interest in those activities, includ-
ing strengthening identification with the AmeriCorps brand; ex-
panding education and workforce pipelines; soliciting feedback from
alumni on member experience; directory data sharing; and inter-
agency collaboration on national, public, and military service. The
Committee encourages CNCS to support these and other alumni
engagement activities.
Civic Bridge Building.—The Committee supports CNCS’ goal of
uniting Americans through national service and recognizes that
service is a proven model of civic bridge building. To advance these
shared goals, the Committee continues to encourage CNCS to con-
sider awarding grants, within existing competitions, to: (1) support
civic bridge building programs and projects to reduce polarization
and community divisions; and (2) provide training in civic bridge
building skills and techniques to CNCS members and host sites
and provide resources that can be publicly disseminated to support
local civic bridge building efforts, among other activities.
Collaboration on Outreach and Recruitment.—The Committee
commends collaboration among the Department of Defense, CNCS,
the Selective Service System, Peace Corps, and the Office of Per-
sonnel Management on raising public awareness about military
and national service opportunities. The Committee directs these
agencies to continue exploring mutually beneficial ways to promote
each agency’s service opportunities, including sharing market re-
search, providing ineligible or non-selected applicants with infor-
mation about other forms of service, piloting joint recruitment ef-
forts, and providing information to individuals transitioning out of
military and national service about other opportunities to serve.
The Committee requests a briefing from CNCS no later than 60
days after enactment that provides an update on these collabora-
tion efforts.
Commission Investment Fund [CIF].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2024 level for
the CIF, which provides funds to State commissions for training
and technical assistance activities to expand the capacity of current
327
and potential AmeriCorps programs, particularly in underserved
areas.
Fixed Price Grant Program.—The Committee believes the fixed
amount AmeriCorps State and National grant is a flexible, useful
grant vehicle that helps minimize risk and lowers administrative
burden on grantees. Section 129(l) of the National and Community
Service Act of 1990, as amended by Public Law 111–13, provides
the agency with the authority to adopt other terms and conditions
based on the risks associated with the Fixed Price grant program.
The Committee directs CNCS to review the risks associated with
the current drawdown formula that only allows recipients to incre-
mentally receive awarded grant funds as service hours are recorded
by enrolled members. The Committee notes that this formula may
not always account for the many start-of-service program costs and
the expenses grantees incur, regardless of whether a member
serves a full term. The Committee urges CNCS to modify the draw-
down formula to cover allowable grant expenses that occur at the
start of year and to minimize the impact that under-enrollment, at-
trition, and service hour disruptions can have on grantee oper-
ations. CNCS should report to the Committees, in the fiscal year
2027 CJ, on the modifications CNCS will make and if any congres-
sional action is required to authorize or help implement the
changes.
Flexibility for Programs.—The Committee notes it provided
CNCS with the authority to fund certain member service positions
under 1,700 hours to help provide flexibility for programs to con-
tinue to operate and best meet the needs of their local commu-
nities.
National Civilian Community Corps [NCCC]
The Committee provides $37,735,000 for NCCC, a full-time,
team-based residential program for men and women ages 18 to 24.
Members are assigned to one of five campuses for a 10-month serv-
ice commitment.
Innovation, Demonstration, and Assistance Activities
The Committee provides $14,706,000 for innovation, demonstra-
tion, and assistance activities.

cludes $8,558,000 for the Volunteer Generation Fund authorized
under section 198P of the SERVE America Act (Public Law 111–
13).
National Days of Service.—The Committee provides $6,148,000
for National Days of Service including the September 11th Na-
tional Day of Service and Remembrance and the Martin Luther
King, Jr. National Day of Service. CNCS may give priority to mak-
ing grants, entering into Cooperative Agreements, or providing
other forms of support to eligible organizations with expertise in:
representing families of victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks and other impacted constituencies; promoting the establish-
ment of September 11 as an annually recognized National Day of
Service and Remembrance; and organizing volunteers to engage in
service to meet community needs and advance the life and teach-
ings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
328
Service Learning.—The Committee encourages CNCS to continue
to be a convener of the important work surrounding service learn-
ing, including programs in public schools and institutions of higher
education.
Evaluation
The Committee provides $6,250,000 for CNCS evaluation activi-
ties.
Effective Interventions.—The Committee is aware of CNCS initia-
tives to help service providers apply scientific evaluation methods
to better understand interventions and encourages CNCS to con-
tinue its use of randomized control trials to build causal evidence
for effective interventions.
State Commission Grants
The Committee recommendation provides $19,538,000 for State
Commission Grants.

ment of CNCS programs and activities. The Committee notes the
inclusion of bill language to support staffing levels necessary to
carry out CNCS’ statutory responsibilities.

$2,000,000 within the amount provided for administration, to con-
tinue work on information literacy, including the continuation and
expansion of the Information Literacy Taskforce in accordance with

gagement through local community collaboration by facilitating
partnerships with local museums. The Committee encourages the
Office of Museum Services to support efforts of state 250th commis-
sions through existing programs, such as Museums for All or Na-
tional Leadership Grants. Such efforts will preserve and share
American history at this once-in-a-generation moment resulting in

amount of funds in the railroad retirement and railroad unemploy-
ment insurance trust funds that may be used by the Board for ad-
ministrative expenses.
The Committee continues to request annual updates on the
project status, including timelines to completion, total anticipated
cost of development, funding obligations, and contracts for RRB’s

the Old Age and Survivors Insurance [OASI] and Disability Insur-
ance [DI] trust funds for special payments to certain uninsured
persons, costs incurred administering pension reform activities, and
the value of the interest for benefit checks issued but not nego-
334

nancial position they would have been in had they not borne these
costs and they were properly charged to general revenues.

for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. In addition, the Committee
provides $23,500,000,000 in advance funding for the first quarter

$66,762,000,000 for Federal benefit payments.
Beneficiary Services
The Committee provides $75,000,000 in new mandatory budget
authority for beneficiary services.

achieve and sustain productive, self-supporting work activity.
Funds also support the Ticket to Work program that provides SSI
recipients with a ticket to offer employment networks [ENs], in-
cluding VR agencies, in exchange for employment and support serv-
ices. Instead of reimbursing ENs for specific services, the Ticket to
Work program pays ENs based on recipients achieving certain
milestones and outcomes.
Research and Demonstration

search and demonstration projects conducted under sections 1110,
1115, and 1144 of the Social Security Act (Public Law 74–271), as
amended. These funds support a variety of research and dem-
onstration projects designed to improve the disability process, pro-
mote self-sufficiency and assist individuals in returning to work,
encourage savings and retirement planning through financial lit-
eracy, and generally provide analytical and data resources for use
in preparing and reviewing policy proposals.
Administrative Expenses
The Committee provides $4,619,965,000 for SSI program admin-
istrative expenses. This appropriation funds the SSI program’s
share of administrative expenses incurred through the Limitation

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,297,978,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,891,978,000
335
This account provides resources for SSA to administer the OASI,
DI, and SSI programs, and to support CMS in administering the
Medicare program. The LAE account is funded by the Social Secu-
rity and Medicare trust funds for their share of administrative ex-
penses, the general fund for the SSI program’s share of administra-
tive expenses, and applicable user fees. These funds support core
administrative activities including processing retirement and dis-
ability claims, conducting hearings to review disability determina-
tion appeals, issuing Social Security numbers and cards, processing
individuals’ annual earnings information, and ensuring the integ-
rity of Social Security programs through continuing disability re-
views [CDR] and SSI redeterminations of non-medical eligibility.
The Committee provides $2,397,000,000 for program integrity ac-
tivities, including CDRs, SSI redeterminations of non-medical eligi-
bility, and Cooperative Disability Investigations units. This in-
cludes $273,000,000 in base funding and $2,124,000,000 in budget
adjustment funding.
The Committee also provides up to $171,000,000 for administra-
tive activities funded from user fees. This includes up to
$170,000,000 in fees collected from States that request SSA to ad-
minister State SSI supplementary payments and up to $1,000,000
from fees collected from non-attorney claimant representatives.
The Committee also provides not less than $2,700,000 for the So-
cial Security Advisory Board. This board advises the Commissioner
of Social Security and makes recommendations to Congress and the
President on policies relating to the OASI, DI, and SSI programs.
Beneficiary Information on Claims Timing.—The Committee is
concerned many retiring beneficiaries make their claiming decision
without a full understanding of the financial implications of benefit
reductions for early retirement or delayed retirement credits. The
Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ describing
SSA’s protocols, operating procedures, and informational materials
(including nomenclature) used to inform retiring beneficiaries of
how changes in their claiming date may affect their monthly ben-
efit after claiming. Such report shall also include changes to such
protocols, procedures, materials, and nomenclature SSA has consid-
ered using to help beneficiaries make more informed decisions re-
garding the timing of their retirement claim and improve the
public’s understanding of the effect of different claiming strategies.
Codebase Modernization.—The Committee supports efforts to up-
date SSA’s codebase from the COBOL programming language,
which would provide better access to beneficiary data, expedite
claim processing, reduce need for manual data entry, and lower the
number of improper payments. The Committee directs the SSA,
within 180 days of issuance of this report, to submit to the Com-
mittees a report on SSA’s progress on the secure migration of the
codebase to a modern programming language.
Communications to my Social Security Account Holders.—The
Committee directs SSA to ensure that its communications with the
public, particularly direct emails to my Social Security Account
holders, be nonpartisan and factual.
Cooperative Disability Investigations [CDI].—The Committee di-
rects SSA to provide an update in its fiscal year 2027 CJ on CDI
units, including updates on the program’s projected savings to
336
SSA’s disability programs, total recovery amounts, and projected
savings to other Federal and State programs. Such updates shall
also include suggestions regarding other ways Federal and State
agencies may partner on anti-fraud initiatives with respect to So-
cial Security programs.
Data Sharing and Systems Integration.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of improving access to accurate and timely in-
formation to support eligibility determinations and program integ-
rity across Federal and State-administered programs. The Com-
mittee encourages the Social Security Administration [SSA], in co-
ordination with the Department of Labor [DOL], to conduct a legal
review of the authority, requirements, and limitations governing
the sharing of relevant SSA- and DOL-held data with State agen-
cies and third-party entities. The Committee further encourages
SSA to evaluate opportunities for secure system integration or
automated data exchange solutions while protecting individual pri-
vacy and ensuring compliance with applicable law.
Digital Identify Authentication.—The Committee recognizes po-
tential efforts to adopt digital identity authentication technologies
to accompany Federal benefit verification practices. The Committee
requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment on SSAs efforts in
this area, including how it is addressing the digital literacy and ac-
cessibility needs of the populations it serves and how it is miti-
gating potential risks and ensuring data privacy.
IT Activities.—The Committee directs SSA to provide a report to
the Committee, within 90 days of enactment of this act, detailing
the number and amount of contracts, grants, and cooperative
agreements awarded for the purpose of maintaining, expanding,
modernizing, or enhancing its information technology capabilities
and infrastructure. Such report shall include, at a minimum, the
name of the contractor or grantee, the amount of funding, the con-
tract duration, the governmental purpose, and the programmatic
area(s) within SSA’s IT portfolio (as described on Table 3.24 of the
fiscal year 2026 CJ) the contract serves.
Service Delivery.—The Committee notes there are significant
service delivery challenges at SSA that are impacting critical serv-
ices that millions of Americans count on. The Committee directs
SSA to provide monthly briefings to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the steps
it is taking to address these issues, including but not limited to, de-
creasing disability claim processing times, ensuring prompt proc-
essing of retirement claims, addressing delays on SSA’s 1–800
number and in field offices, and general improvement to customer
experience when contacting SSA. The Committee directs SSA to
provide the Committees a monthly report of performance metrics
that measure SSA’s progress on addressing key service delivery
challenges. In addition, the Committee directs GAO to conduct a
review of service delivery challenges at SSA and SSA’s steps to ad-
dress them. Finally, the Committee directs SSA to ensure that
changes to internal policies, including changes to its Program Oper-
ations Manual System are deliberate and include public and stake-
holder input when appropriate. The Committee directs SSA to no-
tify the Committees in advance of any changes to its internal poli-
337
cies that could reasonably be expected to meaningfully impact the
public’s interactions with SSA.
Rural and Frontier Service Delivery.—The Committee is con-
cerned that senior citizens and Americans with disabilities in rural
and frontier areas of the Nation are unable to access in-person So-
cial Security services and that access by phone or videoconference
is limited. The Committee strongly urges SSA to evaluate its serv-
ice delivery options in rural and frontier areas and, when feasible,
implement expanded access to options that have been most effec-
tive for residents of these areas to ensure that SSA is able to pro-
vide timely assistance, whether in-person, by phone, or by video-
conference.
Staffing Plan.—The Committee notes the importance of ensuring
SSA has the necessary workforce to operate efficiently and provide
high-quality service to program beneficiaries. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $100,000,000 above the budget request in
order to help address workforce challenges. The Committee directs
SSA to provide a monthly report of staff on board by component as
of the beginning of fiscal year 2025, the beginning of fiscal year
2026, and for each month starting with the month after the date
of enactment of this act, including the number of staff on board by
field office.
Survivor Benefits Processing.—The Committee notes the impor-
tance of ensuring that timely, quality beneficiary services are ren-
dered to current and prospective recipients of survivors benefits.
The Committee emphasizes that, as with other types of Social Se-
curity benefits, the timing of claiming and associated services can
be critical for the livelihood of survivors, especially child bene-
ficiaries.
Ticket to Work Improvements.—The Committee recognizes that
the Ticket to Work program may be underutilized and can provide
important resources for individuals looking to return to work. The
Committee encourages SSA to work to identify ways to improve the
program’s effectiveness through existing and relevant statutory au-
thorities.
Vocational Guidelines.—The Committee is aware that implemen-
tation of the Occupational Information System [OIS] project, which
aims to bring the vocational list used in disability determinations
in line with current job opportunities, is ongoing. The Committee
notes that SSA has obligated and expended significant resources
and time on this project to-date. Therefore, the Committee directs
SSA, within 90 days of enactment of this act, to provide a briefing
to the Committees on Appropriations and Finance of the Senate
and the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means of the
House of Representatives regarding SSA’s status in making these
changes to occupational data, completed actions to-date, and
planned actions for this project over the coming fiscal year.
Work Incentives Planning and Assistance [WIPA] and Protection
and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security [PABSS].—The
Committee provides $23,000,000 for WIPA and $10,000,000 for
PABSS. These programs provide valuable services to help Social
Security disability beneficiaries return to work. The Committee
notes that delayed suitability determinations have in some cases
significantly affected the ability of PABSS grantees to carry out
338
their mission to protect the rights and best interests of individuals
with disabilities.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $114,665,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 114,665,000
The Committee provides $114,665,000 for SSA’s OIG. This in-
cludes $82,665,000 funded from the OASI and DI trust funds for
those programs’ share of OIG’s expenses and $32,000,000 funded
from general revenues for the SSI program’s share of expenses.
Combating Social Security Impersonation Scams.—The Com-
mittee continues to commend the work that SSA OIG has done to
combat Social Security impersonation scams. The Committee again
encourages SSA OIG to prioritize work with SSA to increase
awareness of this scam and to pursue the criminals perpetrating
this fraud.

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests). Following is a list of congressionally directed spending
items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this ex-
planatory statement, along with the name of each Senator who
submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item
so identified. Neither the Committee recommendation nor this re-
port contains any limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as
defined in rule XLIV.

COMMITTEE REPORT FOR DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR,
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND
RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 2026
SUMMARY OF BUDGET ESTIMATES AND COMMITTEE
RECOMMENDATIONS
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee recommends total budget au-
thority of $1,713,436,053,000 for the Departments of Labor, Health
and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. This
amount includes $196,974,000,000 in current year base discre-
tionary funding consistent with the subcommittee’s allocation. In
addition, the bill includes $3,104,000,000 in program integrity allo-
cation adjustments.
Fiscal year 2025 levels cited in this Committee Report reflect the
enacted amounts in Public Law 119–4, the Full-Year Continuing
Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, adjusted for com-
parability where noted.
BILL-WIDE DIRECTIVES
The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Re-
lated Agencies [Labor-HHS–Education] appropriations bill con-
stitutes the largest share of non-defense discretionary funding and
supports critical investments in a wide range of areas including
early learning, substance use and mental health, biomedical re-
search, public health and preparedness, elementary and secondary
education, higher education, workforce development, and social se-
curity, among many others.
This Committee Report provides additional direction and speci-
ficity on the uses of funds provided in this bill. During fiscal year
2026, for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Def-
icit Control Act of 1985, as amended, with respect to appropriations
contained in the accompanying bill, the terms ‘‘program, project,
and activity’’ [PPA] shall mean any item for which a dollar amount
is contained in appropriations acts (including joint resolutions pro-
viding continuing appropriations) or accompanying reports of the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, or accompanying
conference reports and joint explanatory statements of the com-
mittee of conference. The Committee expects agencies to submit
any reprogramming or transfer requests in compliance with re-
quirements of this act and to provide a thorough explanation of the
proposed reallocations, including a detailed justification of in-
creases and reductions. The Committee expects each agency to
manage the expenditures of its programs and activities to remain
within the amounts appropriated by Congress.
The Committee also continues the longstanding requirement that
each agency submit an operating plan to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after enact-
(7)

8
ment of this act, in order to establish the baseline for application
of reprogramming and transfer authorities provided in this act. The
operating plan should include at minimum funding for PPAs as
specified above.
The Committee continues to appreciate the close working rela-
tionship with the various budget offices of the agencies funded in
this bill. Maintaining these relationships is critical for the Com-
mittee to perform its duties in both developing these funding re-
quirements and recommendations and providing oversight over the
execution of funds.
Finally, each reference to the Committees or Committees on Ap-
propriations in this Committee Report, unless otherwise noted, is
to the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies and the
Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies.
Agency Performance Reports.—The Committee looks forward to
receiving the fiscal year 2025 Agency Performance Reports from
the Departments and agencies funded in this act. Not later than
45 days after enactment of this act, the Committee directs the De-
partments funded in this act and CNCS to provide a briefing on
their strategic plan goals for fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2026
and the actions the Departments and CNCS have taken or plan to
take to meet those goals, including through any planned workforce,
programmatic (including planned programmatic reviews), and orga-
nizational changes and how the Departments and CNCS deter-
mined those changes would improve direct services and grantee
oversight and support.
Consultation and Briefing Requirement.—The Committee directs
the Departments funded in this act and CNCS to consult with the
Committee on any actions expected to significantly increase or de-
crease current or future costs of programs they administer. In addi-
tion, the Committee directs the Departments funded in this act and
CNCS to consult with the Committee on any execution action re-
lated to any program or activity for which a directive is included
in this report not later than 4 weeks prior to a public announce-
ment related to such action. Further, the Committee directs the
Departments funded in this act and CNCS to brief the Committee
on any action covered by this consultation requirement, including
consideration and incorporation of feedback during such initial con-
sultation, not later than 1 week prior to a public announcement re-
lated to such action. This paragraph does not replace a more spe-
cific directive for a program or activity included in this report.
Final Spend Report.—The Committee directs the Departments
funded in this act and CNCS to submit a report to the Committees
at the conclusion of the fiscal year providing details on all entities
awarded funding, selection criteria used, and the funding amount
for each grant or contract awarded for each competitive grant pro-
gram funded under this act.
Grant Process.—The Departments and agencies funded in this
act provide grants that support important activities—from bio-
medical research to workforce training to substance use treatment
services to education for students with disabilities—that touch the
lives of millions of Americans in communities across the country.

9
Accordingly, it is critical that the Federal grant making process is
implemented in a timely, efficient, and consistent manner. The
Committee directs the Departments funded in this act and CNCS
to ensure that funding opportunity announcements are posted, non-
competing continuation awards are made, new grants are awarded,
and funding is disbursed all in a timely, efficient, and consistent
manner.
The Committee directs the Departments funded in this act and
CNCS to post publicly on their Website a listing of all of the no-
tices of funding opportunities they plan to announce for the subse-
quent 6 months and the estimated award date of funding under
those notices, and update such information no less than monthly
thereafter. The Committee also directs the Departments funded in
this act and CNCS, to adjust internal competitive grant timelines
as necessary to ensure when funding opportunities are announced
and when funding is awarded aligns with a program’s purpose, for
example that Department of Education funding generally aligns
with school years, and to the extent practicable provide applicants
with a minimum of 60 days to apply for most funding opportuni-
ties. The Committee also directs the Departments funded in this
act and CNCS to provide a report to the Committees listing all
grants during the previous month for which a scheduled non-com-
peting continuation award was not made within 14 days of the end
of the previous period of performance, including an explanation for
the delay. Finally the Committee directs the Departments funded
in this act and CNCS to ensure grant recipients do not experience
unjustified delays in drawing down grant funds.
The Committee requests GAO conduct targeted reviews of the
grant processes at specific agencies funded in this act and make
recommendations to improve efficiencies that could apply broadly
to prevent unnecessary disruptions for grantees and maximize the
benefits to intended beneficiaries of Federal programs.
Grant Terminations.—The Committee has long required advance
notification prior to issuing grant awards, and includes a new com-
parable requirement for advance notification prior to terminating
grants. The Committee directs the Departments funded in this act
and CNCS to provide a report within 120 days of enactment of this
act of all grants that were terminated or discontinued in fiscal year
2025, including a justification for the termination or discontinu-
ation, and any grants that were subsequently reinstated or par-
tially reinstated. The Committee directs the Departments funded
in this act and CNCS to include a timely appeals process for such
actions, and provide a decision on any appeals within 30 days.
Lifesaving Safety Stations.—The Committee is encouraged by the
General Services Administration’s Bulletin FMR C–2024–01, ‘‘Safe-
ty Station Program Guidelines in Federal Facilities’’ that was
issued on December 21, 2023. The Committee encourages all De-
partments covered in this act to implement these guidelines and
establish safety stations in each public building that include auto-
mated external defibrillators, opioid reversal agents, and hemor-
rhagic control programs and requests a briefing from each Depart-
ment within 90 days of enactment of this act on progress towards
implementing these guidelines.

10
Trust and Treaty Responsibilities.—The Committee reminds
agencies funded by this act of their obligation to uphold the Fed-
eral trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes and Federal obliga-
tions to the Native Hawaiian Community. This includes upholding
treaty and reserved rights, and any other rights and obligations
under Federal law; supporting self-determination efforts by Native
communities; fulfilling obligations under Presidential Memoranda
and Executive Orders; and conducting early and robust govern-
ment-to-government consultation with Tribes, and meaningful out-
reach and engagement with Native Hawaiians.
National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.—The Committee also
directs the Secretary of Education, Secretary of Health and Human
Services, and Secretary of Labor to release public reports detailing
how the Departments are addressing antisemitism, including by
implementing the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.
Timely Access for Inspectors General.—The Committee reminds
departments and agencies funded by this act that the Inspector
General Act authorizes the Offices of the Inspector General funded
by this act ‘‘to have timely access to all records, reports, audits, re-
views, documents, papers, recommendations, or other materials
available’’ related to ‘‘programs and operations’’ and expects such
departments and agencies to meet this requirement and not im-
pede the work of Inspectors General to carry out their statutory re-
sponsibilities.
Voter Registration and Participation.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of Education, Secretary of Health and Human Services,
and Secretary of Labor to brief the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of this act
regarding any strategic plans developed by the Department over
the three prior fiscal years outlining the ways that the Department
has promoted voter registration, and voter participation.

TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
Any references in this title of the report to the ‘‘Secretary’’ or the
‘‘Department’’ shall be interpreted to mean the Secretary of Labor

EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION
TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,898,587,000

tralized, integrated system of skill training and related services de-
signed to enhance the employment and earnings of economically
disadvantaged and dislocated workers. Funds provided for many
training programs for fiscal year 2026 will support the program
from July 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027. A portion of this ac-
count’s funding, $1,772,000,000, becomes available on October 1,
2026, for the 2026 program year.
Advanced Robotics Manufacturing.—The Committee recognizes
the need for workforce training and certificate programs targeting
collaborative robotics and additive manufacturing to adequately
prepare the current and future workforce for the challenges of to-
morrow. The Committee encourages the Department to appro-
priately address this need through the prioritization of such pro-
grams, with an emphasis on programs that re-skill incumbent
manufacturing workers.
Apprenticeship Grants.—The Committee supports the expansion
of apprenticeship opportunities and notes that they can often pro-
vide more affordable pathways to high-paying jobs. Not later than
180 days after the enactment of this act, the Department shall pub-
licly disclose on its website grantees receiving funding under the
Apprenticeship Program from the previous program year, the num-
ber of apprentices attributable to each grantee, and the respective
employment and earnings outcomes of program participants as re-
quired under section 116(b)(2)(A)(i) of WIOA. The Committee di-
rects the Department to provide information related to apprentice-
ship grants, including all currently active grants and contracts, and
data dashboards that allow for search and comparison of such data,
including data on credentials earned through or as a result of ap-
prenticeships. The Department shall make updates to apprentice-
ship.gov at least quarterly and shall include up to date information
on grants and contracts. Additionally, the Department shall report
to the Committee on the extent to which it is engaging with the
(11)

12
Department of Education to address mismatches between worker
skills or their participation in the labor force and employer needs
and the steps that the Department has taken or plans to take to
study the drivers of skills’ mismatches, workforce shortages, pro-
ductivity fluctuations, turnover fluctuations, stagnant wages, and
poor working conditions across occupations, industries, and the
economy as a whole.
Communities Affected by Substance Use.—The Committee con-
tinues to encourage the Secretary to prioritize funding for grants
to serve or retrain workers in communities impacted by the health
and economic effects of widespread substance use, including meth-
amphetamine use, addiction, and overdose.
Creative Economy.—The Committee recognizes that the creative
economy was severely impacted by COVID–19 and encourages the
Department to partner with the National Endowment for the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Humanities to explore the
feasibility and expansion of Registered Apprenticeship programs
for creative workers who previously received income through cre-
ative, cultural, or artistic-based pursuits to produce ideas, content,
goods, and services, without regard to whether such income is
earned through employment as an independent contractor or as an
employee for an employer.
Improving Access to Available Benefits.—The Committee recog-
nizes that one-stop customers often face significant barriers to pur-
suing training and employment, including lack of access to quality
childcare, food and nutrition, and medical services. Further, the
Committee is concerned that the complexity of supportive services
program eligibility requirements and application processes may dis-
courage enrollment. To optimize use of Federal funds, the Com-
mittee encourages the Department, in coordination with the De-
partment of Education and the Department of Health and Human
Services, to provide guidance on informing one-stop center cus-
tomers about the availability, including eligibility requirements, of
supportive services or assistance, including Medicaid, the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Earned Income Tax
Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families Program, and on referring customers to such serv-
ices or assistance. Further, guidance should clarify how one-stops
can assist customers in establishing eligibility for financial aid as-
sistance programs related to education and training programs that
are funded outside of WIOA.
Interconnected Workforce Development Technology.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to consider a unified approach
to workforce development by encouraging States to develop digital,
interconnected systems of technologies, maintained by State Work-
force Agencies, to support the growth of skills-based hiring and
competency-based education in order to increase credential comple-
tion and labor force participation.
Laboratory Technicians.—The Committee is concerned by the
Nationwide shortage of trained laboratory technicians. BLS
projects 12,000 new medical laboratory technicians are needed each
year to meet growing demand. According to the American Society
for Clinical Laboratory Science, programs currently graduate just
5,000 laboratorians each year. The Committee encourages the Sec-

13
retary to make funding available to increase the number of quali-
fied laboratory technicians through workforce development.
Modernizing Workforce Development Programming and Serving
Underemployed Workers.—The Committee encourages ETA to col-
laborate with State workforce agencies to modernize workforce de-
velopment programming. The Committee is also concerned about
the continued difficulty of underemployed workers transitioning to
full employment and encourages ETA to explore new avenues for
training, including the use of virtual resources. As part of this ef-
fort, ETA should consider the time constraints of underemployed
workers who may work multiple jobs or have caretaking respon-
sibilities that limit their ability to utilize the existing resources
provided by ETA. Finally, the Committee further encourages the
Department to develop a comprehensive long-term strategy for the
delivery of online training and development programming.
Opportunity Youth.—The Committee continues to encourage the
Department to use funds provided to carry out sections 168(b) and
169(c) of WIOA, which may be used for technical assistance and
demonstration projects, to support demonstration programs that
allow at-risk youth who are out-of-school, have limited work experi-
ence, and live in communities experiencing high rates of unemploy-
ment and high rates of community violence, to participate in the
workforce, including programs that provide such youth with men-
toring services.
Public Libraries.—The Committee continues to encourage ETA to
expand its collaborative work with the Institute of Museum and Li-
brary Services [IMLS] to help States and local boards integrate the
education, employment, and training services provided by public li-
braries into the workforce development system. Libraries can play
a critical role in helping people access benefits and get back to
work and the Committee encourages ETA to work with IMLS to
identify barriers to libraries participating in programs funded
under WIOA and to develop a plan to address those barriers. The
Committee requests a briefing on the plan to identify and address
barriers to libraries participating in programs under WIOA as en-
couraged in Senate Report 118–84.
Pursue Workforce Data Linkages.—The Committee directs the
Department, in coordination with the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Department of Education, and other Federal
agencies that support workforce development programs and that
hold nationwide earnings data, to submit a report to Congress
within 360 days of enactment on how to improve data quality and
transparency regarding participation in and outcomes from Federal
education and training programs, including but not limited to
WIOA, and including pre-participation earnings and employment
measures as well as outcomes reporting beyond a single year post-
exit, while also protecting privacy. The Departments should seek
input from States, data-linkage experts, including members of the
Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence-Building, with knowl-
edge of practices for linking client data with Federal and State
earnings data, data privacy experts, and other relevant stake-
holders. The report should explain what steps can be taken under
current law to implement modernized data infrastructure for work-
force development programs, barriers presented by current stat-

14
utes, regulations, and guidance, as well as legislative changes that
would be necessary to overcome those barriers. The report should
also include steps the Department has taken to implement rec-
ommendations from the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence
Building’s October 2022 final report.
Railroad Workforce Development.—The Committee is concerned
about the workforce needs in the railroad and transit sectors. The
Committee encourages the Department to expand workforce devel-
opment opportunities to address the growing need for additional
workers in the railroad and transit sectors. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to work with the Department of Transpor-
tation and other Federal agencies to support educational opportuni-
ties and workforce training opportunities for high-skill, high-wage,
and high-growth railroad and transit jobs in economically dis-
advantaged areas.
Small Businesses.—The Committee encourages the Department
to support the employment needs of small businesses and entrepre-
neurial skills training through WIOA programs, particularly in un-
derserved, disadvantaged communities.
Submarine Construction Workforce.—The Committee continues to
encourage ETA to collaborate with the Departments of Defense and
Education to address critical workforce needs in the submarine
construction pipeline.
Technology Usage for Workforce Interview Preparation.—The
Committee recognizes the critical role of interview preparation pro-
grams in supporting unemployed individuals, including opportunity
youth, parents, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and formerly
incarcerated individuals—as they transition into the workforce.
The Committee encourages ETA to collaborate with state workforce
agencies to prioritize partnerships with providers utilizing digital
interview preparation programs to enhance workforce readiness,
mitigate persistent unemployment challenges, and reduce strain on
unemployment benefit resources, resulting in substantial cost sav-
ings for States.
Water and Wastewater Operators.—The Committee continues to
be concerned by the Nationwide shortage of water and wastewater
operators, particularly in rural areas, and continues to strongly
urge the Secretary to make funding available through workforce
development and apprenticeship activities funded under this bill
for registered apprenticeship programs consistent with National
Guideline Standards of Apprenticeship for Water and Wastewater
System Operations Specialists and WIOA. The Committee con-
tinues to direct the Department to highlight the availability of
funding opportunities that may support such activities, and to pro-
vide technical assistance and outreach to potential grantees with
an emphasis on sectors that are underrepresented in the appren-
ticeship program and that have demonstrated shortages of workers.
Grants to States
The Committee provides $2,919,332,000 for Training and Em-
ployment Services Grants to States.
Under WIOA, a local board is given up to 100 percent transfer
authority between Adult and Dislocated Worker activities upon ap-
proval of the Governor.

15
Adult Employment and Training.—The Committee provides
$875,649,000 for adult employment and training. Formula funding
is provided to States and further distributed to local workforce in-
vestment areas through one-stop centers. The program provides
employment and training services to disadvantaged, low-skilled,
unemployed, and underemployed adults, including veterans.
Funds are made available in this bill for adult employment and
training activities in program year 2026, which occurs from July 1,
2026, through June 30, 2027. The bill provides that $163,649,000
is available for obligation on July 1, 2026, and that $712,000,000
is available on October 1, 2026. Both categories of funding are
available for obligation through June 30, 2027.
Dislocated Worker Assistance.—The Committee provides
$1,095,553,000 for dislocated worker assistance. This program is a
State-operated effort that provides training services and support to
help permanently separated workers reskill to return to productive
unsubsidized employment. In addition, States must use State-wide
reserve funds for rapid response assistance to help workers affected
by mass layoffs and plant closures. States must also use these
funds to carry out additional State-wide employment and training
activities, such as providing technical assistance to certain low-per-
forming local areas, evaluating State programs, and assisting with
the operation of one-stop delivery systems. States may also use
funds for implementing innovative training programs.
Funds made available in this bill support activities in program
year 2026, which occurs from July 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027.
The bill provides that $235,553,000 is available for obligation on
July 1, 2026, and that $860,000,000 is available on October 1,
2026. Both categories of funding are available for obligation
through June 30, 2027.
Timely Disbursement of Formula Funds.—The Committee notes
the importance of grant recipients receiving timely access to for-
mula funds. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to
obligate formula funding in a timely manner, following the agency’s
historical timelines for such funds.
Youth Training.—The Committee provides $948,130,000 for
youth training. The purpose of this program is to provide low-in-
come youth who are facing barriers to employment with services
that prepare them to succeed in the knowledge-based economy.
Funds are made available for youth training activities in program
year 2026, which occurs from April 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027.
National Programs
Dislocated Worker Assistance National Reserve
The Committee provides $300,859,000 for the Dislocated Worker
Assistance National Reserve, which is available to the Secretary for
activities such as responding to mass layoffs, plant and/or military
base closings, and natural disasters, as well as for technical assist-
ance, training, and demonstration projects.
Funds made available for the National Reserve in this bill sup-
port activities in program year 2026. The bill provides that
$100,859,000 is available for obligation on July 1, 2026, and that

16
$200,000,000 is available on October 1, 2026. Both categories of
funding are available for obligation through September 30, 2027.
Automation Impacted Industries.—The Committee continues to
support funding to support demonstration and pilot projects relat-
ing to the training needs of workers who are, or are likely to be-
come, dislocated as a result of automation.
Career Pathways for Youth Grants.—The Committee continues to
recognize that multiple career pathways should be available to
young people. The Committee also recognizes the need for early
workforce readiness, employment, and training opportunities that
help youth develop soft skills, such as responsibility, organization,
and time management, as well as the need to learn workplace safe-
ty. The Committee provides $20,000,000 to utilize the demonstra-
tion grant authority under the dislocated worker national reserve
for grants to support national out-of-school time organizations that
serve youth and teens, and place an emphasis on age-appropriate
workforce readiness programming to expand job training and work-
force pathways for youth and disconnected youth. This program-
ming includes soft skill development, career exploration, men-
toring, job readiness and certification, summer jobs, year-round job
opportunities, and apprenticeships. Funding will also support part-
nerships between workforce investment boards and youth serving
organizations. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to determine the feasibility of utilizing the existing one-stop
infrastructure to develop and execute career pathways for youth at
the local or regional level.
Dislocated Worker National Reserve Grantee Performance Report-
ing.—Consistent with the requirements of section 116(b)(2)(A)(i) of
WIOA (29 U.S.C. 3141), the Committee directs the Department to
require that all grantees receiving awards funded through the Dis-
located Worker National Reserve report on the employment, earn-
ings, and credential attainment outcomes of program participants.
The Committee further directs ETA to include program participant
outcomes disaggregated by grantee on its website.
Employee Ownership Initiative.—The Committee provides
$2,000,000 for grants authorized by section 346(d) of the SECURE
2.0 Act of 2022. Funds will be used to establish and expand em-
ployee ownership programs authorized by such section. The Com-
mittee directs the Employee Benefits Security Administration to
provide subject matter assistance to ETA as it develops and admin-
isters this grant program.
Multi-State National Dislocated Coal Miners Assistance Grant
Program.—The Committee is aware of the difficulties experienced
by dislocated coal miners as a result of continuing energy sector re-
structuring. The Committee continues to strongly support funding
for non-profit organizations that provide employment and training
assistance, as well as related supportive services, to individuals
who are dislocated by coal plant closures or substantial layoffs at
coal mine operations and their immediate family.
Strengthening Community College Training Grants [SCCTG].—
The Committee provides $65,000,000 for SCCTG. This program
builds the capacity of community colleges to address workforce de-
velopment needs in in-demand industries and career pathways

17
leading to quality jobs and to expand evidence-based solutions to
addressing such needs.
Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities.—The Committee
provides $50,000,000 for the Workforce Opportunity for Rural Com-
munities program, to provide enhanced worker training in the Ap-
palachian, Delta, and Northern Border regions. These funds pro-
vide reemployment and training assistance to dislocated workers in
rural areas to help them adapt existing skills and learn new ones
demanded by growing industries. The Committee strongly encour-
ages the Department to develop funding opportunity announce-
ments and make grant awards in coordination with the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission [ARC], Delta Regional Authority
[DRA], and Northern Border Regional Commission [NBRC], for
which each award shall not exceed $1,500,000. Within the total,
the Committee provides $21,750,000 for grants in areas served by
the ARC, $21,750,000 for areas served by the DRA, and $6,500,000
for areas served by the NBRC.
Indian and Native American Programs
The Committee provides $60,000,000 for Indian and Native
American Programs. These programs are designed to improve the
academic, occupational, and literacy skills of Native Americans,
Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians to aid the participants in
securing permanent, unsubsidized employment. Allowable training
services include adult basic education, general educational develop-
ment attainment, literacy training, English language training, re-
medial education, and career and technical education.
The Committee supports the effective implementation of the In-
dian and Native American programs. The Committee directs the
Department to ensure new members of the Native American Em-
ployment and Training Council [NAETC] are selected as expedi-
tiously as possible to avoid vacancies on the NAETC.
Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs
The Committee provides $97,396,000 for migrant and seasonal
farmworkers programs, which serve members of economically dis-
advantaged families whose principal livelihood is derived from mi-
gratory and other forms of seasonal farm work, fishing, or logging
activities. Enrollees and their families are provided with employ-
ment, training, and related services intended to prepare them for
stable, year-round employment within and outside of the agri-
culture industry.
The Committee provides that $90,134,000 be used for State serv-
ice area grants. The Committee also provides bill language direct-
ing that $6,591,000 be used for migrant and seasonal farmworker
housing grants, of which not less than 70 percent shall be for per-
manent housing. The principal purpose of these funds is to con-
tinue the network of local farmworker housing organizations work-
ing on permanent housing solutions for migrant and seasonal farm-
workers. The Committee also provides $671,000 to be used for
training, technical assistance, and related activities, including
funds for migrant rest center activities under section 167 of WIOA.
The Committee recognizes the value of this program in serving
the entire nation and directs the Department to ensure no state is

18
prohibited from applying for funds under migrant and seasonal
farmworker programs if such state otherwise meets eligibility cri-
teria outlined in statute.
YouthBuild
The Committee provides $105,000,000 for YouthBuild, which
helps provide disconnected youth with work readiness and indus-
try-driven credential attainment opportunities.
The Committee encourages the Department to ensure
YouthBuild grants reach geographically diverse areas, including
rural areas.
Reentry Employment Opportunities [REO]
The Committee provides $110,000,000 for the REO program, in-
cluding $30,000,000 for national and regional intermediaries. The
REO program provides current or formerly incarcerated youth and
adults involved in the justice system with occupational skills train-
ing that leads to industry recognized credentials and apprentice-
ships leading to employment in good, well-paying jobs and careers
with opportunities for advancement. Programs are carried out di-
rectly through State and local governmental entities and commu-
nity-based organizations, as well as indirectly through inter-
mediary organizations.
The Committee directs the Department to ensure grantees estab-
lish formal partnerships with employers and that program partici-
pants receive industry recognized credentials and training in fields
that prepare them for successful reintegration, including ensuring
participants receive training and credentials in fields where their
record is not a barrier to entry or continued employment. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department to consider the needs of commu-
nities that have recently experienced significant unrest.
Apprenticeship Grants
The Committee provides $285,000,000 for Apprenticeship Grants.
The Committee continues to support the prioritization of funding
to expand registered apprenticeships into new industries and for
underserved or underrepresented populations. The Committee sup-
ports the use of apprenticeship grants that provide worker edu-
cation in in-demand and emerging fields, including first responder;
disaster resilience, response, and recovery; utility (energy and
water) and resource management; transportation and infrastruc-
ture; goods movement sectors such as global logistics, rail and
other freight-related employment; technology and outdoor recre-
ation economy-related employment. The Committee also encourages
the Department to support apprenticeship opportunities that incor-
porate non-traditional industries, while providing appropriate flexi-
bility for such industries. Further, the Committee encourages the
Department to fund apprenticeship opportunities in local commu-
nities that have high rates of unemployment and high rates of com-
munity violence.
Pay for Success.—The Committee looks forward to the Depart-
ment’s assessment of the feasibility of supporting a pay-for-success
initiative as directed in the fiscal year 2024 explanatory statement.

19
School Administrator Apprenticeships.—The Committee is en-
couraged by the Department’s decision to make school administra-
tors eligible for apprenticeship training and assistance. The De-
partment should provide additional funding to further establish
and implement a leadership development apprenticeship program
to help educators advance their careers, address school principal
and superintendent shortages, and meet growing demand.
Workforce Data Quality Initiative
The Committee provides $6,000,000 for the Workforce Data
Quality Initiative, which provides competitive grants to support
States in developing, connecting, and enhancing their longitudinal
data systems that integrate education and workforce data. This
supports evaluation and research on the effectiveness of education
and workforce programs, and helps provide consumer-friendly in-
formation so that individuals can select the programs that best
meet their needs.
Workforce Data Innovation and Transparency.—The Committee
recognizes the need to encourage innovation at the state level to
improve data collection and accuracy. The Committee supports the
work of the Workforce Data Quality Initiative to increase data
transparency, enhance workforce delivery services, and help con-
nect individuals to careers.
Congressionally Directed Spending
The Committee provides $93,501,000 for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table at the end of this Committee Re-
port.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act and every 60 days there-
after, the Committee directs the Department to provide a report de-
tailing the status of CDS funding for fiscal year 2026. Such a re-
port shall be presented in Excel format and include a project de-
scription, requestors, the type of award, total obligations, total dis-
bursements, and the percent disbursed.
JOB CORPS

The Committee provides $1,603,325,000 for operations of Job
Corps centers.
The Committee provides $33,830,000 for administrative costs.
The Committee provides a total of $123,000,000 in construction,
renovation, and acquisition [CRA] funds. This amount is available
from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2029. The Committee continues bill
language allowing the Secretary to transfer up to 15 percent of
CRA funds, if necessary, to meet the operational needs of Job
Corps centers or to achieve administrative efficiencies. The bill con-
tinues to require the Secretary to notify the Committees at least
15 days in advance of any transfer. Any such notification shall in-
clude a justification.
Background Checks.—The Committee is concerned that the
pause in processing background checks for Job Corps applicants
has had a detrimental impact on young people and on the efficient
operations of the program. The Committee directs the Secretary to

20
immediately resume processing background checks and provide a
briefing on the number of background checks requested, the num-
ber of background checks completed, and the number of new stu-
dents enrolled in Job Corps programs. Additionally, the Committee
directs the Department to issue interim guidance authorizing Job
Corps center operators to utilize alternative background check and
vetting services that meet the requirements of 29 U.S.C.
3195(b)(1)(C] in order to immediately resume student enrollment.
The Committee further directs the Department to submit a report
within 60 days of enactment outlining the steps it has taken to im-
plement this authority and any remaining barriers to center-level
intake and enrollment.
Continuous Campus Improvement.—The Committee encourages
the Department to develop a process involving Job Corps youth
service providers for setting achievable campus performance expec-
tations in order to more effectively drive continuous improvement
in student outcomes.
COVID Staffing Determinations.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to fully rescind COVID-era policies related to staffing de-
cisions. The Committee encourages the Department to work with
Job Corps operators and other experts to make staffing determina-
tions based on State requirements, budgetary outlooks, and which
staffing levels will produce the highest-quality student outcomes.
Homeless Youth.—The Committee continues to strongly encour-
age the Department to streamline application requirements for
homeless youth in Job Corps.
Maximizing Employer Partnerships.—The Committee applauds
the Department’s efforts to develop relationships between Job
Corps and employers associated with our Nation’s strategic prior-
ities including infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and the de-
fense industrial base. The Committee encourages the Department
to fully leverage section 158(f) of WIOA to maximize the resources
available to campuses to develop these partnerships and meet em-
ployers’ needs.
Rural Training Sites.—The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to support and incentivize high quality center operators to de-
velop and enhance partnerships with existing rural training sites
to enhance opportunities and work experiences for students in un-
derserved rural or remote communities. Such rural partnerships
should use student-focused industry-backed curricula, prepare stu-
dents for employment in high-demand fields, offer students the op-
portunity to take coursework leading to college credit, and dem-
onstrate strong employer partnerships within the region in which
the center is located. Such partnerships will also promote the abil-
ity of Job Corps centers to meet local workforce and cultural needs
in communities far removed from their locations.
Status Updates on Atlanta Job Corps Center.—Congress has pre-
viously provided funding for the construction of the new Atlanta
Job Corps center. The Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide a semi-annual report to the Committee on the status of the
construction of the Atlanta Job Corps Center. The report should be
made available online and should include relevant resources of-
fered by the Department, including other Job Corps opportunities

21
for young people in the Atlanta Job Corps Center service area
while the Atlanta Job Corps Center is completed.
Substance Use and Behavioral Health.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the increase in overdoses and deaths among youth re-
sulting from drug use, including fentanyl. The Committee requests
the Department make recommendations, including legislative
changes, to address substance use and behavioral health challenges
of Job Corps participants in its fiscal year 2027 CJ.
COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $405,000,000

work-based training for unemployed, low-income persons aged 55
and older to help increase the number of such persons who obtain
unsubsidized employment. The Committee provides $395,000,000
for CSEOA.
The Committee encourages the Department to reserve amounts
proportionate to the Pacific Islander and Asian American and the
Indian populations for national grants to national Pacific Island
and Asian American and Indian aging organizations who have a
track record of reaching, in a linguistically and culturally com-
petent manner, this underserved population of older workers across
the country with significant barriers to employment. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department to provide an update in the fis-
cal year 2027 CJ on how recipients of funding under title V of the
Older Americans Act of 1965 [OAA] are serving older individuals
who are Native American and Pacific Islander and Asian American
with such funding.

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 50,300,000
The Committee provides mandatory funds for the Federal unem-
ployment benefits and allowances program that assists workers
who have been adversely affected by international trade by retrain-
ing for new careers and updating their skills. The Trade Adjust-
ment Assistance program provides benefits and services to help
participants find a path back into middle-class jobs, improve earn-
ings, and increase credential and education rates. TAA provides
benefits and services to those who qualify, to include job training,
job search and relocation allowances, and wage supplements for
workers age 50 and older.
The Committee notes that while the Department may not issue
any determinations and may not accept any new petitions or re-
quests for reconsideration, workers who were certified and sepa-
rated from their job on or before June 30, 2022, may still be eligible
for benefits and services.

tivities, which will support activities that benefit the entire Fed-
eral-State UI system, including supporting the continuation of IT
upgrades and technical assistance.
The Committee directs the Department to include information in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ on: (1) how the ability of State workforce
agencies to provide federally required service levels for unemploy-
ment insurance programs is affected when States do not receive the
resources they need for administration as identified by the Re-
source Justification Model; (2) whether improvements to the Re-
source Justification Model could support improved State adminis-
tration of the unemployment insurance programs; (3) whether Fed-
eral funding to States fully pays for the administration of Federal
benefit programs, including emergency benefit programs imple-
mented during the COVID–19 pandemic; (4) how ETA used CARES
Act, ARPA, and annual appropriations to improve the administra-
tion and integrity of the unemployment insurance system since
2020 and how the termination of the UI ARPA grants in May 2025
impacts efforts to improve the integrity of States’ unemployment
insurance systems; (5) how States identify fraudulent actors who
apply for unemployment insurance payments and the nature of
these actors; (6) how any new appropriations and authorities would
help the Department improve access to unemployment insurance
for eligible workers and identify and recoup fraudulent overpay-
ments; and (7) how any new appropriations and authorities would
enhance methods by which ETA helps States better administer

23
their unemployment insurance programs and identify and recoup
fraudulent overpayments.
The Committee also directs the Department to submit a report
within 360 days of enactment of this act evaluating all state unem-
ployment insurance offices for program integrity, timely delivery of
benefits, front-end verification of applicants, timely and accurate
determinations of eligibility for initial and continued claimants, re-
employment efforts, and how Federal support for state insurance
offices contributes to these issues. Additionally, the report should
recommend to the Committee targeted investments to address the
systemic issues listed in the report and include best practices from
States that have improved the administration of the unemployment
insurance program.
Employment Service
For the Employment Service allotments to States, the Committee
provides $675,052,000. This amount includes $21,413,000 in gen-
eral funds together with an authorization to spend $653,639,000
from the Employment Security Administration account of the Un-
employment Trust Fund.
The Committee also provides $20,000,000 for Employment Serv-
ice national activities.
The Committee provides $2,500,000 to continue efforts to reduce
the processing backlog for the work opportunity tax credit [WOTC]
program and for assisting States to modernize information tech-
nology for processing certification requests, which may include
training and technical assistance. The Committee directs the De-
partment to provide a briefing to the Committee 90 days after en-
actment of this act on efforts to reduce the WOTC backlog. Con-
sistent with this effort, the Committee strongly urges the Depart-
ment to develop national guidelines for the consistent administra-
tion of the program, including flexibility for State workforce agen-
cies with lower capacity. This guidance should also encourage State
workforce agencies to enter into cooperative information exchange
agreements with Federal and State agencies that have the data
needed to determine WOTC eligibility. Finally, the Committee rec-
ognizes that processing requests for remote workers may be best
accomplished in the State where the workers reside and not where
the employer is located.
Foreign Labor Certification
For carrying out the Department’s responsibilities related to for-
eign labor certification activities, the Committee provides
$60,528,000. In addition, 5 percent of the revenue from H–1B fees
is available to the Department for costs associated with processing
H–1B alien labor certification applications, and $23,282,000 is
available for related State grants.
Prompt Processing of H–2B Visas.—The Committee continues to
strongly encourage the Department to take steps to ensure prompt
processing of H–2B visa applications and to minimize future inter-
ruptions to the H–2B visa program.
Timely Processing of Permanent Labor Certification Applica-
tions.—The Committee strongly encourages the Department to take
appropriate actions using existing authority and resources to im-

24
prove the processing of Permanent Labor Certification Applica-
tions, including Prevailing Wage Determinations filed through For-
eign Labor Application Gateway [FLAG] system. Historically, proc-
essing took less than 6 months, but currently takes well over a
year. The Prevailing Wage Determinations for the process should
be processed in no more than 2 weeks and the Department should
return to processing times of less than 1 month, notwithstanding
backlogs at other departments involved in the visa process. Within
60 days of enactment, the Department shall provide the Committee
with a report detailing efforts being taken to improve processing
timeframes by using existing authority and resources, including
automating the self-attestation process to speedily approve submis-
sions, while flagging potential bad actors for further investigation
and audits.
One Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information
For one-stop career centers and labor market information, the
Committee provides $57,653,000 for assisting States with collecting
and producing workforce and labor market information and to im-
prove the ability of job seekers to obtain information about pro-
grams of study funded with Federal workforce training funds.
The Committee is encouraged by progress made through the De-
partment’s efforts to incentivize States to reduce barriers to entry
into licensed occupations and increase license portability to facili-
tate mobility of workers in such occupations, with an emphasis on
transitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses. The
Committee encourages the Department to expand on these past ef-
forts to encourage occupational licensing reform, which could in-
clude grants to States, and associations of States, to review, elimi-
nate and reform licensing requirements, and to promote portability
of State licenses. Grant funding would support institutions of high-
er education and occupational licensing partners to address bar-
riers to licensure for veterans and transitioning service members,
immigrants with work authorization, individuals with a criminal
history, and dislocated, low-wage workers. The Department, in con-
sultation with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, is
also encouraged to improve the information made publicly available
on credentials and licenses that facilitate entry into or advance-
ment in occupations.
ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS
The Committee bill continues language providing such sums as
necessary in mandatory funds for this account. The appropriation
is available to provide advances to several accounts for purposes
authorized under various Federal and State unemployment com-
pensation laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, when-
ever balances in such accounts prove insufficient.
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $172,915,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 158,433,000
The Committee provides $158,433,000 for program administra-
tion, including $104,527,000 in general funds and $53,906,000 from

25
the Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-
ment Trust Fund.
General funds in this account pay for the Federal staff needed
to administer employment and training programs under WIOA,
OAA, the Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–618), and the National
Apprenticeship Act. Trust funds provide for the Federal adminis-
tration of employment security, training and employment, and ex-
ecutive direction functions.
VETERANS’ EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $335,341,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 335,341,000
The Committee provides $335,341,000 for the Veterans’ Employ-
ment and Training Service [VETS], including $65,500,000 in gen-
eral revenue funding and $269,841,000 to be expended from the
Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-
ment Trust Fund.
This account provides resources for VETS to maximize employ-
ment opportunities for veterans and transitioning service members,
including protecting their employment rights. VETS carries out its
mission through a combination of grants to States, competitive
grants, and Federal enforcement and oversight.
The Committee provides $185,000,000 for the Jobs for Veterans
State Grants [JVSG] program. This funding will enable Disabled
Veterans’ Outreach Program specialists and Local Veterans’ Em-
ployment Representatives to continue providing intensive employ-
ment services to veterans and eligible spouses; transitioning service
members early in their separation from military service; wounded
warriors recuperating in military treatment facilities or transition
units; and spouses and family caregivers to help ensure the family
has income to provide sufficient support. The Committee maintains
language providing authority for JVSG funding to be used for data
systems and contract support to allow for the tracking of partici-
pant and performance information. The Committee includes new
language providing authority for JVSG funding to be used to sup-
port surviving spouses of service members.
The Committee provides $34,379,000 for the Transition Assist-
ance Program [TAP] to support apprenticeship opportunities and
employment workshops at military installations, and in virtual
classrooms, worldwide for exiting service members and spouses.
The Committee provides $47,048,000 for Federal administration
costs. This funding level will support oversight and administration
of the VETS grant programs, TAP employment workshops, and
compliance and enforcement activities.
The Committee provides $65,500,000 for the Homeless Veterans’
Reintegration Program [HVRP] to help homeless veterans attain
the skills they need to gain meaningful employment. The bill al-
lows Incarcerated Veterans’ Transition funds to be awarded to
serve veterans who have recently been released from incarceration
but are at risk of homelessness.
The Committee provides $3,414,000 for the National Veterans’
Training Institute, which provides training to Federal staff and
veteran service providers.

26
The Committee provides $500,000 to support the HIRE Vets Me-
dallion program.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $191,100,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 191,100,000
The Committee bill includes $191,100,000 for the Employee Ben-
efits Security Administration [EBSA]. EBSA is responsible for the
enforcement of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act [ERISA] in both civil and criminal areas and for enforcement
of sections 8477 and 8478 of the Federal Employees’ Retirement
Security Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–335). EBSA administers an in-
tegrated program of regulation, compliance assistance and edu-
cation, civil and criminal enforcement, and research and analysis.
Bill language continues to allow EBSA to obligate up to $3,000,000
for 2 fiscal years for the expert witness program. The authority is
needed for services on cases extending beyond fiscal year limita-
tion.
The Committee requests that DOL’s required operating plan and
future CJs include long-standing budget activity detail provided in
the fiscal year 2025 and prior CJs.
Adequate Consideration Guidance.—The Committee notes that
the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 also directs the Department to issue
formal guidance on the adequate consideration exemption, as de-
fined in section 407(d)(6) of ERISA. The Committee urges the De-
partment to prioritize a timely, formal notice and comment rule-
making on the adequate consideration exemption that ensures tax-
payers benefit from stakeholder input and experience, consistent
with congressional intent.
ERISA Requirements.—The Committee notes that firms domi-
ciled in or otherwise controlled by the People’s Republic of China
can be opaque in their auditing and accounting work and practices.
The Committee encourages EBSA to consider whether these trans-
parency risks have any implications for requirements on plan fidu-
ciaries under ERISA.
Implementation of Employee Ownership Initiative.—The Com-
mittee directs $2,000,000 within ETA for the grant program au-
thorized section 346 of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 to help estab-
lish and expand employee ownership programs. The Committee di-
rects EBSA to provide subject matter assistance to ETA as it devel-
ops and administers this grant program.
Mental Health Parity.—The Committee supports additional ef-
forts directed toward systemic and targeted audits of healthcare
coverage provided through ERISA plans, to ensure parity between
mental and physical healthcare coverage as required by current
law.
PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $512,900,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 494,264,000

27
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s [PBGC] estimated
obligations for fiscal year 2026 include single-employer benefit pay-
ments of $7,873,000,000, multi-employer financial assistance of
$187,000,000, Investment Management Fees Program of
$139,800,000, and consolidated administrative expenses of
$494,264,000, including no less than $7,588,000 available for the
Office of Inspector General. Administrative expenses are comprised
of three activities: pension insurance activities, pension plan termi-
nation expenses, and operational support. These expenditures are
financed by permanent authority. PBGC also anticipates obliga-
tions of $1,523,356,000 for Special Financial Assistance and
$15,000,000 for related administrative expenses from the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Previously, the Committee accepted the PBGC’s proposal to re-
form the administrative apportionment classifications from three
budget activities to one budget activity to make operations more ef-
ficient and improve stewardship of resources. That consolidated ap-
proach for the three activities is continued, but PBGC is directed
to continue providing detail every year on the three activities in its
annual CJ.
The PBGC is a wholly owned Government corporation estab-
lished by ERISA. The law places it within DOL and makes the Sec-
retary the chair of its board of directors. The Corporation receives
its income primarily from insurance premiums collected from cov-
ered pension plans, assets of terminated pension plans, collection
of employer liabilities imposed by the act, and investment earnings.
The primary purpose of the PBGC is to guarantee the payment of
pension plan benefits to participants if covered defined benefit
plans fail or go out of existence.
The bill continues authority for a contingency fund for the PBGC
that provides additional administrative resources when the number
of new plan participants in terminated plans exceeds 100,000.
When that threshold is reached, an additional $9,200,000 becomes
available through September 30, 2030, for every 20,000 additional
participants in terminated plans. The bill also continues authority
allowing the PBGC additional obligation authority for unforeseen
and extraordinary pre-termination expenses, after approval by the
Office of Management and Budget and notification to the Commit-
tees. Finally, the bill includes authority for PBGC to expend not
more than an additional $100 per affected person for credit or iden-
tity monitoring to individuals upon suffering a security incident or
privacy breach in the event PBGC’s costs exceed $250,000. Those
funds are available for obligation through September 30, 2030.
WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $260,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 260,000,000
The Committee bill includes $260,000,000 for the Wage and Hour
Division [WHD].
WHD is responsible for administering and enforcing laws that
provide minimum standards for wages and working conditions in
the United States. The Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] (Public

28
Law 75–718), employment rights under the Family and Medical
Leave Act (Public Law 103–3), and the Migrant and Seasonal Agri-
cultural Worker Protection Act (Public Law 97–470) are several of
the important laws that WHD is charged with administering and/
or enforcing.
WHD administers and enforces laws covering more than 165 mil-
lion workers in 11 million workplaces in the United States and its
territories. The Committee supports WHD in its efforts to be more
strategic in enforcement activities, which can lead to more signifi-
cant results for workers at an industry-level and deter employers
from violating the law, particularly in key areas of protecting the
rights and wages of workers, ensuring prevailing wage protections,
and combatting exploitative child labor.
PAID Program.—The Committee notes that the Department has
restarted the Payroll Audit Independent Determination program.
The Committee urges the Department to ensure that any worker
provided a settlement under this program is fully informed of their
rights.
OFFICE OF LABOR-MANAGEMENT STANDARDS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $48,515,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 48,515,000
The Committee bill includes $48,515,000 for the Office of Labor-
Management Standards [OLMS].
OLMS administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclo-
sure Act of 1959 [LMRDA] (Public Law 86–257) and related laws.
These laws establish safeguards for union democracy and financial
integrity. They also require public disclosure by unions, union offi-
cers, employers, labor relations consultants and others. In addition,
the Office administers employee protections under federally spon-
sored transportation programs.
OFFICE OF FEDERAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $110,976,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 105,976,000
The Committee bill includes $105,976,000 for the Office of Fed-
eral Contract Compliance Programs [OFCCP].
This Office protects workers and potential employees of Federal
contractors from employment discrimination prohibited under sec-
tion 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era
Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These prohibitions
make it unlawful for contractors and subcontractors doing business
with the Federal Government to discriminate in employment be-
cause of disability or status as a protected veteran.
VAHBP Enforcement Moratorium.—The Committee notes that
OFCCP Directive 2021–01 Revision 2 indicates OFCCP’s intent to
exercise prosecutorial discretion with regard to the affirmative obli-
gations of Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Program [VAHBP] pro-
viders until May 2027. The Committee encourages OFCCP to work
with stakeholders and lawmakers to ensure appropriate implemen-

29
tation of OFCCP programs and robust access to care for veterans
and their families.
Worker Outcomes.—The Committee notes a reduction in staffing
at OFCCP. This could impact protections for workers and prospec-
tive employees of Federal contractors from discrimination. The
Committee plans to examine required monthly staffing reports and
performance outcomes achieved for Federal contractor employees.
OFFICE OF WORKERS’ COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $122,705,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 122,705,000
The Committee bill includes $122,705,000 for the Office of Work-
ers’ Compensation Programs [OWCP]. This includes $2,205,000
from the special fund established by the Longshore and Harbor
Workers’ Compensation Act. In addition, $50,684,000 is available
by transfer from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
OWCP administers four distinct compensation programs: the
Federal Employees’ Compensation Act [FECA], the Longshore and
Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (Public Law 69–803), the Black
Lung Benefits programs, and the Energy Employees Occupational
Illness Compensation Program Act (Public Law 106–398). In addi-
tion, OWCP houses the Division of Information Technology Man-
agement and Services.
SPECIAL BENEFITS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $726,670,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,298,385,000
The Committee bill includes $1,298,385,000 for this account. This
mandatory appropriation, which is administered by OWCP, pri-
marily provides benefits under FECA.
The Committee continues to provide authority to require disclo-
sure of Social Security numbers by individuals filing claims under
FECA or the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act
(Public Law 69–803) and its extensions.
The Committee continues language that provides authority to
use FECA funds to reimburse a new employer for a portion of the
salary of a newly reemployed injured Federal worker. FECA funds
will be used to reimburse new employers during the first 3 years
of employment, not to exceed 75 percent of salary in the worker’s
first year, and declining thereafter.
The Committee continues language that allows carryover of un-
obligated balances to be used in the following year and provides au-
thority to draw such sums as needed after August 15 to pay cur-
rent beneficiaries. Such funds are charged to the subsequent year
appropriation.
The Committee continues language to provide authority to de-
posit into the special benefits account of the employees’ compensa-
tion fund those funds that the Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley
Authority, and other entities are required to pay to cover their fair
share of the costs of administering the claims filed by their employ-
ees under FECA.

30
Finally, the Committee maintains language consistent with long-
standing interpretations and implementation of this appropriation
stating that, along with the other compensation statutes already
specifically enumerated, the appropriation is used to pay obliga-
tions that arise under the War Hazards Compensation Act (Public
Law 77–784), and the appropriation is deposited in the Employees’
Compensation Fund and assumes its attributes, namely avail-
ability without time limit as provided by 5 U.S.C. section 8147.33.
SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $31,367,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 30,585,000
The Committee bill includes a mandatory appropriation of
$24,585,000 in fiscal year 2026 for special benefits for disabled coal
miners. This is in addition to the $6,000,000 appropriated last year
as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, for a total
program level of $30,585,000 in fiscal year 2026.
These mandatory funds are used to provide monthly benefits to
coal miners disabled by black lung disease, their widows, and cer-
tain other dependents, as well as to pay related administrative
costs.
The Committee bill also includes an advance appropriation of
$5,900,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. These funds will
ensure uninterrupted benefit payments as promised to coal miners,
their widows, and dependents.
DIVISION OF ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS
COMPENSATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $66,966,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 68,148,000
The Committee bill includes $68,148,000 for the Division of En-
ergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program
[EEOICP]. This is a mandatory appropriation for administrative
expenses for administration of Part B of the Energy Employees Oc-
cupational Illness Compensation program.
The Division administers the Energy Employees Occupational Ill-
ness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA] (Public Law 106–398),
which provides benefits to eligible employees and former employees
of the Department of Energy, its contractors and subcontractors, or
to certain survivors of such individuals. The mission also includes
delivering benefits to certain beneficiaries of the Radiation Expo-
sure Compensation Act (Public Law 106–245). The Division is part
of OWCP.
BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $485,350,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 477,295,000
The bill provides an estimated $477,295,000 as requested for this
mandatory appropriations account. This estimate is comprised of
$90,499,000 for administrative expenses and an estimated
$386,796,000 for benefit payment and interest costs.

31
The bill continues to provide indefinite authority for the Black
Lung Disability Trust Fund to provide for benefit payments. The
Trust Fund pays all black lung compensation/medical and survivor
benefit expenses when no responsible mine operation can be as-
signed liability or refuses to pay for such benefits, as well as all
administrative costs that are incurred in administering the benefits
program and operating the trust fund. As proposed in the Presi-
dent’s budget, the bill provides for transfers from the trust fund for
administrative expenses for the following Department agencies: up
to $50,684,000 for the part C costs of the Division of Coal Mine
Workers’ Compensation Programs; up to $39,086,000 for Depart-
mental Management, Salaries and Expenses; and up to $373,000
for Departmental Management, Inspector General. The bill also al-
lows a transfer of up to $356,000 for the Department of the Treas-
ury.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $632,309,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 632,309,000
The Committee bill includes $632,309,000 for the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], which is responsible for
enforcing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public
Law 91–596) in the Nation’s workplaces. New bill language is in-
cluded to require OSHA to adhere to program allocations as identi-
fied in the table at the end of this report.
The Committee continues bill language to allow OSHA to retain
course tuition and fees for training institute courses used for occu-
pational safety and health training and education activities in the
private sector. The cap established by the bill is $499,000 per year,
consistent with current law.
The Committee also continues bill language to exempt farms em-
ploying 10 or fewer people from the provisions of the Occupational
Safety and Health [OSH] Act, with the exception of those farms
having a temporary labor camp. The exemption of small farming
operations from OSHA regulation has been in place since 1976.
OSHA clarified the limits of its authority under the appropriations
rider to conduct enforcement on small farms in July 2014, particu-
larly regarding post-harvest activities of a farming operation. It is
also important the Department of Agriculture and National Insti-
tute for Occupational Safety and Health are consulted in any fu-
ture attempt by OSHA to redefine or modify any aspect of the
small farm exemption. The Committee also continues language ex-
empting employers with fewer than 10 employees in industry clas-
sifications having a lost workday injury rate less than the National
average from general schedule safety inspections, except for the
small farms covered by the broader exemption.
Compliance Assistance.—The Committee bill includes language
requiring OSHA to dedicate not less than $3,500,000 for admin-
istering the Voluntary Protection Program [VPP] in its Federal
Compliance Assistance budget. OSHA shall not reduce funding lev-
els or the number of employees administering the VPP, the Safety
and Health Achievement Recognition Program, or Federal Compli-

32
ance Assistance, and shall not collect any monies from participants
for the purpose of administering these programs.
Opioid Use in the Workplace.—The Committee is concerned over
the prevalence of opioid use in the workplace. According to the Na-
tional Safety Council, while 75 percent of employers reported see-
ing opioid use impact their workplace, only 17 percent reported
being well-prepared to address it. The Committee encourages the
Secretary to issue guidance to employers on acquiring and main-
taining opioid overdose reversal medication and training employees
on an annual basis on the usage of such medication, and requests
a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this act on progress to-
wards issuing these guidelines.
Smoke-Related Health Issues for Workers.—The Committee di-
rects the Department to work with the National Institute for Occu-
pational Safety and Health [NIOSH] and other relevant agencies to
gather evidence on best practices and make recommendations that
protect workers from the consequences of long-term exposure to ad-
verse air. Further, the Committee requests that the Department
provide a briefing to the Committees on Appropriations on their
joint efforts with NIOSH supporting vulnerable workers, particu-
larly those exposed to adverse air.
State Plan States.—The Committee bill includes $120,000,000 for
grants to States under section 23(g) of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act (Public Law 91–596). These funds primarily are pro-
vided to States that have taken responsibility for administering
their own occupational safety and health programs for the private
sector and/or the public sector. State plans must be at least as ef-
fective as the Federal program and are monitored by OSHA. The
bill continues language that allows OSHA to provide grants of up
to 50 percent for the costs of State plans approved by the agency.
Workplace Violence in Healthcare and Social Services.—The
Healthcare and Social Assistance industry sector includes nearly
21 million employees and these workers face an increased risk of
workplace violence that is nearly six times that of workers in all
other industries. This violence dramatically impacts nurse well-
being and burnout. It exacerbates the nurse staffing crisis and af-
fects the quality of patient care. The Committee urges OSHA to ex-
plore steps the agency can take to ensure that healthcare and so-
cial services workers are protected from violence in the workplace
and requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act
on such steps.
The Committee bill also includes $12,787,000 for the OSHA
Susan Harwood Training Grant program. The program provides
disadvantaged, underserved, low-income, or other hard-to-reach, at-
risk workers with identifying and avoiding workplace hazards,
training to protect them from on-the-job hazards, and to inform
workers of their rights and employers of their responsibilities
under the OSH Act.
MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $387,816,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 387,816,000

33
The Committee bill includes $387,816,000 for the Mine Safety
and Health Administration [MSHA]. New bill language is included
to require MSHA to adhere to program allocations as identified in
the table at the end of this report.
MSHA enforces the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act (Public
Law 91–173) by conducting inspections and special investigations
of mine operations, promulgating mandatory safety and health
standards, cooperating with the States in developing effective State
programs, and improving training in conjunction with States and
the mining industry.
The Committee continues language authorizing MSHA to use up
to $2,000,000 for mine rescue and recovery activities. It also retains
the provision allowing the Secretary to use any funds available to
the Department to provide for the costs of mine rescue and survival
operations in the event of a major disaster. To prepare properly for
an emergency, the Committee also directs MSHA to continue to de-
vote sufficient resources toward a competitive grant activity for ef-
fective emergency response and recovery training in various types
of mine conditions.
In addition, bill language continues to allow the National Mine
Health and Safety Academy to collect not more than $750,000 for
room, board, tuition, and the sale of training materials to be avail-
able for mine safety and health education and training activities.
Bill language also allows MSHA to retain up to $2,499,000 from
fees collected for the approval and certification of equipment, mate-
rials, and explosives for use in mines, and to utilize such sums for
these activities.
The Committee continues to emphasize the importance of mine
safety enforcement, and instructs MSHA to fully implement the re-
quirements of section 103 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health

BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $703,952,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 703,952,000
The Committee bill includes $703,952,000 for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics [BLS]. This amount includes $68,000,000 from the
Employment Security Administration account of the Unemploy-
ment Trust Fund and $635,952,000 in Federal funds.
BLS is the principal fact-finding agency in the Federal Govern-
ment in the broad field of labor economics. The Committee recog-
nizes that the Nation requires current, accurate, detailed workforce
statistics for Federal and non-Federal data users as provided by
BLS.
Current Population Survey.—The Committee remains concerned
by declining response rates facing all survey programs and other

34
challenges which necessitate actions by BLS and the Census Bu-
reau to modernize the operations of the Current Population Survey
[CPS] and maintain this resource. The Committee believes steps
must be taken to modernize the CPS. The Committee understands
work on an Internet self-response mode and other improvements
are underway. The Committee requests a CPS modernization plan,
including an implementation timeline and resource needs, not later
than 30 days after enactment of this act and follow-up briefing not
later than 30 days after submission of the plan. Such plan and
briefing shall include input from and participation of the Census
Bureau.
GAO Briefing and Report.—The Committee directs the GAO to
study and provide a briefing with preliminary observations to the
Committees no later than 180 days after enactment of this act,
with a report to follow on a date mutually agreed upon with the
Committee at the time of the preliminary briefing, on the impact
of the elimination of the Technical Advisory Committee and the
Data Users Advisory Committee on the quality and reliability of
BLS data collection and steps BLS is taking to improve the quality
and reliability of BLS data collection.
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.—The Committee con-
tinues to recognize the importance of the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth [NLSY], which provides valuable information
about labor market trends across different generations and spans
multiple decades.
The Committee directs BLS to maintain sufficient funding levels
for the continued fielding of the NLSY79 and NLSY97 cohorts and
to continue the current design, methodology, and data quality. In

mittee directs BLS to issue a public report and brief the Commit-
tees on its plans for executing these directives, providing a status
update on the fielding and future of the NLSY79 and NLSY97 co-
horts and carrying out its implementation of the NLSY27 cohort
plans.
OFFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $43,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 43,000,000
The Committee bill includes $43,000,000 for the Office of Dis-
ability Employment Policy [ODEP] to provide leadership, develop
policy and initiatives, support technical assistance and implemen-
tation, and award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts
furthering the objective of eliminating physical and programmatic
barriers to the training, labor force participation and employment
of people with disabilities and to design and implement research
and technical assistance grants and contracts that support the
transition to competitive, integrated employment for youth and
adults with disabilities. The bill also includes language continuing
to allow not less than $9,000,000 to be used for research and dem-
onstration projects related to testing effective ways to promote
greater labor force participation of people with disabilities. These

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 363,843,000
The Committee bill includes $363,843,000 for the Departmental
Management, Salaries and Expenses account. Of this amount,
$363,535,000 is available from general funds and $308,000 is avail-
able by transfer from the Employment Security Administration ac-
count of the Unemployment Trust Fund. In addition, $39,086,000
is available by transfer from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
The Departmental Management, Salaries and Expenses appro-
priation pays the salaries and related expenses of staff responsible
for formulating and overseeing the implementation of departmental
policy and management activities in support of that goal. In addi-
tion, this appropriation includes a variety of operating programs
and activities that are not involved in departmental management
functions, but for which other appropriations for salaries and ex-
penses are not suitable.
Bureau of International Labor Affairs [ILAB].—The Committee
bill includes $111,125,000, of which $76,725,000 is available for ob-
ligation through December 31, 2026, for ILAB to carry out its stat-
utory responsibilities. These funds are in addition to the supple-
mental appropriations for ILAB in Public Law 116–113, the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, for its re-
sponsibilities under that law.
ILAB’s appropriation is available to help improve working condi-
tions and labor standards for workers around the world by carrying
out ILAB’s statutory mandates and international responsibilities,
including in promoting the elimination of the worst forms of child
labor and forced labor. ILAB works to ensure workers and busi-
nesses in the United States are not put at a competitive disadvan-
tage by trading partner countries not adhering to their labor com-
mitments under trade agreements and trade preference programs.
The bill continues language setting aside funding for grants, con-
tracts and other arrangements for technical assistance on worker
rights and for combatting child labor, with no less than
$30,175,000 available for worker rights programs and no less than
$30,175,000 for combatting exploitative child labor internationally.
This flexibility will allow ILAB to target additional resources where
conditions on the ground and other factors create the greatest op-
portunities to make significant progress on these issues and main-
tain a robust level of support for both critically important activi-
ties. The Committee directs ILAB to use available funds for moni-
toring, oversight, and technical assistance in support of the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to include information on how all
available funds are being used for the purposes of such act, includ-

36
ing Mexico’s implementation of nationwide labor reforms and com-
pliance with labor obligations, in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
The Committee continues to support the critical role ILAB plays
in working to eradicate child labor, forced labor, and human traf-
ficking, including through its research and reporting in its Findings
on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, List of Goods Produced by
Child Labor or Forced Labor, and List of Products Produced by
Forced or Indentured Child Labor. The appropriation will support
continued publication of these important reports, including the
tracking of goods through supply chains and identifying inputs
made with child and forced labor.
Communications With the Committee.—The Committee relies on
its relationship with the Office of Congressional and Intergovern-
mental Affairs [OCIA] and the Departmental Budget Center [DBC]
to make decisions about how to best allocate budget resources and
provide oversight over how taxpayer dollars are spent. OCIA has
a responsibility to ensure that the Committees receive accurate and
timely information including by ensuring that program offices pro-
vide program-specific information in a timely manner upon request.
The Committee directs OCIA to improve the quality and timeliness
of the information it provides, including by reforming and stream-
lining internal clearance processes, and allowing DBC to commu-
nicate directly with the Committee as they have done historically.
Evaluation, and Evidence-Building and Use.—The Committee
bill includes $4,281,000 for program evaluation and allows these
funds to be available for obligation through September 30, 2027.
The Committee bill also continues the authority of the Secretary to
transfer these funds to any other account in the Department for
evaluation purposes. The Committee bill continues authority to use
up to 0.75 percent of certain Department appropriations for evalua-
tion activities identified by the chief evaluation officer. The Depart-
ment shall notify the Committee of the planned uses of funds de-
rived from this authority.
Foundation for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.—The Com-
mittee continues to believe that the execution of the Foundations
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act will enhance the evidence-
building capacity of Federal agencies, strengthen privacy protec-
tions, improve secure access to data, and provide more and higher
quality evidence to policymakers. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Department to continue to include in the fiscal year 2027 and
future CJs updates on the implementation and planned implemen-
tation of such act for the current and future budget years. These
updates shall describe important changes being made by agencies
using research findings, evaluation and evidence to improve their
operations.
Paid Family Leave.—The Committee is particularly supportive of
the Women’s Bureau’s work and dedication to supporting paid
leave programs as part of their mission to support women’s work-
force participation. In order to study best practices in paid leave
programs, the Women’s Bureau is encouraged to request data from
State paid leave programs in order to publish a report about usage
rates and distribution of paid leave at the State level as well as
steps State paid leave programs are taking to support the full
range of businesses and entrepreneurs.

37
Payment Management System [PMS].—The Committee directs
the Department to immediately notify the Committees of any PMS
outages or technical problems exceeding 48 hours, and any pay-
ment delays or disruptions in the PMS distribution of funds exceed-
ing 14 days for individual payees, including any delays resulting
from Executive Order 14158 or Executive Order 14222.
Staffing Report.—Not later than 30 days after enactment, the
Department is directed to provide the Committee an operating plan
identifying the total FTE and non-personnel allocations supported
by each appropriation provided by this act and FTE and non-per-
sonnel allocations for each office supported by each of these appro-
priations provided in this act. In addition, the Department shall
provide on a monthly basis the number of on-board staff, attrition,
approved hires not yet on-boarded and projected full-year FTE
usage, including approved hires, and actual non-personnel ex-
penses, for each office supported by, and in total for each appro-
priation provided by this act. The monthly reports should be de-
tailed by competitive (including career SES) and excepted (includ-
ing noncareer and limited term SES) service staff. The Department
shall also provide the Committee on a biannual basis an excel file
which includes the names, titles, grades, program office, and date
of hire of all of the employees in a position in the excepted service
employed by the Department during the previous 180 days.
Women’s Bureau.—The Committee bill includes $23,000,000 for
the Women’s Bureau. The Committee continues bill language al-
lowing the Bureau to award grants, including not less than

mittee continues to support the ongoing effort to increase the num-
ber of people who have access to medical services at health centers.
Health centers play a vital role in ensuring access to primary care
in underserved areas of the country, including urban, rural, and
frontier areas.
In addition, within the amount provided, the Committee provides
up to $120,000,000 under the Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA]
(Public Law 102–501 and Public Law 104–73), available until ex-
pended. These funds are used to pay judgments and settlements,
(40)

41
occasional witness fees and expenses, and related administrative
costs. The Committee intends FTCA coverage funded through this
bill to be inclusive of all providers, activities, and services included
within the health centers’ federally approved scope of project.
Addressing Intimate Partner Violence and Project Catalyst.—The
Committee includes no less than $2,000,000 for the HRSA Strategy
to Address Intimate Partner Violence.
Base Grant Adjustments.—The Committee recognizes that health
center costs have increased significantly and that it has been near-
ly a decade since the last base grant adjustment. The Committee
encourages HRSA to consider the needs of existing health centers
in relation to their current base grants when allocating health cen-
ter funding.
Brain Health Access Initiative.—The Committee supports HRSA’s
efforts to integrate screenings for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias [ADRD] into the Health Center Program, as well as the
agency’s technical assistance activities that help support health
centers’ ability to meet the healthcare needs of older Americans.
The Committee encourages HRSA to continue utilizing the ADRD
screening measure reporting requirement to promote increased ac-
cess to cognitive assessments across the Health Center Program.
Children’s Mental Health Services.—The Committee continues to
urge HRSA to provide funding to health centers to support vital
mental health services for children.
Early Childhood Development.—The Committee continues no less
than $30,000,000 to further integrate early childhood development
services and expertise, including by hiring or contracting for early
childhood development specialists.
Ending the HIV Epidemic.—The Committee provides
$157,250,000 within the Health Centers Program for the Ending
the HIV Epidemic initiative. The initiative provides funding to
health centers in high-need jurisdictions to increase prevention and
treatment services for people at high risk for HIV transmission, in-
cluding pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] related services, outreach,
and care coordination through new grant awards in areas currently
served by health centers.
Federally Qualified Health Center [FQHC] Look-Alike Participa-
tion.—The Committee notes that certain health centers throughout
the country are ineligible to apply for supplemental funding awards
because of their status as a FQHC Look-Alike [LAL]. The Com-
mittee requests a briefing from HRSA within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on the impacts of allowing FQHC LALs to apply
for supplemental funding opportunities under section 330 of the
Public Health Service [PHS] Act and ways in which the FQHC LAL
program could be better utilized as a pipeline into the section 330
Health Center Program.
Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Coverage.—The Committee pro-
vides $1,000,000 for payments of claims under the FTCA to be
made available for free clinic health professionals as authorized by
section 224(o) of the PHS Act (Public Law 104–73). This appropria-
tion extends FTCA coverage to medical volunteers in free clinics to
expand access to healthcare services for low-income individuals in
medically underserved areas.

42
Health Center Controlled Networks [HCCNs].—The Committee
recognizes the value of HCCNs, which support nationwide virtual
infrastructure that enables real-time performance tracking, inter-
operability, and digital connectivity to advance healthcare mod-
ernization. The Committee encourages HRSA to prioritize contin-
ued investment in HCCNs as a driver of cost-effective, technology-
forward, community-based care.
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis [MASH].—
MASH is a form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver
disease linked to metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions includ-
ing high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and type
2 diabetes. The Committee urges HRSA to increase screening ef-
forts for MASH in community health centers [CHCs] to support
early identification and earlier treatment, which reduces the risk
of end-stage liver disease.
Native Hawaiian Health Care.—The Committee affirms the Fed-
eral trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians, and further that the
provision of healthcare and the betterment of health conditions of
Native Hawaiians as directed in 42 U.S.C. 11705 is key to advanc-
ing the Federal trust responsibility of the United States. The Com-
mittee includes no less than $27,000,000 for the Native Hawaiian
Health Care Program. Of the total amount appropriated for the
Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, not less than $10,000,000
shall be provided to Papa Ola Lokahi for administrative purposes
authorized under 42 U.S.C. 11706, including to coordinate and sup-
port healthcare service provision to Native Hawaiians and
strengthen the capacity of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Sys-
tem to provide comprehensive health education and promotion, dis-
ease prevention services, traditional healing practices, and primary
health services to Native Hawaiians.
School-Based Health Centers [SBHCs].—The Committee includes
$55,000,000 for awards to health centers operating school-based
service sites under section 330 of the PHS Act to increase their ca-
pacity to meet the increasing demand for health services, including
mental health services.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee believes funding for the
training and technical assistance available for health centers
through national and State cooperative agreements and grants is
critical to the successful operation and expansion of the Health
Centers Program. Funds are available within the amount provided
to enhance technical assistance and training activities and further
quality improvement initiatives that improve health outcomes.
Timely Notice of Awards.—The Committee includes new bill lan-
guage directing BPC to award funding for continuation awards that
continue previous activities under existing awards no later than
the day following the expiration of the period of performance. For
health centers subject to specific award conditions due to a correc-
tive action plan, BPC may extend the current award in lieu of pro-
viding a new award for the purposes of finalizing negotiations with
the grantee.
Type I Screenings.—The Committee supports efforts to increase
type 1 diabetes screenings at community health centers [CHCs],
particularly among high-risk populations, especially given the ad-
vances in treatments that now can delay onset of the disease for

43
several years if caught early enough. HRSA is directed to provide
a report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act
and to post on a publicly available website on the efforts being
made to increase screening for type 1 diabetes at CHCs. The report
should include the feasibility and cost estimate of expanding
screening, as well as a plan and timeline on how to roll out such
efforts. Additionally, approximately 40 percent of people do not
know they have type 1 diabetes until they experience diabetic
ketoacidosis [DKA], which is a life-threatening event requiring hos-
pitalization. The Committee supports the inclusion of screening for
DKA in CHCs’ type 1 diabetes screening protocols and educating
high-risk patients about DKA.
Vaccination and Screening for Hepatitis B.—The Committee con-
tinues to encourage HRSA to support health center grantees’ adop-
tion of the necessary practices and policies to comply with the No-
vember 2021 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
[ACIP] recommendation that all adults between ages 19 and 59 be
vaccinated and the March 2023 ACIP recommendation that all
adults between ages 19 and 59 be screened for hepatitis B. To im-
plement these policies, the Committee further encourages HRSA to
ensure that health centers screen patients aged 19–59 for hepatitis
B, offer to immunize all non-infected patients in the 19–59 age co-
hort, and navigate infected individuals into care. The Committee
requests an update from HRSA before the end of fiscal year 2026
on its progress to meet this goal, including the number of individ-
uals screened and number of individuals vaccinated for hepatitis B
at HRSA-funded health centers.
Women’s Preventive Services Initiative.—The Committee notes
that the Women’s Preventive Services Initiative [WPSI] developed
evidence-based guidelines for community health centers to provide
preventive services and screenings to improve women’s health
throughout their lifespan. The Committee supports continued ac-
cess to preventive screenings at community health centers, includ-
ing for patients in rural areas. Within 180 days of enactment of
this act, the Committee directs HRSA to provide a briefing on the
extent to which FQHCs have adopted WPSI guidelines and what
barriers exist to clinics providing services, including in rural areas.
HEALTH WORKFORCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,404,376,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,383,376,000
The Bureau of Health Workforce provides policy leadership and
grant support for health professions workforce development. The
mission of the Bureau is to identify shortage areas while working
to make them obsolete. Programs are intended to ensure that the
Nation has the right clinicians, with the right skills, working
where they are needed.
The Committee also encourages HRSA to conduct outreach, pro-
vide technical assistance, and give priority in awarding cooperative
agreements and grants to entities in high poverty areas and his-
torically marginalized communities. The Committee encourages
HRSA to work with these communities to develop their mental
health workforce and requests an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ

44
on best practices and strategies to attract mental healthcare practi-
tioners to these disproportionately impacted communities.
National Health Service Corps
The Committee provides $128,600,000 for the National Health
Service Corps [Corps]. The Committee recognizes the success of the
Corps program in building healthy communities in areas with lim-
ited access to care. The program has shown increases in retention
of healthcare professionals located in underserved areas.
Within this total, the Committee continues support for access to
quality opioid and substance use disorder [SUD] treatment in rural
and underserved areas nationwide. The Committee continues lan-
guage that expands eligibility for loan repayment awards through
the Corps to include SUD counselors. The Committee also con-
tinues bill language to modify the rules governing the Corps to
allow 60 days for every Corps member to cancel their contract. Fur-
ther, the Committee encourages HRSA to explore opportunities to
provide incentives for individuals working in their home State or
the State in which they received their education.
Correctional Facilities.—While Federal and State correctional fa-
cilities are eligible for Corps scholarships and loan repayment, a
1989 Federal regulation narrowed eligibility for Corps scholarships
to exclude county jails. The Committee notes that county jails in
large metropolitan areas are often the biggest correctional facilities
in an area and encourages HRSA to work with Congress and rel-
evant stakeholders to develop a process to provide county and mu-
nicipal correctional facilities the opportunity to participate in the
Corps program if they would otherwise meet the requirements of
a National Health Service Corps service site. Within 180 days of
enactment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing detailing
implications and considerations for participation by county jails.
Maternity Care Target Areas [MCTAs].—The Committee recog-
nizes HRSA’s progress in determining MCTAs in order to begin
making loan repayment awards to maternal health practitioners,
such as OB/GYNs and Certified Nurse Midwives, who agree to
serve in MCTAs. Within the total for the Corps, the Committee in-
cludes not less than $8,000,000 to support loan repayment and
scholarships for maternity care health services in health profes-
sional shortage areas. The Committee requests that HRSA provide
a briefing on this effort within 120 days of enactment of this act.
Rural Health.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
Corps Scholarship Program, especially in combatting the rural
healthcare provider shortage, and encourages HRSA to increase the
number of scholarships provided. Providing Corps scholarships,
particularly to students from rural communities, will increase ac-
cess to medical school and help to solve the rural provider work-
force shortages throughout the United States.
Workforce Shortages.—The Committee appreciates HRSA’s ef-
forts to tackle healthcare workforce shortages across the country,
particularly in rural areas. The Committee supports the expansion
of the physician, nursing, and pharmacy workforce to meet the
growing health needs of our population. The Committee encourages
HRSA to consider ways to expand these efforts and directs HRSA
to include in the fiscal year 2027 CJ information on steps the agen-

45
cy is taking to address health professions shortages, including ef-
forts to ensure the State Loan Repayment Program is supporting
all healthcare professions. The update should include: (1) informa-
tion, by State, on what professions are benefiting from the State
Loan Repayment Program and how many individuals in each pro-
fession have received funding; and (2) the number of applicants,
broken down by profession and State. In addition, the update
should provide information on how HRSA can expand efforts to in-
clude health professionals who do not typically benefit from HRSA
workforce programs, such as pharmacists, in its educational, train-
ing, and loan repayment programs.
Training for Diversity
The Committee supports programs that improve the diversity of
the healthcare workforce. HRSA’s diversity pipeline programs help
advance patient care and ensure opportunity for all healthcare pro-
viders.
Centers of Excellence
The Committee provides $25,422,000 for the Centers of Excel-
lence [COE] program. This program provides grants to health pro-
fessions schools and other institutions to serve as resource and
education centers for the recruitment, training, and retention of
underrepresented minority students and faculty. The Committee
notes that COEs educate a disproportionate share of health profes-
sionals from minority and underserved backgrounds and address
the need for a diverse and culturally competent healthcare work-
force.
Health Careers Opportunity Program
The Committee includes $15,000,000 for the Health Careers Op-
portunity Program [HCOP]. The Committee notes that HCOPs as-
sist students from minority and economically disadvantaged back-
grounds with navigating careers into the health professions.
Faculty Loan Repayment
The Committee provides $2,310,000 for the Faculty Loan Repay-
ment Program. This program provides loan repayment to health
profession graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who serve as
faculty at eligible health professions academic institutions.
Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students
The Committee provides $55,014,000 for Scholarships for Dis-
advantaged Students. This program provides grants to eligible
health professions and nursing schools to award scholarships to
students from disadvantaged backgrounds who have financial need.
The Committee recognizes the success of the program and encour-
ages HRSA to prioritize institutions with a proven record of train-
ing diverse practitioners and placing practitioners in low-income
communities.
Midwifery Training.—The Committee continues $5,000,000 to
support grants to educate midwives to address the National short-
age of maternity care providers. The Committee encourages HRSA
to award robust funding to increase and diversify the number of

46
Certified Nurse Midwives, particularly in rural and underserved
communities.
Primary Care Training and Enhancement
The Committee provides $49,924,000 for the Primary Care Train-
ing and Enhancement [PCTE] program to support the expansion of
training in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics.
Funds may be used to develop training programs or provide direct
financial assistance to students and residents.
Administrative Academic Units.—The Committee supports the
inclusion of administrative academic units within medical schools
and requests a briefing within 60 days of enactment of this act on
HRSA’s work to support administrative academic units within med-
ical schools, including barriers to additional funding opportunities
for such units.
Community-Based Clinical Rotations for Medical Students.—The
Committee recognizes that patient care is frequently provided in a
range of community-based settings and that providing outpatient
training opportunities in underserved areas encourages long-term,
sustainable physician practice in high-need areas. The Committee
encourages HRSA to evaluate and facilitate opportunities for med-
ical schools to partner with FQHCs, Rural Health Clinics or other
healthcare facilities located in medically underserved communities
to increase medical school clinical rotations in rural and under-
served areas.
Eating Disorders Screening and Referrals.—Within the total for
PCTE, the Committee continues to support no less than $1,000,000
in coordination with SAMHSA’s Center of Excellence for Eating
Disorders, to provide trainings for primary care health profes-
sionals to screen, intervene, and refer patients to treatment for the
severe mental illness of eating disorders, as authorized under sec-
tion 13006 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114–255).
Training in Oral Health Care
The Committee provides $42,673,000 for Training in Oral Health
Care Programs, which includes not less than $13,000,000 for Gen-
eral Dentistry Programs and not less than $13,000,000 for Pedi-
atric Dentistry Programs and not less than $15,000,000 for State
Oral Health Workforce grants. This funding supports a competitive
program in fiscal year 2026 for multi-year awards. The Committee
directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for section 748 post-
doctoral training grants, predoctoral dental grants, and dental fac-
ulty loan repayment program [DFLRP] grants. The Committee di-
rects HRSA to initiate a new DFLRP grant cycle in fiscal year 2026
with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty supervising dental
students or residents and providing clinical services in dental clin-
ics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affili-
ated sites.
Medical Student Education
The Committee provides $45,000,000 to support colleges of medi-
cine at public universities located in the top half of States projected
to have a primary care provider shortage.

47
Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages
Area Health Education Centers
The Committee provides $47,000,000 for Area Health Education
Centers [AHECs]. The program links university health science cen-
ters with community health service delivery systems to provide
training sites for students, faculty, and practitioners. The program
supports three types of projects: core grants to plan and implement
programs; special initiative funding for schools that have pre-
viously received AHEC grants; and model programs to extend
AHEC programs with 50 percent Federal funding.
Health Care Simulation Labs.—The Committee provides no less
than $3,000,000 to continue competitive grants for AHEC recipi-
ents to expand experiential learning opportunities through simula-
tion labs designed to educate and train healthcare professionals
serving rural, medically underserved communities. HRSA shall in-
clude as an allowable use the purchase of simulation training
equipment.
Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training Pro-
gram
The Committee provides $113,000,000 for the Behavioral Health
Workforce Education and Training [BHWET] program. This pro-
gram establishes and expands internships or field placement pro-
grams in behavioral health serving populations in rural and medi-
cally underserved areas. The Committee expresses ongoing, strong
support for the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery
[STAR] Loan Repayment program that was previously funded
under BHWET but is now funded as a standalone program.
Addiction Medicine Fellowship [AMF] Program.—Within the
total for BHWET, the Committee includes $25,000,000 for AMF to
foster robust community-based clinical training of addiction medi-
cine or addiction psychiatry physicians in underserved, community-
based settings who see patients at various access points of care and
provide addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services
across healthcare sectors.
Community-Based Settings.—The Committee encourages HRSA
to work with grantees to use BHWET funds to support individuals
providing care in community-based settings while completing clin-
ical training requirements for licensure. This flexibility would allow
for improved access to behavioral health services in rural and un-
derserved communities across America.
Peer Support Specialists.—Within BHWET, the Committee in-
cludes $14,000,000 to fund training, internships, and certification
for mental health and substance use peer support specialists to cre-
ate an advanced peer workforce prepared to work in clinical set-
tings.
Provider Distribution.—The Committee recognizes that some
communities may disproportionately experience a high prevalence
of substance use disorders, high suicide rates, and high poverty
rates, combined with severe mental health provider shortages. The
Committee encourages HRSA to assess the distribution of behav-
ioral health students and providers who have participated in be-
havioral health workforce development programs and examine best

48
practices to support healthcare and mental health providers serv-
ing in such communities.
Geriatric Programs
The Committee provides $48,245,000 for the Geriatric Programs,
including the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program and the
Geriatrics Academic Career Awards [GACA] Program. These pro-
grams support training to integrate geriatrics into primary care de-
livery and develop academic primary care community-based part-
nerships to address gaps in healthcare for older adults.
Mental and Behavioral Health Programs
The Committee includes $44,053,000 for Mental and Behavioral
Health programs.
Graduate Psychology Education [GPE].—Within the total for
Mental and Behavioral Health programs, the Committee includes
$25,000,000 for the inter-professional GPE program to increase the
number of health service psychologists trained to provide inte-
grated services to high-need, high-demand populations in rural and
urban communities. The Committee recognizes the growing need
for highly trained mental and behavioral health professionals to de-
liver evidence-based behavioral interventions for pain management
in addressing the opioid epidemic. The Committee also notes con-
tinued mental health needs among youth and adolescents and
urges HRSA to strengthen investments in the training of health
service psychologists to help meet these demands.
Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery [STAR]
Loan Repayment Program
The Committee provides $40,000,000. This program addresses
shortages in the SUD workforce by providing for the repayment of
education loans for individuals working in a full-time SUD treat-
ment job that involves direct patient care in either a Mental Health
Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death
rate exceeds the National average. The Committee also encourages
HRSA to actively recruit SUD counselors to take advantage of its
STAR Loan Repayment Program, so that underserved communities
may benefit from the presence of these professionals.
Health Professions Workforce Information and Analysis
The Committee provides $5,663,000 for health professions work-
force information and analysis. This program provides for the col-
lection and analysis of targeted information on the Nation’s
healthcare workforce, research on high-priority workforce ques-
tions, the development of analytic and research infrastructure, and
program evaluation and assessment.
Real-Time Data to Improve U.S. Healthcare Workforce.—The
Committee recognizes the benefit of using real-time information in
order to assess whether such programs are leading to improved
physician supply in medically underserved areas. The Committee
supports development of a data dashboard for all graduate medical
education training position participants to include real-time infor-
mation on residency applications, interviewee demographics, and
residency fulfillment rates. The Committee requests a professional

49
judgment estimate for the development of such a data dashboard,
and any potential barriers, within 180 days of enactment of this
act.
Public Health Workforce Development
The Committee provides $18,000,000 for Public Health Workforce
Development. This program line, also called Public Health and Pre-
ventive Medicine, funds programs that are authorized in titles III
and VII of the PHS Act (Public Law 111–148) and supports awards
to schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, public health, and in-
tegrative medicine programs.
Nursing Workforce Development Programs
The Committee provides $303,472,000 for Nursing Workforce De-
velopment programs. These programs provide funding to address
all aspects of nursing workforce demand, including education, prac-
tice, recruitment, and retention. The Committee recognizes the se-
vere nursing shortage facing our country and the challenges this
shortfall poses to our healthcare system’s ability to meet increasing
demand. The Committee encourages the agency to engage with
stakeholders to assess current and projected shortages, identify
best practices and innovative strategies at the Federal, State, and
local levels, and make recommendations to strengthen the nursing
workforce pipeline.
Palliative Care Nursing Workforce.—Palliative care is patient
and family-centered care, involving the support of an inter-profes-
sional team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other providers
and specialists who provide care for people with serious illnesses.
As the healthcare needs of the Nation evolve and grow in com-
plexity, the Committee encourages HRSA to expand opportunities
to train and strengthen the palliative care nursing workforce
through existing programs and activities.
State-Based Nursing Workforce Centers.—The Committee notes
interest in State-based nursing workforce centers. Such centers can
collect local workforce research data, conduct strategic nursing
workforce planning and program development, support programs to
decrease workplace violence against nurses, develop programs to
increase the recruitment and retention of nurses, and coordinate
nurse leadership development programs. The Committee encour-
ages HRSA to work with Congress and stakeholders to examine
ways to establish new or enhance existing State-based nursing
workforce centers to advance training.
Strategic Partnerships.—The Committee recognizes that the triad
model of academic-clinical-community partnerships offers prom-
ising strategies for addressing nursing shortages and increasing re-
cruitment to rural areas. The Committee directs HRSA to deter-
mine the feasibility of collecting data on such partnerships, includ-
ing partnerships that receive Federal funding; the number of par-
ticipants engaging in such partnerships; the characteristics of a
successful partnership; and how preceptors play a key role in part-
nership nurse training models. The Committee directs HRSA to
provide an update on its findings in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.

50
Advanced Education Nursing
The Committee provides $89,581,000 for Advanced Education
Nursing programs, which increase the number of qualified nurses
in the workforce by improving nursing education through cur-
riculum and faculty development. The Committee recognizes the
importance of strengthening the primary care workforce and train-
ing providers to work in community-based settings, particularly by
funding Advanced Nursing Education and Residency Programs.
Certified Nurse Midwives.—The Committee includes $8,000,000
to grow and diversify the maternal and perinatal nursing workforce
by increasing and diversifying the number of Certified Nurse Mid-
wives with a focus on practitioners working in rural and under-
served communities. The program awards scholarships to students
and registered nurses [RNs] to cover the cost of tuition for the du-
ration of the nurse midwifery program.
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program.—The Committee pro-
vides $15,000,000 to support training and certification of RNs, ad-
vanced practice registered nurses [APRNs], and forensic nurses to
practice as sexual assault nurse examiners.
Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention Program
The Committee includes $64,413,000 for competitive grants with-
in the Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention program
to enhance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce
through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. With-
in this total, the Committee continues no less than $10,750,000 for
grants to enhance nurse education through the expansion of experi-
ential learning opportunities. HRSA is directed to ensure that
these grants include as an allowable use the purchase of simulation
training equipment.
RN Shortages.—The Committee provides $5,000,000 to increase
the supply of registered nurses. Further, the Committee directs
HRSA to give priority in new funding announcements to public en-
tities for training additional RNs, specifically for long-term and
acute care settings, and to give priority to applicants in States list-
ed by HRSA as having the greatest shortages.
Traineeships to Address the Nursing Shortage and Prepare Aca-
demic Faculty.—The National Academies of Science, Engineering,
and Medicine [NASEM] issued a report that provided recommenda-
tions to Congress to ease the nursing shortage in America. The
Committee recognizes the urgent need to address the nursing
shortage existing in all parts of the United States and grow the
pipeline of nurse educators to meet the demand to grow the work-
force. Therefore, the Committee encourages HRSA to provide new
traineeships and fellowships, including stipends, for eligible enti-
ties at both public and private institutions to expand opportunities
that prepare individuals for careers in nursing.
Nurse Practitioner Fellowship Program
The Committee provides $6,000,000 for grants to community-
based nurse practitioner residency and fellowship training pro-
grams that are accredited, or in the accreditation process, for prac-
ticing postgraduate nurse practitioners in primary care or behav-
ioral health, where supported education and training specialties

51
will include family, adult family, adult gerontology, pediatric, wom-
en’s healthcare, nurse midwife, and psychiatric mental health. The
Committee is concerned that the Nation remains unprepared to ad-
dress healthcare provider shortages and recognizes the importance
of primary care and behavioral health providers being prepared to
manage clinical and social complexities. The Committee directs
HRSA to give preference to FQHCs, as defined by section
1861(aa)(4) of the Social Security Act, in awarding grants.
Nurse Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment
The Committee includes $92,635,000 for Nurse Corps. This pro-
gram supports scholarships and loan repayment assistance for
nurses and nursing students committed to working in communities
with inadequate access to care.
Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment
The Committee includes $28,500,000 for Nurse Faculty Loan Re-
payment to expand the number of qualified nursing faculty nation-
wide by providing low interest loans for individuals studying to be
nurse faculty and loan cancellation for those who then go on to
work as faculty.
Nursing Workforce Diversity
The Committee includes $22,343,000 for Nursing Workforce Di-
versity to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals
from disadvantaged backgrounds by providing student stipends,
scholarships, and preparation and retention activities.
Children’s Hospitals Graduate Medical Education
The Committee provides $390,000,000 for the Children’s Hos-
pitals Graduate Medical Education [CHGME] program. The Com-
mittee strongly supports the CHGME program, which provides sup-
port for graduate medical education training programs in both am-
bulatory and inpatient settings within freestanding children’s
teaching hospitals. CHGME payments are determined by a per-
resident formula that includes an amount for direct training costs
added to a payment for indirect costs. Payments support training
of resident physicians as defined by Medicare in both ambulatory
and inpatient settings.
Pediatric Specialty Loan Repayment Program
The Committee recognizes that significant shortages of pediatric
medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists, child and ado-
lescent psychiatrists, and other pediatric mental health profes-
sionals are impeding access to care for children and adolescents in
underserved areas. The Committee includes $10,000,000 for section
775 of the PHS Act. The Committee understands that high student
loan debt is a significant barrier to providers choosing to complete
training that would enable them to provide specialized care to chil-
dren with special needs. The Committee directs HRSA to work
with stakeholders with expertise in pediatric specialty care to en-
sure that the program and application process reflects the unique
nature of pediatric specialty care, including ensuring that any clin-
ical and service hour requirements and service site eligibility cri-

52
teria are consistent with pediatric specialty practice and reflect the
regionalization of pediatric specialty care.
National Practitioner Data Bank
The Committee provides $33,500,000 for the National Practi-
tioner Data Bank. As mandated by the Health Care Quality Im-
provement Act (Public Law 99–660), the National Practitioner Data
Bank does not receive appropriated funds, but instead is financed
by the collection of user fees.
The National Practitioner Data Bank collects certain adverse in-
formation, medical malpractice payment history, and information
related to healthcare fraud and abuse. The data bank is open to
healthcare agencies and organizations that make licensing and em-
ployment decisions.
MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,170,430,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,160,680,000
The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau is to im-
prove the physical and mental health, safety, and well-being of the
Nation’s women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families.
This population includes fathers and children with special
healthcare needs.
Maternal and Child Health [MCH] Block Grant
The Committee provides $799,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant,
which provides a flexible source of funding that allows States to
target their most urgent maternal and child health needs. Within
this total, the Committee also includes funding for a number of
special projects to address the Nation’s rising rate of maternal mor-
tality. The program supports a broad range of activities, including
providing prenatal care, well-child services, and immunizations; re-
ducing infant mortality; preventing injury and violence; expanding
access to oral healthcare; addressing racial and ethnic disparities;
and providing comprehensive care through clinics, home visits, and
school-based health programs.
Indian Health Service Facilities.—The Committee encourages
HRSA to ensure the services offered through the MCH Block Grant
are provided at Indian Health Service facilities, tribally operated
health programs, and Urban Indian Health programs.
MCH Block Grant-Special Projects of Regional and National
Significance [SPRANS]
The Committee provides $196,116,000 for SPRANS. The Com-
mittee includes funding for the following activities in the following

Congenital Syphilis [CS].—The Committee is concerned by re-
ports of record high cases of CS, which is preventable during preg-
nancy and can result in bone deformities, deafness, blindness, still-
birth or death. The Committee encourages HRSA to expand efforts
to increase prenatal screening and testing throughout pregnancy
and to implement proper education for pregnant women and pro-
viders on screening, diagnosis, and treatment of CS.
Early Childhood Development Expert Grants.—The Committee
provides $10,000,000 to continue support for placements of early
childhood development experts in pediatric settings with a high
percentage of Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program
patients.
Hemophilia Programs.—The Committee strongly supports and
maintains funding for the Regional Hemophilia Network Program,
which provides grant funds to the National network of 140 Hemo-
philia Treatment Centers [HTCs]. The Committee recognizes the
importance of the Program’s work in supporting HTCs and the
model comprehensive and multi-disciplinary care they offer, includ-
ing physical therapy assessments, social work and case manage-
ment, which are vital to managing this complex, vulnerable, and
rare bleeding disorders patient community.
Infant-Toddler Court Teams.—The Committee includes
$18,000,000 to continue and expand research-based Infant-Toddler
Court Teams to change child welfare practices to improve well-
being for infants, toddlers, and their families.
Minority-Serving Institutions.—The Committee continues
$10,000,000 for a research network that is comprised of and sup-
ports minority-serving institutions to study health disparities in
maternal health outcomes and develop curricula for training health
professionals to identify and address the risks that environmental
factors pose for vulnerable mothers and women who plan to become
pregnant.
Newborn Essentials Support Toolkit.—The Committee includes
$1,000,000 to continue the Newborn Support Kit public-private
partnership program, which is consistent with the activities au-
thorized for the Special Projects of Regional and National Signifi-
cance under 42 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). The Committee recognizes dem-
onstrated successful outcomes of such programs to decrease mater-
nal mental health symptoms and financial stress. Funding shall be
used to purchase and distribute newborn supply kits, including dia-
pers, postpartum supplies, blood pressure monitors, and infant
thermometers. The Secretary shall prioritize implementation of the
program in medically underserved geographic areas, including
rural communities, tribal communities, and communities with the
highest maternal mortality rates.

54
Oral Health.—The Committee includes $5,250,000 to continue
demonstration projects to increase the implementation of inte-
grating oral health and primary care practice. The projects should
model the core clinical oral health competencies for non-dental pro-
viders that HRSA published and initially tested in its 2014 report
Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice.
Regional Pediatric Prevention Network.—The Committee provides
$25,000,000 to continue work among the Nation’s pediatric hos-
pitals and their communities to prepare for and coordinate re-
search-informed responses to future pandemics and other global
health threats.
State Maternal Health Innovation Grants.—The Committee pro-
vides $55,000,000 to support innovation among States to improve
maternal health outcomes and address disparities in maternal
health. With this funding, States collaborate with maternal health
experts to implement State-specific action plans in order to improve
access to maternal care services, identify and address workforce
needs, and support postpartum and inter-conception care services.
Stillbirth Prevention Technical Assistance.—The Committee is
encouraged by HRSA’s efforts to update its materials and guidance
to clarify that stillbirth prevention activities are an allowable use
of funds under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block
Grant program. The Committee urges HRSA to continue to provide
for ongoing technical assistance and other activities to support
States’ stillbirth prevention activities.
Maternal and Child Health Programs
Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program
The Committee provides $8,205,000 for grants and contracts to
help coordinate service delivery for individuals with sickle cell dis-
ease, including genetic counseling and testing, long-term follow-up
and care coordination, and training of health professionals.
Autism and Other Developmental Disorders
The Committee provides $56,344,000 for the Autism and Other
Developmental Disorders program. The program supports surveil-
lance, early detection, education, and intervention activities for au-
tism and other developmental disorders, as reauthorized in the Au-
tism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Sup-
port Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–60).
The Committee provides not less than $38,245,000 for the Lead-
ership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities
[LEND] programs. LEND programs are uniquely positioned to pro-
vide innovative strategies to integrate and enhance existing invest-
ments, including translating research findings on interventions,
guidelines, tools, and systems management approaches to training
settings, to communities, and into practice, and to promote life-
course considerations-from developmental screening in early child-
hood to transition to adulthood issues. The funding is critical to the
LEND’s role in providing direct clinical assessment and evidence-
based interventions. Additionally, this workforce development fund-
ing is essential to increasing the number of providers with ad-
vanced interdisciplinary training in a broad array of professional

55
disciplines to improve the identification, assessment, and care for
individuals with autism and other neurodevelopmental and related
disabilities. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue sup-
porting the program’s efforts to address a critical shortage of
healthcare professionals, serve under-represented communities,
and fulfill the expanded statutory mandate to serve individuals
across the lifespan.
Healthy Start
The Committee provides $145,250,000 for Healthy Start. The pri-
mary purpose of Healthy Start is to reduce infant mortality and
generally improve maternal and infant health in at-risk commu-
nities. Grants are awarded to State and local health departments
and nonprofit organizations to conduct and develop a package of in-
novative health and social services for pregnant women and infants
and evaluate these efforts.
Maternal Mortality.—The Committee continues to support a new
targeted expansion of an enhanced Healthy Start program model
that began in fiscal year 2023. The Committee also continues to
support nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician as-
sistants, and other maternal-child advance practice health profes-
sionals within all program sites nationwide.
Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring Initiative.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the Healthy Start blood pressure monitoring
pilot, which distributed cuff kits to 15 Healthy Start sites in 12
States. The Committee provides no less than $250,000 for more
States to benefit from this pilot project, and to the Healthy Start
program to continue to support the self-measured blood pressure
monitoring pilot, which works to identify preeclampsia during preg-
nancy at an earlier stage in high-risk communities by distributing
blood pressure cuffs and patient information. Preeclampsia, the
most dangerous form of hypertension, is a pregnancy complication
that affects as many as one in 12 pregnancies and can easily be
monitored.
Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children
The Committee provides $20,883,000 for the Heritable Disorders
in Newborns and Children program, as described in the Newborn
Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008 (Public Law 113–240). This pro-
gram provides funding to improve States’ ability to provide new-
born and child screening for heritable disorders. Newborn screen-
ing provides early identification and follow-up for treatment of in-
fants affected by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal, and/or func-
tional conditions.
Recommended Uniform Screening Panel [RUSP].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of Federal guidance, including the
significant influence of the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel
[RUSP], in State decision-making around the detection of chronic
illnesses at birth. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs HRSA to provide a briefing on the activities of
the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and
Children [ACHDNC], including efforts to promote universal screen-
ing, respond to medical breakthroughs, and any updates to the
RUSP.

56
Early Hearing Detection and Intervention
The Committee provides $18,818,000 for universal newborn hear-
ing screening and early intervention activities. This program
awards 59 competitive grants to States and territories that support
statewide systems of newborn hearing screening, audiologic diag-
nostic testing before 3 months of age, and enrollment in early inter-
vention programs before the age of 6 months.
Congenital Cytomegalovirus [cCMV].—The Committee notes that
cCMV is the most common viral infection infants are born with in
the United States and the leading non-genetic cause of hearing
loss. Emerging research has shown that early intervention treat-
ments may prevent or lessen the severity of hearing loss in infants
born with cCMV. The Committee encourages HRSA to expand ef-
forts to provide cCMV education, screening, and testing during
pregnancy.
Emergency Medical Services for Children
The Committee provides $24,334,000 for the Emergency Medical
Services for Children program, which focuses on improving the pe-
diatric components of the emergency medical services system and
improving the quality of care provided to children in the pre-hos-
pital setting. Funding is available to every State emergency med-
ical services office to improve the quality of emergency care for
children and to pay for research and dissemination of best prac-
tices.
Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Sub-
stance Use Disorders [MMHSUD]
The Committee provides $12,000,000 for the MMHSUD program,
which was reauthorized in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of
2023 (Public Law 117–328). HRSA is directed to make grants to
States to establish, improve, or maintain programs to train profes-
sionals to screen, assess, and treat for maternal depression in
women who are pregnant or who have given birth within the pre-
ceding 12 months.
According to Maternal Mortality Review Committee data in 38
States, mental health conditions accounted for over 22 percent of
pregnancy-related deaths in 2020. Maternal mental health [MMH]
conditions impact one in five pregnant or postpartum women, in-
cluding as many as one in three in high-risk populations.
MMHSUD trains healthcare providers to screen, assess, and treat
MMH conditions and substance use disorders, and provides special-
ized psychiatric consultation to providers. The Committee encour-
ages HRSA to improve or maintain existing State programs,
prioritizing States with high rates of adverse maternal health out-
comes, and to provide technical assistance to both grantee and non-
grantee States to implement activities under this program. Grants
shall include culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to

grams.
Home-Based Behavioral Healthcare Services.—The Committee
encourages the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access [PMHCA] pro-
gram State grantees to foster collaboration with organizations that
are working within communities and with families to support indi-
vidualized, comprehensive home-based behavioral healthcare serv-
ices for young people and adolescents. Where possible, the Com-
mittee encourages PMHCA recipients to share resources with pedi-
atric health professionals about programs that support comprehen-
sive family support services.
Poison Control Centers
The Committee provides $26,846,000 for Poison Control Centers.
The Committee remains concerned with longstanding geo-routing
challenges for incoming calls of poison centers. Not later than 18
months after the date of enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects HRSA to coordinate with the Federal Communications Com-
mission and leading wireless carriers, to the extent technically and
economically feasible, to identify, develop, and implement a proof-
of-concept trial of a geo-routing solution to ensure that communica-
tions with the National toll-free number are routed to the appro-
priate poison control center based on the physical location of the
contact rather than the area code of the contact device. The Com-
mittee encourages HRSA to use SAMHSA geo-routing for the 988
Lifeline as a framework for development and implementation.
Innovation for Maternal Health
The Committee includes $17,300,000 to support continued imple-
mentation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health pro-
gram’s maternal safety bundles to all U.S. States, the District of
Columbia, and U.S. territories, as well as tribal entities, and to
support capacity building, address maternity care deserts, and pro-
vide technical assistance nationwide for the implementation of the
Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program. Patient safety
bundles are a set of targeted, evidence-informed best practices that,
when implemented, improve patient outcomes and reduce maternal
mortality and severe maternal morbidity.
Within the total provided, the Committee includes $500,000 to
support the development and implementation of a resource kit for
providers, as well as correctional custody and healthcare staff, who
care for pregnant, birthing, and postpartum women who are incar-
cerated. Such resource kits should include best practices, resources,
and planning materials for use by teams in healthcare settings that
may not typically provide obstetric services or frequently care for
people in need of obstetric care.
Integrated Services for Pregnant and Postpartum Women
The Committee provides $10,000,000 to reduce adverse maternal
health outcomes and maternal deaths by incentivizing maternal
healthcare providers to provide integral healthcare services to preg-

58
nant women and new mothers to optimize maternal and infant
health outcomes.
Maternal Mental Health Hotline
The Committee provides $8,000,000 to expand support for a ma-
ternal mental health hotline. The hotline shall provide 24 hours a
day voice and text support that is culturally and linguistically ap-
propriate. Funds provided shall also be used to raise public aware-
ness about maternal mental health issues and the hotline.
Increasing Awareness.—Maternal mental health conditions im-
pact one in five pregnant and postpartum women and one in three
high-risk populations including service members, military spouses,
and rural women. Since its launch on Mother’s Day in 2022, the
Hotline has served more than 64,000 women and families across
the United States with average response times of less than 30 sec-
onds. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects HRSA to provide a report to Congress on the agency’s efforts
to increase awareness of the hotline, including any promotional ac-
tivities and coordination with stakeholders.
Support for Servicemembers.—Maternal mental health conditions
impact 36 percent of female servicemembers and military spouses,
and 60 percent of retired servicemembers. The Committee encour-
ages HRSA to train hotline staff on best practices to support the
unique needs of servicemembers, veterans, and military families
utilizing the hotline. The Committee further directs HRSA to co-
ordinate with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department
of Defense to ensure that public awareness activities reach civilian,
military, and veteran pregnant and postpartum women, as author-
ized in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (Public Law
117–328).

ease, and support for State AIDS drug assistance programs
[ADAP]. The Committee provides $900,313,000 for AIDS medica-
tions in ADAP.
Medical Nutrition Therapy and Food Bank/Home Delivered
Meals.—The Committee recognizes the value of nutrition services
as an evidence-based intervention that improves health outcomes
and lowers healthcare costs for people living with HIV/AIDS. The
Committee supports the existing nutrition services offerings, in-
cluding Medical Nutrition Therapy and Food Bank/Home Delivered
Meals, within the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and encourages
HRSA to continue these important initiatives and coordinate these
activities with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health,
where feasible.
Early Intervention Services
The Committee provides $208,970,000 for early intervention
grants. These funds are awarded competitively to primary
healthcare providers to enhance healthcare services available to
people at risk of HIV and AIDS. Funds are used for comprehensive
primary care, including counseling, testing, diagnostic, and thera-
peutic services.

departments, and other nonprofit community-based programs that
provide comprehensive primary healthcare services to populations
with or at risk for HIV.
AIDS Dental Services
The Committee provides $13,620,000 for the AIDS Dental Serv-
ices program. This program provides grants to dental schools, den-
tal hygiene schools, and post-doctoral dental education programs to
assist with the cost of providing unreimbursed oral healthcare to
patients with HIV.
The Ryan White Part F program provides for the Dental Reim-
bursement Program, which covers the unreimbursed costs of pro-
viding dental care to persons living with HIV/AIDS. Programs that
qualify for reimbursement are dental schools, hospitals with post-
doctoral dental education programs, and colleges with dental hy-
giene programs.
AIDS Education and Training Centers
The Committee provides $34,886,000 for AIDS Education and
Training Centers [AETCs], which train healthcare practitioners,
faculty, and students who care for AIDS patients outside of the tra-

60
ditional health professions education venues and supports cur-
riculum development on the diagnosis and treatment of HIV infec-
tion for health professions schools and training organizations.
Special Projects of National Significance
The Committee provides $25,000,000 for the Special Projects of
National Significance program. This program supports the develop-
ment, evaluation, and dissemination of innovative models of HIV
care and treatment to improve the retention and health outcomes

HEALTH SYSTEMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $122,009,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 127,009,000
The Committee provides is $127,009,000 for the Health Care
Systems Bureau.
The Health Care Systems Bureau protects the public health and
improves the health of individuals through efforts to support and
enhance the systems by which healthcare is delivered in America.
Organ Donation and Transplantation
The Committee provides $59,049,000 for organ donation and
transplantation activities.
Kidney Transplant Disparities.—The Committee recognizes con-
cerns that some of the metrics used at transplant hospitals may
disincentive the treatment of complex, higher risk kidney trans-
plant and directs HRSA to provide a report no later than 60 days
after enactment of this act on ways HRSA can work with trans-
plant hospitals to ensure that the metrics used do not penalize hos-
pitals for taking on more complex kidney transplant cases.
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [OPTN] Mod-
ernization Initiative.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
the OPTN Modernization Initiative, launched in March 2023, to
strengthen accountability and the performance of the nation’s
organ transplant system. The Committee is extremely concerned by
recent reports of cases involving patients with neurological signs
incompatible with organ donation. Such reports raise serious eth-
ical and legal questions, and the Committee is encouraged by the
Secretary’s recent announcement that HRSA is mandating strict
corrective actions for the entities involved. The Committee requests
a briefing within 30 days of enactment of this act and every 90
days thereafter on HRSA’s spend plan and progress toward its stat-
ed objectives and actions the Department has taken or plans to
take to improve oversight, protect patient safety, increase public
and stakeholder trust in the organ allocation process, and track
and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the initiative. Further,
as HRSA continues this work, it is critical that the needs of pedi-
atric transplant patients and their families be prioritized, and the
Committee urges HRSA to maintain the multidisciplinary commit-
tees in the OPTN system, and to require pediatric representation
on each organ-specific committee. Finally, the Committee directs
HRSA to provide an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the use
of organ tracking technology to allow organ procurement organiza-

61
tions real-time updates on an organ’s location to help improve the
safe and efficient transportation of donor organs.
OPTN Next Generation Technology.—Due to the significant fail-
ures of the OPTN’s technology in the past, the Committee is par-
ticularly interested in HRSA’s continuation of activities to develop
a technology solution to fully modernize the OPTN. The Committee
directs the Secretary to prioritize obligations from resources in the
nonrecurring expenses fund [NEF] for these activities. The Com-
mittee encourages HRSA to consider technology solutions already
adopted across HHS and the private sector, particularly those that
address complex medical and logistics supply chain challenges
while promoting patient safety, as part of a competitive process
and successful transition.
Organ Transportation Working Group.—The Committee supports
the recommendations made by the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion’s [FAA] Organ Transportation Working Group to identify best
practices for transporting organs in the cabin of airplanes. This ini-
tiative is critical for patients awaiting organ transplants, as trans-
porting organs in the cabin can reduce transit time, minimize tem-
perature fluctuations, and increase the viability of life-saving or-
gans during critical transportation windows. As part of the report,
FAA developed 20 recommendations, including five for HRSA: (1)
establish a forum for continuous discussion and communications
across the transplant community and aviation industry stakeholder
groups; (2) establish standardized data definitions, data types, and
reporting protocols for data collection in the organ transport com-
munity; (3) add granularity in data reporting by collecting trans-
portation methods and success/failure rates in addition to timing in
schedule; (4) develop a centralized data management system to col-
lect data from OPTN members, couriers, and other relevant stake-
holders; (5) share relevant incident reports with Transportation Se-
curity Administration [TSA] and airlines. The Committee strongly
supports these recommendations and directs HRSA to provide an
update to the Committee no later than 60 days after enactment of
this act on how the agency will implement these recommendations.
National Cord Blood Inventory
The Committee provides $19,266,000 for the National Cord Blood
Inventory [NCBI]. The purpose of this program is to provide funds
to cord blood banks to build an inventory of the highest quality
cord blood units for transplantation.
NCBI builds a racially and ethnically diverse inventory of high-
quality umbilical cord blood for transplantation. The Committee
applauds HRSA for increasing the number of units collected and
maintained under NCBI.
C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program
The Committee provides $33,009,000 for the C.W. Bill Young
Cell Transplantation Program. The Committee continues to support
cell transplantation through the use of bone marrow, peripheral
blood stem cells, and cord blood. The Committee appreciates
HRSA’s efforts to increase the diversity of the volunteer registry
and encourages HRSA to continue to address barriers that impact

62
a patient’s ability to identify a matched donor and access lifesaving
transplants in a timely manner.
National Hansen’s Disease Program
The Committee includes $13,706,000 for the Hansen’s Disease
Program, $122,000 for Hansen’s Disease Buildings and Facilities,
and $1,857,000 for Payments to Hawaii for Treatment of Hansen’s
Disease. These programs support inpatient, outpatient, and long-
term care, as well as training and research in Baton Rouge, Lou-
isiana; outpatient clinic sites in the continental U.S. and Puerto
Rico; related expenses for the facilities of the National Hansen’s
Disease Center; and medical care and treatment of persons with
Hansen’s disease through the Hawaii Department of Health’s com-
munity program administered from Honolulu, Hawaii.
RURAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $364,607,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 373,907,000
The Committee provides $373,907,000 for Rural Health pro-
grams.
The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy [FORHP] administers
HHS rural health programs, coordinates activities related to rural
healthcare within HHS, and analyzes the possible effects of policy
on the more than 60 million residents of rural communities.
FORHP advises the Secretary on the effects of Medicare and Med-
icaid on rural citizens’ access to care, the viability of rural hos-
pitals, and the availability of physicians and other health profes-
sionals.
Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA] Codes.—The Committee
applauds FORHP’s work to better define rural areas in difficult
and mountainous terrain areas and encourages them to continue to
work to adopt the Road Ruggedness Scale, as defined in the report
Characterizing Rugged Terrain in the United States, published by
the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research
Service.
Rural Communities Opioid Response Program [RCORP]
The Committee provides $145,000,000 for RCORP. Within the
funding provided, the Committee includes $10,000,000 to continue
at least three Rural Centers of Excellence [Centers], as established
by Public Law 115–245 and continued through Public Law 116–260
and 117–103. The Committee recognizes the success of the Centers
in addressing substance use disorders within rural communities
through various evidence-based treatment and recovery models but
is concerned about growing issues of alcohol misuse. Funding pro-
vided to the Centers may be used for research and dissemination
activities to address rural alcohol misuse.
Further, the Committee supports HRSA’s continued investment
in the current Centers and encourages HRSA to consider how the
Centers can expand their outreach into other underserved commu-
nities. Within the total provided for RCORP, the Committee con-
tinues to include $4,000,000 to support career and workforce train-
ing services and other needs related to substance use challenges

63
within the Northern Border Regional Commission’s rural regions to
assist individuals affected by a substance use disorder.
Rural Health Outreach
The Committee provides $103,975,000 for the Rural Health Out-
reach program. This program supports projects that demonstrate
new and innovative modes of outreach in rural areas, such as inte-
gration and coordination of health services. Outreach grant pro-
grams include Outreach Service Grants, Rural Network Develop-
ment Grants, Delta States Network Grant Program, Network Plan-
ning Grants, and Small Health Care Provider Quality Improve-
ment Grants.
Regional Grant Programs.—The Committee includes not less
than the fiscal year 2025 level for the Delta States Rural Develop-
ment Network Grant program, including not less than $15,000,000
for the Delta Region Community Health Systems Development pro-
gram. The Committee provides no less than $5,000,000 for HRSA’s
collaboration with the Northern Border Regional Commission to
provide direct support to member States and help underserved
rural communities with planning and implementing service coordi-
nation improvements that better population health. Lastly, the
Committee provides no more than $2,500,000 for HRSA’s collabora-
tion with the Appalachian Regional Commission.
Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies
[RMOMS].—The Committee provides no less than $13,000,000 for
RMOMS to support grants to improve access to and continuity of
maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities by increasing
the delivery of and access to preconception, pregnancy, labor and
delivery, and postpartum services, as well as developing sustain-
able financing models for the provision of maternal and obstetrics
care. The Committee encourages HRSA to examine efforts to sup-
port collaborative innovation networks to improve maternal and in-
fant health outcomes and reduce preventable maternal mortality
and severe maternal morbidity by improving prenatal care, labor
care, birthing, and postpartum care services in rural areas.
Rural Health Research
The Committee provides $11,076,000 for the Rural Health Re-
search program, which funds publicly available and policy relevant
research on rural health to assist providers and Federal, State, and
local governments in addressing challenges faced by rural commu-
nities. Additional research on the significant and pervasive chal-
lenges faced by rural Americans in accessing healthcare in support
of mental health, substance use, nutrition and healthy eating,
chronic health management, among other critical needs, requires
additional policy research capacity to inform solutions to these im-
portant issues. The Committee encourages HRSA to consider oppor-
tunities for additional research studies within the funds provided.
Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants
The Committee provides $66,277,000 for Rural Hospital Flexi-
bility grants and the Small Hospital Improvement Program. Under
these grant programs, HRSA works with States to provide support
and technical assistance to Critical Access Hospitals and other

64
small, rural hospitals to focus on quality and performance improve-
ment and to integrate emergency medical services.
The Committee is keenly aware of the significant challenges fac-
ing emergency care for rare and chronic disease patients in rural
America. Rural emergency medical service [EMS] providers have
gaps in education that can lead to disparate outcomes for rural
rare and chronic disease patients based on delays in proper care,
administration of emergency prescription medications, or unfore-
seen side effects or drug interactions occurring during medical
interventions. Without closing these care gaps, rare and chronic
disease patients face risks to their health and lives in the event of
an emergency. Therefore, the Committee encourages HRSA to
allow education for the administration of patient-held drugs for
rural rare and chronic disease patients for rural EMS personnel as
an eligible use of funding from the Emergency Services Supplement
of the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant Program.
Cybersecurity.—The Committee urges HRSA to clarify that funds
from the Small Hospital Improvement Program may be used to
support cybersecurity measures including purchases of hardware,
software, and training.
State Offices of Rural Health
The Committee provides $13,500,000 for State Offices of Rural
Health. These offices help States strengthen rural healthcare deliv-
ery systems by enabling them to coordinate care and improve sup-
port and outreach in rural areas.
Black Lung Clinics
The Committee provides $12,190,000 for the Black Lung Clinics
program. This program funds clinics that treat respiratory and pul-
monary diseases of active and retired coal miners, steel mill work-
ers, agricultural workers, and others with occupationally related
respiratory and pulmonary impairments. These clinics reduce the
incidence of high-cost inpatient treatment for these conditions.
Radiation and Exposure Screening and Education Program
The Committee provides $1,889,000 for activities authorized by
the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Public Law 109–482).
This program provides grants for the education, prevention, and
early detection of radiogenic cancers and diseases resulting from
exposure to uranium during mining and milling at nuclear test
sites.
Rural Residency Planning and Development
The Committee provides $14,000,000 for the Rural Residency
Planning and Development program. The Committee commends
FORHP for efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas
and supports continuation and expansion of the program to develop
new rural residency programs, or Rural Training Tracks.
The Committee provides no more than $2,000,000 to support
family medicine/obstetrics training programs in States with high
infant morbidity rates. The funding will reduce infant mortality
and maternal morbidity by improving the availability and accessi-
bility of prenatal care through increasing family medicine/obstetrics

65
training programs and graduates, increasing Family Medicine and
OB/GYN faculty to train physicians, and by providing equipment,
such as ultrasound, electronic fetal monitors, and telemedicine
equipment with the training and support for this equipment to
rural areas. HRSA is directed to brief the Committee on its plans
no less than 15 days prior to releasing a Funding Opportunity An-
nouncement.
Rural Hospital Stabilization Pilot Program
The Committee includes $6,000,000 for the Rural Hospital Sta-
bilization Pilot program that started in fiscal year 2024. The pro-
gram is intended to provide support to at-risk rural hospitals to en-
hance or expand service lines to retain healthcare services locally
and increase service volume and revenue that will enhance hos-
pitals’ financial viability. HRSA is directed to prioritize applica-
tions from hospitals that do not have Medicare Critical Access Hos-
pital designation and are at risk of closure.
FAMILY PLANNING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $286,479,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 286,479,000
The Committee provides $286,479,000 for the title X Family
Planning program. This program supports preventive and primary
healthcare services at clinics nationwide.
HRSA-WIDE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM SUPPORT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $219,588,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,078,036,000
The Committee provides $1,078,036,000 for HRSA-wide activi-
ties. Within the total, $150,000,000 is provided for program man-
agement.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—Within the total for pro-
gram management, the Committee also includes $873,748,000 for
projects financing the construction and renovation (including equip-
ment) of healthcare and other facilities and for one-time grants
supporting other health-related activities. The projects are specified
in the table at the end of this Committee Report.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter,
the Committee directs HRSA to provide a report detailing the sta-
tus of CDS funding for the previous three fiscal years. Such a re-
port shall be presented in Excel format and include a project de-
scription, House and Senate requestors, the type of award, total ob-
ligations, total disbursements, and the percent disbursed.
Addressing Chronic Disease.—The Committee recognizes the Ad-
ministration’s focus on addressing chronic disease, including the
proposed Make America Healthy Again [MAHA] Initiative and its
approach to addressing the prevalence of chronic disease and child-
hood obesity. The Committee urges HRSA to work with the Office
of the Assistant Secretary for Health to ensure coordination of
these efforts across the Department. Within 30 days of enactment
of this act, the Committee directs HRSA to provide a briefing on
efforts to utilize the principles of the MAHA Initiative to inform ac-
tivities throughout HRSA’s programs.

66
Oral Health Literacy.—Within the total provided for HRSA-wide
activities, the Committee includes $300,000 to support the develop-
ment of an oral health awareness and education campaign across
relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program,
Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White
HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health.
Telehealth
The Committee provides $42,050,000 for the Office for the Ad-
vancement of Telehealth [OAT], which promotes the effective use
of technologies to improve access to health services for people who
are isolated from healthcare and to provide distance education for
health professionals. The Committee strongly supports OAT and
their mission to expand high quality medical care to rural commu-
nities that do not have adequate access to medical providers includ-
ing many medical specialties.
Technology-Enabled Collaborative Learning.—The Committee
provides $8,500,000 as authorized in Public Law 116–260 to con-
tinue the use of technology-enabled collaborative learning and ca-
pacity building models. This collaborative model of medical edu-
cation and care management, often referred to as Project ECHO
[Extension for Community Health Outcomes], helps clinicians pro-
vide expert-level care to patients wherever they live, and increases
access to specialty treatment in rural and underserved areas for a
variety of conditions. The Committee recognizes that HRSA has ini-
tiated activities to allow grantees to explore addressing Alzheimer’s
disease. The Committee encourages HRSA to expand and support
such activities, including improving Alzheimer’s person-centered
care coordination and improving care transitions.
Telehealth Centers of Excellence [Centers].—The Committee pro-
vides $8,500,000 for the existing Centers to continue to validate
technologies and reimbursement mechanisms, establish training
protocols, and develop comprehensive templates for States to inte-
grate telehealth into their State health provider networks. The
Centers identify best practices, serve as national training resources
and test the efficacy of different telehealth clinical applications.
The Centers serve to promote the adoption of telehealth programs
across the country by validating technology, establishing training
protocols, and providing a comprehensive template for States to in-
tegrate telehealth into their State health provider network. Fund-
ing should serve to promote the adoption of telehealth services na-
tionwide and help address the access to care issue faced by rural
America. The Committee directs HRSA to continue funding exist-
ing sites with the funds provided.
Telehealth Network Grants.—The Committee expresses support
for the Telehealth Network Grant program in addressing rural
health emergencies and encourages HRSA to include telepharmacy
as an area of interest for future awards.
Telemental Health for Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupa-
tions.—The Committee recognizes the persistent barriers to access-
ing mental healthcare for individuals in farming, fishing, and for-
estry occupations and other medically underserved populations,
particularly in rural areas. The Committee encourages HRSA, in
collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, to consider op-

67
portunities to support home-based telemental health services to
help meet the unique needs of these populations.
Office of Pharmacy Affairs
The Committee provides $12,238,000 for the Office of Pharmacy
Affairs [OPA]. OPA administers the 340B drug-pricing program,
which requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts or rebates
to a set of programs and hospitals that serve a disproportionate
share of low-income patients. The 340B program is a critical life-
line to many of its program participants, including FQHCs, FQHC
Look-Alikes, children’s hospitals, Ryan White HIV/AIDS clinics,
and other safety-net hospitals and providers. These covered entities
are model stewards of the program and reinvest 340B savings to
‘‘stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible, reaching more
eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services,’’ as
Congress intended.
The Committee is concerned that manufacturers continue to deny
340B pricing for drugs purchased by covered entities for use in con-
tract pharmacies, which threatens the ability of safety-net pro-
viders to care for patients in need. The Committee urges HRSA to
continue to take actions to safeguard covered entities’ lawful access
to discounted drugs.
VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,200,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,200,000
The Committee includes $15,200,000 for administrative costs as-
sociated with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The Na-
tional Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides compensa-
tion for individuals with vaccine-associated injuries or deaths.
Funds are awarded to reimburse medical expenses, lost earnings,
pain and suffering, legal expenses, and death benefits. The Vaccine
Injury Compensation Trust Fund is funded by excise taxes on cer-
tain vaccines recommended for routine administration to children
and pregnant women.
Completion of Medical Reviews.—The Committee requests a re-
port within 6 months of enactment of this act detailing HRSA’s use
of intelligent document processing [IDP] and artificial intelligence
[AI] to complete medical reviews for individuals seeking compensa-
tion from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund,
including how IDP and AI have contributed to reducing reviewing
times and reductions in the backlog of cases, as well as guardrails
in place to ensure that medical reviews are accurate and complete.
COVERED COUNTERMEASURES PROCESS FUND
Appropriation, 2025 ............................................................................... $7,000,000
Committee Recommendation ................................................................ 7,000,000
The Committee includes $7,000,000 for compensation of injury
claims associated with countermeasures costs to administer the
Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program [CICP]. The CICP
provides benefits to individuals who are seriously injured as a re-
sult of the administration or use of covered countermeasures.

68
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
The Committee provides a program level of $9,152,090,000 for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which in-
cludes $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the En-
ergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act
[EEOICPA], and $1,398,375,000 in transfers from the Prevention
and Public Health [PPH] Fund.
The activities of CDC focus on several major priorities: providing
core public health infrastructure and functions; detecting and re-
sponding to urgent health threats; monitoring the Nation’s health
using sound scientific methods; preventing the leading causes of ill-
ness, injury, and death; assuring the Nation’s preparedness for
emerging infectious diseases and potential pandemics; and pro-
viding training, support, and leadership for the public health work-
force.

The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases is $913,291,000,
which includes $554,958,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund.
The mission of the National Center for Immunization and Res-
piratory Diseases is the prevention of disease, disability, and death
through immunization and by control of respiratory and related
diseases.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol-
lowing activities in the following amounts:

317 Immunization Program.—The Committee recognizes CDC’s
immunization program plays a fundamental role in achieving na-
tional immunization goals and sustaining high vaccination cov-
erage. In addition, this program underpins the protection of all
children being vaccinated, even those fully insured, by providing
Federal, State, and local resources to investigate outbreaks, con-
duct surveillance, and provide public awareness campaigns to ad-
dress vaccine hesitancy that continues to be the root cause of out-
breaks for measles and other preventable diseases. The Committee
continues to expect funding be used to promote vaccinations for
vaccine preventable diseases [VPDs] as well as address vaccine
hesitancy using well-established science. CDC is encouraged to ex-
pand the existing immunization infrastructure, including imple-
menting new strategies for hard-to-reach populations, such as those
who may be vaccine-hesitant and those who are underserved due
to socioeconomic or other reasons. The Committee requests an up-
date in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the rate of routine vaccination

69
across all ages, as well as a forward-looking plan to administer
missed doses.
Accelerate the Elimination of HPV-Related Cancer and Disease.—
Human papillomavirus [HPV]-related cancers remain an alarming
public health concern in the United States, impacting nearly
40,000 Americans each year and is the leading cause of cervical
cancer. Each year, approximately 200,000 women are diagnosed
with cervical pre-cancer, 13,000 women are diagnosed with cervical
cancer caused by HPV, and approximately 4,000 women die from
cervical cancer in the United States. The evidence shows that HPV
vaccination is extremely effective at preventing over 90 percent of
HPV-related cancers when given between the recommended ages of
9 and 12. Yet, CDC data from 2023 shows that only 61 percent of
children ages 13–17 were up to date with HPV vaccination, which
is significantly less than the ‘‘Healthy People 2030’’ goal of 80 per-
cent. While all childhood and adolescent vaccinations declined dur-
ing the pandemic, the HPV vaccine rates experienced the largest
decrease and have been the slowest to rebound to pre-pandemic
levels. The Committee urges CDC to take immediate action to ex-
pand access to HPV vaccination, including by: updating the immu-
nization information system at the Federal level to enable stand-
ardized forecasting of HPV vaccination at age 9 across the country;
supporting providers and trusted voices to engage patients with a
strong recommendation for HPV vaccination as cancer prevention;
and continuing to reduce health disparities and barriers to care for
underserved communities.
Acute Flaccid Myelitis [AFM].—The Committee recommends CDC
continue its work to review suspected cases of AFM, examine pos-
sible risk factors and causes of AFM, and update clinicians about
AFM diagnosis, management, and possible treatment options.
Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices [ACIP].—ACIP
serves a critical role in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The Committee recognizes the essential role of experts serving on
ACIP who have the experience necessary to make informed rec-
ommendations regarding vaccine policy, which also serves to en-
sure the public’s trust in ACIP and its recommendations. Congress
has codified, under several Federal statutes, policies that link to
ACIP’s recommendations for vaccine-preventable diseases, includ-
ing requirements for insurance coverage of certain vaccinations. In
order to promote transparency, the Committee directs CDC to work
in collaboration with medical professional societies to help deter-
minate any updates necessary for the immunization schedules.
Cost Estimates.—The Committee reiterates the request for the
Fiscal Year 2024 report, included in Public Law 118–47, and re-
quests that the report on estimated funding needs of the Section
317 Immunization Program subsequently be updated and sub-
mitted not later than February 1, 2026, to the Committees on Ap-
propriations. The updated report should include an estimate of op-
timum State and local operations funding, as well as a discussion
of the role of the 317 Program, as coverage for vaccination under
public and private resources continues to evolve. Estimates should
also be included to address the needs of outbreak investigation and
response, particularly as measles cases are increasing. The Com-
mittee also requests that the report include specific information on

70
the estimated cost to fully address evidence-based public health
strategies that could be funded through CDC to improve coverage
for HPV and influenza.
Long COVID.—The Committee encourages CDC to monitor and
track incidence of Long COVID among children and adults, includ-
ing developing a patient registry for Long COVID.
National Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that the National Perinatal Hepatitis B Program
[PHBPP] is critical to preventing chronic liver disease and liver
cancer. The Committee is aware that hepatitis B is most commonly
spread from mother-to-child due to blood exchange during the
birthing process, and that approximately 90 percent of children
who are exposed to the hepatitis B virus will develop a chronic in-
fection if they do not receive proper care. PHBPP provides integral
services to prevent lifelong chronic liver disease, such as tracking
perinatal hepatitis B infections, providing the hepatitis B birth
dose, and ensuring hepatitis B immunization series completion for
infants exposed to hepatitis B. The Committee urges CDC to main-
tain PHBPP, and to continue to fund all current participants in the
program in order to eliminate one of the leading causes of liver
cancer.
Non-Influenza Respiratory Viruses.—Respiratory viruses cause
substantial illness and death in the United States, especially in
young children, older adults, and people with underlying health
conditions. The Committee recognizes the importance of a strong
capacity at CDC to address respiratory viruses and supports CDC’s
work to address respiratory illnesses holistically, with the capacity
to identify and assess characteristics of viruses to inform vaccines
and therapeutics, quantify the burden such viruses place on the
health of Americans, and the effectiveness of vaccines and other
preventive measures.
Promoting Routine Vaccination.—The Committee is concerned
about declining rates of vaccination among children ages 24
months and entering kindergarten, resulting in increased out-
breaks in preventable, infectious diseases including measles and
whooping cough across States. The Committee requests CDC pro-
vide an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the vaccine education
efforts and the rate of routine vaccination across all ages, as well
as an update on the plan to administer missed doses, prioritizing
areas with the largest reduction in routine coverage rates. CDC
should include updated recommendations about what other tools it
could employ to address this issue, as well as a plan to strengthen
efforts to combat misinformation about vaccines and vaccination,
which are contributing to confusion and hesitancy.
Vaccines for Children Program.—The Vaccines for Children
[VFC] program provides safe, effective, and life-saving immuniza-
tions for millions of children each year, including the hepatitis B
immunization. The hepatitis B immunization alone has prevented
90,100 childhood deaths in the U.S. since 1994—the fourth highest
number of deaths prevented out of all 14 of the childhood immuni-
zations. Additionally, all vaccines in the VFC program have gone
through multiple rounds of scientific review and rigorous approval
processes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and ACIP.
The hepatitis B vaccine has been administered over 1 billion times

71
since its discovery—a clear testament to its safety and efficacy. The
Committee urges CDC to continue to fund and maintain the VFC
in an effort to prevent chronic illness and death in the United
States.
HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, AND
TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,391,056,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,381,056,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases
[STDs], and Tuberculosis Prevention [TB] is $1,381,056,000.
The Center administers CDC’s activities on HIV/AIDS, viral hep-
atitis, STDs, and TB, with the exception of the Global AIDS pro-
gram, which is housed in the Global Health Center.
The Committee provides funding for the following activities in
the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on
Domestic HIV/AIDS Prevention and Research.................................................................................................. $1,013,712,000

Tuberculosis ..................................................................................................................................................... 137,034,000
Infectious Diseases and Opioid Epidemic ....................................................................................................... 23,000,000
Ending the HIV Epidemic [EHE] Initiative.—The Committee in-
cludes $220,000,000 for the EHE Initiative. The Committee sup-
ports efforts to increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]
medication that prevents HIV infection. CDC is encouraged to sup-
port the building blocks of a national program to increase aware-
ness of PrEP, including by increasing access to PrEP medication,
laboratory services, essential support services such as case man-
agement, counseling, linkage, and adherence services, robust PrEP
outreach and education activities, and PrEP provider capacity ex-
pansion.
Hepatitis.—The Committee encourages efforts to eliminate the
public health threat of viral hepatitis and to implement and help
fund the HHS National Viral Hepatitis Strategic Plan, which offers
a framework to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat.
The Committee encourages CDC to expand the viral hepatitis dis-
ease tracking and surveillance capabilities of States to permit an
effective targeting of resources and evaluation of program effective-
ness. In pursuit of this goal, the Committee recommends greater
emphasis and access to testing for both hepatitis B and hepatitis
D. The Committee is aware of the November 2021 ACIP rec-
ommendation that all adults between ages 19 and 59 be vaccinated
for hepatitis B and the March 2023 CDC recommendation that all
adults be screened for hepatitis B. The Committee urges a coordi-
nated Federal effort to implement these goals. The Committee
urges CDC to continue disease tracking and surveillance for acute
and chronic viral hepatitis A, B, and C in States and jurisdictions,
which will save lives and allow for effective and efficient distribu-

72
tion of resources. The Committee requests an update on the preva-
lence and incidence of hepatitis D and the opportunities to enhance
the analysis of this disease in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
HIV Prevention and Treatment.—The Committee recognizes the
continued threat posed by HIV, which remains on the rise in many
communities across the United States. There are approximately
32,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year, and pre-
venting a single new infection can result in an average of $850,000
in lifetime healthcare cost savings. The Committee underscores the
importance of preserving targeted Federal funding for HIV surveil-
lance, testing, linkage to care, and prevention and treatment serv-
ices and notes that State and local health departments require suf-
ficient resources to contain and reduce the spread of HIV. In addi-
tion, the Committee recognizes the transformative impact of contin-
ued biomedical innovations in turning HIV/AIDS from a fatal dis-
ease into a chronic, manageable condition, as well as a preventable
condition through PrEP, and underscores the importance of pre-
serving targeted funding to ensure access to essential HIV treat-
ment and prevention medicines, including long acting injectables
for HIV prevention. The Committee continues to support invest-
ment in four key strategic areas that are essential to ending the
HIV epidemic: (1) HIV testing and diagnosis of people living with
HIV; (2) linkage to care and rapid initiation of HIV treatment; (3)
connection to HIV prevention services, including PrEP; and (4) dis-
ease surveillance and rapid response to potential HIV outbreaks.
Infectious Diseases and Opioids.—The Committee encourages
CDC to prioritize jurisdictions with the highest age-adjusted mor-
tality rate related to SUDs and acute hepatitis C infection. CDC is
also encouraged to prioritize jurisdictions that are experiencing
outbreaks or emerging clusters of infectious diseases associated
with drug use, including those not eligible for EHE funding.
Sexually Transmitted Infections [STIs].—The Committee included
$10,000,000 for fiscal years 2023–2025 to advance the grant period
for the STI program forward one month. For fiscal year 2026, the
Committee provides $164,310,000 which will allow the program to
operate at the same fiscal level and grant year as provided for in
fiscal year 2025. The Committee is concerned by the high rates of
sexually transmitted infections in the United States, particularly
the increase in syphilis and congenital syphilis. The Committee in-
cludes funding to combat and prevent the high incidence of STIs.
The Committee directs CDC to work with other agencies, as appro-
priate, to develop innovative approaches including the use of tele-
health platforms and at home specimen collection to increase
screening, treatment, and education to curb the spread of STIs in
vulnerable populations.
Subawards.—The Committee is concerned about the account-
ability of subawards made with funds appropriated for infectious
diseases and the opioid epidemic and directs CDC to track and
monitor subawards.
Tribal Tuberculosis.—The Committee is concerned about the in-
sufficient staffing of tuberculosis technicians in Tribal areas. The
Committee encourages CDC in conjunction with State and local
health departments, to continue supporting TB prevention and

73
treatment activities in populations at highest risk for TB, including
American Indian and Alaska Native communities.
Tuberculosis [TB].—The Committee is concerned, that despite
the United States having one of the lowest incidence rates of TB
in the world, an outbreak in January 2025 caused 2 deaths, and
67 persons developed latent TB in Kansas. Delays in care for peo-
ple with TB and postponement of identification and treatment of
individuals with latent TB infection stalls efforts to eliminate TB
in the United States. The Committee encourages CDC to work to
ensure resources are available for TB screening, identification,
treatment, and prevention services.
EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $760,272,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 763,272,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases is $763,272,000, which
includes $52,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund.
The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Dis-
eases aims to detect, prevent, and control infectious diseases from
spreading, whether they are naturally occurring, unintentional, or
the result of terrorism.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for the fol-
lowing activities in the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on
Antibiotic Resistance Initiative appropriations ............................................................................................... $197,000,000
Vector-Borne Diseases appropriations............................................................................................................. 64,603,000

Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Transfer from Prevention and Public Health Fund........................... 40,000,000
Healthcare-Associated Infections Transfer from Prevention and Public Health Fund.................................... 12,000,000
Advanced Molecular Detection [AMD].—The Committee includes
$40,000,000 and recognizes the critical role the AMD program
plays in bringing cutting edge technology to the front lines of public
health by harnessing the power of advanced sequencing methods
and high performance computing with bioinformatics and epidemi-
ology expertise to study pathogens. The Committee commends CDC
for advancing research in the critical area of lethal bacteria and
special pathogens. However, the Committee remains concerned
about the increasingly dangerous threat to public health of emerg-
ing and dangerous bacterial pathogens that can be difficult or im-
possible to grow in laboratory settings and can disproportionately
affect health equity of underrepresented populations. Further re-
search is required in advanced DNA sequencing to speed the devel-
opment of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The Committee
requests a briefing on the advanced DNA sequencing and detection

74
of novel emerging and dangerous pathogens no later than 180 days
after enactment of this act.
Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee continues to
support the administration’s proposal to address the problem of
antimicrobial resistant bacteria and fungi through a ‘‘One Health’’
approach and by tracking and preventing the spread of resistance
at the local, regional, national and global levels. The Committee
notes the complexities in conducting surveillance of antimicrobial
resistance. The Committee directs CDC to publish a report publicly
describing national trends in the prescription of antibiotics. The re-
port shall identify recommendations for how antibiotic stewardship
programs could be improved, and what steps should be taken for
Congress to help physicians improve appropriate use of antibiotics.
Additionally, the Committee recognizes the important role played
by CDC’s Global Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory and Re-
sponse Network in detecting and responding to threats, including
through the Antibiotic Resistance in Communities and Hospitals
[ARCH] initiative. The Committee urges continued investment in
ARCH, which is working in six countries to better understand, and
develop effective strategies to prevent, the spread of high-risk,
multi-drug resistant organisms in communities and hospitals lo-
cally and globally. The Committee also strongly encourages CDC to
increase awareness of the elevated risk of drug-resistant infections
that impact patients, especially those with cancer. The Committee
urges CDC to educate physicians and patients on infection preven-
tion and antibiotic stewardship as well as a focus on appropriate
antibiotic use in the cancer patient population.
Importation of Dogs.—The Committee understands the role of
CDC in preventing the spread of disease, however, certain changes
to the final rule entitled ‘‘Control of Communicable Disease; For-
eign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats’’ were not included
in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and did not receive public
comment. The burden of such changes on pene-exclaves and com-
munities near the border of a rabies-free or low-risk country should
be reviewed and mitigated by CDC. The Committee views CDC’s
efforts to modify implementation of the rule as a step forward. The
Committee directs CDC to maintain the current pause on imple-
mentation of the rule and further directs CDC to restart the rule
process in order to consider additional ways to ensure that the
transport of dogs into the country by rescue organizations, citizens
who cross the border for work or other daily activities, including
sporting events, and U.S. employees stationed overseas traveling
with their pets are not unreasonably inhibited. The Committee also
requests that CDC evaluate any flexibilities to the 6-months of age
requirement, in order to ensure dogs from rabies-free or low-risk
countries, and their owners or potential owners, are not unneces-
sarily penalized by the final rule. The Committee requests a brief-
ing within 60 days of enactment on the status of this rule.
Lyme Disease and Related Tick-Borne Illnesses.—The Committee
provides continued funding for programs authorized under the Kay
Hagan Tick Act (Public Law 116–94) to promote a public health ap-
proach to combat rising cases of tick-borne diseases. In distributing
these funds, the Committee directs CDC to prioritize entities fo-
cused on Lyme disease and related tick-borne diseases in the areas

75
of surveillance, control, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and edu-
cation. The Committee encourages CDC to execute the Lyme and
tick-borne disease portion of the National Strategy for Vector-borne
Disease in order to accelerate measures to improve Alpha-gal Syn-
drome surveillance, patient care, and public awareness with an em-
phasis on healthcare provider education, in keeping with the three
public health priorities identified in the CDC 2024 report. The
Committee recognizes the growing public health threat of Lyme
disease and related tick-borne diseases and directs CDC to provide
support in endemic areas as well as areas not yet considered en-
demic. Given the impact of Lyme disease and the status of ongoing
clinical trials, the Committee requests a report within 180 days of
enactment on CDC’s research to date and recommendations on ac-
tions needed to facilitate a successful Lyme disease vaccine rollout
that will build confidence and encourage uptake should a vaccine
be approved by the FDA.
Mosquito Surveillance and Control Activities.—The Committee
urges CDC to enhance capacity and expand nation-wide surveil-
lance of vector-borne disease through an Internet-based program
called VectorSurv. The Committee is aware that this modernized,
data management and analysis system is used by vector control
and state public health agencies in the U.S. It is currently in use
in a growing number of States and the U.S.–Affiliated Pacific Is-
lands. Mosquito control and public health agencies that use the
VectorSurv system are able to manage and analyze surveillance
and control data related to mosquitoes, ticks, arboviruses, and
other vector-borne diseases
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [ME/
CFS].—Given that a subset of patients with post-acute COVID–19
and other post-infectious syndromes meet the diagnostic criteria for
ME/CFS, the Committee continues to encourage CDC to develop a
national epidemiological and disease tracking study of post-infec-
tious syndromes prevalence, specifically the rates of ME/CFS in
adults. The Committee encourages CDC to strengthen collaboration
with (1) interagency partners, (2) disease experts and stakeholders,
and (3) the NIH’s Collaborative Research Centers. Additionally, the
Committee urges CDC to conduct a series of epidemiological stud-
ies into the causes, diagnosis, and risk factors of ME/CFS. The
Committee expects CDC to engage physicians and patients in an
effort to increase awareness of ME/CFS and disseminate updated
clinical guidance. Finally, the Committee supports CDC’s successful
Project ECHO-style primary care provider education programs and
encourages CDC to explore expanding the program to additional
States and regions, with a special focus on rural and underserved
communities.
Mycotic Diseases.—The Committee supports CDC’s efforts relat-
ing to mycotic diseases, including its collaboration with the Valley
Fever Institute, Valley Fever Center for Excellence, and the Cocci
Study Group. As part of this effort, the Committee urges CDC to
grow its work to improve surveillance, awareness, and diagnostics
for coccidioidomycosis and other fungal diseases. The Committee
also urges CDC to prioritize national action plans or programs that
seek to increase disease surveillance, medical stewardship, and pa-
tient education and awareness activities; biothreat readiness or ac-

76
tivities that deliver expedited and actionable results at the point-
of-care, provide potential to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations or
escalations of care, or aid the government’s ability to halt the
spread of deadly fungal infections nationally; and medical products,
such as diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, that work against a pri-
ority fungal pathogen with particular focus on novel products that
create new product classes capable of spurring future product
types. The Committee directs CDC to fund these activities at not
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
National Healthcare Safety Network [NHSN].—The Committee
includes $24,000,000 for NHSN and recognizes the critical value of
this system for healthcare quality measurement and improvement,
as well as supporting national security needs for situational aware-
ness of health systems’ capacity during major outbreaks and pan-
demic responses. The Committee supports the modernization of the
system’s infrastructure resulting in increased timeliness and accu-
racy, reduced burden on healthcare facilities, and the ability to col-
lect urgent data as called for by the National Biodefense Strategy
to create an enduring domestic all-hazards hospital data collection
capability.
Prion Disease Surveillance.—The Committee is concerned that
Chronic wasting disease [CWD], a fatal condition in cervids (deer,
elk, and moose) caused by misfolded prions, has been detected in
over 30 States and all four regions of the country. Monitoring the
prevalence of prion diseases, including determining a disease’s inci-
dence and whether it was acquired from animals or other humans,
is critical. In light of scientific observations regarding the Nation-
wide spread of CWD and concerns about the potential for cross-spe-
cies transmissions to humans and food production animals, the
Committee includes $8,000,000 for surveillance efforts of human
prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, through the
National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center and CDC.
Quarantine and Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance [TGS].—
The Committee includes a $2,000,000 increase for this program
and supports efforts to detect pathogens early and enhance global
biosecurity efforts through the Traveler-based Genomic Surveil-
lance program. The Committee is aware of the expansion of the
TGS program and its ability to detect over 60 pathogens collected
through aircraft wastewater and nasal swabs from voluntary trav-
elers arriving at eight international U.S. based airports and rec-
ommends continuing to advance these activities through resources
made available in this bill and from prior years’ appropriations bal-
ances. This capability has been transformative in advancing the
Nation’s pathogen surveillance capabilities to provide early warn-
ing for detection, characterization and response, including assess-
ments of medical countermeasure efficacy.
Sepsis.—The Committee includes $5,000,000 to support CDC’s
ongoing work for expanded data collection related to sepsis and the
Sepsis Core Elements through NHSN and the Division of
Healthcare Quality Promotion’s work to develop sepsis quality
measures. The Committee recognizes the importance of developing,
in coordination with CMS, measures to improve the detection of
sepsis and outcomes for patients with sepsis. These include a hos-
pital sepsis programs’ structural measure to address the implemen-

77
tation of structures and activities to improve the recognition and
care of patients with sepsis, the Adult Sepsis Event outcome meas-
ure that will assess the number of cases and outcomes of adult pa-
tients hospitalized with sepsis, and the Pediatric Sepsis Event
measure that will be used to estimate the National burden of pedi-
atric sepsis. The Committee requests CDC release an annual report
on hospital use of the Sepsis Core Elements, which includes how
many hospitals use the Core Elements and CDC plans for further
analysis that detail success and barriers to implementation of the
sepsis Core Elements.
Vector-Borne Diseases [VBDs].—The Committee is concerned
about the risk of a vector-borne infectious disease outbreak in the
United States and our readiness to quickly respond to and stop its
spread. The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for con-
tinued implementation of the Kay Hagan Tick Act and to enhance
capacity to expand nation-wide surveillance of vector-borne disease.
The Committee intends that this additional funding will also sup-
port the purposes of the Strengthening Mosquito Abatement for
Safety and Health provisions in the All-Hazards Preparedness and
Advancing Innovation Act (Public Law 116–22).
Wastewater Surveillance.—The Committee remains encouraged
by CDC’s infectious disease surveillance work through wastewater
surveillance that partners with health laboratories and academic
institutions to track multiple existing infectious disease threats si-
multaneously and to quickly pivot to detect both the resurgence of
known pathogens and the emergence of new threats. The Com-
mittee continues to underscore the importance of a wastewater sur-
veillance system that can serve as a national early-warning system
for infectious diseases with broad geographic representation that
strategically incorporates sites across the country to strengthen
early detection and biosecurity and shares results publicly to help
inform communities and protect Americans. The Committee directs
CDC to provide details regarding the status of wastewater surveil-
lance including specifications for the number, composition, capabili-
ties, and geographic distribution of sites in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
This information should also include recommendations regarding
the funding required annually to create a national wastewater sur-
veillance system for infectious diseases as well as an analysis of
spending on wastewater surveillance for fiscal years 2023–2026.
CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,433,914,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,428,914,000
The Committee recommendation for the activities of the National
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion is
$1,428,914,000, which includes $340,417,000 in transfers from the
PPH Fund.
The mission of the Center is to provide national leadership in
promoting health and well-being through prevention and control of
chronic diseases. More than one-half of all American adults have
at least one chronic illness, and such diseases account for 70 per-
cent of all U.S. deaths and over three-quarters of all healthcare
costs in the United States.

78
These conditions are largely preventable or improved through
evidence-based programs and strategies. The Committee encour-
ages CDC to continue working with State and local health depart-
ments and national organizations to maximize their investments in
evidence-based programming and strategies at the community
level.
Within the total provided for the National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the following amounts
are available for the following activities:

Alzheimer’s Disease.—The Committee recommendation includes
$41,500,000, an increase of $2,000,000 to continue Alzheimer’s and
related dementias public health programs authorized in Public Law
115–406 and to strengthen the Healthy Brain Initiative, including
implementation of the Healthy Brain Initiative Public Health Road
Maps. HHS formally made prevention of Alzheimer’s disease a na-

79
tional priority when it added Goal Six to the National plan to fight
the disease in 2021. Goal Six calls for clear strategies to achieve
the goal, including additional research, strengthening our Nation’s
public health infrastructure, and turning risk reduction into clin-
ical practice. The Committee is encouraged by research dem-
onstrating the impact of risk reduction on dementia prevalence. To
ensure disproportionately affected populations are reached, the
Committee encourages CDC to increase capacity to support popu-
lations with a high burden of Alzheimer’s and other dementias
through public health promotion and workforce development. The
Committee directs the Secretary to publish a report publicly within
180 days of enactment on progress made toward meeting the goal.
Breast and Cervical Cancer.—The Committee includes
$235,500,000 for the provision of critical, lifesaving breast cancer
screening and diagnostic services to uninsured and underinsured
women. The Committee is aware that there are still substantial
barriers to screening like geographic isolation, limited health lit-
eracy, lack of provider recommendation, inconvenient times to ac-
cess services, and language barriers. The Committee directs CDC
to continue efforts to reduce breast and cervical cancer disparities
especially in underserved communities and to work to reach women
who may have delayed screening services during the COVID–19
pandemic.
Cardiac Emergency Response Planning in Schools.—The Com-
mittee notes the recent enactment of the Cardiomyopathy Health
Education, Awareness, and Research, and AED Training in the
Schools [HEARTS] Act (Public Law 118–176) and encourages CDC
to provide extramural funding to an appropriate partner with rel-
evant expertise to systematically review, identify best practices,
and offer recommendations for AED deployment as directed by the
HEARTS Act.
Childhood Cancer STAR Act.—The Committee continues
$2,000,000 for implementation of the Childhood Cancer Survivor-
ship, Treatment, Access, and Research [STAR] Act (Public Law
115–180 and 117–350) for CDC’s ongoing efforts to enhance State
cancer registries to track cancer in children, adolescents, and young
adults.
Chronic Disease and Alzheimer’s.—The Committee recognizes the
work of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases, espe-
cially as more is learned about the relationship and linkage be-
tween multiple chronic diseases. Research shows association be-
tween multiple chronic diseases, modifiable risk factors, and the
development of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Heart disease,
obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions are being studied as
risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The Committee
requests a report from CDC within 120 days of enactment of this
act outlining efforts to educate, particularly underserved commu-
nities, about the relationship between chronic diseases and poten-
tial development of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
Chronic Disease Education and Awareness [CDEA] Program.—
The Committee notes the importance of the CDEA program and in-
cludes funding to support grants for chronic health conditions that
do not have a line item in CDC’s budget. The Committee urges

80
CDC to continue to support several important multi-year projects
that are improving public and professional awareness, along with
new initiatives. Multiple conditions, patient advocacy organiza-
tions, clinicians, and researchers could benefit from this program,
such as schizophrenia; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
[POTS] and similar forms of dysautonomia; tardive dyskinesia,
which can be a debilitating movement disorder affecting individ-
uals with serious mental illness; and improved prevention, diag-
nosis, and treatment of life-threatening blood clots.
Eating Disorders Awareness Program.—The Committee is con-
cerned that eating disorders have one of the highest fatality rates
of any psychiatric illness, and the rate of diagnosis for youth ages
12–18 rose 25 percent since 2019. The Committee supports the im-
plementation of public awareness campaigns for eating disorders
including education implementation on proper prevention strate-
gies.
Epilepsy.—The Committee includes $11,500,000 and commends
CDC for its ongoing leadership of this successful program and ef-
fective community collaboration, and encourages further efforts to
eliminate stigma, improve awareness and education, and better
connect people with epilepsy to health and community services.
The Committee appreciates CDC’s ongoing epilepsy-related surveil-
lance and funding of epidemiologic studies on epilepsy and recog-
nizes the importance of data to accurately understand the inci-
dence, prevalence, and mortality rate of epilepsies, along with indi-
vidual and social risk factors that influence health outcomes. The
Committee encourages CDC to enhance surveillance and epidemio-
logic studies of the epilepsies to generate data that can guide inter-
ventions to improve outcomes for people with epilepsy, including
interventions for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The Com-
mittee looks forward to receiving the report requested in fiscal year
2024 on current gaps in surveillance data of people living with
epilepsies and on the feasibility, cost, and timing of case reporting
epilepsy through the addition of the disease to the National Neuro-
logical Conditions Surveillance System.
Farm-to-School.—The Committee continues $2,000,000 within
Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity for research and edu-
cation activities related to farm-to-school programs that result in
promoting healthy eating habits for students. The Committee in-
tends that these grants support multi-agency, multi-organizational
State farm to early childhood initiatives. The Committee also di-
rects CDC to coordinate farm-to-early childhood program efforts
with the Office of Community Food Systems at the Department of
Agriculture.
Fertility Data and Assisted Reproductive Technology [ART].—The
Committee is concerned by the elimination of CDC’s ART Surveil-
lance and Research team, which fulfilled statutorily mandated ac-
tivities under the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification
Act [FCSRCA] of 1992. This team collected and published data on
over 98 percent of U.S. IVF cycles, ensuring transparency and ac-
countability for families seeking fertility care. The Committee di-
rects CDC to restore full ARTS program capacity, including rees-
tablishing staff with demonstrated expertise in fertility and ART
and maintaining public reporting of ART data. The Committee pro-

81
vides funding sufficient to support the staff and statutorily re-
quired activities of this program. Additionally, CDC shall keep the
ART dataset publicly available and updated at least quarterly. The
Committee reminds CDC of its obligation under FCSRCA to ensure
this data is transparent, comprehensive, and standardized, ena-
bling patients to make informed medical decisions about fertility
treatment. The Committee requests a report 60 days after enact-
ment on CDC’s ART data and research activities.
Food Allergies.—The Committee recognizes the serious issue of
food allergies, which affect approximately 8 percent of children in
the United States. The Committee includes continued funding for
a school-based effort to address food allergies and reduce poten-
tially fatal anaphylactic reactions.
Food Service Guidelines [FSG] for Federal Facilities.—The Food
Service Guidelines for Federal Facilities is a set of voluntary best
practices that can be used to increase healthy and safe food options
for employees. The Committee encourages the Director to update
the guidelines and work with the General Services Administration
to increase awareness and adoption of the Food Service Guidelines
for Federal Facilities and to ensure they are updated following each
update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Heart Disease and Stroke.—The Committee continues funding for
CDC’s Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention program. CDC is en-
couraged to support community partnerships in additional States
to control heart disease and stroke and help the more than 119
million Americans living with high blood pressure. The Committee
continues funding to support implementation of the Cardiovascular
Advances in Research and Opportunities Legacy Act (Public Law
117–224). In addition, the Committee also continues the
WISEWOMAN program to increase the number of low-income, un-
insured and underinsured women who are assessed and connected
to resources.
High Obesity Rate Counties.—The Committee directs CDC to con-
tinue this program at no less than the fiscal year 2024 level. CDC
grantees are expected to work with State and local public health
departments and other partners to support measurable outcomes
through community and population-level evidence-based obesity
intervention and prevention programs. Funded projects should in-
tegrate evidence-based policy, systems, and environmental ap-
proaches to better understand and address the environmental and
societal implications of obesity. The Committee encourages CDC to
also consider including the preponderance of obesity by State based
on the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in its eli-
gibility criteria for the High Obesity Program.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD].—The Committee commends
CDC’s ongoing efforts to continue epidemiological studies on
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, known collectively as IBD,
and encourages CDC to establish awareness and education activi-
ties for patients and healthcare professionals to improve early dis-
ease diagnosis to result in improved outcomes.
Lung Cancer.—The Committee is concerned that only 16 percent
of all those eligible were screened for lung cancer. To improve
screening rates, the Committee encourages CDC to work with
States on targeted, cost-effective strategies that increase lung can-

82
cer screening rates. Strategies might include improving patient and
provider education, increasing awareness of the screening criteria,
and leveraging patient navigators and community health workers
to reduce barriers to accessing lung cancer screening.
Kidney Disease.—The Committee provides funding to support the
Chronic Kidney Disease Program, for activities that increase
awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic kidney disease
[CKD] including continued support for existing partnerships. CDC
is encouraged to support the public awareness initiative for advanc-
ing American kidney health that was established to implement Ex-
ecutive Order 13879.
Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative.—Within the funds pro-
vided for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the
Committee encourages CDC to continue the Mississippi Delta
Health Collaborative project and requests that CDC provide an up-
date on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
National Diabetes Prevention Program.—The Committee includes
an increase and is encouraged by the health progress of many par-
ticipants in CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program. The
Committee encourages CDC to continue its work to update the
PreventT2 curriculum content to include evidence from the USDA’s
Dietary Guidelines for Americans on the importance of and access
to healthy foods, including data on disease prevention through a
balanced diet, and to prioritize working directly with local commu-
nity partners who provide produce prescription programming. The
Committee encourages CDC to explore ways to integrate food as
medicine approaches in the National Diabetes Prevention Program.
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.—The Committee
encourages CDC to work with healthcare providers to inform the
public about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS] and
similar forms of dysautonomia, common chronic conditions that im-
pact millions of Americans and cause severe disability. The Com-
mittee is concerned that 28 States do not have a board-certified au-
tonomic specialist resulting in POTS patients facing on average a
5-year diagnostic delay, and encourages CDC to work with a na-
tional patient advocacy organization and expert clinicians and re-
searchers to develop an education program for healthcare providers
to increase access to care for POTS and similar dysautonomia pa-
tients.
Prostate Cancer.—The Committee remains concerned about the
continued rise in prostate cancer deaths and supports CDC’s work
to address this trend by increasing public awareness of prostate
cancer risks, screening, and treatment in high-risk men. The Com-
mittee provides continued funding for CDC’s prostate cancer activi-
ties, including for outreach and education initiatives targeting
high-risk men and their families.
Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health [REACH].—
The Committee includes $64,950,000 to support grantees in build-
ing capacity for collaboration and disseminating evidence-based
strategies in communities. REACH is a vital initiative to help
eliminate healthcare disparities in minority communities. The
Committee’s recommended level includes $24,000,000 for Good
Health and Wellness in Indian Country.

83
Reducing Healthcare Costs.—The Committee recognizes the role
of CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion in addressing chronic diseases, which account for
seven of the 10 leading causes of death and significantly contribute
to the Nation’s $4,500,000,000,000 in annual healthcare costs. The
Committee is concerned that despite high healthcare spending, the
United States continues to face suboptimal health outcomes. The
Committee also acknowledges the connection between chronic dis-
eases and infectious diseases, as people with chronic conditions are
at higher risk of severe illness and death from infectious disease.
Strengthening prevention efforts is a cost-effective strategy to im-
prove the Nation’s health status, reduce healthcare spending and
support a more productive workforce. To ensure transparency and
accountability, the Committee requests a briefing from CDC within
120 days of enactment CDC’s ongoing efforts to reduce healthcare
costs through data driven public health programs, partnerships
with non-governmental entities, and coordination with State and
local health departments.
Rural Prevention Health Research.—The Committee recognizes
the important work of Prevention Research Centers [PRCs], in par-
ticular the needs of rural focused prevention research. The Com-
mittee encourages CDC to review their grant funding process to en-
sure appropriate funding to rural areas, including rural Appa-
lachia, which consistently ranks high in incidences of disease, in-
jury, and poor health outcomes, to ensure important rural health
research continues to take place. The Committee also directs CDC
to ensure at least 20 percent of PRC funding is being directed to
research in rural areas.
Safe Motherhood and Infant Health.—The Committee includes a
$3,000,000 increase for this portfolio of programs to improve the
health of pregnant and postpartum individuals and their infants.
The CDC is directed to maintain the same level of staff in the Safe
Motherhood Office as were in place on March 31, 2025. The mater-
nal mortality rate in the United States has trended downward in
recent years but still persists at an unacceptably high rate. The
Committee encourages CDC to use the funding increase to expand
support for Maternal Mortality Review Committees [MMRCs],
Perinatal Quality Collaboratives [PQCs], the Hear Her Campaign,
and other programs including Sudden Unexplained Infant Death
[SUID] and the Sudden Death in the Young [SDY] Case Registry.
The Committee is concerned that data collection under the Preg-
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System [PRAMS] was
inexplicably paused this year and that staffing reductions will im-
pact data collection and technical assistance going forward. The
Committee includes funding to continue this vital program to pro-
vide accurate national statistics on U.S. maternal mortality rates
and inform data-driven actions to prevent these deaths. The Com-
mittee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this act on
PRAMS data collection efforts in fiscal year 2025 and barriers to
effective and consistent data collection and opportunities to im-
prove coordination among State MMRCs. The Committee encour-
ages CDC to prioritize funding to help MMRCs build stronger data
systems and improve data collection at the State level to create
consistency and ensure accuracy and completeness in data collec-

84
tion, analysis, and reporting across State MMRCs. Additionally, the
Committee supports CDC for funding State-based PQCs and en-
courages CDC to prioritize funding to expand PQCs to additional
States and territories and provide increased support to existing
PQCs. The Committee requests an update on the expansion of
PQCs beyond the States currently funded, as well as any barriers
to expansion in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
School Health.—The Committee includes $19,400,000 to promote
school-based health and to prevent chronic disease and promote the
health and well-being of children and adolescents in schools.
School Health Index [SHI].—The Committee understands the im-
portance for educational institutions to promote health and
wellness to their students from a holistic perspective to encourage
stronger learning environments. The Committee recognizes that
CDC created SHI to assist schools in evaluating and improving the
health and well-being of students. The Committee encourages CDC
to create and develop a tool similar to the SHI for higher edu-
cation.
Skin Cancer Education and Prevention.—The Committee is con-
cerned with the growing number of people diagnosed with prevent-
able forms of skin cancer, which is now the most commonly diag-
nosed cancer in the United States. The Committee provides
$5,000,000 for skin cancer education and prevention and encour-
ages CDC to continue its collaboration and partnership with local
governments, business, health, education, community, nonprofit,
and faith-based sectors.
Sleep Health and Sleep Disorders.—The Committee is concerned
with the troubling lack of coordinated efforts in public health to im-
prove sleep health and disorder awareness, diagnosis, and treat-
ment despite landmark scientific discoveries demonstrating the sig-
nificant impact of sleep on disease and mental and physical health
and wellness. The Committee encourages CDC to expand activities
to improve sleep health and sleep disorders awareness, epidemi-
ology, detection, and care particularly for rare and orphan sleep
disorders, like narcolepsy, and requests that CDC provide an up-
date on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Sudden Cardiac Arrest.—The Committee recognizes that sudden
cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death among athletes at all
ages and that timely access to automated external defibrillators
[AEDs] can significantly improve survival rates. The Committee
urges CDC to publish best practices for how to best deploy AEDs
in sporting facilities, including schools, colleges, community cen-
ters, and stadiums. The best practices should include recommenda-
tions on optimal locations, maintenance, training, and coordination
with emergency medical services, including the development of
Emergency Action Plans for AED deployment. Additionally, the
Committee encourages CDC to expand the Cardiac Arrest Registry
to Enhance Survival [CARES] program to capture data from addi-
tional States. The Committee recognizes that every year, more than
350,000 Americans fall victim to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and
only about 1 in 10 will survive this event. Registry data is critical
to improving sudden cardiac survival rates in all States by allowing
communities to measure the quality of patient care, establish per-

85
formance goals, and analyze emergency response data to identify
opportunities for improvement.
Tobacco.—The Committee includes funding for CDC, States,
Tribes and territories to continue efforts to reduce tobacco use
among disparate populations and in areas and regions with high
tobacco prevalence and mortality, such as rural communities, vet-
erans, and people with behavioral health conditions, as well as con-
tinue the highly successful and cost-effective Tips from Former
Smokers media campaign, which has helped over 1 million people
quit smoking, saved lives, and saved over $7,000,000,000 in
healthcare costs. The Committee acknowledges the overall progress
that has been made on reducing adult smoking prevalence, but un-
fortunately approximately 2 in 10 U.S. adults continues to smoke
cigarettes, and urges CDC to continue its evidence-based work to
ensure that rates also decline in populations disproportionately af-
fected by tobacco use, including rural communities. The Committee
remains concerned that 10 percent of youth use at least one tobacco
product and encourages CDC’s ongoing efforts to respond to and
prevent youth use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. The
Committee is also concerned by staff terminations within the Office
of Smoking and Health, especially as tobacco use has long been the
leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The con-
tinued funding for CDC’s tobacco programs will allow CDC, States,
Tribes and territories to continue programs and activities to reduce
tobacco use. The Committee directs CDC to provide a briefing on
the Tobacco program, including a breakdown of funding sources,
programs, and activities within 120 days of enactment of this act.
Additionally, CDC is instructed to provide information on how
funds are currently supporting, or may prospectively support, FDA
enforcement and regulation of unauthorized products and State di-
rectories.
Type 1 Diabetes.—Over 1,450,000 Americans have type 1 diabe-
tes [T1D], with 304,000 of those diagnosed under the age of 18. The
Committee is concerned that CDC has not adequately focused edu-
cation and awareness efforts on T1D, especially given the signifi-
cant progress made in the past several years related to new treat-
ments. The Committee directs CDC to update its website to reflect
progress on treatments for T1D. The website should include infor-
mation targeting physicians, school health workers, parents, and
young adults about screening recommendations as well as potential
treatments now available to delay onset of T1D. The Committee
also directs CDC to provide a plan, no later than 60 days after en-
actment of this act, outlining steps the agency will take to increase
outreach and education efforts focused on T1D.
Vision and Eye Health.—The Committee provides $4,500,000 for
vision and eye health and glaucoma detection The Committee is
aware that vision impairments and eye disease contribute to or
complicate many other serious and costly chronic health conditions,
including diabetes, depression and anxiety, cardiovascular disease,
and cognitive decline. Data on risk of vision loss and existence of
vision loss in the United States is necessary to inform State and
community partnerships that emphasize early detection and inter-
vention and to address the biggest challenges

The Committee provides $205,060,000 for the activities of the
National Center on Birth Defects, Developmental Disabilities, Dis-
ability and Health [NCBDDD].
This Center improves the health of children and adults by pre-
venting birth defects, developmental disabilities, and complications
of hereditary blood disorders, and by promoting optimal child de-
velopment and health and wellness among children and adults liv-
ing with disabilities.
Within the total provided, the following amounts are available

Autism.—The Committee includes funding for the Autism Devel-
opmental Disabilities Monitoring [ADDM] Network and to continue
surveillance of cerebral palsy to reach nearly all of its 16 ADDM
Network sites.
Blood Clots.—The Committee is concerned about the enormous
toll of blood clots on patients and the healthcare system, particu-
larly for pregnant women, Black Americans, and cancer patients.
The Committee again urges CDC to develop a comprehensive, na-
tionwide blood clot education and awareness campaign for the gen-
eral public focused on the treatment and prevention of blood clots
and education and training of healthcare professionals about the
signs and symptoms of blood clots.
Congenital Heart Disease [CHD].—CHD is the most common and
deadliest category of birth defects in the United States. The Com-
mittee commends NCBDDD for its leadership in improving under-
standing of the unique, specialized care needs for the growing CHD
population across the lifespan. The Committee includes $9,250,000
for surveillance, research, and awareness activities authorized by

87
the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act (Public Law
115–342), including to support additional longitudinal surveillance
sites, survey activities on long-term outcomes and patient needs,
engagement with healthcare providers, and analysis of healthcare
claims and clinical data.
Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—The Committee in-
cludes $9,000,000 to continue Muscular Dystrophy research and
disease surveillance initiatives. The Committee strongly encourages
CDC to update research and tracking to better understand the out-
comes for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy treated both
in and out of Certified Duchenne Care Centers; examine impacts
of Duchenne on bone health, cardiovascular, and cognitive function;
and investigate care and outcomes for adults with Duchenne, those
receiving multiple therapies including gene therapy, and various
demographic subpopulations. The Committee requests a report
within 180 days of enactment of this act detailing its plan for up-
dating muscular dystrophy efforts along these parameters.
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.—The Committee includes $11,500,000
for the surveillance of prenatal alcohol use and fetal alcohol spec-
trum disorders [FASD], to facilitate partnerships to prevent alcohol
use during pregnancy, improve support services and access to care
by responding to families living with FASD, and disseminating
practical resources and information through existing community-
based local affiliates.
Hemophilia Programs.—The Committee strongly supports and
maintains funding for the hemophilia programs long housed at
CDC’s Division of Blood Disorders and Public Health Genomics.
The Committee recognizes the important work of these programs,
which help fund the collection of surveillance data by Hemophilia
Treatment Centers and support public health efforts related to
bleeding disorders. These programs also support laboratory testing
and other essential work relating to the detection, understanding,
and prevention of inhibitors—a devastating complication that af-
fects up to 20 percent of individuals living with hemophilia, vastly
increasing the disease burden and costs of treatment for the dis-
order.
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome [NAS] Surveillance.—The Com-
mittee includes $4,250,000 to address the rise in NAS resulting
from the overuse of opioids and other related substances during
pregnancy. Funding should be used to conduct research on the use
of opioids and other substances during pregnancy and related ad-
verse outcomes from infancy through childhood, and identify best
practices for care, evaluation, and management to help children.
Physical Activity for People with Disabilities.—The Committee
provides an increase of $1,000,000 to strengthen existing programs
that address healthy athletes.
Rare Blood Disorders and Immune Thrombocytopenia [ITP]
Care.—The Committee encourages CDC to explore the creation of
an ITP treatment centers pilot program in order to identify public
health and patient care opportunities to enhance efficiency and im-
prove outcomes in coordination with the professional and patient
community to establish an ITP treatment centers pilot program
modeled on similar successful efforts for hemophilia and sickle cell

88
disease. The Committee requests a briefing on resource needs and
core activities within 180 days of the enactment of this act.
Sickle Cell Disease [SCD].—The Committee provides continued
funding for the sickle cell disease data collection program. The
Committee encourages CDC to provide technical assistance to addi-
tional States with a higher prevalence of SCD, so that they can
successfully participate in this grant program to better identify af-
fected individuals in their States and better meet their needs.
Spina Bifida.—The Committee recognizes that Spina Bifida is
the most common permanently disabling congenital disability com-
patible with life in the United States, affecting 1,500 babies in the
country each year. While Spina Bifida and related neural tube de-
fects are sometimes preventable through education and adequate
daily folic acid consumption, there are an estimated 166,000 indi-
viduals, more than 65 percent of whom are adults, living with all
forms of this complex birth defect. The Committee understands
that there is a significant need for immediate support at CDC to
address the transitional and adult care needs of the growing, aging
Spina Bifida community and the Committee requests an update in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts to address these needs. The Com-
mittee supports the continuation of the Spina Bifida Clinical Care
Monitoring and Tracking Program, which works with the National
Spina Bifida Registry to guide the healthcare community in the
best treatment options for people living with Spina Bifida.
Stillbirth.—Stillbirth rates remain unacceptably high, affecting
thousands of families each year. The Committee appreciates the
findings and recommendations included in the March 2023 Still-
birth Task Force report and encourages CDC to implement the rec-
ommendations including improved recordkeeping, data collection,
and analysis about stillbirths, addressing disparities in stillbirth
risk, and provide better support for families after a stillbirth oc-
curs.
Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Net-
work [SET–NET].—The Committee includes $23,000,000 for SET–
NET. The program supports CDC’s collaboration with State, Tribal,
territorial, and local health departments to monitor the impact of
emerging health threats, including COVID–19, and the impact of
such threats on pregnancy, as well as the health of infants, to in-
form public health and clinical decision-making.
Tourette Syndrome.—The Committee provides $2,500,000 and di-
rects CDC to continue to educate physicians, educators, clinicians,
allied professionals, and the general public about the disorder and
to improve scientific knowledge on prevalence, risk factors, and co-
occurring conditions of Tourette Syndrome. The Committee com-
mends CDC for its national public health education and research
program on Tourette syndrome. The Committee encourages funding
be used to continue to educate physicians, educators, clinicians, al-
lied professionals, and the general public about the disorder and to
improve scientific knowledge on prevalence, risk factors, cost, and
impact and co-occurring conditions of Tourette syndrome.

Community Health Workers and Community Health.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of the community health work-
force in reaching underserved communities, preventing illness, and
reducing related healthcare costs. The Committee urges CDC to en-
courage the use of community health workers, including within
Tribal communities, to support the delivery of person-centered care.
Global Civil Registry and Vital Statistics.—The Committee
strongly supports the National Center for Health Statistics’ efforts
to facilitate capacity building among low- and middle-income coun-
tries to develop civil registry and vital statistics systems. The Com-
mittee requests a report within 180 days of enactment that in-
cludes a listing of countries that have been supported through
these partnerships to-date and a budgetary estimate of the funding
required to continue this work.
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.—The Committee recog-
nizes that CDC’s mission to detect and respond to health threats
requires rapid dissemination of information. The Committee urges
CDC to continue publication of CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report, which allows for timely release of public health in-
formation. The Committee also directs CDC to continue publishing
evidence-based scientific findings in peer-reviewed journals to dis-
seminate public health data, health surveillance findings, and sup-
plemental information.
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander National Health Interview
Survey.—The Committee recognizes that it has been 10 years since
the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander National Health Inter-
view Survey was last fielded. The Committee looks forward to the
report as directed in Public Law 118–47 on the feasibility, advis-
ability, and costs to re-issue this survey, as well as methods to en-

90
sure the inclusion of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in the
annual National Health Interview Study.
National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System.—The
Committee includes $5,000,000 within Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and Informatics to continue efforts on the two initial conditions-
multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.
Public Health Data Modernization Initiative [DMI].—The Com-
mittee commends CDC’s work to advance public health data mod-
ernization and acknowledges that efforts to enhance public health
data system capabilities will result in fast and more reliable data
sharing. The Committee provides continued funding for CDC to
continue bringing together State, Tribal, local and territorial public
health jurisdictions and public and private sector partners with the
goal of establishing modern, interoperable, and real-time public
health data and surveillance systems to protect the American pub-
lic. The Committee recommends CDC ensure that funding from
DMI is allocated to jurisdictions through the National Center for
Health Statistics to support necessary upgrades to their vital sta-
tistics systems to enable more, better, and faster vital records data.
The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of
this act on the progress and plans for programs and activities sup-
ported by DMI funding. The Committee directs HHS to prioritize
CDC data modernization and IT projects, focusing on improving en-
terprise capabilities and infrastructure. The Committee further di-
rects HHS to continue to provide quarterly reports for all ongoing
projects.
Public Health Workforce.—The Committee includes $71,000,000
and urges CDC to invest in fellowship and training programs to re-
build the public health workforce that includes, but is not limited
to, epidemiologists, contact tracers, lab scientists, community
health workers, data scientists, behavioral scientists, disease inter-
vention and prevention specialists, occupational health specialists,
public health physicians, veterinarians, nurses, informaticians, pro-
gram managers, economists, policy and evaluation experts, and
communicators who can help protect the Nation’s communities.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] Registry.—The Committee
encourages CDC to continue its investment in research that will re-
duce incidence and prevalence of ALS in the United States. The
Committee encourages CDC to continue its efforts to evaluate, up-
date, and improve the National ALS Registry program, by ensuring
that the most up to date information is provided to researchers,
and ALS patients are connected with clinical trials, treatments,
and resources in a timely manner. The Committee supports contin-
ued ALS prevalence reports, and urges CDC to publish these re-
ports in a timely manner and provide updates regarding these
prevalence reports. Additionally, the Committee urges CDC to col-
laborate with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to
provide a publicly available report on the incidence and prevalence
of ALS among military veterans.
Asthma.—The Committee includes funding for the National
Asthma Control Program [NACP] so CDC can work with States to
improve health outcomes for people living with asthma. As the
number and severity of wildfires increases, the Committee also
urges the NACP to continue its efforts to develop public health
interventions aimed at protecting people with asthma from wildfire
smoke. The Committee also recognizes the significance of asthma
as a chronic disease and supports the National Asthma Control
Program [NACP] in its efforts to reduce asthma-related hospitaliza-
tions, emergency department visits, and healthcare costs. The Com-
mittee recognizes the economic impact of asthma on workplace and
school productivity and urges CDC to provide an updated assess-
ment of the National economic burden of asthma, including preva-
lence, medical costs, absenteeism, and mortality.
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention.—The Committee includes
$51,000,000 to prevent and mitigate childhood lead exposure and
expand the data capabilities of the program to rapidly identify and
address emerging threats in communities with elevated risk of ex-
posure to lead. CDC is expected to support local capacity to im-
prove the health of children through efforts to eliminate lead from
their environment. Additionally, the Committee is disappointed by
the recent upheaval in the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention
Program, caused by the terminations of the entire branch’s staff,
before those terminations were reversed months later. The funding
provided in this act is intended to support the program’s activities
as they existed in fiscal year 2024. As such, CDC is directed to con-

92
tinue providing funding and technical support to health depart-
ments for identifying, tracking, and responding to lead exposures
in children; maintaining the blood lead surveillance system; devel-
oping and updating guidance and training for health departments
and healthcare providers to support lead poisoning prevention ef-
forts; and offering technical assistance for lead exposure events, in-
cluding through the deployment of CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning
Prevention branch staff to localities requesting assistance after a
lead exposure event.
Climate and Health.—The Committee includes $10,000,000 for
the program to provide guidance, data, and technical assistance to
all States, local health departments, and additional assistance to
Tribes and territories, to identify possible health effects associated
with a changing climate and implement health adaptation plans.
Communities across the country are vulnerable to health effects
from increasingly common events such as heatwaves, wildfires,
floods, droughts, and extreme storms. The Committee expects CDC
to aid in the development and implementation of State-specific ac-
tion plans to protect health from these threats.
Extreme Heat and Data Collection.—The Committee recognizes
the increasing frequency and severity of extreme heat events and
the lack of currently available data to adequately understand the
financial burden that extreme heat places upon healthcare sys-
tems. The Committee encourages CDC, in collaboration with the
National Integrated Heat Health Information System [NIHHIS]
and its participating agencies, to develop and implement a system
for tracking and making publicly available the healthcare costs as-
sociated with the increased demand for medical assistance during
extreme heat events, including expenses related to emergency room
visits, urgent care treatments, hospitalizations, and associated
medications.
Pediatric Reference Intervals.—The Committee encourages CDC
to initiate efforts to improve the accuracy of pediatric reference in-
tervals. CDC is directed to include an estimate of the costs associ-
ated with developing pediatric reference intervals in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Per and Polyflouroalkyl Substances [PFAS].—The Committee re-
mains concerned that extended exposure to PFAS is associated
with decreased antibody response, dyslipidemia, decreased infant
and fetal growth, and increased risk of kidney cancer. CDC is en-
couraged to continue to provide clinical guidance to advise clini-
cians when to offer PFAS blood testing to patients who are likely
to have a history of elevated exposure.
Radon.—The Committee continues to support State radon pro-
gram efforts that raise awareness about the associated risks of
radon exposure. The Committee encourages expanding radon
grants to States that are seeking to adopt or strengthen certifi-
cation requirements for radon measurement and mitigation work-
ers.
INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL

93
The Committee provides $761,379,000 for the National Center
for Injury Prevention and Control.
CDC is the lead Federal agency for injury prevention and control.
Programs are designed to prevent premature death and disability
and reduce human suffering and medical costs caused by non-
occupational injuries including those caused by fires and burns,
poisoning, drowning, violence, and traffic accidents.

Adolescent Mental Health.—The Committee supports the creation
of the Behavioral Health Coordinating Unit to coordinate and le-
verage existing CDC activities related to mental health, with a par-
ticular focus on adolescent mental health activities, including early
intervention. The Committee encourages CDC to begin to develop
a national strategy and establish goals to improve adolescent men-
tal health, including linkages between adolescent mental health
and substance use and overdose, adverse childhood experiences,
suicide, and other areas that impact mental wellbeing. This effort
is expected to include convening of key experts, in and out of gov-
ernment, with special considerations to ensure the voices of under-
served communities and populations are represented. CDC is also
encouraged to provide technical assistance, including through
grants to partner organizations, to support collaborations and con-
nections between multiple sectors in communities such as public
health, education, community mental health organizations and
other community-based organizations, youth serving organizations,
parents, and social services providers to strengthen mental health
prevention and promotion and improve mental health, well-being,
and resilience in communities.
Adverse Childhood Experiences [ACEs].—The Committee pro-
vides $9,000,000 for ACEs surveillance, research, and prevention
efforts. The Committee commends CDC’s Injury Prevention Center
for funding States and localities, including those with high rates of
trauma, violence, and overdoses, to conduct surveillance on expo-
sure to ACEs and target community-based interventions related to
exposure to childhood trauma, ACEs, substance use, and violence
and to promote positive childhood experiences.

94
Child Sexual Abuse Prevention.—The Committee includes
$3,000,000 in recognition of the severe and often life-long physical,
cognitive, and emotional impact of child sexual abuse and com-
mends CDC’s work in child sexual abuse prevention research. CDC
is encouraged to improve surveillance systems and data collection,
increase the understanding of risk and protective factors, and de-
velop and disseminate effective prevention efforts. The Committee
directs CDC to continue the work with partners to evaluate and
improve child sex abuse prevention policies within youth serving
organizations, including through working with non-profit organiza-
tions that specialize in child sexual abuse prevention. The Com-
mittee also notes the expertise of non-profit and research organiza-
tions and encourages CDC to continue collaboration with these
partners to ensure widespread adoption of guidance developed for
youth serving organizations to prevent child sexual abuse.
Community and Youth Violence Prevention.—The Committee
commends CDC for its work to prevent youth and community vio-
lence through technical assistance, research, and partnerships be-
tween community organizations, schools, law enforcement, faith-
based organizations, and academia to evaluate effective interven-
tions to reduce violence. The Committee encourages CDC to scale
up existing partnerships with organizations that have dem-
onstrated success in reducing community violence and its risk fac-
tors, including those involving healthcare and community outreach
organizations, as well as supporting academic-community collabo-
rations and research to advance the science and practice of violence
prevention, while reducing inequities from which such violence
stems.
Core State Injury Prevention Program [Core SIPP].—The Com-
mittee includes $29,950,000 for the Core SIPP to enhance efforts
to identify and respond to injury threats with data-driven public
health actions.
Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence.—The Committee provides
$38,200,000 for CDC to collect data on the connection between
brain injuries and domestic and sexual violence, and implement a
data collection project that follows up on and operates under CDC’s
National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey and asks
questions about the prevalence and circumstances surrounding
brain injuries.
Drowning Prevention.—The Committee continues $2,000,000 to
prevent fatal drownings. Drowning is a leading cause of uninten-
tional deaths among children and youth below the age of 14. This
funding will allow CDC to implement proven drowning prevention
programs with national organizations working with underserved
and diverse youth to support State drowning surveillance efforts,
as well as to develop and begin implementation of a national plan
on water safety.
Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research.—The Com-
mittee includes $12,500,000 to conduct research on firearm injury
and mortality prevention. Given violence and suicide have a num-
ber of causes, the Committee recommends CDC take a comprehen-
sive approach to studying these underlying causes and evidence-
based methods of prevention of injury, including crime prevention.
All grantees under this section will be required to fulfill require-

95
ments around open data, open code, pre-registration of research
projects, and open access to research articles consistent with the
National Science Foundation’s open science principles. The Director
of CDC is to again report to the Committees within 30 days of en-
actment of this act on implementation schedules and procedures for
grant awards, which strive to ensure that such awards support
ideologically and politically unbiased research projects.
Injury Control Research Centers.—The Committee includes
$11,000,000 for awards for multi-disciplinary research on the
causes, outcomes, and prevention of injuries and violence.
National Violent Death Reporting System.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the value of the National Violent Death Reporting System
[NVDRS], as it is the only system in the United States that cap-
tures data on circumstances surrounding violent deaths, including
suicides and homicides. Such data allow States and localities to de-
tect and monitor circumstances that commonly precede violent
death, investigate and respond to factors that increase risk for vio-
lent death, and inform opportunities for preventing premature
death. Modernizing the systems through which these data flow is
imperative to ensure the timeliness of these data and the ability
to use them to inform prevention and response activities. Addition-
ally, the Committee recognizes the value of near real-time
syndromic surveillance data collected on nonfatal violence, suicide,
and mental health-related emergency department visits, particu-
larly as CDC has demonstrated the ability to link these innovative
data with violent death and suicide mortality data. Given that
syndromic surveillance data on violence, suicide, overdose, and
mental health-related emergency department visits are obtained
through CDC’s existing National Syndromic Surveillance Program,
the Committee encourages CDC to identify ways to streamline
these two data sources—nonfatal and fatal violence-related data.
Further, the Committee encourages CDC to identify opportunities
to use existing data science analytic tools and artificial intelligence
(e.g., those available via CDC’s Enterprise Data, Analytics, and
Visualization platform) to reduce time spent by States in manually
abstracting violent death circumstance data.
Opioid Prescribing Guidelines.—The Committee applauds CDC’s
release of the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing
Opioids for Pain, which updates and replaces the 2016 CDC pre-
scribing guideline. The Committee directs CDC to continue its work
educating patients and providers, and to encourage uptake and ap-
propriate use of the Guidelines. The Committee urges CDC to con-
tinue coordination with other agencies including the VA, IHS, DoD,
and HRSA in implementation and related updates in safe pre-
scribing practices to ensure consistent, high-quality care standards
across the Federal Government.
Opioid or Other Drug Use and Overdose Prevention.—The Com-
mittee continues to encourage CDC to ensure that funding for
opioid and stimulant use and overdose prevention, as well as other
emerging substances and threats, reaches local communities to ad-
vance local understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and to
scale-up prevention and response activities. Additionally, CDC is
directed to continue expansion of case-level syndromic surveillance
data, improvements of interventions that monitor prescribing and

96
dispensing practices, better timeliness and quality of morbidity and
mortality data, as well as the enhancement of efforts with medical
examiners and coroner offices.
Opioid Overdose Prevention and Surveillance.—The Committee
notes that recent data shows a reduction in deaths from drug
overdoses, including from dangerous opioids like fentanyl. While
the data is trending in the right direction, the Committee is con-
cerned that this progress could be interrupted by the delay in the
release of funding for overdose prevention efforts, which help State
and local health departments have the capacity to prevent deaths
from overdoses. The Committee directs CDC to issue timely awards
for this program and to provide a briefing to the Committees with-
in 60 days of enactment on the Overdose Data to Action program,
including how States have used the funding to reduce overdose
deaths.
Pain Management.—The Committee acknowledges the population
health demographic data reported on chronic pain in 2023 provided
as directed in Public Law 117–103 and described in House Report
117–96. However, the Committee encourages CDC to update the
report provided to include an analysis and reporting of the direct
healthcare costs related to pain diagnostic, management and treat-
ment services for all forms of treatment including medication,
interventional procedures, medical devices, behavioral health, re-
storative treatments and complementary and integrative treat-
ments for all payer sources including public, private and out of
pocket costs as well as indirect costs related to pain including
missed work, short and long-term disability and loss of produc-
tivity.
Provider Education for Opioid Alternatives.—The Committee re-
mains concerned about the high mortality rate due to opioid
overdoses and encourages CDC to provide outreach to outpatient
surgical providers on the increased availability and wide-ranging
benefits of non-opioid pain management in both hospital outpatient
departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The Committee en-
courages CDC to work with CMS, FDA, and continuing medical
education associations on an education and outreach plan.
Rape Prevention.—The Committee includes $61,750,000 to sup-
port rape prevention and education programs. In granting funds to
States, the Secretary shall set forth procedures designed to ensure
meaningful involvement of the State or territorial sexual assault
coalitions and representatives from underserved communities in
the application for and implementation of funding.
Suicide Prevention.—The Committee remains concerned about
suicide rates in the United States and includes $30,000,000. The
Committee recognizes that suicide is a serious public health prob-
lem requiring strategic programming, especially among dispropor-
tionately impacted populations. The Committee also recognizes that
suicide prevention requires a public health approach that addresses
multiple risk factors at the individual, community, and societal lev-
els. States, tribes, and territories are well positioned to lead a com-
prehensive public health approach to suicide prevention, which in-
volves coordinating with multisector partners, to take a data-driv-
en, evidence-based process to address the broad range of risk and
protective factors associated with suicide. The Committee directs

97
CDC to prioritize funding to State public health departments with
the goal of expanding the Comprehensive Suicide Prevention pro-
gram nationwide, and to help tribes and territories build capacity
and implement strategies to prevent suicide.
Traumatic Brain Injury [TBI].—The Committee provides
$8,250,000 to initiate concussion surveillance, particularly among
children and youth. The Committee appreciates CDC’s work to bet-
ter understand the burden of concussions in the United States. The
Committee recognizes the need for standardized data collection
practices across the care continuum to capture and integrate data
on traumatic brain injury [TBI] with data collected for research
purposes to improve patient identification and outcomes. The Com-
mittee encourages CDC to coordinate across HHS, the Departments
of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Transportation to identify and
recommend key data elements and terms that should be collected
to improve the consistency of TBI health data derived from dif-
ferent sources.
Unintentional Injury on College Campuses.—The Committee re-
quests a briefing, within 120 days of enactment of this act, on the
feasibility of CDC collecting and disseminating data related to acci-
dental injuries among college students that result in serious injury
or death.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $362,800,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 363,800,000
The Committee includes $363,800,000 for the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] programs. This fund-
ing level is sufficient to maintain the programs and activities lo-
cated in Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wash-
ington, and West Virginia as well as the staff in these locations in
place on March 30, 2025. The Committee recognizes that NIOSH
is the only Federal agency responsible for conducting research and
making recommendations for the prevention of work-related illness
and injury. The NIOSH mission is implemented by conducting
basic and applied scientific research and translating the knowledge
gained into products and services that impact workers in settings
from corporate offices to construction sites to coal mines. Further,
the Committee acknowledges that NIOSH continues to protect
American workers through its work-related illness and injury re-
search and directs CDC to ensure work continues in NIOSH re-
search centers nationwide. The Committee encourages NIOSH to
continue its objectivity so as to ensure the highest professional and
ethical standards are maintained.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities at
the following amounts:

Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Program.—The Committee in-
cludes $29,000,000 for efforts to protect workers in this sector by
providing leadership in applied research, disease and injury sur-
veillance, education, and prevention.
Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program Mobile Medical
Unit.—The Committee is concerned about the prevalence of coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung, and the recent
increase in progressive massive fibrosis, the most severe stage of
black lung, among younger miners. According to NIOSH, one in 10
underground coal miners who have worked in mines for at least 25
years were identified as having black lung. Coal miners in central
Appalachia are disproportionately affected with as many as one in
five having evidence of black lung-the highest level recorded in 25
years. Early screening and detection of black lung can improve
health outcomes and reduce mortality. However, a NIOSH report
has identified several potential barriers to screening for miners-in-
cluding the ability to participate in screening. The Committee
urges NIOSH to continue working to improve access to screening
for miners using its mobile medical unit in Morgantown and across
Appalachia.
Disaster Resilience.—The Committee recognizes that extreme
weather and disasters can leave long-lasting damage in commu-
nities. These events require health professionals and public health
departments to have the resources and guidance to prepare for and
mitigate health impacts before disasters, respond during disasters,
and protect health during recovery after disasters. The Committee
expects CDC to aid in the development and implementation of lo-
cally specific plans to respond to these threats.
Education and Research Centers [ERCs].—The Committee in-
cludes $32,000,000 for ERCs in recognition of their important work
to improve workplace safety and health by translating scientific
discoveries into practice through effective education, training, and
outreach. The Committee applauds the work of NIOSH to imple-
ment innovative approaches, and its translational research. The
agency’s priorities and efforts have included work on the protection
of workers from heat hazards as well as the effects of the COVID–
19 pandemic on the workplace, including the mental and emotional
health impact on workers. The Committee encourages NIOSH to
continue its support for new and existing ERCs to support edu-
cation and training programs for graduate students, particularly in
Environmental and Industrial Hygiene, Occupational Health Nurs-
ing, Occupational Medicine Residency, and Occupational Safety
and Health Engineering.
Environmental Exposures and Cancer in First Responders.—The
Committee is aware that first responders have increased rates of
cancer diagnoses and death relative to the general population they
serve. First responders, such as firefighters, are exposed to a com-
plex mix of known and possible cancer-causing chemicals through
breathing hazardous substances and absorbing them through their

99
skin. The Committee encourages NIOSH to continue its work ex-
amining the health and safety of first responders to build upon ex-
isting scientific evidence based research to further develop and rec-
ommend best practices for complex occupational safety and health
problems such as the toxic exposures and higher cancer incidence
rates in this population.
Heat Stress and Worker Illnesses and Injuries.—The Committee
recognizes that working under high heat conditions causes symp-
toms of heat illness, including fatigue, loss of balance, nausea,
headache, loss of physical and mental capacity, heavy sweating,
muscle cramps, and other symptoms that cause or contribute to
workplace injuries and illnesses. Injuries incurred may be minor,
serious, life-threatening illnesses, or fatal and may result in long-
term injuries or permanent disabilities. The Committee urges CDC,
in collaboration with appropriate partners, to research the relation-
ship between heat stress and workplace illnesses and injuries and
to identify means for more accurate data collection, including the
recording and reporting of heat related injuries and illnesses, in
outdoor and indoor workplaces.
Mining Research.—The Committee encourages CDC to partner
with public universities to facilitate the development and imple-
mentation of research initiatives in deep mining of critical minerals
and metals, specifically targeting the enhancement of workplace
safety and health in U.S. mining operations. Collaborative and
independent research efforts should be from universities that offer
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology [ABET] ac-
credited undergraduate mining engineering programs under Min-
ing Engineering Program criteria and graduate programs in mining
and explosives engineering, with explosives engineering focused on
mining applications. These integrated programs are necessary for
conducting highly specialized technical research and implementing
effective workforce development initiatives.
National Firefighter Registry for Cancer.—The Committee in-
cludes an increase of $1,000,000 as the registry recruits and enrolls
participants.
Potential PFAS Exposure Source for Firefighters.—The Com-
mittee is committed to advancing research on occupational expo-
sure of firefighters to PFAS. NIOSH is directed to engage with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology on their ongoing
study to identify a firefighter’s relative risk of exposure to PFAS
released from their protective gear.
Total Worker Health Program.—The Committee continues fund-
ing for the Total Worker Health program, which supports and con-
ducts ground-breaking research to advance the overall safety,
health, and well-being of U.S. workers. This funding supports crit-
ical priorities, including addressing the Nation’s mental health, sui-
cide, and substance use disorder crises, in the context of work de-
sign and employment.
World Trade Center Health Program [WTCHP].—The Committee
notes the importance of adequate staffing at NIOSH for purposes
of fulfilling statutory obligations under the WTCHP. The Com-
mittee anticipates a timely review of the monthly staffing reports
as directed through the Office of the Secretary. The Committee rec-
ognizes that thousands of eligible members of WTCHP reside out-

100
side the New York metropolitan area, including Florida, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. In consideration of migration
trends, and with a greater need to provide clinical services, in par-
ticular monitoring and treatment of WTCHP-certified conditions
and improve access to research within regions where eligible mem-
bers live, the Committee encourages CDC to include an assessment
in the fiscal year 2027 congressional justification on the value and
impact on sustainability of the program in establishing an addi-
tional Clinical Center of Excellence outside the New York metro-
politan area.
ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL INJURY COMPENSATION ACT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $55,358,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,358,000
The Committee includes $55,358,000 for the Energy Employees
Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act [EEOICPA] (Pub-
lic Law 106–398). This mandatory funding supports NIOSH sci-
entists who reconstruct radiation dose levels to inform compensa-
tion decisions.
Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program
Act [EEOICPA] Implementation.—The mandatory funding provided
by Public Law 106–398 supports NIOSH scientists who reconstruct
radiation dose levels to inform compensation decision. The Com-
mittee encourages CDC to continue supporting the professional de-
velopment of health physics professionals, who are integral to dose
reconstruction and special exposure cohort determinations within
the program.
GLOBAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $692,843,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 692,843,000
The Committee provides $692,843,000 for global health-related
activities at CDC.
CDC’s global efforts promote health security and prevent disease
in the United States and abroad through rapid detection and re-
sponse to emerging and re-emerging health threats.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities in
the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on
Global HIV/AIDS Program ................................................................................................................................. $128,921,000
Global Tuberculosis.......................................................................................................................................... 11,722,000

Parasitic Diseases and Malaria....................................................................................................................... 29,000,000
Global Public Health Protection....................................................................................................................... 293,200,000
Global Health Protection.—The Committee includes $293,200,000
and recognizes CDC’s unique role in supporting public health ca-
pacity development through scientific and technical leadership both
domestically and globally, by working closely with United States
government agencies, ministries of health, and other partners to

101
ensure that disease threats anywhere are prevented, detected early
and responded to robustly through a coordinated, multisectoral ap-
proach. The Committee recognizes that accurate and swift
diagnostics are crucial for the early detection and containment of
infectious diseases of pandemic potential. The Committee encour-
ages CDC’s Global Health Center in collaboration with the Na-
tional Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases to
prioritize the development of diagnostics for pathogens of pandemic
potential and encourages CDC to work with Federal and other
partners to strengthen capacity and infrastructure of countries to
support adoption and access to diagnostics. The Committee notes
that CDC’s global health research efforts are critical to U.S. bilat-
eral and multilateral global health and global health security pro-
grams that protect Americans and the rest of the world. CDC is a
global leader in infectious disease detection, preparedness, and re-
sponse, including the development and validation of tools and strat-
egies to prevent and mitigate the spread of disease.
Global HIV/AIDS Program.—The Committee recognizes that
since the inception of President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
[PEPFAR], CDC has served as an implementing partner, providing
technical expertise and program oversight. The Committee directs
CDC to coordinate with the State Department’s Bureau of Global
Health Security and Diplomacy to continue this essential role as an
implementing partner to ensure program oversight and account-
ability.
Malaria and Parasitic Diseases.—The Committee provides
$29,000,000, recognizing the important role CDC plays in the fight
against malaria and parasitic disease, particularly providing para-
sitic lab capabilities for the United States. Parasitic diseases cause
devastating health and economic effects for hundreds of millions of
people around the world and in the United States. CDC provides
life-saving services and expertise in research, diagnosis, treatment,
surveillance, consultation, and education of parasitic diseases to
States and countries, U.S. government agencies, and other public
health partners. The Committee encourages further support for
these activities so CDC can enhance its parasitic diseases labora-
tory, close the gap on parasitic disease-related health inequity in
the United States, and advance global control and elimination of
malaria and targeted neglected tropical diseases.
Polio Eradication.—The Committee includes $180,000,000 to sup-
port CDC activities related to wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived
polio surveillance, vaccine procurement, and outbreak response.
CDC is urged to continue to provide technical assistance to coun-
tries for polio immunization campaigns, conduct environmental
surveillance of polio viruses to ensure prompt detection and to pre-
vent potential outbreaks of paralytic polio disease.
Soil Transmitted Helminth and Other Parasites of Domestic Con-
cern.—The Committee is pleased with the success of the currently
funded CDC projects in educating healthcare providers and the
public in at-risk communities and establishing specimen collection
and diagnostic protocols to address soil transmitted helminth. The
Committee includes funding for the surveillance, testing and edu-
cation efforts of the currently funded projects to address other
parasites of domestic concern which may be present in these areas.

102
Projects should consider the prevalence of Chagas,
angiostrongyliasis and toxoplasmosis, among others to investigate
their presence in these regions.
Violence Against Children and Youth Surveys.—The Committee
requests a briefing, not later than 90 days after enactment of this
act, on the implementation and delivery of the Violence Against
Children and Youth Surveys [VACS] in active countries that have
completed the survey implementation in the corresponding fiscal
year and are engaged in the data to action process, including moni-
toring and evaluation. The Committee requests the briefing include
the implementing countries’ efforts to prevent and respond to vio-
lence against children; technical support provided by the United
States government, and research, global thought leadership, and
innovative efforts to respond to the findings of VACS reports.
PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $938,200,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 933,200,000
The Committee provides $933,200,000 for CDC’s Preparedness
and Response activities.
CDC’s preparedness and response mission is to build and
strengthen national preparedness for public health emergencies in-
cluding natural, biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear inci-
dents. This funding supports national response programs, as well
as grants to States and localities to enhance preparedness efforts
across the country.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities in
the following amounts:
Budget activity rec C om om m m en it d te a e ti on
Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement .................................................................... $735,000,000

All Other CDC Preparedness ............................................................................................................................ 139,000,000
Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics [CFA] and Ready
Response Enterprise Data Integration [RREDI] Platform.—The
Committee provides $50,000,000 for CFA and RREDI to facilitate
the use of data, modeling, and analytics to improve preparedness
and response. The Committee is aware of the unprecedented chal-
lenge recent public health emergencies, such as measles, MPox,
RSV, influenza, and COVID–19, pose to Federal, State, and local
governments’ ability to collect and share data in a meaningful way
to ensure informed policy and operational decisionmaking. The
Committee recognizes the investment the U.S. government has
made into these programs and includes funding for CDC to main-
tain this capability to ensure preparedness for future public health
emergencies. The Committee urges CDC to continue to work with
schools of public health and other academic institutions to engage
the Nation’s expertise in disease modeling, public health data anal-
ysis, research, and training to build workforce capacity in this
emerging field. As an interagency resource for early warnings re-
lated to emerging infectious disease threats, the Center will sup-

103
port the public health system in detecting, responding to, and even-
tually preventing future epidemics and outbreaks.
Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agree-
ments.—The Committee includes $735,000,000 to support State and
local health departments to quickly detect, monitor, and respond to
health threats. Public health system investments serve as the
backbone for disaster and outbreak response in every State and the
pandemic has shown that increased funding for preparedness is
necessary for a baseline of consistent protection. The Committee
continues to request a State distribution table in the fiscal year
2027 CJ, which should also include information about how funding
is being allocated to local health departments and how States are
determining these allocations.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $40,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,000,000
The Committee provides $40,000,000 for Buildings and Facilities.
CDC-Owned Buildings and Facilities.—The Committee continues
funding to make progress on reducing CDC’s backlog of mainte-
nance and repairs at its campuses nationwide, including its Atlanta
headquarters. The Committee acknowledges that in order to pro-
tect Americans from health threats and to rapidly respond to public
health emergencies, CDC needs a safe, secure, and fully oper-
ational infrastructure in the form of its own laboratories, buildings,
and facilities. COVID–19 and other recent public health emer-
gencies have required urgent action and demonstrated that CDC
laboratories and facilities need to be ready to respond quickly and
comprehensively. The Committee supports the completion of the
CDC Masterplan Build Out, including continued progress with the
Atlanta Masterplan Build Out.
Mine Safety Research Facility.—The Committee requests the con-
tinuation of quarterly updates on progress in the construction of
the new mine safety research facility and laboratory, costs in-
curred, and unanticipated challenges which may affect timeline or
total costs, and any other pertinent developments until the comple-
tion of the facility.
CDC-WIDE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM SUPPORT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $663,570,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 631,570,000
The Committee provides $631,570,000 for public health leader-
ship and support activities at CDC.
The recommendation includes $250,000,000 in transfers from the
PPH Fund.
The Committee includes funding for the following activities in

Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices [ACIP] Report.—
The Committee includes $1,000,000 and directs CDC to enter into
a contract with the National Academies of Science, Engineering,
and Medicine [NASEM] to develop a framework that delineates the
considerations that should be taken into account when considering
prospective voting members of ACIP, as well as recommendations
to strengthen the ACIP appointment process. The framework
should also address best practices for ensuring transparency, inde-
pendence, and integrity in the appointment process. NASEM
should also include specific criteria in the framework for maintain-
ing a balanced range of expertise across ACIP, and propose any
necessary revisions to the conflict of interest policy for ACIP and
its working groups.
CDC Technical Expertise.—The Committee recognizes CDC’s
unique public health expertise, which allows the agency to provide
technical assistance, data, and research to States, communities,
and international partners. The Committee encourages CDC to con-
tinue efforts that support strengthening public health across its
wide range of programs including preventing and responding to in-
fectious diseases, injury prevention and control, and addressing
chronic illnesses. As such, section 238 requires the Secretary to
submit a detailed plan and justification to the Committees on Ap-
propriations prior to initiating a reorganization or transfer of func-
tions carried out by CDC. Additionally, the Committee notes the
number of political appointees at CDC has increased significantly
and further notes the importance of maintaining staff with the
technical expertise to support the agency’s mission to protect the
health, safety, and security of the American people.
Monthly Briefings.—The Committee directs CDC to provide
monthly briefings to the Committees on Appropriations regarding
activities funded by this act and other available appropriations.
Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund [IDRRRF].—
The Committee includes $5,000,000 for the IDRRRF. The IDRRRF
provides an immediate source of funding to ensure that funds are
available when an emerging infectious disease crisis is detected.
Funds are available until expended.
Local Public Health Departments.—The Committee notes that
Federal funding intended for both State and local health depart-
ments does not consistently reach local health departments beyond
those directly-funded. The Committee encourages CDC to require
States to fund local health departments when programmatically
appropriate.
Obligations.—For CDC-Wide activities and for activities within
every Center, unless advanced notice is provided in writing to the
Committees on Appropriations, funds must be obligated for con-
tinuation awards and new award cycles that continue previous ac-

105
tivities under existing NOFOs on the last day prior to the expira-
tion of the period of performance from fiscal year 2024.
Office of Rural Health [ORH].—The Committee provides
$5,000,000 to continue ORH. The Committee is encouraged by ef-
forts from the agency to establish the CDC ORH. The Committee
directs the agency to ensure that the established ORH will guide
CDC’s rural health leadership across the entire agency. This in-
cludes by developing purposeful public health guidance for rural
health departments, analyzing and developing initiatives to expand
the rural public health workforce, establishing a formal partner-
ship with the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy under HRSA,
and otherwise serving as a resource and technical assistance hub
for public health in rural communities.
Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity.—The Committee in-
cludes $350,000,000 in public health funding that is not segmented
by disease, condition, activity. Rather, it is provided for cross-cut-
ting, core public health infrastructure needs, including but not lim-
ited to workforce, health information and data systems, public
health policy and communications, financial management, commu-
nity partnership development, and organizational capacity. By pro-
viding maximum flexibility, this funding will allow public health
agencies to determine and address their greatest needs and build
core capabilities that will strengthen and support new and existing
programmatic functions. The Committee again directs that no less
than 70 percent of this funding be awarded to health departments.
The Committee encourages CDC to strengthen infrastructure in
local health departments by continuing to directly award funds to
local health departments, and by urging State health department
recipients to allocate resources to local health departments. The
Committee urges CDC to publicly track and report to the Com-
mittee how funds provided to State health departments are passed
through to local health departments.
Public Health Leadership and Support.—The Committee includes
$116,570,000 to support CDC’s foundational public health activities
and to facilitate partnerships. The Committee commends CDC for
its commitment to the development of a diverse healthcare and
public health workforce. Within this total, the Committee includes
$6,500,000 to expand the John R. Lewis CDC Undergraduate Pub-
lic Health Scholars Program, including the opportunity for more
HBCUs to participate, as well as Tribal Colleges and Universities.
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
The Committee provides $47,062,518,000 in base discretionary
resources for the National Institutes of Health [NIH], an increase
of $301,000,000. Additionally, the Committee provides
$226,000,000 in budget authority authorized in the 21st Century
Cures Act (Public Law 114–255), an increase of $99,000,000. Per
the Cures Act, $97,500,000 is transferred to the National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS] and $97,500,000 to
the National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH] for the BRAIN Ini-
tiative; and $31,000,000 to the Office of the Director [OD] for the
All of Us precision medicine initiative. In addition, the Committee
also includes $1,412,482,000 in transfers available under section

106
241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended), for a total
program level for NIH of $48,701,000,000.
As in previous years, the Committee has targeted NIH funding
in areas of promise of scientific advancement and urgency, while
allowing NIH to maintain flexibility to pursue unplanned scientific
opportunities and address unforeseen public health needs. The
Committee increases support for cancer research by $150,000,000,
provides an increase of $100,000,000 for Alzheimer’s Disease/Alz-
heimer’s Disease-Related Dementias [AD/ADRD] research, provides
an increase of $25,000,000 for expanded access grants authorized
by the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act (Pub-
lic Law 117–79), increases support for Antiviral Drug Discovery
Centers [AViDDs] by $20,000,000, increases support for the BRAIN
Initiative by $12,000,000, increases support for Lyme disease re-
search by $10,000,000, increases support for diabetes research by
$10,000,000, provides a $10,000,000 increase for rare disease re-
search, increases support for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network
[UDN] by $9,000,000, and provides $5,000,000 for implementation
of the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton Na-
tional Plan to End Parkinson’s Act (Public Law 118–66). The bill
also includes an increase of $20,000,000 for the Implementing a
Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone [IM-
PROVE Initiative] to combat recent alarming rates of maternal
mortality, and an increase of $30,000,000 for the Office of Research
on Women’s Health [ORWH], of which $10,000,000 is provided for
the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health
[BIRCWH] program. Finally, the bill provides $1,500,000,000 for
the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health [ARPA–H].
The Committee directs NIH to include updates on the following
research, projects, and programs in the fiscal year 2027 Congres-
sional Justification [CJ]: Alzheimer’s Disease/Alzheimer’s Disease-
Related Dementias [AD/ADRD] research; Childhood Post-Infectious
Neuroimmune Disorders/PANS/PANDAS; Common Fund projects;
future goals for each of the deadliest cancers-brain, liver (including
cholangiocarcinoma), lung, ovary, pancreas, and stomach and
esophageal cancers; efforts to determine a uniform definition of se-
vere maternal morbidity; efforts to expand research and represen-
tation opportunities for Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine; efforts to

NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,224,159,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,374,159,000
The Committee recommendation includes $7,374,159,000, an in-
crease of $150,000,000, for the National Cancer Institute [NCI]. Of
this amount, $30,000,000 is available for repairs and improvements
to the NCI facility in Frederick, Maryland.
Advancing Cancer Immunotherapy.—The Committee encourages
NIH to continue to support research to advance double-loaded den-
dritic cell immunotherapy.
Biliary Tract Cancers.—The Committee stongly encourages NIH
to support research to develop novel treatment strategies in biliary
tract cancers, and for basic and translational research as well as
clinical trials in liver cancers, as both are needed to improve state-
of-the-art cancer immunotherapy. The Committee strongly supports
research on novel cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. Targeting
recurrent cancer neoantigens in BTC with novel cancer treatment
vaccine in combination with other drugs that work on the human
immune system could move the treatment paradigm in BTC for-
ward and enable combinatorial immunotherapy trials, including
adoptive cell therapies for future combinatorial immunotherapy
trials, including adoptive cell therapies, in this lethal disease.
Cancer Care Support for Rural Communities.—Rural areas with
limited access to healthcare services often have a high prevalence
of chronic disease and other factors that contribute to increased
levels of cancer mortality. These areas also typically have low
health literacy, poor cancer screening rates and a dearth of spe-
cialty services. The Committee encourages NCI to work with rel-
evant stakeholders, such as academic medical centers, rural hos-
pitals, clinics, and other community partners to determine how best
to direct evidence-based outreach to areas most impacted by cancer
mortality.
Cancer Immunotherapy and Artificial Intelligence [AI].—The
Committee recognizes that targeting a tumor’s immune micro-
environment represents an exciting new approach to preventing the
tumor from growing and spreading, especially for the class of treat-
ments known as immunotherapies. Recent technological advances
in AI, imaging and pathology offer encouraging options for accel-
erating research into how to target a patient’s immune system
against the tumor, but much more work in this area is needed.
Therefore, the Committee encourages NCI to prioritize research on
novel technologies that can help investigators better understand
complex interactions between tumors and the immune system.
Childhood Cancer Data Initiative [CCDI].—The Committee in-
cludes no less than $50,000,000 for the CCDI, including to support
continued enhancement of the CCDI Molecular Characterization
Initiative.
Childhood Cancer STAR Act.—The Committee includes
$28,000,000, for continued implementation of the Childhood Cancer
Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research [STAR] Act (Public
Law 115–180 and 117–350) to support existing biorepositories for

108
childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical trials
to collect and maintain relevant clinical, biological, and demo-
graphic information on all children, adolescents, and young adults
with cancer. The Committee has included funding to carry out
childhood cancer survivorship research and programs as authorized
in the STAR Act, such as supporting research to inform best prac-
tices for the treatment of late effects of childhood cancers, research
to improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better
able to care for this population as they age, and research to inform
innovative models of care for childhood cancer survivors.
Deadliest Cancers.—The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act
[RCRA] of 2012 (Public Law 112–239) focuses on cancers with a 5-
year survival rate below 50 percent, which account for over 40 per-
cent of all U.S. cancer deaths. While advances in some cancers
have made it possible to reduce the overall rate of cancer deaths
over the last several decades, there has been limited progress re-
ducing mortality for these diseases. In fiscal year 2020 (Public Law
116–94), Congress directed NCI to develop a scientific framework
using the process outlined in the RCRA for stomach and esopha-
geal cancers. The Committee commends NCI for developing the
framework and notes that NCI has also launched a Program in
Origins of Gastroesophageal Cancers. Given the devastating toll of
all recalcitrant cancers and the lack of diagnostic and treatment re-
sources currently available, the Committee, alongside the research
and advocacy communities, encourages a continued focus on these
cancers and requests an update on research on each of the dead-
liest cancers-brain, liver (including cholangiocarcinoma), lung,
ovary, pancreas, and stomach and esophageal cancers in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ. Further, given the high mortality rates for these
cancers, the Committee is particularly concerned about reports of
increased incidence of esophageal, liver, pancreas, and stomach
cancer among the adolescent and young adult population and di-
rects NCI to develop a plan with specific actions to understand the
causes and risk factors that are leading to these increases as well
as potential interventions.
HPV Screening, Syphilis Screening, and Self-Collection.—The
Committee recognizes the impact and potential of the Last Mile
Initiative and applauds innovative efforts, such as the emerging
network to study noninvasive self-collection and self-diagnostic op-
portunities for HPV testing. The Committee notes similar opportu-
nities in syphilis and general opportunities to better adopt point-
of-care self-diagnostics in precision medicine and connected
healthcare. NCI is encouraged to continue working with a variety
of stakeholders and to continue studying various approaches to sus-
tain scientific progress.
Improving Native American Cancer Outcomes.—The Committee
urges NCI to continue to coordinate with the National Institute on
Minority Health and Health Disparities [NIMHD] on the Initiative
for Improving Native American Cancer outcomes to support efforts,
including research, education, outreach, and clinical access related
to cancer in Native American populations.
Kidney Cancer.—Kidney cancer is an insidious disease that most
often has no signs or symptoms in early stages. It has not been re-
sponsive to ‘‘traditional’’ cancer interventions such as chemo-

109
therapy and radiation, and the biology has historically been poorly
understood. As a result, it is often the case that once diagnosed,
metastatic disease is present, leading to the low 5-year survival
rate of 18 percent. The Committee encourages NCI to establish a
multi-institute working group that meets annually and incor-
porates involvement from NIDDK, NIBIB, NCATS, and other ap-
propriate Institutes and Centers. This working group should de-
velop a multi-year strategy for improving early detection and sig-
nificantly lowering the mortality rate for kidney cancer patients.
Liver Cancer.—The Committee applauds NCI for seeking input
on how best to address the need to prioritize early detection,
screening, and prevention sciences for primary liver cancer. Pri-
mary liver cancer has a dismal 5-year survival rate of only 22 per-
cent, is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United
States, and unlike most cancers the rate of liver cancer mortality
continues to increase. Action to improve early detection and reduce
liver cancer mortality is urgently needed, as mortality rates have
not meaningfully improved in over a decade. The Committee urges
NCI to continue expanding the use of Program Projects, Coopera-
tive Research and Broad Agency Announcements, and other con-
tract mechanisms to achieve the goals of strategic plans.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer Research.—The Committee recognizes
that metastatic prostate cancer remains highly lethal, with limited
treatment options following relapse. Despite urgent need for inno-
vative therapies, access to investigational treatments, including
early phase clinical trials, remains a significant challenge, given
the advanced age of many patients, multiple comorbidities, and mo-
bility limitations. The Committee urges NCI to prioritize funding
for research that expands access to early phase clinical trials for
metastatic prostate cancer, particularly in community-based set-
tings, to ensure that patients—especially those at the highest risk
of mortality—have the opportunity to benefit from novel thera-
peutic developments.
Natural Products Research.—Research shows that derivatives
from natural products have been an important source of clinically
useful anti-cancer agents, yet not enough evidence-based research
has been done to strategically identify those compounds that could
provide potential benefits in cancer treatment. The Committee en-
courages NCI to continue to support research into whether and
how natural products could be beneficial to cancer patients in re-
ducing the toxicity of therapy or by enhancing therapeutic efficacy
as a primary or adjunctive therapy. The Committee encourages
NCI to continue to fund research to evaluate the potential value of
natural products in reducing adverse effects of cancer therapy and
in enhancing therapeutic efficacy through basic, translational and
clinical trials research. NCI is encouraged to seek applicants that
have a demonstrated expertise in natural products research, are
capable of conducting a holistic review of drugs and disease states
utilizing NCI’s annotated inventory of natural products, and that
are able to test the safety and efficacy of natural products in com-
munities experiencing high rates of healthcare disparities in access
to cancer care.
Neuroblastoma.—The Committee commends NCI for its support
of neuroblastoma research and recognizes the many complex chal-

110
lenges presented by this deadly pediatric cancer. The Committee
encourages NCI to continue investments in this area and requests
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts to improve outcomes
for CNS relapse patients.
Optimal Timing and Sequencing of Cancer Immunotherapy.—The
Committee recognizes that cancer immunotherapy is improving
outcomes for an increasing number of cancer patients, especially
those for whom other treatments were ineffective. New research
suggests that more patients might benefit if immunotherapy were
used earlier in the course of their cancer, or to prevent and inter-
cept cancers before they start. The Committee urges NCI to con-
tinue to support research focused on assessing the optimal timing
for the use of cancer immunotherapy in individual patients. Exam-
ples of such research include studying the effectiveness of cancer
immunotherapy in premalignant conditions, early-stage cancer, and
as a neoadjuvant therapy, prior to additional treatment such as
surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.
Pancreatic Cancer.—Pancreatic cancer will be second only to lung
cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States before 2030. Despite decades of effort, survival remains the
lowest of all the major cancers and is particularly dismal for Black
Americans. It is critical that NCI continue its efforts to support
early detection and clinical research that focuses on pancreatic can-
cer. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of early de-
tection approaches for pancreatic cancer, and the need to ensure di-
verse enrollment in cancer clinical trials, including pancreatic can-
cer trials. The Committee urges the NCI to convene stakeholders—
including scientists, clinicians, and diverse patient representa-
tives—to strategically reconsider current approaches and redesign
both an effective early detection platform and a diversity plan for
clinical trials that will benefit all pancreatic cancer patients and
provide a global model for effective change in the trajectory of a
deadly cancer. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year
2027 CJ regarding progress in early detection research and ongoing
efforts to leverage NCI’s clinical trials networks to advance
progress for all people experiencing a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.
Patient Access to Clinical Trials.—The Committee recognizes that
local healthcare provider and patient access to clinical trials is crit-
ical for improving equitable access to research and novel therapies;
diversifying the population participating in research; ensuring the
safety and efficacy of new drugs; and accelerating the dissemina-
tion and implementation of findings and the adoption of newly ap-
proved therapies. However, access to trials remains out of reach for
many patients and local oncology providers, particularly those in
rural areas and/or at practice sites and hospitals without dedicated
research resources and infrastructure. Leveraging technology can
improve efficiencies of trial start-up, administration, and commu-
nications. A virtual research team who provides centralized re-
search expertise and resources can ultimately support local pro-
vider participation in clinical trials by alleviating the need for spe-
cialized personnel onsite. The NCI’s recently launched Virtual Clin-
ical Trials Office pilot study provides virtual research personnel to
NCI-funded trials conducted at participating NCI-designated can-
cer centers and NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites.

111
The Committee encourages the use of telehealth and expansion of
the clinical trial-related remote services provided by this office. The
Committee requests an update on the Virtual Clinical Trials Office
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ, including demonstrating if there were
increases in local provider and/or patient participation in clinical
trials, especially from rural areas, and challenges and successes in
prescreening/screening of potential trial candidates, obtaining in-
formed consents, data abstraction, building protocol-specific treat-
ment plans, and maintaining a repository for quick adoption into
the local sites.
Pediatric Rare Cancer Therapeutic Development.—Recognizing
that effective treatments for many types of childhood cancer do not
exist yet, the Committee encourages NIH to continue to examine
novel systems for identifying how rare cancers develop and
progress, and to continue supporting and accelerating the develop-
ment and evaluation of life-saving therapeutics for pediatric cancer
patients.
Rural NCI Designation.—The Committee encourages NCI to re-
view its criteria for awarding Cancer Center Support Grants
[CCSGs] to include considerations for Cancer Centers that are pri-
marily providing care to rural patients, conducting cancer research
with rural populations, or otherwise are focused on cancer in rural
America. While recognizing the role that Cancer Centers play in
providing patient care, the Committee also commends the vital
work underway at community cancer clinics across the country and
NCI’s efforts to support them, including through the NCI Commu-
nity Oncology Research Program [NCORP] and the recently created
Working Group in Support of Efforts to Enhance Community Can-
cer Research and Quality Care. The Committee requests an update
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on NCI’s efforts related to promoting
cancer research among rural populations.
Skin Cancer Screening Evidence Gaps.—The Committee urges
NIH to continue to support research in the areas outlined in the
Research Needs and Gaps Section from the U.S. Preventive Serv-
ices Task Force [USPSTF] 2023 Skin Cancer Screening Rec-
ommendation Statement. This will ensure that the Task Force has
the necessary evidence to create the strongest evidence-based rec-
ommendations and further reduce skin cancer morbidity and mor-
tality, especially among those with the greatest burden of disease.
The Committee encourages that these efforts should continue to
prioritize the inclusion of all racial and ethnic groups to investigate
whether the effectiveness of screening, diagnosis, and treatment
vary by group. The Committee requests an update on this effort in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ. The Task Force’s 2023 Skin Cancer Rec-
ommendation Statement identifies several critical research gaps
that restrict the Task Force from making evidence-based rec-
ommendations that address multiple important areas. For example,
the Task Force notes that research is needed to better understand:
the effects of screening on morbidity and mortality or early detec-
tion of skin cancer, particularly melanoma; skin cancer presen-
tations in a variety of skin tones; morbidity and mortality outcomes
reflective of the U.S. population; the effectiveness of screening in
a range of primary care settings that reflect the variation in access
to care in the United States; the effectiveness of screening for re-

112
ducing morbidity and mortality of acral lentiginous melanoma; and
effective risk assessment tools to identify high risk individuals who
would benefit from skin cancer screening. Melanoma is a unique
and major threat to our military community as it was one of the
most frequent diagnoses among male service members and the sec-
ond most frequent cancer diagnosis among female service members
in a 10-year surveillance period. The overall incidence rate of mela-
noma in active-duty military personnel between 2000 and 2007 was
62 percent greater than among the general populace during the
same period. Disparities are also prevalent among rural popu-
lations who lack access to healthcare providers, which often results
in delayed and late-stage diagnoses compared to patients residing
in urban settings.
Theranostics.—Theranostics is a nuclear medicine technique that
combines diagnostic imaging and targeted radiopharmaceutical
therapies to precisely identify and treat diseases like cancer. This
cutting-edge technology uses diagnostic imaging to identify and tar-
get cancer cells; if such cells are present, radiopharmaceutical
therapies are injected intravenously and bind to the targeted can-
cer cells to deliver localized doses of radiation to the tumor.
Theranostics are an innovative, precision medicine technique that
allows for personalized treatment of cancers—such as thyroid can-
cer, prostate cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors—while sparing
healthy tissue around the tumor. Theranostics show huge potential
to advance the battle against cancer; a disease that remains a for-
midable challenge in medicine and has claimed a significant num-
ber of lives nationwide. The Committee encourages NCI to support
research that utilizes and promotes theranostics, where appro-
priate, to provide early, accurate, and effective cancer diagnosis
and treatment.
NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,982,345,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,982,345,000
The Committee recommendation includes $3,982,345,000 for the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI].
Cardiomyopathy Research.—The Committee encourages NHLBI
to support cardiomyopathy research including research regarding
the causation of cardiomyopathy, including genetic causes and mo-
lecular biomarkers, long-term health outcomes in individuals with
cardiomyopathy, including infants, children, teenagers, adults, and
elderly individuals, and facilitate studies using longitudinal data
and retrospective analysis to identify effective treatments and out-
comes for individuals with cardiomyopathy.
Cardiovascular Disease [CVD].—The Committee continues to rec-
ognize that CVD, including heart disease, stroke, and hypertension,
is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide.
The Committee provides robust funding to NHLBI to continue to
address these issues, and to prioritize funding opportunities that
reduce CVD among the hardest-hit geographic areas, such as the
Southern United States.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD].—Among chronic
diseases in the United States in 2022, COPD is the 6th leading
cause of death. Over 16 million Americans have been diagnosed

113
with COPD and it is estimated that a similar number are
undiagnosed and not receiving appropriate treatment. NIH reports
that COPD research funding ranked 182nd in 2023. There is an ur-
gent need for innovative treatments that can effectively slow the
progression and mitigate the lung tissue damage caused by COPD.
Most COPD research and therapy development has focused on later
stages of disease when substantial loss of lung function and dam-
age to lung tissue have already occurred, does not address the un-
derlying causes, and has little opportunity to impact disease pro-
gression. Additionally, there is a need for greater acceptance of
clinical outcome measures that assess what really matters most to
COPD patients in order to support development of more effective
therapies. While NHLBI supports basic and translational research
in COPD, there is currently limited funding provided for observa-
tional and treatment clinical trials, including drug repurposing
studies, that can advance new outcome measures and identify dis-
ease targets for earlier treatment. The Committee encourages
NHLBI to increase support for these research areas and to collabo-
rate with the FDA on patient-centered, novel clinical outcome
measures that support COPD therapy development.
Congenital Heart Disease [CHD].—The Committee commends
NHLBI for its continued work to better understand causation, im-
prove treatments and outcomes, support the growth of the clinical
and research workforce, and integrate registry data and research
datasets to facilitate research on congenital heart disease across
the lifespan, including through the Pediatric Heart Network and
the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium. The Committee en-
courages NHLBI to prioritize CHD activities outlined in its stra-
tegic plan, including improving understanding of outcomes and co-
morbidities, improving treatment options across the lifespan, and
accelerating discovery, analysis, and translation by leveraging CHD
registries and networks. The Committee requests NHLBI include
in its fiscal year 2027 CJ a report on steps being taken to close
these research gaps.
COVID–19 Associated Illnesses.—The Committee recognizes the
growing burden of COVID–19 associated critical illnesses and re-
covery, especially in adults with acute respiratory distress syn-
drome [ARDS], pneumonia, and/or sepsis. The Committee encour-
ages NHLBI, in partnership with the National Institute of General
Medical Sciences, to explore facilitating research support through
ancillary studies enabled by the ARDS, Pneumonia, and Sepsis
Phenotyping [APS] Consortium.
Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—In light of improve-
ments in care leading to patients living into their third decade, the
leading cause of death in DMD patients is heart failure. The Com-
mittee encourages NHLBI to support research that characterizes
fibro-fatty replacement of cardiomyocytes in DMD/BMD. The Com-
mittee encourages NHLBI to explore convening a workshop with
research, clinical, and patient organization leaders to work towards
establishing viable cardiac outcome measures for the development
of therapeutic agents to delay or treat heart disease in individuals
diagnosed with Duchenne. There is growing evidence to support
that select individuals with DMD/BMD would benefit from ventric-
ular assist device placement or heart transplant. The Committee

114
encourages NHLBI to support research to further develop criteria
for identifying patients who may benefit from such strategies.
Lung Health Disparities.—The Committee is concerned about the
disproportionate impact of lung conditions, such as asthma, COPD,
and lung cancer on populations experiencing health disparities, and
encourages NHLBI to work with NIMHD to advance research in
this area. The Committee requests an update from both NHLBI
and NIMHD in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Lung Health Research.—Chronic lung diseases are among the
leading causes of death and chronic illness in the United States in-
cluding the over 15 million Americans diagnosed with chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease [COPD] and related lung diseases.
Most chronic lung disease research to date has focused on later
stages of disease when substantial loss of lung function and dam-
age to lung tissue have already occurred. There is a need for treat-
ments that when applied early in the course of disease can more
effectively slow the progression and mitigate the lung tissue dam-
age caused by chronic lung diseases. NHLBI supports a wide array
of basic and translational research in these conditions. Increased
research is needed to improve our understanding of early disease
to identify appropriate targets to modulate disease progression be-
fore the irreversible tissue damage has occurred. NHLBI-funded
studies such as the COPDGene, SPIROMICS and LungMAP are
critical to this objective and have already provided significant in-
sight to begin to understand the biology of early disease. The Com-
mittee encourages NHLBI to increase support for these and other
early disease research in chronic lung disease.
National Center on Sleep Disorders Research [NCSDR].—The
Committee recognizes NCSDR for facilitating and coordinating ef-
fective sleep health and sleep disorders research across NIH and
HHS. The Committee notes that recent scientific progress along
with improvements in care and therapy are often not reaching the
individuals that could most often benefit from them as time to di-
agnosis for many conditions is measured in years if not decades.
NCSDR is encouraged to work with stakeholders across HHS to
better translate research finding, raise awareness of breakthroughs
and opportunities, and support public health efforts to link patients
to care.
National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases.—The Committee is
pleased with the continued progress of the National Commission on
Lymphatic Diseases. The Committee continues to encourage en-
gagement with relevant stakeholders and other Institutes and Cen-
ters on key priorities and topic areas of need as the Commission
finalizes its comprehensive report on the state of Lymphatic Dis-
eases.
Pulmonary Fibrosis [PF].—The Committee applauds NHLBI for
its growing commitment to groundbreaking research into PF, a
family of chronic diseases affecting more than 250,000 Americans
and taking the lives of roughly 40,000 annually. Yet there remains
no cure and life expectancy is only 3–4 years for many patients.
The Committee encourages NHLBI to sharpen its focus on identi-
fying new paths to improved treatments and creating innovative
ways to support early career investigators so that the pipeline for
PF research will continue to strengthen, thereby providing renewed

115
hope to patients and families facing these serious diseases. The
Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Rare Blood Disorders.—The Committee recognizes NHLBI for its
leadership of the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources, and ap-
preciates efforts to advance science in the rare blood disorders port-
folio. NHLBI is encouraged to sustain progress in this area and to
engage in emerging opportunities for community and cross-agency
collaboration with CDC and HRSA to coordinate research and fur-
ther improve care in immune thrombocytopenia [ITP], hemophelia,
sickle cell disease, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [wAIHA],
and other acquired and inherited blood disorders.
RECOVER Initiative.—The Committee notes with concern that
the multi-organ syndrome known as Long COVID has emerged as
a serious health condition that can cause socioeconomic burdens,
and long-term pulmonary complications represent an important
component of Long COVID. The Committee urges NHLBI, in its co-
leading of the RECOVER Initiative, to continue to prioritize re-
search into the understanding, treatment and prevention of post-
COVID respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in adults and
children, particularly among populations disproportionately im-
pacted by COVID–19.
Wildland Fire Smoke.—The Committee recognizes that exposure
to smoke from wildfires is an occurrence that is impacting more
Americans. The Committee is concerned that public health experts
do not yet fully understand the risk posed by exposure to wildland
fire smoke-particularly acute and chronic smoke exposure to pa-
tients with existing pulmonary and cardiac disease. The Committee
encourages NHLBI to support research to understand the risk
smoke exposure has for patients with underlying health conditions
and any interventions that can be implemented to mitigate adverse
health effects.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $520,163,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 520,163,000
The Committee recommendation includes $520,163,000 for the
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [NIDCR].
NIDCR is the largest institution in the world exclusively dedicated
to researching ways to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial health
for all. It has funded research leading to improvements in oral
health for millions of Americans with investments in pain biology
and management, reducing opioid use, temporomandibular dis-
orders, regenerative medicine, and in developing early diagnostics
and treatments for oral and pharyngeal cancers.
Advancing Head and Neck Cancer Early Detection Research
[AHEAD].—The Committee commends NIDCR for establishing
AHEAD to accelerate translational and clinical research on the
early detection of head and neck cancers [HNC]. The initiative
aims to increase scientific knowledge of the molecular characteris-
tics of dysplastic tissue lesions, which are the predominant pre-
cursor for HNCs. The Committee encourages NIDCR to support re-
search to utilize data from The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] and
other genomic and proteomic projects to help match tumor defects

116
with patient clinical outcomes, which could lead to tailored bio-
marker identification for early diagnosis and treatment.
Oral Care Interventions.—The Committee reaffirms that dental
care is integral to the medical management of numerous diseases
and medical conditions and that the lack of medically necessary
oral healthcare heightens the risk of costly medical complications.
The Committee appreciates NIH’s support for research that has
demonstrated that dental care is closely linked to and crucial to the
clinical success of other covered medical services. The Committee
urges NIH to fund additional research in this area and conduct
trials to determine which oral care interventions are most effective
for reducing the prevalence and improving the medical manage-
ment of malignant oral cancers and chronic diseases, preventing
pneumonia in hospitals, and lowering hospitalization and emer-
gency department admission rates for oral diseases and conditions.
Temporomandibular Disorders [TMD].—The Committee com-
mends NIDCR for developing the TMD Collaborative for Improving
Patient-Centered Translational Research [TMD IMPACT]. The
timely implementation of the TMD IMPACT Collaborative into a
national consortium is essential. The Committee is pleased NIDCR
has funded nine TMD IMPACT groups. The Committee encourages
NIDCR to maintain a patient-centered approach in the implemen-
tation of this Collaborative by including patients and advocacy or-
ganizations in this next phase of the project. The Committee is en-
couraged to see that NIDCR has added collaborators including the
FDA, NIAMS, NIBIB, NINDS, NCCIH, OBSSR, and ORWH.
NIDCR should encourage other Agencies and Institutes, Centers,
and Offices within NIH with appropriate scientific expertise to par-
ticipate in and support this project. Given the complexity of TMDs,
interdisciplinary expertise is essential, particularly in addressing
comorbidities and chronic pain conditions. The Committee directs
NIH to provide an update within 120 days on the progress to im-
plement the next phase of this important initiative including the
recruitment of other NIH Institutes as partners. The Committee
urges NIDCR to enhance the centralized resources of the two TMD
national programs [TMD IMPACT] to advance interdisciplinary
care, disseminate best practices, refine clinical guidelines, and inte-
grate research into precision care for TMD patients. Finally, the
Committee acknowledges NIDCR’s participation and support of the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Report
on TMDs and urges continued engagement to advance a scientific
understanding and improve patient care.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY
DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,310,721,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,320,721,000
The Committee recommendation includes $2,320,721,000, an in-
crease of $10,000,000, for the National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK].
Diabetes.—The Committee provides an increase of $10,000,000
and commends the efforts of NIDDK to prioritize the discovery and
validation of biomarkers and urges NIDDK to continue to prioritize
this important work that will accelerate the designing and con-

117
ducting of clinical trials to prevent, treat, and cure type 1 diabetes.
The Committee urges NIDDK to work with the National Institute
on Aging to explore the relationship between diabetes and
neurocognitive conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Further, the Committee encourages NIDDK to expand re-
search into metabolic interventions for diabetes and its associated
comorbidities, including obesity and cardiovascular disease, with
particular attention to nutritional and other innovative manage-
ment strategies as potential therapeutic approaches. This includes
support for large-scale clinical trials aimed at identifying predictive
biological and metabolic biomarkers, optimizing patient stratifica-
tion, and developing best practice clinical guidelines. Research
should employ multimodal data collection, including imaging, ge-
netics, and cellular biology, to advance understanding of the under-
lying mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction and inform personal-
ized, metabolism-based treatment and prevention strategies.
Diabetic Eye Disease.—The Committee notes the connection be-
tween diabetes and eye health. The Committee encourages NIDDK
to engage with relevant Institutes and Centers and stakeholders to
identify collaborative opportunities to improve research and com-
munity-level intervention activities in diabetic eye disease.
Hepatitis B.—The Committee applauds NIDDK efforts to create
common resource services and materials for the research commu-
nity and urges continued focus on clinical networks, databank de-
velopment and precision medicine approaches. The Committee fur-
ther urges the development of experimental animal and cell culture
models to help advance cure research against the widest possible
set of therapeutic targets and research focused on understanding
the virology and immunology of people with low levels of HBsAg,
a protein on the surface of the hepatitis B virus-as this category
of people are more responsive to therapy. The Committee is aware
of the view within the scientific community that finding a cure for
hepatitis B, as has been achieved for hepatitis C, is a winnable goal
and is within reach in the near term. For these reasons, the Com-
mittee urges that research, based on the needs as identified in the
updated Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure Hepatitis
B, be funded by NIH in fiscal year 2026 and beyond.
Kidney Transplant Disparities.—The Committee appreciates
NIDDK’s ongoing work on kidney disease research, particularly on
disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney
diseases through new studies to address disparities in kidney
transplant care. The Committee reaffirms the importance of reduc-
ing health disparities and urges NIDDK to support health dispari-
ties research to improve kidney transplant care.
Nutrition Science and Addressing Chronic Diseases.—The Com-
mittee recognizes NIDDK for its leadership advancing nutrition
science particularly as it relates to a variety of chronic conditions.
Further, the Committee appreciates that the benefit and impact of
further scientific advancements goes beyond digestive and meta-
bolic conditions and encourages cross-cutting collaborative research
efforts in nutrition science and chronic diseases with relevant NIH
Institutes and Centers in support of ongoing and emerging efforts,
many of which are coordinated by ONR at the Office of the Direc-

118
tor, including the concept for Food is Medicine Networks or Centers
of Excellence.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,603,925,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,773,925,000
The Committee recommendation includes $2,773,925,000, for the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS].
This amount includes a $50,000,000 increase for NINDS’ Alz-
heimer’s Disease and Related Dementias [ADRD] research. This
amount also includes $100,000,000, a $25,000,000 increase, for Ac-
celerating Access to Critical Therapies [ACT] for ALS Act (Public
Law 117–79) research funded by NINDS which was previously pro-
vided to the Office of the Director. Finally, the amount includes
$69,890,000, $6,000,000 increase, for the BRAIN Initiative.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] Research.—The Committee
commends NINDS for its leadership in the NIH ALS Strategic
Planning Working Group and development of the 2023 priorities for
ALS research focused on more effective diagnosis, prevention,
treatment, and a cure. The Committee provides an increase of
$25,000,000 to support these efforts, and urges NINDS to use this
funding to bolster ALS clinical trials, therapies, targeted therapies,
and treatments.
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias
[AD/ADRD].—The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000
across NIH for AD/ADRD research, including an increase of
$50,000,000 in NINDS and $50,000,000 in NIA.
Angelman Syndrome [AS].—The Committee understands that
NINDS is convening research leaders, patient organizations, and
other stakeholders to prepare a roadmap for clinical outcomes
measures and biomarkers for AS, a rare neurogenetic disorder. As
a part of and following this convening, NINDS is urged to support
funding for clinical outcome measures and biomarker development,
determine more efficient pathways for developing and manufac-
turing novel gene therapies for neurodevelopmental diseases, and
inform the next generation of clinical studies that should be pur-
sued based on approved biomarkers. NIH should ensure timely and
comprehensive data-sharing across investigators and industry in
order to advance these goals. NINDS shall provide a report to the
Committees on this initiative within 1 year of enactment.
Brain Aneurysms.—The Committee remains concerned that an
estimated 1 out of every 50 individuals in the United States has
a brain aneurysm and an estimated 30,000 Americans suffer a
brain aneurysm rupture each year, with little or no warning. Rup-
tured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 50 percent of cases. De-
spite the widespread prevalence of this condition and the high soci-
etal cost it imposes on our Nation, the Federal Government only
spends approximately $2.08 per year on brain aneurysm research
for each person afflicted with a brain aneurysm. The Committee
encourages NINDS to increase its support for research focused on
prevention and early detection of brain aneurysms.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [CJD].—The Committee commends the
NAPA Advisory Council report from 2023 that acknowledges the
scientific connection between prion diseases and ADRDs, and the

119
2024 Update that specifically mentioned CJD, and continues to en-
courage NIH to recognize prion diseases as ADRDs and fund more
research for prion diseases, like CJD. ADRDs have already bene-
fited from prion disease research, and further integration of the
fields could lead to beneficial new treatments and improve sci-
entific understanding of these devastating diseases.
Frontotemporal Degeneration [FTD].—The Committee encourages
NIH to continue to support research to identify and validate bio-
markers for FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases among ra-
cially and ethnically diverse cohorts. Easily accessible biomarkers
to accurately detect and measure disease will facilitate greater ac-
cess to diagnosis and promote participation in research on all forms
of dementia. Natural history studies like ALLFTD facilitate bio-
marker discovery and enable the design of clinical trials to test in-
novative treatments. Equally critical is the development of a data
biosphere that enhances secure sharing of clinical and research
data and biological samples for FTD. Broad sharing of datasets will
enable the larger community of researchers to bring their expertise
to bear on the challenge of treating and preventing FTD and other
ADRDs. The Committee also encourages NIH to find ways to sup-
port more effective communication across researchers, and between
clinical science and broader society, to ensure that the research ad-
vances driven by NIH can have maximum effect on improving
health. FTD is rare and tends to occur at a younger age than other
forms of dementia. This creates additional challenges for clinical
trials and research. To overcome these challenges as well as re-
cruitment and retention issues, the Committee urges NIH to fund
investigators who reflect the broad variety of study populations
who can ensure culturally appropriate research is being conducted
as well as develop innovative clinical trial designs that recruit di-
verse populations so that potential therapies can be tested more ef-
ficiently and effectively.
Improving Diagnostic Testing for Neurodegernative Diseases.—
The Committee supports HHS efforts to prevent and effectively
treat neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease,
Lewy body dementia, and other related disorders. The Committee
also recognizes that early detection is imperative to improving
health outcomes and patient quality of life by delaying or halting
the progression of such diseases. To improve the ability of
healthcare providers to diagnose and treat neurodegenerative dis-
eases at an earlier onset, the Committee encourages NINDS to
work with healthcare-related entities, manufacturers, and devel-
opers, as appropriate, to promote the awareness and research of
novel diagnostic testing, including tests that detect and visualize
protein markers using skin and other accessible tissues, for
neurodegenerative diseases. The Committee also encourages
NINDS to collaborate with appropriate stakeholders, including
CMS, to improve access to such novel diagnostic tests for
neurodegenerative diseases by evaluating current Medicare and
Medicaid coverage to determine if such coverage is adequate.
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [ME/
CFS] Research Roadmap.—The Committee recognizes the urgent
need to advance research for ME/CFS, especially given its overlap
with Long COVID and relevance across multiple ICs and com-

120
mends NIH for approving the ME/CFS Research Roadmap. The
Committee encourages NIH to implement the roadmap’s rec-
ommendations, including advancing biomarker discovery, diag-
nostic tool development, and clinical trials. NIH is further directed
to provide a detailed implementation plan to the Committee within
180 days of enactment.
Multiple System Atrophy [MSA].—The Committee notes the con-
nection between MSA and Parkinson’s Disease and the potential
for advancements in research that impact both communities. The
Committee notes the lack of treatment options and the lengthy
time to diagnosis MSA and encourages NINDS to work with com-
munity stakeholders to implement the National Plan to End Par-
kinson’s.
National Parkinson’s Project.—The Committee includes
$5,000,000 for NIH to continue the implementation of the National
Parkinson’s Project, as created by the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and
Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act
(Public Law 118–66). Within 90 days of enactment of this act, NIH
shall provide a briefing describing planned next steps the agency
will take to implement the act.
Opioids, Stimulants, and Pain Management.—The Committee
provides no less than $285,295,000 in NINDS for the HEAL Initia-
tive. The Committee encourages NINDS to continue its efforts
through the HEAL Initiative, with a focus on grant opportunities
to support research and education for effective and non-addictive
pain management to improve outcomes for people with pain in di-
verse settings across the United States.
Pediatric-Onset Epilepsies Network.—The Committee is aware of
the enormous economic cost and toll in human suffering resulting
from epilepsies and considers research in this area a high priority.
There are approximately 470,000 children currently living with epi-
lepsy, as well as three million adults, many of whom were diag-
nosed as children. Creating an infrastructure with a goal of under-
standing pediatric epilepsies diagnoses by cause and coordinating
research across institutions may increase the potential for scientific
progress in the era of precision medicine. This network could in-
clude efforts to unite key assets and support a collaborative, multi-
disciplinary research model to enroll patients from many settings
to accelerate therapy development and expedite translation of re-
search findings into standard clinical care. Therefore, the Com-
mittee urges NINDS, in collaboration with the epilepsies stake-
holder community and the Curing the Epilepsies conference, to es-
tablish the Pediatric-Onset Epilepsies Network. Such a network
could enable cooperative research studies, accelerate the develop-
ment of knowledge about epilepsies, and rapidly advance thera-
peutic options, including genetic therapies, and their implementa-
tion to improve treatments and healthcare outcomes. The Com-
mittee directs the NIH Director to provide a report on key findings
and planned actions within 1 year of enactment and annually
thereafter.
Preventive and Early-Treatment Cognitive and Brain Health Re-
search.—The Committee encourages NIH to give greater attention
to the study of the pre-symptomatic or preclinical stages of neuro-
logical disorders, that is, alterations in cognitive and brain health

121
before the first clinical symptoms of neurological disease when per-
sons typically encounter medical professionals. Learning what hap-
pens during these stages may guide the development of measures
for detection and monitoring earlier in the course of disease, includ-
ing sensitive neuropsychological measure and biomarkers, which
could improve early interventions development and testing for neu-
rological disease before it becomes disabling and, ultimately, pre-
vent diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, mul-
tiple sclerosis, stroke, and epilepsy. Mounting evidence suggests
that significant pathologies have already accumulated by the time
symptoms appear and early, pre-symptomatic intervention may im-
prove outcomes and may reduce the costs that neurological disease
pose on our health system. Additionally, the Committee supports
NIH and relevant agencies research on emerging non-toxic ap-
proaches to the treatment of related neurological disorders, includ-
ing elovanoids.
Research on Dementia in Parkinson’s Disease [PD].—The Com-
mittee encourages NIA and NINDS to expand the use of fiscal year
2026 and beyond AD/ADRD funding to fund projects studying de-
mentia in PD. PD is the second most common and fastest growing
neurodegenerative disease globally and is characterized by the ab-
normal folding of a protein in the brain, which is similar to what
typically occurs in AD/ADRD. Channeling additional resources into
research could help to unlock groundbreaking dementia-relevant
discoveries in crucial areas like PD and other closely associated
neurological disorders.
Spinal Cord Injury [SCI].—The Committee recognizes SCI as a
pressing public health concern, given its potential to cause severe
paralysis, chronic pain, dependence on mechanical ventilation, and
a host of other debilitating outcomes. With millions of individuals
worldwide lacking any effective therapy to restore function, the
Committee urges NINDS to increase its investment in both pre-
clinical and translational research aimed at identifying novel SCI
treatments. Of particular importance are research efforts focused
on promoting regeneration of the neural pathways that support
respiratory function, preventing the onset of chronic neuropathic
pain, and developing cutting-edge imaging modalities to accurately
track and measure patient responses to therapies. Targeted fund-
ing in these priority areas holds the promise of significantly im-
proving quality of life for patients and their families, mitigating the
vast economic and societal impact of this devastating condition,
and propelling progress toward meaningful, long-term clinical solu-
tions.
Stroke.—Despite notable progress in the stroke mortality rate, it
remains the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of se-
vere long-term disability. The Committee supports continued re-
search to improve the scientific understanding of the brain and
stroke, and the translation of that science exploring new treat-
ments and improved approaches to stroke recovery and rehabilita-
tion through the NIH funded clinical trials network StrokeNet. The
Committee also supports continued stroke-related research con-
ducted through the BRAIN Initiative. This initiative is revolution-
izing our understanding of the brain and offering hope for the mil-
lions of individuals impacted by brain diseases, disorders, and inju-

122
ries including stroke. African Americans have a disproportionately
higher prevalence of stroke and the highest death rate from stroke
compared to any other racial group. The Committee encourages
continued investment in research to understand and eliminate
health inequities across neurological disorders and stroke, includ-
ing the Community-Engaged Health Equity Research in Neuro-
science [HERN] Initiative.
Treatments for PSP, CBD, MSA.—Progressive supranuclear
palsy [PSP], corticobasal degeneration [CBD] and multiple system
atrophy [MSA] are rare, adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases
with significant care burdens, no diagnostic biomarkers, and no
disease-modifying treatments or cures. Average life expectancy fol-
lowing symptom onset is approximately 7 years, and accurate diag-
nosis remains a major challenge-currently achieved in only about
25 percent of cases. The Committee urges NINDS to continue to
ensure that PSP, CBD, and MSA are included in relevant pro-
grammatic initiatives, data collection efforts, and strategic plan-
ning activities focused on neurodegenerative disorders. Specific at-
tention should be given to the development of diagnostic biomark-
ers and therapeutic targets. The Committee further encourages the
allocation of dedicated resources to support research that addresses
the unique clinical and scientific challenges presented by these dis-
eases.
Tuberous Sclerosis.—The Committee understands the importance
of continuing to fund research on Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in
order to support ongoing progress for finding cutting-edge treat-
ments and potential cures for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.
Undiagnosed Diseases Network [UDN].—The Committee provides
an increase of $9,000,000, for UDN and directs the continuation of
the coordinating center, all clinical sites, DNA sequencing core,
central biorepository, model organisms screening center, and other
necessary testing in the pursuit of diagnoses, including but not lim-
ited to: metabolomics, infectious and toxic exposures, and immune
abnormalities.
Udall Centers of Excellence in PD.—Established in 1997 by Pub-
lic Law 105–78, the Udall Centers were designed to be the anchor
of the NIH research efforts in PD. Over the past several years, the
number of Udall Centers has shrunk from 10 to 5, despite more
than 1 million Americans suffering from PD with this population
expected to grow to 2 million by 2050. Moreover, the current esti-
mated economic cost of PD in the United States is $52,000,000,000
annually. The Committee believes that the Udall Center program
is in need of re-investment to accelerate progress on new treat-
ments in the fight against PD. The Committee encourages NINDS
to robustly support the establishment of new Udall Centers and ex-
plore ways to expand the number of centers informed by the Dr.
Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan
to End Parkinson’s Act (Public Law 118–66).
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,562,279,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,592,279,000

123
The Committee provides $6,592,279,000, an increase of
$30,000,000, for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases [NIAID].
Antiviral Drug Discovery Centers [AViDDs].—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of research and development of new
antivirals and their ability to combat new viral outbreaks and pre-
vent them from becoming pandemics, and includes $20,000,000 to
continue to support this effort. The Committee supports the
AViDDs and their mission to develop antiviral drugs to serve as
our first line of defense against forthcoming viral outbreaks. The
Committee is concerned that NIH reported to the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States that future funding for the program has
been eliminated, leaving them funded for only three out of the in-
tended 5 years. The Committee directs NIH to continue supporting
antiviral drug discovery to mitigate the risk of future viral out-
breaks.
Bacteriophage Therapy.—The Committee recognizes that engi-
neered bacteriophage therapy has emerged as one of the most
promising technologies for combating the global crisis of multi-
drug-resistant bacterial infections. The Committee further notes
that recent advancements in artificial intelligence, high-throughput
robotic screening, and advanced biomanufacturing have enabled
bacteriophage therapy to selectively eliminate pathogenic bacterial
species while preserving the body’s natural microbiome. To advance
this critical innovation, the Committee encourages NIAID to con-
tinue supporting research and clinical trials on bacteriophage ther-
apy in the United States.
Celiac Disease.—The Committee commends NIH for issuing a
Notice of Special Interest to spur additional research on the study
of celiac disease. Today, the only known treatment is a gluten-free
diet; however, recent public and private sector research confirms
that such a ‘‘treatment’’ is insufficient for many who suffer from ce-
liac disease. The Committee encourages NIH to devote focused re-
search on the study of celiac disease and continues to urge the
newly created NIH Office of Autoimmune Disease Research
[OADR] to work with NIAID and other NIH Institutes to: support
new research on celiac disease; better coordinate existing research;
and focus new research efforts toward causation, diagnosis, man-
agement, treatment, and, ultimately, a cure of this disease. The
Committee directs NIH to include updates on research, projects,
and programs for celiac disease in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Centers for Research on Emerging Infectious Diseases [CREID].—
The Committee provides $18,200,000 for CREID, a global network
of centers dedicated detecting emerging infectious diseases as early
as possible. The network investigates how and where viruses and
other pathogens emerge from wildlife and spread diseases to peo-
ple-information that is critical to waging rapid responses to such
outbreaks. The Committee directs NIAID to provide continued
funding for the network.
Co-Infection.—The Committee applauds the successes of the Mar-
tin Delaney Collaboratories for HIV Cure Research [MDC] in fos-
tering collaboration towards development of potential curative
strategies for HIV. Approximately 5 percent to 15 percent of people
with HIV in the United States also have chronic hepatitis B virus

124
[HBV] infection, and liver disease is a leading cause of death for
people living with HIV. The Committee urges hepatitis B be in-
cluded in ongoing MDC work to more effectively address HIV and
hepatitis B co-infection. Until we have curative therapy, improved
treatments for chronic hepatitis B are needed that will lead to bet-
ter health and treatment sustainability. The Committee urges en-
hanced collaboration with the Office of AIDS Research, and in-
creased effort towards developing and studying new, innovative,
and potentially life-saving treatments for chronic hepatitis B mono-
infection and hepatitis B/HIV co-infection, especially Long-Acting
Antivirals.
Equipping NIH Research Programs to Target HIV/AIDS
Hotspots.—The Committee directs the NIH Office of AIDS Research
to coordinate NIH-wide resources to focus on areas with the high-
est prevalence of HIV/AIDS, for example, utilizing Centers for
AIDS Research [CFARs] to develop targeted interventions that in-
crease the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] and better pro-
tect those communities from HIV transmission and its con-
sequences.
Food Allergies.—The Committee recognizes the serious issue of
food allergies which affect approximately 8 percent of children and
10 percent of adults in the United States. The Committee com-
mends the ongoing work of NIAID in advancing FDA approved
treatment options for people with food allergies and increasing sup-
port for clinical investigation to a total of 27 clinical sites for this
critical research, including 14 sites as part of the Consortium for
Food Allergy Research [CoFAR].
Hepatitis B.—The Committee applauds NIAID for leading the ef-
fort to update the Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure
Hepatitis B, so it remains a robust roadmap to find a cure. The
Committee is aware of the widely held view in the scientific com-
munity that finding a cure for hepatitis B, as has now been
achieved for hepatitis C, is a winnable goal and is within reach in
the near-term. For these reasons, the Committee urges that re-
search, based on the needs as identified in the updated Plan, be
funded in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. The Committee urges
NIAID to expand the use of Program Projects, R01 and U01 Coop-
erative Research Agreements, and other contract mechanisms to
discover and develop new therapies for chronic hepatitis B and D.
The Committee applauds the success of the point of Care Tech-
nologies Research Network [POCTRN] and Rapid Acceleration of
Diagnostics [RADX] programs and encourages more use of these
programs for development of point-of-care tests for HBV, HDV and
the cancers caused by these viruses. Efforts for establishment of
biologically relevant animal models, particularly, the immune com-
petent small animal models supporting persistent HBV infection, to
support the development of immune modulators for the functional
cure of chronic hepatitis B should be supported.
Hereditary Angioedema [HAE] with Normal C1 Inhibitor.—The
Committee applauds the previous work across NIH to identify ge-
netic mutations that cause HAE and to advance treatment options
and care for affected individuals, moving a once deadly rare disease
to a largely manageable chronic illness. However, the Committee
notes that challenges persist in diagnosis, treatment, and care for

125
HAE patients with normal c1 Inhibitor and encourages NIAID to
work with other Institutes and Centers, and the stakeholder com-
munity, to advance research in this key area.
HIV Self-Testing.—The Committee strongly supports advance-
ment of technologies that enable rapid self-testing for HIV, particu-
larly those technologies that detect HIV in people on current or fu-
ture therapeutics and vaccines. The Committee notes the critical
importance of having such self-testing technologies available before
new options for therapeutic control and HIV vaccines become wide-
ly available. Self-testing technologies are necessary for individuals
to know their HIV status and seek care to initiate treatment,
thereby supporting ongoing HIV prevention efforts. Thus, the Com-
mittee urges NIH to fund as many meritorious proposals as pos-
sible to bring these important tests to market.
HIV Vaccine Research.—There are 1.2 million people living with
HIV in the United States, and 36,000 new infections per year. HIV
causes more deaths annually than breast cancer or prostate cancer.
After decades of scientific effort and consistent NIH investment, we
now have a clear, evidence-based road map for developing a suc-
cessful HIV vaccine. Efforts like the HIV Vaccine Trials Unit
[HVTN] and its partner clinical research centers in 13 States en-
sure that expertise from all corners of the United States are con-
tributing to this effort. The Committee notes that in May 2025,
NIH notified researchers that it will not renew funding for major
research consortia working to develop the most cutting-edge experi-
mental HIV vaccines into clinical trials. For 40 years, researchers
have sought to develop an HIV vaccine, and NIH is the largest sin-
gle funder of HIV vaccine research, providing 70 percent of the
global research efforts. The Committee directs NIH to continue to
support sustained, robust Federal funding for HIV vaccine re-
search.
National Biocontainment Laboratories [NBLs].—The Committee
provides $23,000,000, to the two NBLs to support core and shared
resources for BSL–4 containment, enabling them to develop and
maintain the research resources, facilities and personnel needed to
meet the national biodefense and emerging infectious diseases re-
search needs in the event of a deliberate act of bioterrorism or nat-
urally occurring public health emergency. The Committee notes
that research on high consequence zoonotic viruses requires high-
containment BSL–4 labs. High-containment BSL–4 labs enable re-
searchers to diagnose and investigate these types of pathogens, and
develop rapid and reliable diagnostics, novel antiviral therapeutics,
and vaccines, without endangering the staff or population at large.
Additional investments in BSL–4 infrastructure for research in
highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses is critical. The Committee di-
rects that this funding be used by the NBLs to support (1) main-
taining the research resources for biodefense, emerging infectious
disease agents, and other infectious disease threats to global
health; (2) training new researchers in biosafety level 4 practices;
(3) maintaining a workforce skilled in BSL–4 research; and (4) es-
tablishing best practices for the safe, effective, and efficient conduct
of research in BSL–4 facilities.
Neglected Disease Research.—The Committee strongly supports
NIAID’s neglected disease research programs, including for HIV/

126
AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases. NIH
is the world’s single largest funder of neglected disease research
and has supported the development of high-impact technologies for
health areas that receive little attention from industry. Given that
many innovation gaps persist, NIAID is directed to continue to sup-
port this research.
Regional Biocontainment Laboratories [RBLs].—For nearly two
decades the RBLs have played a vital role as part of the nation’s
biodefense infrastructure helping the United States prepare and re-
spond to emerging infectious disease agents. The Committee is
pleased NIAID competitively awarded UC7 awards to the RBLs.
The Committee encourages NIAID to allow grantees to carry over
unused funds into fiscal year 2027 to support this vital work of the
RBLs. The Committee provides $52,000,000, to the 12 RBLs to sup-
port core and shared resources for BSL–3 containment and related
activities within the RBL facility in its entirety. To the extent pos-
sible, of this amount, no less than $3,000,000 shall be provided to
each of the 12 RBLs to support training and maintaining a capable
research workforce with broad, relevant biomedical, technological,
veterinary, and regulatory expertise, supporting operations, facili-
ties, and equipment purchase costs, and supporting research uti-
lizing the capabilities of the RBLs. The remaining funding shall go
to the 12 RBLs to support: (1) research on biodefense, emerging in-
fectious disease agents, and other infectious disease threats to glob-
al health; (2) training new researchers, including in biosafety level
3 practices; (3) maintaining a workforce skilled in BSL–3 research;
and (4) establishing best practices for the safe, effective, and effi-
cient conduct of research in BSL–3 facilities. All funding shall be
used to support the aforementioned activities conducted within the
RBL, and should not be limited to just the BSL–3 space.
Research on Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee is
aware that antibiotic stewardship programs are a key component
in preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance in all healthcare
facilities in the United States and across the world. The Committee
provides no less than $565,000,000 to fund NIAID research to com-
bat AMR and the training of new investigators to improve AMR re-
search capacity as outlined in the 2020–2025 National Action Plan
to Combat Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria [CARB]. In the CARB,
2020–2025, one of the five goals was to Accelerate Basic and Ap-
plied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Thera-
peutics, and Vaccines in order to improve understanding of the
many factors that contribute to the emergence, spread, and persist-
ence of antibiotic resistance and to support new strategies for pre-
venting and mitigating infections. NIH has supported research to
understand mechanisms of AMR spread and to mitigate inappro-
priate usage of antibiotics. The Committee urges NIAID to undergo
an assessment of the current infection control and health services
research, determine where the gaps exist, and create a research
agenda to help advance this important area of knowledge.
Tuberculosis [TB].—According to the World Health Organization,
a total of 1.25 million people died from TB in 2023 (including
161,000 people with HIV). Worldwide, TB is the leading infectious
killer and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV.
Critical scientific research into the development of new TB diag-

127
nostic, treatment and prevention tools was delayed during the
COVID–19 pandemic. The Committee commends NIAID on the
publication of the 2024 update to the Strategic Plan for Tuber-
culosis Research and encourages NIAID to continue its implemen-
tation.
Universal Flu Vaccine.—The Committee includes $270,000,000 to
support efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines that pro-
vides long-lasting protection against numerous flu strains, rather
than a select few. The Committee notes that on May 1, 2025, NIH
received a $500,000,000 transfer from the Administration for Stra-
tegic Preparedness and Response [ASPR] to accelerate the develop-
ment of universal vaccines using beta-propiolactone [BPL]-inac-
tivated, whole-virus platform. Given this substantial increase,
within the total provided, the Committee does not provide funding
to support vaccine development using the beta-propiolactone [BPL]-
inactivated, whole-virus platform. The Committee urges NIAID to
prioritize research needed to develop a universal influenza vaccine
and directs NIH to ensure that all universal influenza vaccine re-
search activities are approved by NIH’s rigorous multi-tiered re-
view system, including the NIAID National Advisory and Infectious
Diseases Council.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,244,679,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,244,679,000
The Committee provides $3,244,679,000 for the National Insti-
tute of General Medical Sciences [NIGMS], which includes
$1,412,482,000 in transfers available under 241 of the PHS Act
(Public Law 104–73 as amended).
Biomedical Research Workforce Training.—Training programs at
the NIH provide a quality standard of training for graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral fellows in biomedical research. The training
grants that support these programs at research institutions across
the country play a vital role in establishing a biomedical research
ecosystem and train the next generation of researchers for health-
related research needs. Despite the success of training programs,
the number of students and postdoctoral scholars supported on
training grants has remained constant over the years. The Com-
mittee applauds NIH efforts to increase funding for IDeA States
and urges NIH to also emphasize the importance of supporting
training grants in IDeA States. The Committee directs NIH Insti-
tutes and Centers to conduct and provide to the Committees, a
portfolio analysis within 120 days of enactment. The analysis will
assess the distribution of T32 training grants among States, includ-
ing number of applicants and success rates per State to ensure
NIH is supporting capacity building and a diverse workforce for the
future biomedical research enterprise. In addition to the portfolio
analysis, in the fiscal year 2027 CJ, NIH is directed to provide an
update on specific actions NIH will take to identify and remove
barriers for applying for training grants in IDeA States.
Bridge Programs.—The Committee strongly supports opportuni-
ties for students with limited access to STEMM [Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine] education and re-
search. The Committee recognizes the effectiveness and importance

128
of NIGMS bridging programs that support historically underserved
students and researchers to pursue STEMM studies and become
the nation’s next generation of researchers, including programs
such as the Bridges to the Baccalaureate Research Training Pro-
gram, Bridges to the Doctorate Research Training Program,
Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program [PREP], Advancing
Research Careers [ARC] program, and Maximizing Opportunities
for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers [MOSAIC] pro-
gram. The Committee is extremely concerned that NIH terminated
many of these programs in 2025, and directs NIH to reestablish
them. The Committee urges NIH to expand the size of existing
training programs that bridge different educational or career
stages and establish these programs at institutions that have his-
torically received low levels of funding support from NIH, including
Minority Serving Institutions and institutions that are eligible
under the Department of Education’s Strengthening Institutions
Program. The Committee urges NIH to set clear mentorship and
support standards for students participating in these programs.
The Committee urges NIH to encourage and provide more guidance
to participating institutions to account for sufficient staff and out-
reach, budget and other training-related expenses in grant applica-
tions. Finally, the Committee directs NIH to provide a report on
these activities within 90 days of enactment.
Institutional Development Award [IDeA].—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the IDeA program in enhancing geo-
graphical representation across NIH’s research portfolio, and pro-
vides continued funding for the program. In order to ensure that
research investments from IDeA programs provide maximum ben-
efit, the Committee urges NIH to examine ways to increase NIH
IDeA State participation in major grant programs across NIH’s
portfolio, including those that support biomedical research facili-
ties, instrumentation, and training. The Committee notes the Bio-
medical Research Workforce Working Group report and supports
growing the IDeA funding level to its minimum recommended level,
which will allow NIH to take advantage of the full diversity of the
nation’s assets: diversity of individuals, diversity of institutions,
and diversity of geography. Currently eligible States have histori-
cally had low aggregate success rates for grant applications to NIH
and rely on the IDeA program to help build a research infrastruc-
ture and enhance research capacity at institutions in those States.
Finally, the Committee opposes any efforts within NIH to change
eligibility for the IDeA program to a system that would be based
on States’ populations.
IDeA Clinician Researcher Support.—The Committee recognizes
the NIH’s continued efforts to support mentorship and career de-
velopment of clinician researchers through the Clinical and
Translational Science Awards and other programs. However, the
Committee is concerned that IDeA-eligible States do not have equi-
table access to funding to support mentored career development.
The Committee encourages NIH to support mentored career devel-
opment funding for physicians and clinicians in IDeA States.
IDeA Networks for Clinical and Translational Research [IDeA–
CTR].—The Committee notes the success of the IDeA Clinical and
Translational Research centers to develop infrastructure and

129
human resources to more effectively conduct clinical and
translational research. Further, the Committee notes the potential
for further enhancement and progress through meaningful collabo-
ration with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards [CTSA]
program, particularly in rural areas. The Committee encourages
NIGMS and NCATS to provide a general roadmap for collaborative
opportunities that preserve the autonomy of both programs while
removing barriers to allow for rapid scientific advancement and im-
proved local care and research.
Increasing Diversity in Biomedical Research.—The Committee
strongly supports opportunities for the nation’s next generation of
researchers and efforts to enhance diversity in biomedical research.
Early-stage researchers, particularly those from groups underrep-
resented in biomedical research, spend longer periods of time in
postdoctoral positions with lower salaries, receive inadequate
mentorship, and are offered fewer opportunities for professional ad-
vancement, resulting in lower retention rates for those groups.
Even with these obstacles, many early-stage researchers tackle
riskier projects and have contributed to research that has gen-
erated positive outcomes for the benefit of society. Grant programs
offering support and opportunities for researchers at key career
transition points requiring little or no preliminary data, are critical
to ensuring innovative scientists from diverse backgrounds succeed
in biomedical research. Therefore, the Committee is concerned that
NIH terminated a number of longstanding research training and
career development programs that play a vital role in building the
next generation of the biomedical research workforce. These pro-
grams provide critical funding for graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars, and the termination of these programs has
caused an immediate and harmful impact on the ability of aca-
demic medicine to attract and retain the best and brightest sci-
entists. To maintain these programs, the Committee provides not
less than $13,100,000 to continue the Maximizing Access to Re-
search Careers [MARC] program; not less than $18,800,000 to con-
tinue the Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program; not less
than $21,300,000 to continue the Undergraduate Research Train-
ing Initiative for Student Enhancement program; not less than
$6,400,000 for the Bridges to Doctorate program; not less than
$15,500,000 for the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development
program; and not less than $20,800,000 for the Institutional Re-
search and Academic Career Development Award to train the next
generation of scientists while enhancing the diversity of the bio-
medical research workforce and enabling promising scientists to
pursue high-risk, high-reward research. Finally, within 90 days of
enactment, the Committee directs NIH to provide a report and
briefing to the Committees on Appropriations on the training and
career development programs that have been terminated since De-
cember 2024, and a justification for the termination of each pro-
gram. Such report shall include the amount NIH spent on each
program in fiscal year 2024, and a comprehensive list of awards as-
sociated with each program, including the grant number, institu-
tion and the total cost of each award.
Minority Serving Institutions.—Congress recognizes the impor-
tance of highly trained physician-scientists to serve diverse commu-

130
nities, decrease health disparities, and enhance the biomedical re-
search workforce. The Committee encourages NIGMS to support
medical scientist training at Minority Serving Institutions as de-
fined in title III of the Higher Education Act. Such efforts should
support dual degree programs that train students in medicine and
biomedical research.
Supporting Biomolecular NMR Databanks.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the essential role that existing, extramural Nuclear Mag-
netic Resonance [NMR] databases located at public academic
health centers play in fostering medical research and drug dis-
covery. As such, the Committee encourages NIGMS to ensure that
grants which support these valuable scientific community assets
are of sufficient size to ensure that they can continue to add and
curate new data, modernize, and support all researchers.
EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH
AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,759,078,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,779,078,000
The Committee provides $1,779,078,000, an increase of
$20,000,000, for the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development [NICHD].
Andrological Health.—The Committee strongly supports
translational and clinical research into andrological health, and
urges NICHD to prioritize and expand these research programs.
Endometriosis.—The Committee urges NICHD to continue ex-
panding basic, clinical, and translational research into the mecha-
nisms of endometriosis, including root causes of the disease and
new treatment methods. The Committee encourages research on
the genetic and immune system components of endometriosis. The
Committee further encourages NIH to devote more resources to
support targeted research of endocrine disrupting chemicals in
endometriosis, the relationship of endometriosis and cancer, pre-
natal and epigenetic influences on the risk for endometriosis. The
Committee also encourages research on non-invasive diagnostics of
endometriosis to reduce diagnosis delay and improve treatment.
The Committee encourages research on the growth of endometriosis
and endometriosis recurrence post-surgical procedures or medical
therapeutics. Additionally, NIH is encouraged to use an updated,
evidence-based definition of the disease, aligning with current sci-
entific understanding that characterizes it as a chronic, systemic,
and inflammatory condition. This aims to ensure the development
of effective diagnostics and treatments reflect endometriosis’ full
clinical reality (i.e., not solely a reproductive condition) as it can af-
fect every major organ in the body.
Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision
for Everyone [IMPROVE] Initiative.—The Committee provides no
less than $73,400,000 for this activity, an increase of $20,000,000.
The Committee is aware that NICHD’s current Maternal Health
Research Centers of Excellence provide a platform to further both
research and clinical care in reducing maternal morbidity and mor-
tality. The Committee appreciates NIH’s commitment to supporting
Centers in areas of the country that see the highest rate of both.
The Committee encourages NICHD to continue to expand its cur-

131
rent Centers of Excellence with a particular emphasis on increas-
ing support for existing centers and establishing new ones in re-
gions of greatest need, eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in
maternal morbidity, and training a diverse group of early-stage sci-
entists in maternal health equity research.
Infertility.—The Committee remains concerned about the rate of
infertility suffered by couples trying to conceive. In the United
States, 11 percent of women of reproductive age have difficulty get-
ting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. The Committee
urges NICHD to continue to research infertility, specifically
adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and polycystic ovary
syndrome. This research could include diagnostic testing, causes of
the conditions, and treatment options, especially non-pharma-
cological intervention. Since there is a gap in the knowledge of how
to diagnose and treat male infertility, the Committee also urges
NICHD to continue to support research on male mechanisms of in-
fertility.
Maternal Morbidity and Mortality.—The Committee is concerned
about recent closures of obstetrics and gynecology units in rural
hospitals across the country and their impact on patient access to
care. The Committee encourages NICHD to support research on
this issue, including examining how these closures are affecting
maternal morbidity and mortality.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Research.—The Committee urges
NICHD to continue expanding basic, clinical, and translational re-
search into the mechanisms of polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS],
including the cause of the condition, such as metabolic dysfunction,
and treatment methods, especially addressing hormonal imbalance,
insulin resistance, nutritional and lifestyle modifications, and sur-
gical procedures.
Population Research.—The Committee commends NICHD for
supporting prospective, population representative longitudinal
studies, including the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child De-
velopment Supplement, Future of Families and Child Wellbeing
Study, and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Data from
these studies are public goods used widely to inform research and
training activities conducted by thousands of scientists at univer-
sities nationwide, including underserved institutions, and are heav-
ily used by new and early-stage investigators. In addition, these
studies are the only nationally representative data scientists may
use to analyze, for example, how parental and grandparental char-
acteristics affect children’s outcomes and the impact of adverse
childhood experiences over the life course. NICHD is encouraged to
continue supporting this type of research.
Safe to Sleep Campaign.—The Committee is concerned that in
April 2025 NIH cancelled Federal participation in Safe to Sleep, a
30-year campaign to prevent infants from dying in their sleep.
Thanks to increased awareness and access to evidence-based risk
reduction strategies for parents and caregivers, Safe to Sleep dra-
matically reduced the number of Sudden Infant Death [SIDs]
cases—cutting them nearly in half between 1994 and 2009. NICHD
expanded the campaign in 2012 to bring an awareness to other
non-SIDs sleep-related infant deaths like accidental suffocation and
strangulation in bed, which fall under a broader umbrella of unex-

132
pected infant deaths known as Sudden Unexpected Infant Death
[SUID]. According to the most recent data available, sudden infant
death rates increased nearly 12 percent between 2020 and 2022, or
more than 300 babies dying every month. The elimination of
NICHD’s support for Safe to Sleep would lead to even more pre-
ventable infant deaths. Therefore, the Committee directs NICHD to
re-establish the Safe to Sleep Campaign and provides $1,300,000,
the same amount as fiscal year 2024, to ensure the health and
safety of all American infants.
Severe Maternal Morbidity.—The Committee is concerned that
despite the high rate of severe maternal morbidity in the United
States, there is not a uniform definition of severe maternal mor-
bidity. Having a uniform definition would help Federal, State and
local agencies and research institutions establish standardized and
interoperable processes for billing surveillance, data collection and
research. The collected data could then inform the development
and deployment of targeted, evidence-based prevention and treat-
ment programs to reduce the incidence of severe maternal mor-
bidity. The Committee encourages NICHD to hold a formal con-
vening of subject matter experts and organizational representa-
tives, including representatives from the CDC, HRSA, NICHD, the
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Tech-
nology, FDA, and public stakeholders, to determine a uniform defi-
nition of severe maternal morbidity. The Committee directs NICHD
to provide a report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the proceedings
of convening including formal definitions for severe maternal mor-
bidity.
Women’s Reproductive Health Research [WRHR] Program and
Research Scientist Development Program [RSDP].—The Committee
encourages NICHD to continue to fund WRHR and RSDP scholars,
with the goal of increasing the diversity of the scholars, sites, and
research supported by the programs. The Committee recognizes the
effectiveness of these programs, which provides an opportunity for
obstetrician/gynecologists who recently completed postgraduate
clinical training to further their training in basic, translational and
clinical research. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update
on these programs in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Uterine Fibroid Research.—The Committee urges NICHD to con-
tinue expanding basic, clinical, and translational research into the
mechanisms of uterine fibroids, including the cause of uterine
fibroids, especially the relation to hormone imbalance and high es-
trogen levels, and new treatment methods, including surgical pro-
cedures. The Committee further encourages research on the impact
of uterine fibroids on abnormal bleeding, anemia, fertility, and re-
current miscarriage. The Committee encourages research on the
prevalence of uterine fibroids in minority populations.
NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $896,549,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 896,549,000
The Committee recommendation includes $896,549,000 for the
National Eye Institute [NEI].
Usher Syndrome.—The Committee encourages NIH to enhance
and prioritize Usher syndrome research at NEI. The Committee re-

133
quests an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ. The update should in-
clude efforts to stimulate the field and to accelerate viable human
treatment options for those with Usher syndrome.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $913,979,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 913,979,000
The Committee recommendation includes $913,979,000 for the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS].
Environmental-Related Health Conditions.—The Committee pro-
vides $40,000,000 for NIEHS to continue research on the impacts
that changing environmental conditions have on human health.
Improving Understanding Environmental Triggers of Inflam-
matory Bowel Disease [IBD].—The Committee is aware of research
indicating linkages between environmental factors such as heavy
and transition metals, air pollutants, food emulsifiers, and pes-
ticides are associated with an increased risk of IBD and the need
to address gaps in this area. The Committee directs NIEHS to col-
laborate with NIH ICs, such as NIDDK and the Office of Nutrition
Research to develop a research strategy to address these gaps, in-
cluding better understanding the impact of environmental factors,
more precise assessments to measure the effects of exposures, and
understanding the overall impact of any such factors and ways to
intervene to address them. The Committee also directs NIH to as-
sess possible ways to incorporate immune-mediated digestive dis-
eases and nutrition into existing programs.
Indoor Air.—The Committee urges NIEHS to continue research-
ing indoor pollutants, including from combustion indoors, to better
understand the indoor air landscape and its impacts. The Com-
mittee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Microplastics and Human Health.—The Committee recommends
that NIH review primary chemicals in the life cycle analysis of
plastic materials that are negatively impacting the environment
and human health. The Committee urges NIH to research the pres-
ence of microplastics and nanoplastics in the human body, includ-
ing in organs and biospecimens and how such presence impacts
human health.
PFAS Mitigation.—The Committee recognizes that contaminated
water poses a significant public health risk, with the potential to
cause a range of adverse health outcomes, including gastro-
intestinal illness, neurological conditions, reproductive issues,
chronic diseases, and the transmission of infectious diseases. Given
the severe and far-reaching impacts on human health, the Com-
mittee continues to appropriate funding to support and coordinate
comprehensive health-focused research efforts to evaluate the di-
rect and indirect impacts of contaminated water on public health.
Wildfire Smoke.—The Committee recognizes that exposure to
smoke from wildfires is no longer a rare occurrence and is a reality
for millions of Americans. The Committee is concerned that public
health experts do not yet fully understand the risk posed by expo-
sure to wildland fire smoke-particularly acute and chronic smoke
exposure to patients with existing pulmonary and cardiac disease.
The Committee encourages NIEHS to support research to under-

134
stand the health risks associated with wildfire smoke exposure and
any interventions that can be implemented to mitigate adverse
health effects.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,507,623,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,557,623,000
The Committee recommendation includes $4,557,623,000, for the
National Institute on Aging [NIA]. This amount includes an in-
crease of $50,000,000 for NIA’s AD/ADRD research.
Alzheimer’s Disease/Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias [AD/
ADRD].—Since fiscal year 2015, Congress has increased research
funding for AD/ADRD by more than 500 percent, making it the
largest expenditure of its kind in NIH. By 2050, the cost to treat
and care for those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease is expected to
rise to as high as $1,100,000,000,000 a year. Without a medical
breakthrough to prevent, slow, or stop the disease, Medicare- and
Medicaid-related costs could rise more than four-fold. NIH-funded
research offers hope for finding solutions to manage this disease
successfully in the future. Therefore, the Committee continues to
support Alzheimer’s disease research, including multi-disciplinary
approaches into the basic science and pathology of the disease,
which builds upon the funding goals needed to prevent and effec-
tively treat Alzheimer’s by 2025 identified in the National Plan re-
quired by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (Public Law 111–
375). The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000 across
NIH for AD/ADRD research, including an increase of $50,000,000
in NINDS and $50,000,000 in NIA. The NIA is encouraged to con-
tinue addressing the research targets outlined in the fiscal year
2026 Professional Judgment Budget. In addition, NIA is directed to
provide an update on activities related to this research in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ.
Alzheimer’s Disease and Metabolic Function.—The Committee en-
courages NIH to investigate the fundamental link between meta-
bolic function and AD/ADRDs, as well as the study of the preven-
tion, treatment, and reversal of AD/ADRDs, including Parkinson’s
disease, through metabolic therapies. The Committee urges the
NIH to expand research into metabolic interventions for AD/
ADRDs. This includes support for large-scale clinical trials aimed
at identifying predictive neurobiological and metabolic biomarkers,
optimizing patient stratification, and developing best practice clin-
ical guidelines. Research may employ multi-disciplinary approaches
into the basic science and pathology of the diseases, including
neuroimaging, genetics, and cellular biology, to advance under-
standing of the underlying mechanisms of disease and inform per-
sonalized, metabolism-based treatment and prevention strategies.
Alzheimer’s Risk Reduction.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to prioritize scientifically-based early interventions for
ADRDs, and to identify and implement a comprehensive set of ac-
tions to assess risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Such
an assessment should include a focus on populations and commu-
nities at highest risk and with the greatest prevalence. Actions
should include: conducting health risk assessments; identifying op-
portunities to address known risk factors; examining incentives to

135
promote brain health; providing payments for prevention and care
delivery models that incorporate brain health as part of care and
treatment of other conditions; and examining the development and
implementation of quality measures specifically related to brain
health.
Palliative Care Research.—The Committee provides continued
funding for NIA to coordinate the work of a multi-institute and
multi-Center initiative for palliative care research, including extra-
mural-based research infrastructure, by developing early and mid-
stage researchers, and engaging various healthcare systems, pro-
viders, and community partners. The Committee recognizes that
palliative care is a critical area of research and informs supportive
care for patients of all ages with serious illness and their families
focused on relief of symptoms and suffering, communication of
prognosis and treatment options in the context of patient goals,
and coordination of care within and across healthcare settings. The
Committee commends NIA for spearheading the release of a fund-
ing opportunity to support a national Consortium for Palliative
Care Research Across the Lifespan in February 2024. This Consor-
tium will provide resources, expertise, and coordination to advance
innovative, high-quality palliative care research across the lifespan
and across a range of serious illnesses, including dementia. The
Consortium will also emphasize scientific workforce development in
palliative care, in addition to clarifying and addressing differences
in quality and use of palliative care services across populations.
NIA is directed to update the Committee monthly on this effort
until awards are made. Finally, NIA is directed to notify the Com-
mittee at least 10 days in advance of the release of a Notice of
Award for the Consortium for Palliative Care Research Across the
Lifespan.
Population Research.—The Committee commends NIA for sup-
porting a robust population aging research portfolio that includes
research grants, centers, networks, training programs, and popu-
lation representative longitudinal surveys, including the Health
and Retirement Study and National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent to Adult Health, studying how demographic, social, environ-
mental, behavioral, psychological, and economic factors impact
health and well-being over the life course. In fiscal year 2025, the
Committee is pleased to learn that NIA plans to renew funding for
its Centers on Demography and Economics of Aging program. The
current 15 centers provide essential infrastructure and data, stimu-
lating aging research and training activities on topics such as phys-
ical and cognitive functioning, disability, health disparities, and
Alzheimer’s disease, nationwide. The Committee urges NIA to con-
tinue to encourage collaboration among its centers, as it currently
does via the Research Centers Collaborative Network [RCCN].
RCCN aligns approaches between NIA Center programs, including
the Centers on Demography and Economics of Aging, Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Centers, and Roybal Centers for Translational
Research in the Behavioral and Social Sciences of Aging.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN
DISEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $685,465,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 685,465,000
The Committee recommendation includes $685,465,000 for the
National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Dis-
eases [NIAMS].
Atopic Dermatitis.—The Committee recognizes NIAMS ongoing
efforts to incorporate community feedback and otherwise craft a
new Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2025–2029. The Committee
notes the tremendous opportunity for cross-NIH multidisciplinary
research into atopic dermatitis and other forms of eczema and en-
courages further efforts to coordinate with other institutes and cen-
ters to complement emerging NIAMS activities and to effectively
coordinate the overall research portfolio in atopic dermatitis.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION
DISORDERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $534,333,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 534,333,000
The Committee recommendation includes $534,333,000 for the
National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
[NIDCD].
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $197,693,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 197,693,000
The Committee recommendation includes $197,693,000 for the
National Institute of Nursing Research [NINR]. Funding for NINR
is crucial for the advancement of nursing science, addressing the
nation’s critical health issues. Funding nursing research offers an
excellent return on investment, advancing the health of individuals
and communities while ensuring high-quality, cost-effective care
across lifespan.
Health Disparities Research.—The Committee continues to pro-
vide $10,000,000 for NINR to support research related to identi-
fying and reducing health disparities.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $595,318,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 595,318,000
The Committee recommendation includes $595,318,000 for the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA].
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders [FASD].—The Committee sup-
ports NIAAA efforts to accelerate FASD basic, prevention, diag-
nosis, and treatment research. The Committee encourages NIAAA
to continue efforts to support innovative research and to dissemi-
nate research findings to States, Tribes, and provider and non-prof-
it organizations in increasing FASD diagnostic capacity, enhancing
FASD prevention programs, developing resources for systems of
care, training services providers and professionals, and responding
to the needs of individuals. In addition, the Committee encourages

137
NIAAA to restore the FASD Center of Excellence to translate and
disseminate research to States, Tribes, and existing FASD affiliates
for the purpose of increasing diagnostic capacity, developing re-
sources for systems of care, training service providers and profes-
sionals, maintaining a clearinghouse and data-based directory, and
responding to the needs of individuals.
Reducing Alcohol Related Mortality.—The Committee is con-
cerned by the high rates of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related mor-
bidity and mortality in the United States. The Committee urges
NIAAA to continue supporting research on prevention programs
that focus on populations most affected by alcohol misuse and alco-
hol-related mortality. This research can include the development,
testing, and implementation of prevention interventions to reduce
alcohol misuse.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,662,695,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,662,695,000
The Committee recommendation includes $1,662,695,000 for the
National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA].
Alternative Clinical Trial Endpoints for Substance Use Dis-
orders.—Although there are effective medications for treating
opioid, tobacco, and alcohol use disorders, these treatments do not
work for everyone-and to date, no medications have been approved
by FDA to treat stimulant use disorders. The Committee therefore
encourages FDA and NIDA to collaborate on the establishment of
endpoints other than abstinence for use in clinical trials of medica-
tions to treat substance use disorders. Such alternative endpoints
may include reduced craving (defined as a strong desire or urge to
use drugs), reduced drug use, or reduced substance use disorder se-
verity. The Committee appreciates NIDA-funded research on using
alternative endpoints in clinical research on substance use dis-
orders, such as the recent finding that reduced drug use is associ-
ated with meaningful clinical improvements for people with stimu-
lant use disorders. The Committee urges FDA and NIDA to build
upon such research and work together toward incorporating alter-
native endpoints into clinical trials for substance use disorders.
Barriers to Research.—The Committee is concerned that restric-
tions associated with Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act
effectively limits the amount and type of research that can be con-
ducted on certain Schedule I drugs, especially opioids, psychedelics,
marijuana or its component chemicals, and new synthetic drugs
and analogs. At a time when we need as much information as pos-
sible about these drugs and antidotes for their harmful effects, we
should be addressing regulatory and other barriers to conducting
this research. The Committee appreciates NIDA’s completion of a
report on the barriers to research that result from the classification
of drugs and compounds as Schedule I substances including the
challenges researchers face as a result of limited access to sources
of marijuana, including dispensary products.
Cocaine Overdose Treatment.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the ‘‘fourth wave’’ of the drug addiction public health
crisis and the surge in overdose deaths involving stimulants, in-
cluding cocaine. The Committee recognizes that NIDA is

138
prioritizing research and development of treatments which can rap-
idly reverse cocaine toxicity and reduce mortality rates, addressing
the severe gap in this unmet medical need. Due to the unavail-
ability of an FDA-approved cocaine overdose reversal medication,
the Committee encourages NIDA to continue prioritization of addi-
tional research and development to advance a life-saving treatment
for overdoses caused by cocaine.
HEAL Initiative.—The Committee continues to be extremely con-
cerned about the epidemic of prescription opioids, heroin, and illicit
synthetic opioid use, addiction, and opioid overdose in the United
States and appreciates the important role that research plays in
the various Federal initiatives aimed at this crisis. The Committee
is also aware of the elevated number of opioid overdose deaths,
with the primary driver of these deaths involving synthetic opioids,
primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Approximately 220 people
die each day in this country from drug overdose (over 149 of those
involved opioids), making it one of the most common causes of non-
disease-related deaths for adolescents and young adults. To combat
this crisis, the Committee has provided within NIDA’s budget no
less than $365,295,000, for the Institute’s share of the HEAL Ini-
tiative and in response to elevated rates of stimulant use and drug
overdose involving stimulants. The Committee encourages NIDA to
continue research on the development of safe and effective medica-
tions and new formulations and combinations to treat substance
use disorders and prevent or reverse overdose, and to continue re-
search on comprehensive care models in communities nationwide to
prevent and treat opioid misuse and opioid use disorder, expanding
treatment capacity, enhancing access to overdose reversal medica-
tions for opioid use disorder, and improving addiction care; testing
interventions in justice system settings to expand the uptake of
medication treatment and methods to scale up these interventions;
and developing evidence-based strategies to integrate screening
and treatment for opioid use disorders in emergency department
and primary care settings. The Committee has included language
expanding the allowable use of these funds to include research re-
lated to stimulant use and addiction.
Investments in Basic Research.—The Committee is aware that
basic research is the foundation for clinical research, both of which
pave the way to new or improved treatments for substance use dis-
orders. Basic research can focus on the causal mechanisms under-
lying the functioning of the human body and provides a critical un-
derstanding of the short- and long-term impacts of drug use. The
discoveries that are made through basic research can often be
translated into improved patient care, including novel medications,
fewer drug-related fatalities, and science-based methods for pre-
venting substance use and substance use disorders. The Committee
encourages NIDA’s continued investments in investigator-initiated
grants in basic research and support for training of young inves-
tigators to ensure a healthy and growing population of researchers.
Methamphetamine and Other Stimulants.—The Committee is
concerned that, according to predicted provisional data released by
CDC, overdose deaths involving drugs in the categories that in-
clude methamphetamine and cocaine increased by 38 and 43 per-
cent respectively, in just 2 years. This sharp increase has led some

139
to refer to stimulant overdoses as the ‘‘fourth wave’’ of the current
drug overdose epidemic in America following the rise of opioid-re-
lated deaths involving prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl-re-
lated substances. No FDA-approved medications are available for
treating methamphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulant use dis-
orders. While there are currently approved medication treatments
for alcohol and opioid addiction, there remains no approved medica-
tion for methamphetamine addiction. The Committee urges NIDA
to continue its ongoing trials in order to expeditiously find and ap-
prove a medication for methamphetamines. The Committee con-
tinues to support NIDA’s efforts to address the opioid crisis, has
provided continued funding for the HEAL Initiative, and supports
NIDA’s efforts to combat the growing problem of methamphet-
amine and other stimulant use disorders and related deaths.
Overdose Reversal Drugs.—Recognizing the increasing severity of
the National opioid crisis and the need to better our options for re-
sponding to, treating, and preventing overdoses, the Committee en-
courages NIDA to prioritize research to expedite treatments for and
prevention of overdose from fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and other
emerging substances.
Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in
Drug Use and Addiction Prevention and Treatment.—Education is
a critical component of any effort to curb drug use and addiction,
and it must target every segment of society, including healthcare
providers (doctors, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists), patients,
and families. Medical professionals must be in the forefront of ef-
forts to curb the opioid crisis. The Committee continues to be
pleased with the NIDAMED initiative, targeting physicians-in-
training, including medical students and resident physicians in pri-
mary care specialties (e.g., internal medicine, family practice, emer-
gency medicine, and pediatrics). The Committee encourages NIDA
to continue to provide clinical resources to providers to help iden-
tify and treat patients with substance use disorder.
Safe Prescribing.—The Committee encourages NIDA to continue
to expand efforts to research and educate physicians and other
medical professionals about safe prescribing practices for pain and
managing patients who abuse prescription opioids, as well as best
practices for incorporating substance misuse and addiction screen-
ing and treatment into their clinical practices.
Youth E–Cigarette Use.—The Committee is aware of alarming
trends in youth electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) use and recent
survey data from CDC indicating that more than 10 percent of high
school students and 4.6 percent of middle school students reported
using e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days in 2023. The Committee
understands that e-cigarettes and other vaporizing equipment re-
main popular among adolescents, and requests that NIDA continue
to fund research on the use and consequences of using these de-
vices. The Committee is pleased that NIDA continues to support
the Monitoring the Future survey and the Population Assessment
of Tobacco and Health Study, which provide timely data on tobacco
products and other drug use. Finally, with more than 4 million
young people using e-cigarettes, there is a greater need for re-
search into therapeutic options for nicotine cessation among youth
who have developed addiction to nicotine. The Committee encour-

140
ages NIDA to continue supporting research to develop therapies,
including both pharmacologic and behavioral therapies, to combat
nicotine addiction in pediatric populations.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,187,843,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,193,843,000
The Committee recommendation includes $2,193,843,000 for the
National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH]. This amount includes
$70,028,000, an increase of $6,000,000 for the BRAIN Initiative.
Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD].—The Committee encourages
NIH to support greater investment in research on autism, particu-
larly in areas outlined in the Interagency Autism Coordinating
Committee’s [IACC] Strategic Plan for ASD, and directs NIH to en-
sure that all research activities for autism follow widely-accepted
scientific practices in order to ensure research integrity. The Com-
mittee encourages NIH to support greater investment in research,
particularly in areas outlined in the IACC Strategic Plan for ASD,
and directs NIH to ensure that all research activities for autism
follow widely-accepted scientific practices in order to ensure re-
search integrity. In addition, the Autism CARES Act of 2024 (Pub-
lic Law 118–80) included several new directives that the NIH is di-
rected to implement. These include releasing an annual budget es-
timate for autism research for fiscal year 2026 based on the IACC
Strategic Plan, ensuring research efforts reflect the entire popu-
lation of individuals with ASD, and creating a new process for the
public to obtain information on all existing and planned autism re-
search activities as well as allowing the public to provide com-
ments. Pursuant to the Autism CARES Act of 2024, the Committee
also directs the prompt re-establishment of the IACC and that
among the non-public members, directs that the Secretary appoints
experienced, leading licensed and board-certified researchers in the
field of ASD.
Mental Health Research.—In recognition of the country’s unprec-
edented mental health crisis, the Committee supports funding for
mental health research. This funding is provided to support re-
search focused on developing targeted prevention of and treatment
for mental illness. The Committee urges NIMH to accelerate better
diagnostics, improved therapeutics and behavioral treatments, and
enhanced precision of mental healthcare; continue to develop a new
Precision Psychiatry Initiative; and support studies of social me-
dia’s impact on mental health. The Committee supports NIMH ef-
forts to launch a new depression biomarker development effort to
guide treatment decisions for major depression and identify re-
search gaps and opportunities for understanding relationships
among social media behavior, social media engagement, and youth
mental health. These initiatives will combine innovative physio-
logical and behavioral methods to better predict patient prognosis
and optimize treatment. In addition, the Committee continues to be
concerned about the effects of the COVID–19 pandemic on mental
and behavioral health and encourages NIMH to support research
into the impacts of the pandemic on mental health.
Peer Support for Youth.—The Committee understands that many
youth who are struggling with their mental health seek out peer

141
support services, often because they are not ready to engage or do
not have access to clinical healthcare. But while numerous studies
have shown that peer support increases help-seeking behavior and
reduces social isolation in adults, research on youth peer support
services and peer-to-peer counseling programs is limited. Therefore,
the Committee encourages NIMH to prioritize research in these
areas, including how to scale up such services and programs effec-
tively. In addition, the Committee encourages NIMH to continue to
regularly hear from young people to inform its future research pri-
orities through its Advisory Council, strategic planning process,
focus groups or similar leadership methods. The Committee sup-
ports the agency’s existing youth-informed activities and encour-
ages additional efforts to grow youth engagement in setting its re-
search priorities and carrying out participatory research.
Serious Mental Illness.—The Committee encourages NIMH to ex-
pand research into metabolic interventions for serious mental ill-
nesses, including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and
schizophrenia. The Committee encourages NIMH to investigate the
fundamental link between metabolic function and psychiatric ill-
ness, as well as the study of the prevention, treatment, and rever-
sal of serious mental illness through metabolic therapies. This in-
cludes support for large-scale clinical trials investigating nutri-
tional ketosis, with a focus on identifying predictive neurobiological
and metabolic biomarkers, optimizing patient stratification, and de-
veloping best practice clinical guidelines. Research should encom-
pass multimodal data collection, including neuroimaging, genetics,
and cellular biology, with an emphasis on translational science that
informs personalized treatment and advances understanding of un-
derlying disease mechanisms.
Suicide Prevention.—The Committee recognizes that suicide a
complex, and serious public health problem with multiple contrib-
uting factors, including biological, psychological, social, and envi-
ronmental. The Committee encourages NIMH to direct additional
attention to suicide prevention research across all of these areas,
as well as the application of novel measurement techniques, statis-
tical analysis, digital initiatives and information systems. The
Committee also encourages NIMH to promote greater collaboration
with other NIH Institutes and Centers with expertise in research
areas that can contribute to suicide prevention, especially NIA,
NICHD, NHGRI, NIAAA and NIDA. The Committee requests an
update on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.

Biomedical Technology Development.—The Committee is pleased
with the success of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tech pro-
gram in accelerating the innovation and commercialization of
COVID–19 diagnostic technologies. The Committee appreciates
NIBIB’s efforts to expand the innovation funnel model beyond
COVID–19 testing to address other critical unmet needs in diag-
nostic testing and other biomedical technologies and encourages
NIBIB to continue these efforts in fiscal year 2026 in consultation
with other institutes and centers, including but not limited to
NHLBI, NIAID, NICHD, NIA, NINDS, and NIMH. The Committee
further directs NIBIB to provide an update in the fiscal year 2027
CJ on progress of these efforts.
NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $170,384,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 170,384,000
The Committee recommendation includes $170,384,000 for the
National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
[NCCIH].
Pain Management.—The Committee includes $5,000,000 to sup-
port research into non-pharmacological treatments for pain man-
agement and urges NCCIH, along with DOD and VA, to continue
to support research, including comorbidities such as opioid misuse,
abuse, and disorder among military personnel, veterans, and their
families. The Committee urges NIH, VA, and DOD to expand re-
search on non-pharmacological treatments for veterans and service
members.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $534,395,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 534,395,000
The Committee recommendation includes $534,395,000 for the
National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities
[NIMHD].
Improving Native American Cancer Outcomes.—The Committee
notes that Native Americans experience overall cancer incidence
and mortality rates that are strikingly higher than non-Native pop-
ulations. The Committee includes $6,000,000, for the Initiative for
Improving Native American Cancer Outcomes to support efforts in-
cluding research, education, outreach, and clinical access related to
cancer in Native American populations. The Committee further di-
rects NIMHD to work with NCI to locate this Initiative at an NCI-
designated cancer center demonstrating partnerships with Indian
Tribes, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations to im-
prove the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancers among
Native Americans, particularly those living in rural communities.
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Health Research Office.—The
Committee recognizes the Federal trust responsibility to Native
Hawaiians and the unique health challenges facing the Native Ha-
waiian and Pacific Islander community. The Committee also ac-

143
knowledges that there is limited health research on this commu-
nity, relative to other populations, particularly that disaggregates
between different subpopulations. The Committee includes
$4,000,000, for the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Health Re-
search Office. The Committee encourages collaboration across Insti-
tutes and with the community, including research institutions with
expertise and researcher representation from the NHPI commu-
nity.
Research Centers at Minority Institutions [RCMI] Program.—The
Committee recognizes the longstanding contributions of the RCMI
program in improving the health of all Americans, originally estab-
lished in 1985 by this subcommittee, and as directed in 42 U.S.C.
241 and 284, amended by 42 U.S.C. 201. The RCMI program
strengthens research capacity and infrastructure at minority-serv-
ing institutions, identifies differential outcomes for minority popu-
lations, and provides training and mentoring. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs NIH to maintain funding for RCMI grantees, par-
ticularly institutions serving rural, underserved, and geographi-
cally isolated populations. The Committee encourages NIMHD to
adjust the RCMI annual per-institution NIH funding threshold for
inflation. The Committee directs NIMHD to submit a report within
90 days of enactment regarding the implementation of this ad-
justed eligibility criterion for RCMI, its impact on the pool of eligi-
ble institutions, and how this criterion is applied to eligibility for
other NIMHD programs.
Research Endowment Program.—The Committee is pleased with
NIMHD’s reinvigoration of the Research Endowment Program and
recent investments in the program. The Committee urges NIMHD
to increase funding available to existing grantees and continue to
expand and assist eligible institutions receiving grants with this
additional funding through a competitive process.
JOHN E. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCED STUDY IN
THE HEALTH SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $95,162,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 95,162,000
The Committee provides $95,162,000 for the Fogarty Inter-
national Center [FIC].
Fogarty International Center [FIC].—The Committee recognizes
the need to support resources for FIC for its work in strengthening
health research systems, training infectious disease researchers,
and improving pandemic preparedness in low- and middle-income
countries [LMICs]. FIC supports cross-cutting research and re-
search training programs that apply to a broad range of health
threats, enabling grantees and trainees to anticipate and respond
effectively to new global challenges. Programs within FIC support
training for researchers in the development and use of powerful
tools such as data science, mobile health, and bioinformatics, which
are applied to anticipating and controlling a wide range of global
health threats that could impact the United States. The Committee
encourages FIC to continue to expand training and research part-
nerships with schools and programs of public health and related
academic institutions in support of this core mission. In addition,
the Committee supports expanding FIC’s role in pandemic pre-

144
paredness and research capacity building, including by strength-
ening international coordination, increasing capacity for computa-
tional modeling and outbreak analytics, and supporting research to
reduce health disparities and improve implementation of health
interventions in low-resource settings.
Global Infectious Disease Research Training Program.—The
Committee recognizes that building a critical mass of researchers
in developing countries is essential to controlling infectious dis-
eases. Such researchers are key to generating new strategies for
disease prevention and treatment. Therefore, the Committee urges
FIC to prioritize funding for the Global Infectious Disease Research
Training Program.
NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $497,548,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 497,548,000
The Committee provides $497,548,000 for the National Library of
Medicine [NLM].
Data Initiative.—The Committee supports the transformation of
NLM from its traditional role as a repository of data and research
results to one where it serves as an active hub coordinating the use
of ever-expanding data resources and facilitates researcher access
to advanced analytics, including artificial intelligence and machine
learning techniques. The Committee encourages NLM to expand
the data storage capabilities and datasets necessary to establish a
federated biomedical research data sharing infrastructure that fea-
tures a centralized catalog of data holdings and use models to ad-
vance information science, analytics, and data science, and support
the application of artificial intelligence in biomedical research.
NLM is directed to provide an update on these efforts within 120
days of enactment.
Epitranscriptomics Database Standards.—The Committee recog-
nizes the recent release of the National Academies of Sciences, En-
gineering, and Medicine [NASEM] report ‘‘Charting a Future for
Sequencing RNA and Its Modifications’’ in March 2024. The Com-
mittee notes the report’s recommendation that clear and consistent
standards for data and databases need to be established to facili-
tate data access and sharing. Given that NLM’s National Center
for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] collaborates with the sci-
entific community to support development of standards for data-
bases and biological nomenclature, among other responsibilities,
the Committee urges NCBI to support the establishment of data
and database standards for epitranscriptomics in collaboration with
the scientific community consistent with the NASEM report rec-
ommendation, and include an update on this effort in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ.
NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $928,323,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 938,323,000
The Committee provides $938,323,000, an increase of
$10,000,000, for the National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences [NCATS].

145
Clinical and Translational Science Awards [CTSA] Program.—
The Committee provides $629,560,000 for the CTSA program, the
same as the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Well-resourced and fully
supported U-awards form the backbone of the CTSA program and
any ongoing changes to grants and awards mechanism for CTSAs
should maintain this focus to ensure hubs continue to have flexi-
bility and stability, as well as thrive and provide an effective core
that drives this critical national network forward, including devel-
oping localized partnerships, and effectively training the next gen-
eration of researchers while enhancing research capacity. The Com-
mittee reiterates that NCATS should continue to support at least
60 sites and that any hub that successfully recompetes for funding
should continue to receive at least 95 percent of its previous level
of support, if such an amount is requested. U-awards should con-
tinue to form the primary base of support so that hubs have flexi-
bility and stability, can continue to develop localized partnerships,
and can effectively train the next generation of researchers while
enhancing research capacity. While the Committee recognizes op-
tional funding opportunities which were previously incorporated
into the prior single application offer a higher level of institutional
funding support, NCATS must ensure these opportunities do not
diffuse the focus of CTSAs and create challenges to ongoing na-
tional collaborative. The Committee also notes the work of the
IDeA Clinical and Translational Research centers and urges in-
creased collaboration between these programs.
Collaboration with Business Incubators.—The Committee com-
mends NCATS for working with grantees to leverage its mission by
including nonprofit business incubators that host small to mid-size
life science, research, and biotechnology companies that use serv-
ice-based approaches to nurture and guide their member companies
to success. The Committee urges NCATS to continue proactive out-
reach to redouble its efforts to leverage its mission by exploring op-
portunities or potential collaborations with business incubators
that host small to midsize science, research and pharmaceutical
companies that use service-based approaches to nurture and guide
their member companies to success. The Committee encourages
NCATS to continue to use Administrative Supplements to existing
CTSA contracts to fulfill this objective.
Community-led Health Research/Community partnerships or
ComPASS program.—The Committee applauds NIH for its efforts
to directly fund community organizations to create and test inter-
ventions in partnership with academic researchers who codesign
interventions to improve people’s health, well-being, and quality of
life. The Committee is concerned about the abrupt termination of
this program and encourages the NIH director to reevaluate and
reinvest in the ComPASS and other similar initiatives.
Cures Acceleration Network [CAN].—The Committee continues to
provide $75,000,000 for the CAN to reduce barriers between re-
search discovery and clinical trials.
Full Spectrum of Medical Research.—The Committee applauds
NIH efforts to support and advance the full spectrum of medical re-
search, which ensures breakthroughs in basic science are trans-
lated into therapies and diagnostic tools that benefit patient care
while disseminating cutting-edge information to the professional

146
community. The Committee notes the importance of flagship initia-
tives, including the CTSA program, to these important efforts.
National Clinical Cohort Collaborative [N3C].—The Committee
continues to support N3C’s open-science, privacy-preserving data-
sharing platform to accelerate biomedical research and discovery.
Supported by the CTSA Program, N3C links de-identified electronic
health record data with other types of data such as imaging, mor-
tality, and Medicare and Medicaid data from CMS to answer key
research questions on a variety of diseases, with two diseases being
piloted. The Committee supports the continuation of N3C and en-
courages NCATS to continue coordinating with other HHS agencies
to make N3C available as an underlying common real-world data
platform to drive faster discovery across a range of diseases and
maximize the Federal research investment by creating a reusable
data infrastructure. Within 1 year of enactment, the Committee re-
quests NCATS provide a 5-year strategic plan and recommenda-
tions for expanding the N3C platform.
Rare Disease Research.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant impacts NCATS has in addressing rare disease, directly fund-
ing research that resulted in 55 Investigational New Drugs and 14
approved therapies, and provides a $10,000,000 increase for rare
disease research. The Committee encourages NCATS to leverage
the investments made in NCATS rare disease research to accel-
erate the development of new treatments for the 95 percent of rare
diseases with no approved treatment, to strengthen the innovation
of diagnostics to shorten the average 5 year-long diagnostic odys-
sey, and to lower the nearly $1,000,000,000,000 annual economic
burden of rare diseases. The Committee urges NCATS to increase
funding for rare disease research, helping to grow the newly cre-
ated Division of Rare Diseases Research Innovation and accelerate
the development of new treatments. Finally, the Committee notes
that 11 NCATS’ Rare Disease Clinical Research Network [RDCRN]
renewal grant applications were terminated in April 2025 due to
implementation of a new NIH foreign subaward policy. This deci-
sion jeopardizes more than a decade of progress in clinical trials,
natural history research, and the development of clinical care
guidelines for rare diseases that impact thousands of patients en-
rolled in these studies. The Committee notes that on June 5, 2025,
NIH issued the grant opportunity PAR–25–438 to allow affected
consortia to reapply for funding to be awarded in fiscal year 2025.
The Committee is concerned that NIH has not awarded these
grants, and that funding for these consortia will expire in Sep-
tember 2025. Therefore, within 30 days of enactment and monthly
thereafter, the Committee directs NIH to provide a briefing to the
Committees on Appropriations on efforts to award RDCRN grants
that were submitted in response to PAR–25–438 until funding has
been awarded.
Translational Science.—The Committee recognizes the important
work of NCATS-funded CTSAs in supporting innovation and job
creation. The Committee also understands that many commercially
promising and potentially lifesaving inventions from CTSAs are
often translated into FDA-approved and commercially available
products. The Committee understands that there can be limitations
in commercialization knowledge and resources available. The Com-

147
mittee therefore urges NCATS to continue to work with CTSAs to
provide opportunities to translate research.
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,605,514,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,460,514,000
The Committee provides $2,460,514,000 for the Office of the Di-
rector [OD]. Within this total, $572,401,000 is provided for the
Common Fund, and $12,600,000 is included for the Gabriella Miller
Kids First Research Act (Public Law 113–94).
ADRD Clinical Trial Diversity/Health Equity.—The Committee
recommends that NIH fund or conduct Black/African American-,
Latino/Hispanic- and women- only research studies to better under-
stand the underlying etiology of cognitive impairment and demen-
tia in these groups that have disproportionately higher prevalence
of disease.
Advancing Clinical Trials Through Subawards.—The Committee
is concerned about the impact of the Administration’s policy to pro-
hibit scientists from directing any funding to international research
partners and the impact on clinical trials and human subjects re-
search. Pediatric cancer, rare disease, HIV and infectious disease
research rely on clinical trial participants and biospecimens from
foreign countries in order to aggregate enough samples or patients
for robust research. The Committee directs NIH to allow reim-
bursements and other funding arrangements with research part-
ners abroad to foster pediatric cancer, rare disease, HIV and infec-
tious disease research.
Advisory Councils.—Advisory councils are a fundamental part of
NIH’s grant making process. The Committee notes that NIH re-
cently disbanded or terminated several of its advisory councils and
boards established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act
[FACA] to provide advice and recommendations to the NIH Direc-
tor, Institute and Center [IC] Directors, and senior scientific staff.
This includes the Advisory Committee to the Director [ACD], sev-
eral IC advisory councils, and many other special emphasis panels
and study section review groups, all of which are part of NIH’s
grant making process. The Committee notes that the process for se-
lecting members on FACA Committees is rigorous and time con-
suming, usually requiring 2 years of screening candidates through
a series of background and ethics checks, formally nominating
them, and seeking agency and Department approval. Within 30
days of enactment, the Committee directs NIH to brief the Commit-
tees on Appropriations on the status of NIH’s FACA advisory coun-
cils and boards. Such briefing shall include a detailed list of every
NIH FACA advisory council, board, committee, special emphasis
panel, and study section that has been terminated, disbanded, or
had its members dismissed since December 2024, and a justifica-
tion for each instance. The Committee also directs the NIH Direc-
tor to provide a separate briefing to the Committees on Appropria-
tions on the disbanding of the ACD, and the selection criteria ap-
plied to select new members. Finally, within 90 days of enactment,
NIH is directed to provide a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations regarding the agency’s plan to reconstitute its FACA Ad-

148
visory Councils, particularly any IC Advisory Councils that have
been disbanded or terminated.
Advancing Novel Alternative Methods Research.—The Committee
is encouraged by many of the insights and recommendations of the
Advisory Committee to the Director [ACD] Working Group on Cata-
lyzing the Development and Use of Novel Alternative Methods
[NAMs] to Advance Biomedical Research, detailed in the December
2023 Report to the ACD and accepted by NIH in February 2024.
The Committee acknowledges that NAMs complement under-
standing of human biology and advance human health. Within 18
months of enactment, NIH is urged to publish a report on the allo-
cation of funds specifically designated for research utilizing alter-
natives to animal testing. This report should include an estimate
of the total amount of funding directed towards alternative re-
search methods, the number of funded projects that use alternative
methods, examples of the specific types of alternatives funded, and
examples of research initiatives and their outcomes, including but
not limited to publications, patents, or advances in non-animal
testing methodologies. NIH shall ensure that this report is made
available to the public via NIH’s website and shall ensure the data
is presented in a user-friendly format. NIH is encouraged to add
a new Research, Condition, and Disease, Categorization [RCDC] in
fiscal year 2026 to track NIH spending on NAMs.
Alcohol and Polysubstance Misuse Research.—The Committee is
pleased to see NIH supporting research on alcohol and
polysubstance use, and urges the Director to continue to support
research in this area across the United States. Given the increas-
ing prevalence of polysubstance-involved overdose deaths, particu-
larly among rural and minority communities, the Committee also
encourages the Director to support studies in rural and minority
communities with high rates of mortality involving alcohol and
polysubstance use.
All of Us Research Program.—The Committee provides
$31,000,000 for the All of Us Research Program.
ALS Research, Treatments, and Expanded Access.—The Com-
mittee provides a $25,000,000 increase for ALS research within
NINDS to reduce the burdens of people with ALS as quickly as
possible. It is crucial for people living with ALS and people diag-
nosed with ALS in the future, that NIH dramatically grows its ALS
portfolio and the research workforce with additional grant funding
and increases its focus on research that will lead to measurable
changes in the lives of people living with ALS. The Committee di-
rects NIH to handle funding of expanded access grants as author-
ized by the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies [ACT] for ALS
(Public Law 117–79) as separate, not competitive with, funding for
other research on ALS and includes $100,000,000 for this purpose.
Expanded Access Grants support scientific research utilizing data
from expanded access to investigational drugs for people with ALS
who are not eligible for clinical trials. The Committee requests
NINDS include ALS clinics across the country in an ALS Clinical
Research Network to increase capacity for research utilizing data
from expanded access and other clinical research at geographically
distributed sites. The Committee continues to direct NINDS and
OD to brief the Committees prior to any execution of expanded ac-

149
cess grants or programmatic funding. Once awards are announced,
the Committee directs NINDS and OD to provide the Committees
with an explanation of the funded grants, including a clear break-
down of what the funding is to be used for. Furthermore, after the
review and awards of meritorious applications under section 2, the
Committee directs NIH to apply any unused funds to programs au-
thorized under ACT for ALS including section 3 public-private re-
search partnership. Finally, if sufficient eligible applications are
not received, or NINDS has any reason to believe any funding
should lapse, the ICs are directed to notify the Committees on Ap-
propriations prior to notifications of awards. This notification shall
include: (1) a detailed explanation as to why applications cannot be
funded; (2) the technical assistance provided to applicants to assist
them in submitting eligible grant applications; and (3) a proposed
plan to award funding for other ALS research identified by the
NIH ALS Strategic Priorities prior to the end of the fiscal year.
Alzheimer’s Disease [ADRD] and Parkinson’s [PD].—The Com-
mittee strongly encourages NIA and NINDS to expand the use of
fiscal year 2026 and beyond AD/ADRD funding to fund projects
studying dementia in PD. PD is the second most common and fast-
est growing neurodegenerative disease globally and is characterized
by the abnormal folding of a protein in the brain, which is similar
to what typically occurs in AD/ADRD. Channeling additional re-
sources into research could help to unlock groundbreaking demen-
tia-relevant discoveries in crucial areas like PD and other closely
associated neurological disorders.
Article Processing Charges for NIH–Funded Research.—The Com-
mittee commends NIH for building on prior public access and data-
sharing reforms to initiate a process to address rising Article Proc-
essing Charges [APCs] that scientific journal publishers often
charge NIH-supported scientists to publish the findings of their
federally-funded research. NIH, and the scientists it funds, must be
good stewards of taxpayer dollars and obtain as much research
value as possible from limited resources. The Committee directs
NIH to work with the scientific community to inform development
of an APC allowable charge limit and, as part of that process, to:
account for different publishing models, particularly U.S.based pub-
lishers focused on rigorous peer review and quality checks; support
a robust American scientific research and publishing enterprise
amid unprecedented global competition; and support the aims of
gold standard science by establishing parameters to guard against
potential abuses, including payment of APCs to journals that don’t
prioritize research quality and integrity. Within 90 days of enact-
ment, NIH is directed to brief the Committee on these efforts and
its work to engage scientific journals on reasonable, sustainable
APCs moving forward.
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning [AI/ML].—The Com-
mittee provides $135,000,000 for the Office of Data Science Strat-
egy to support NIH’s efforts to build capacity to leverage AI, ML
and data science to accelerate the pace of biomedical innovation.
The Committee encourages NIH to continue expanding the applica-
tion of AI, ML, and data science across its research portfolio. The
application of AI methods in biomedicine offer promising new ap-
proaches to screen for, detect, and diagnose health conditions, pre-

150
dict disease risk and progression, improve drug discovery, and opti-
mize precision care for patients. However, the AI/ML research field
lacks diversity in its researchers as well as in the data sets that
it uses. Furthermore, new techniques are needed to incorporate
ethics and trustworthiness into the design of new models. These
gaps pose a risk of creating and continuing harmful biases in how
AI/ML is used, how algorithms are developed and trained, and how
findings are interpreted, ultimately leading to continued health dis-
parities and inequities. The Committee supports efforts to increase
diversity in AI/ML, including accelerating grants awarded through
NIH’s AI/ML Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Re-
searcher Diversity [AIM–AHEAD] program. The Committee sup-
ports the memorandum of understanding [MOU] between NIH and
the Department of Energy [DOE] focused on using advanced com-
puting, quantum, and AI/ML for biomedical research and data
sourcing. The Committee encourages NIH to continue coordinating
with DOE to accelerate advances in precision oncology and sci-
entific computing as part of the Cancer Moonshot program. The
Committee continues to support collaboration between NIH and
DOE to bring together biomedical scientists with computer sci-
entists and other data science experts. The Committee also sup-
ports NIH’s contributions to the National AI Research Resource
[NAIRR] and the creation of AI ready datasets for the research
community. The Committee encourages NIH to develop effective AI
education and training pathways for the health research workforce,
including trainees and senior scientists, to ensure the U.S. bio-
medical research workforce remains at the forefront of scientific
discovery. These training resources should support biomedical re-
searchers from diverse populations and backgrounds in the use of
AI technologies to efficiently, accurately, and meaningfully process
data for their research, as well as to participate in multi-discipli-
nary teams to develop new capabilities that advance biomedical AI.
The Committee urges NIH to continue enhancing its infrastructure
capabilities around data, computing, and software across the agen-
cy and within the research community. The Committee also urges
NIH to coordinate with relevant intergovernmental partners to
support this long-term mission.
Autism Research.—The Committee urges the Director to ensure
that fiscal year 2026 NIH spending on research on Autism Spec-
trum Disorders [ASDs] meets the authorized funding level set by
the Autism CARES Act of 2024, and ensure such research address-
es the underlying biology, including genetics, environmental factors
and their interaction, co-occurring medical conditions, and treat-
ment and services needs, and includes the entire population of indi-
viduals with ASD, including those with profound autism. In addi-
tion, the Committee is concerned by reports that the OD awarded
a noncompetitive, multi-million-dollar consulting contract for au-
tism research that resulted in the abrupt termination of NIH’s
Chief Operating Officer. Within 30 days of enactment, NIH is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committee on this incident. Such
report shall include the contract, statement of work, determination
and findings for the sole source justification, award decision docu-
mentation, and stop work order that was issued. Finally, the Com-
mittee notes that the Director’s proposed Autism Real World Data

151
Platform [RWDP] is nearly identical to a proposal for an Alz-
heimer’s Disease Research RWDP that was proposed in 2023 that
Congress expressed serious reservations about at that time. As a
result of its concerns regarding NIH’s ability to carry out an
RWDP, the Committee requested GAO conduct an audit of the pro-
posal. The explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year
2024 appropriations act urged NIH to pause funding any new
awards under the proposal until GAO published a report that was
underway but not yet completed, and to report to the Committees
every 30 days on any effort related to RWDP. GAO’s subsequent
July 2024 report (GAO–24–106886) found that NIH did not imple-
ment key leading practices for cost estimating and project manage-
ment for the RWDP. The report findings show that the cost esti-
mate for the RWDP is likely not accurate, comprehensive, or cred-
ible and that the proposal lacked a governance structure for achiev-
ing the project’s objectives or oversight. NIH then decided, at the
urging of Congress, to not move forward with that proposal. Given
this proposal is nearly identical to that, and NIH has never ad-
dressed the concerns with the earlier proposal, the Committee
strongly urges NIH to pause funding any awards for the Autism
RWDP and report to the Committee every 30 days after the date
of enactment of this act on any effort related to RWDP.
Biomedical Research Facilities.—The Committee continues to
provide $80,000,000 for grants to public and nonprofit entities to
expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or
construct new research facilities as authorized under section 404I
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283k). The Committee
urges NIH to make awards that are large enough to underwrite the
cost of a significant portion of newly constructed or renovated fa-
cilities. The Committee also encourages NIH to allocate no less
than 25 percent of funding for this program to institutions of
emerging excellence, that could include those in IDeA States, to en-
sure geographic and institutional diversity.
Biosecurity in Synthetic Nucleic Acid Synthesis.—The Committee
commends the multiple Federal efforts to advance the adoption of
strong biosecurity standards for synthetic biology technologies. NIH
and other agencies that fund life-sciences research are required to
establish that, as a requirement of funding, synthetic nucleic acid
procurement is conducted through providers or manufacturers that
adhere to the Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening.
Moreover, NIH should also explore approaches to encourage the
purchase of domestically produced synthetic genetic materials and
tools to protect U.S. intellectual property. The Committee requests
an update within 90 days of enactment on NIH’s ongoing work to
advance the adoption of strong biosecurity standards for synthetic
biology technologies.
Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies
[BRAIN] Initiative.—The Committee continues to support the
BRAIN Initiative which is revolutionizing our understanding of the
brain and fostering discoveries, collaborations, and partnerships
that will lead to treatments and cures for brain and central nerv-
ous system diseases, disorders, and injuries. The BRAIN Initiative
is an ambitious program to develop and apply new tools and tech-
nologies to answer fundamental questions about the brain and ulti-

152
mately to inspire new treatments. The BRAIN Initiative promotes
scientific advances that provide opportunities to understand the
structure and function of the brain at an unprecedented level of de-
tail, helping bring advanced treatments for brain disorders to clin-
ical use and paving the way for tools that will fundamentally trans-
form and improve the future of biomedical research. The Com-
mittee provides a $12,000,000 increase for the BRAIN Initiative.
The Committee requests a briefing on the BRAIN Initiative about
the progress and achievements of the key projects and studies it is
supporting with these funds by reporting on their objectives and
anticipated/actual outcomes within 90 days of enactment.
Cell and Gene Therapies.—Newly approved cell and gene thera-
pies provide enormous promise for patients with conditions ranging
from various cancers such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma to
inherited blood disorders like hemophilia, sickle cell disease and
beta thalassemia. Long-term data from clinical trials and real
world experience are needed for researchers, practitioners, and pa-
tients to understand the long-term effects and potential toxicities
associated with these therapies. The Committee encourages NIH to
explore these issues by holding a workshop with the relevant Fed-
eral agency representatives, including FDA and NIH, and expert
stakeholders on this topic and requests an update in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
Cephalopod Research.—The Committee recognizes that there are
no federally required welfare standards for the use of cephalopods
in federally-funded research because all invertebrate animals are
excluded from the Public Health Service [PHS] Policy on the Hu-
mane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, which provides certain
welfare standards for vertebrate animals. The Committee recog-
nizes that implementing and complying with the PHS Policy re-
quires reference to guidelines in the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals [the Guide], which does not currently in-
clude cephalopod-specific welfare guidelines, and updates to which
are overseen by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine [NASEM]. The Committee also recognizes that re-
searchers must still justify their use and numbers when proposing
research seeking NIH funding. The Committee acknowledges that
other countries have established oversight requirements for
cephalopods when used in government-funded research. The Com-
mittee encourages NIH to consider developing guidance for the hu-
mane care and use of cephalopods in NIH-supported research, in-
cluding possibly expanding the definition of ‘‘animal’’ in the PHS
Policy to include cephalopods.
Childhood Post-Infectious Neuroimmune Disorders/PANS/PAN-
DAS.—The Committee is concerned that although NIH supports re-
search on Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome
[PANS] and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders As-
sociated with Streptococcus [PANDAS], significantly more needs to
be done. Understanding the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of
these life-threatening diseases is essential to expedite early identi-
fication and intervention, thereby reducing the risk of chronic ill-
ness and associated costs to families, school systems, healthcare
systems, and insurers. PANS/PANDAS research also would further
the understanding of the critical link between neuropsychiatric ill-

153
ness and COVID–19 and other infections. The Committee encour-
ages NIH to continue to prioritize research on PANS/PANDAS and
related to autoimmune encephalitic conditions, and requests an up-
date in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Chimpanzees.—The Committee is pleased that NIH has relocated
the remaining chimps from Holloman Air Force Base in
Alamogordo, New Mexico to Chimp Haven. The Committee under-
scores the importance of compliance with Public Law 106–551, the
Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection
Act, which mandates the retirement of chimpanzees owned or sup-
ported by the Federal Government to appropriate sanctuary care.
The Committee directs NIH to submit a report to the Committee
no later than 180 days after enactment regarding the chimpanzees
transferred from Alamogordo Primate Facility at Holloman Air
Force Base in New Mexico to the Chimp Haven sanctuary in Lou-
isiana. The report shall include a complete accounting of the num-
ber of chimpanzees relocated; the dates of transport and mode of
transportation used; information on the health status of each chim-
panzee prior to transport; a detailed summary of any health com-
plications, injuries, or deaths that occurred during or after the relo-
cation, including the cause(s) of any such outcomes; an assessment
of the current health and wellbeing of the transferred chimpanzees
at Chimp Haven; any additional measure NIH and its contractors
have taken or plan to take to ensure the safe and humane trans-
port of federally owned chimpanzees in the future.
Common Data Elements [CDEs].—The Committee applauds the
Office of Data Science Strategy for issuing a request for informa-
tion [RFI] to stakeholders focused on developing CDEs and for con-
vening a workshop on this topic. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of CDEs in facilitating research activities and fostering
collaboration amongst the research and healthcare communities.
CDEs are instrumental in standardizing data collection, enhancing
data quality, and enabling more effective data sharing and anal-
ysis, particularly in complex areas such as autoimmune and im-
mune-mediated diseases. The Committee encourages NIH to build
upon the RFI and workshop and to develop a plan to work with
stakeholders, particularly in the autoimmune and immune-mediate
communities, to develop and advance the use of CDEs.
Common Data Elements for Women’s Health.—The Committee
recognizes the continued need to develop common data elements
[CDEs] related to women’s health that will help researchers share
and combine datasets, promote interoperability, and improve the
accuracy of datasets when it comes to women’s health. The Com-
mittee encourages the Office of Data Science Strategy [ODSS] to
collaborate with the Office of Research on Women’s Health
[ORWH] and Institutes and Centers to prepare a roadmap for de-
veloping new NIH-endorsed CDEs to capture more data about
women’s health in both research and clinical settings. In addition,
the Committee urges NIH to launch a data resource to better co-
ordinate and integrate investments in women’s health research
across NIH. The Committee encourages ODSS and ORWH to en-
gage outside stakeholders, including professional societies and pa-
tient organizations, in this work, as appropriate. NIH is directed to

154
provide an update on relevant activities within 90 days of enact-
ment.
Common Fund.—The Committee acknowledges the role of the
NIH Common Fund in advancing biomedical research and fostering
innovative research collaborations across various NIH Institutes,
Centers, and Offices to catalyze discovery across all biomedical re-
search, and to create a space where investigators and multiple NIH
Institutes, Centers, and Offices collaborate to address scientific
challenges and opportunities that are high-priority for NIH as a
whole. The Committee encourages the Common Fund to consider
establishing an RNA Project [RNOME] to support this work. The
Committee requests an update on Common Fund projects in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Compensation for Trainees and Early Career Researchers.—The
Committee appreciates that the future of U.S. economic competi-
tiveness and our Nation’s ability to address national, economic, and
health security threats depends on sustaining a robust STEM
workforce. Ensuring individuals from communities that are under-
represented in the STEM field can enter and sustain a career as
part of the STEM workforce is essential to strengthening the re-
search workforce going forward. The Committee is deeply con-
cerned that entrenched financial barriers are increasingly deterring
graduate and postdoctoral students, particularly those from under-
represented communities, from pursuing STEM careers. The lack of
Cost-of-Living Adjustments [COLAs] can make it financially unre-
alistic for postdoctoral scholars to accept positions, particularly in
high-cost areas; areas in which academic medical centers are lo-
cated. The Committee commends NIH for proposing meaningful in-
creases in stipends for postdoctoral scholars. These increases take
a significant step towards returning National Research Service
Awards [NRSA] to their inflation-adjusted pre-pandemic levels and
brings the agency closer to offering real dollar increases in the sti-
pend of early career researchers that are needed to ensure a strong
STEM workforce.
Denying Foreign Access to Americans’ Sensitive Health Data.—
The Committee is concerned that NIH does not have proper proto-
cols to restrict the ability of foreign adversaries from accessing sen-
sitive data within NIH databases. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Director, within 30 days of enactment, to report on its proc-
esses to maintain, update, publish and implement user authentica-
tion protocols to restrict the ability for foreign adversary entities,
as defined in 15 CFR section 7.4, to access the databases.
Developmental Delays.—The Committee continues to provide
$10,000,000 for research on developmental delays, including speech
and language delays in infants and toddlers, characterizing speech
and language development and outcomes in infants and toddlers
through early adolescence. The Committee urges NIH to support
research which may include longitudinal studies, translation of re-
search into clinical practice, and novel approaches to study children
with speech and language delays to provide parents, teachers, pedi-
atricians, and other caregivers with the information they need to
help late talking children grow and thrive in school and other so-
cial environments.

155
Diet and Chronic Disease Research.—The Committee commends
NIH for convening a scientific workshop in August 2024 that ex-
plored the role food and diet play in developing mucosal immunity
for conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and other
digestive and autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases. The Com-
mittee is also aware of the increasing interest in research focused
on preventing Inflammatory Bowel Disease including research on
environmental and dietary factors that may trigger these condi-
tions. The Committee urges NIH to build upon these activities
across NIH and consider opportunities to better coordinate ongoing
and emerging efforts through a Food is Medicine Network or Cen-
ters of Excellence program.
Emerging Technologies.—The Committee commends NIH for
seeking new mechanisms to partner with other Federal agencies,
such as its partnership with the National Science Foundation on
emerging technologies such as quantum information sciences and
quantum technologies, bioengineering and synthetic biology, artifi-
cial intelligence, and digital twins. As these programs are devel-
oped, the agencies are encouraged to find mechanisms to continue
activities at the intersections of robotics, biomechanics, disabilities,
and chronic pain. The National Robotics Initiative supported these
efforts and now that it has sunsetted the agencies should ensure
new mechanisms to foster collaboration between biomedical re-
searchers and engineers, computer and physical scientists, and
other disciplines to ensure progress on critical health challenges
are considered.
Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes [ECHO].—
The Committee includes $180,000,000, for the ECHO program.
ECHO currently funds the Navajo Birth Cohort Study. The Com-
mittee encourages expanding the study to include a larger rep-
resentation of Navajo children in the cohort to allow for a better
understanding of the impacts of environmental exposure in the
Navajo Nation.
Expanding Support for Young Investigators.—NIH has been criti-
cized for funding too many late career scientists while funding too
few early career scientists with new ideas. The Committee is con-
cerned that the average age of first-time R01 funded investigators
remains 42 years old. More than twice as many R01 grants are
awarded to investigators over 65 than to those under 36 years old.
The Committee appreciates NIH’s efforts to provide support for
early-career researchers through several dedicated initiatives, in-
cluding the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award, Next Generation
Researchers Initiative, Stephen Katz award, and the NIH Pathway
to Independence Award. The Committee encourages NIH to con-
tinue supporting these important initiatives and to expand support
for early career researchers by increasing the number of award re-
cipients for these programs in future years. The Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122) directed NIH to pro-
vide a ‘‘professional judgement’’ budget to the Committee to grow
and retain the early career investigator pool, accelerate earlier re-
search independence, and ensure the long term sustainability of
the biomedical research enterprise. Building off of these efforts, the
Committee directs NIH to provide an update on the activities to
grow and retain early career investigators.

156
Facilities and Administrative Costs [F&A].—The F&A cost of a
grant is intended to cover the indirect costs of biomedical research,
ranging from administration and facilities to the cost of equipment
shared across multiple researchers. For example, at research facili-
ties focused on making the next breakthrough in cancer treatment,
indirect costs supply the air handlers that provide the precise con-
ditions needed to generate therapeutic T cells for immunotherapy
trials, complex data systems to analyze and protect patients’
genomic data, and support for the next generation of scientific lead-
ers. The methodology for negotiating indirect costs has been in
place since 1965, and rates have remained largely stable across
NIH grantees for decades. The Committee recognizes that this has
been essential for supporting federally-funded research at institu-
tions across the country. The Committee acknowledges that opti-
mizing indirect cost rates can further enhance the efficiency of re-
search, including benefiting early career researchers and smaller
institutions. But the Committee notes the administration similarly
proposed to cap NIH’s indirect cost rate at 15 percent in 2018,
which Congress rejected by including a general provision prohib-
iting that in the fiscal year 2018 appropriations Act, which has
been continued thereafter. The Committee notes that several major
national associations representing academic and research institu-
tions launched the Joint Associations Group [JAG] on Indirect
Costs to develop transparent, equitable, and efficient alternatives
to the current Federal indirect cost reimbursement system. To-
gether, these subject matter experts from major public and private
research universities, independent research institutes, academic
medical centers, industry, foundations, hospitals, Federal research
laboratories, and leading higher-education associations are devel-
oping new models for funding indirect costs on Federal research
grants as potential replacements for the current Federal F&A reim-
bursement model. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the
JAG’s proposal to develop and implement an optimized, new gov-
ernment-wide model for indirect costs reimbursement and in antici-
pation of that effort maintains its longstanding bill language pro-
hibiting NIH from developing or implementing a modified approach
to funding F&A costs.
Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention.—The Committee pro-
vides $12,500,000 to conduct research on firearm injury and mor-
tality prevention. Given violence and suicide have a number of
causes, the Committee recommends NIH take a comprehensive ap-
proach to studying these underlying causes and evidence-based
methods of prevention of injury, including crime prevention. All
grantees under this section will be required to fulfill requirements
around open data, open code, pre-registration of research projects,
and open access to research articles consistent with the National
Science Foundation’s open science principles. The Director is to re-
port to the Committees within 30 days of enactment of this act on
implementation schedules and procedures for grant awards, which
strive to ensure that such awards support ideologically and politi-
cally unbiased research projects.
Focused Ultrasound.—The Committee understands focused
ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological, relatively safe,
and cost-effective alternative or complement to conventional sur-

157
gery, radiation, or drug-based treatments that holds tremendous
promise to treat numerous debilitating conditions and diseases in-
cluding Alzheimer’s breast cancer, gynecological cancers, uterine
fibroids, and endometriosis, and substance abuse disorder. The
Committee encourages NIH continue to engage with the focused
ultrasound stakeholder community and requests a briefing on ef-
forts to increase focused ultrasound research funding within 120
days of the enactment.
Food As Medicine.—The Committee is aware of the strategic goal
within the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research focused on
improving the use of food as medicine and is interested in how cer-
tain foods, which are prescribed to support management of a spe-
cific condition and administered under physician supervision, im-
pact the lives of patients, for example those with digestive diseases
including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The Committee
urges NIH to support research on the efficacy of ‘food as medicine’
strategies to treat various diseases and conditions.
Forced Swim Test and Tail Suspension Test.—The Committee is
encouraged by NIH efforts to decrease the use of animal models in
research, but remains concerned about the use of certain
neurobehavioral approaches, such as the forced swim test and tail
suspension test, which are known to have poor predictive value for
understanding human mental illness, like depression, or developing
effective therapeutics. The Committee acknowledges that other
countries have limited the use of the forced swim test due to sci-
entific and animal welfare concerns. The Committee urges the NIH
to limit funding for grants involving the forced swim test or tail
suspension test. The Committee also encourages NIH to continue
to increase support for human-specific mental health and behav-
ioral research, including imaging, epidemiological, clinical, com-
putational, and cell-derived approaches, that can provide more
translational insights into the underlying neurobiology of human
mental illness.
Foreign Adversaries.—The Committee is concerned about funding
for research at any laboratory owned or controlled by the govern-
ments of the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, the Russian Federation, the Bolivarian Republic of Ven-
ezuela under the regime of Nicolas Maduro Moros, or any other
country determined by the Secretary of State to be a foreign adver-
sary. The Committee requests a report on any such research within
30 days of enactment.
Foreign Influence.—To support NIH’s efforts to expeditiously
complete grant compliance reviews, the Committee continues to in-
clude $2,500,000 for this activity within the Office of Extramural
Research. The Committee directs NIH to provide biannual briefings
on compliance, oversight, and monitoring reviews where non-com-
pliance related to foreign interference has been identified.
Fund the Person, Not the Project.—While many labs are funded
by R01-equivalent grants, the R35 mechanism arguably allows sci-
entists more flexibility and freedom to pursue the most meritorious
science. The Committee looks forward to reviewing NIH’s plans for
expanding the R35 along with its plans for evaluating the impact

158
on scientific progress, as directed in the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122).
Global Cohort for Alzheimer’s Treatment.—More than 57 million
people worldwide are living with dementia, including more than 7.2
million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease. The disease does not
affect everyone equally: in the United States two-thirds of people
living with Alzheimer’s disease are women. Black people are twice
as likely and Latino people are one and one-half times as likely to
develop Alzheimer’s than Caucasian people. It is believed that
there are disparities in Alzheimer’s disease both between and with-
in nations around the world, including between men and women
and members of different ethnic groups. In order to ensure that
treatments work for the greatest number of people possible, the
Committee urges the National Institutes of Health to provide an
update in the fiscal year 2027 Congressional Justification on activi-
ties related to global cohort studies or networks with high-quality
data on a well-characterized, diverse population, readily available
to researchers. The Committee expects that one potential outcome
for such a cohort or network of global cohorts would be an increase
discovery of targets for drug development and associated biomark-
ers.
Harassment Policies.—NIH has taken major steps over the last
several years to address harassment in biomedical research set-
tings. However, the Committee remains frustrated by statutory
loopholes that fail to protect victims of harassment and prevent
perpetrators from transferring grants between organizations. In
2020, NIH clarified the longstanding requirement for institutions
to seek prior approval when changing personnel on a grant or mov-
ing the grant to a new institution. The request for approval was
expected to mention whether the change was related to concerns
about safety or work environments (e.g. due to concerns about har-
assment, bullying, retaliation, or hostile working conditions). These
notifications allow NIH to make informed decisions about any
changes to awards including requests to transfer awards to a new
institution. Additionally, new authority provided by the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–35) made it man-
datory for institutions to inform NIH of disciplinary actions taken
against senior or key personnel, regardless of whether they prompt-
ed changes including transferring a grant between institutions. If
an ongoing investigation is incomplete and the individual under in-
vestigation leaves their current position, however, NIH lacks the
authority to require recipient organizations to complete the report
or share its findings with the agency. To address this issue, the
Committee has included a new general provision to require institu-
tions that receive NIH funding to complete any investigation un-
dertaken due to concerns about harassment, bullying, retaliation,
or hostile working conditions, even if during the course of the in-
vestigation the individual under investigation leaves their current
position and is no longer employed by the institution. NIH is di-
rected to continue to provide annual updates to the Committees on
holding both NIH-funded institutions and researchers accountable
for such incidents, including through the loss of Federal funding.
In addition, the Committee is concerned that current regulations do
not allow NIH to act quickly and independently to suspend or

159
debar perpetrators. The Committee urges NIH to issue regulations
implementing Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689.
Such regulations would provide NIH with the authority to issue a
government-wide debarment, thereby preventing individuals or en-
tities from participating in any government contracts, subcontracts,
loans, grants, and other assistance programs for a specified period.
Finally, the Committee directs NIH to share investigation reports,
conclusions, and the results of any investigation involving senior/
key personnel on an NIH award due to concerns about harassment,
bullying, retaliation, or hostile working conditions with another
NIH recipient organization on a need-to-know basis.
Health Impacts on Children of Technology and Social Media
Use.—The Committee remains concerned about the impacts of tech-
nology use and media consumption on infant, children, and adoles-
cent development. The Committee appreciates NIH’s ongoing en-
gagement on this important topic and encourages NIH to prioritize
research into the cognitive, physical, and socioemotional impacts of
young people’s use of technologies as well as long-term develop-
mental effects on children’s social, communication, and creative
skills. The Committee also encourages NIH to study potential cor-
relations between increased use of digital media and technologies
and suicidal thoughts and ideation among children. The Committee
encourages NIH to consider different forms of digital media and
technologies, including mobile devices, smart phones, tablets, com-
puters, and virtual reality tools, as well as social-media content,
video games, and television programming. The Committee encour-
ages collaboration between NIMH and NICHD for these activities.
The Committee requests an update on these activities within 120
days of enactment.
INCLUDE Initiative.—The Committee includes no less than
$90,000,000 within OD for the INCLUDE Initiative. The Com-
mittee remains pleased with NIH’s focus on large cohort studies
across the lifespan, novel clinical trials, and multi-year, NIH-wide
research driving important advances in understanding immune
system dysregulation, Alzheimer’s disease, and leukemia that is
contributing to improvements in the health outcomes and quality
of life of individuals with Down syndrome as well as millions of
typical individuals. The Committee requests that NIH provide an
updated plan within 60 days of enactment of this act that includes
a timeline and description of potential grant opportunities and
deadlines for all expected funding opportunities so that young in-
vestigators and new research institutions may be further encour-
aged to explore research in this space. This plan should also incor-
porate an increase in pipeline research initiatives specific to Down
syndrome.
Long COVID Treatments.—The Committee remains concerned
about the economic and overall health impact that Long COVID in-
flicts on the Nation. It is currently estimated that between 6 per-
cent and 19 percent of those infected with SARS–CoV–2 go on to
develop Long COVID, resulting in up to 20 million Americans suf-
fering from this set of debilitating chronic symptoms. Long COVID
is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including severe fa-
tigue, non-restorative sleep, cognitive dysfunction, and widespread
pain. Further, it resembles other post-acute infection syndromes

160
[PAISs], such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic
fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS] and related conditions, known as
chronic overlapping pain conditions [COPCs] or nociplastic syn-
dromes. While the Committee is pleased that NIH’s HEAL and RE-
COVER initiatives plan to target some specific symptoms of Long
COVID, the Committee is concerned that NIH has not expanded
the evaluation of treatments to address many common symptoms
associated with Long COVID either individually or that present as
syndromes which are combinations of symptoms. Furthermore,
NIH’s research program has defined Long COVID narrowly, exclud-
ing many of the common symptoms plaguing Long COVID suf-
ferers. In June 2024, NASEM released the 2024 NASEM Long
COVID Definition, which encompasses extensive lists of the symp-
toms and diagnosable conditions that current science attributes to
Long COVID. The Committee urges NIH to rebalance its research
program to prioritize clinical trials in pursuit of effective treat-
ments and to use the NASEM Long COVID definition to guide its
choice of symptoms and conditions to be address by the candidate
treatments. Such trials should target key symptoms and symptom
complexes associated with Long COVID including widespread pain,
fatigue, non-restorative sleep, brain fog, dizziness, post-exertional
malaise [PEM], postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS]
and loss of taste and smell. Further, the Committee urges NIH to
prioritize the support of clinical trials evaluating therapies for Long
COVID including therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in
treating COPCs or nociplastic syndromes that overlap with Long
COVID.
Lyme Disease and Related Tick-Borne Illnesses.—The Committee
includes not less than $110,000,000, an increase of $10,000,000, for
research into Lyme and other Tick-Borne diseases. The Committee
urges NIH to develop new tools that can more effectively prevent,
diagnose, and treat Lyme disease, including its long-term effects,
and other tick-borne diseases. The Committee encourages the pro-
motion and development of potential vaccine candidates for Lyme
disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Committee urges NIH to
conduct research to better understand modes of transmission for
Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. The Committee encourages
NIH to incentivize new investigators to enter the field of Lyme dis-
ease and other tick-borne disease research. The Committee encour-
ages NIH to coordinate with CDC on publishing reports that assess
diagnostic advancements, methods for prevention, the state of
treatment, and links between tick-borne disease and other ill-
nesses.
Made in America Research Equipment.—The Committee con-
tinues to support efforts to reinforce the Nation’s limited infra-
structure to produce essential products for biomedical research
such as medical devices, equipment, reagents, and consumables.
The Committee strongly encourages NIH to develop a long-term
plan for NIH grantees to give preference to and result in purchases
directly from domestic manufacturers to the maximum extent pos-
sible. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update in the fiscal
year 2027 CJ on steps it has taken to support this goal.
Menopause.—The Committee commends NIH for convening a
stakeholder workshop to discuss research needs, and requests a

161
briefing within 90 days of enactment on remaining knowledge gaps,
or other barriers, related to research, diagnostic testing, and treat-
ments with respect to perimenopause, menopausal symptoms, and
related health outcomes.
Multi-Purpose Prevention Technologies.—The Committee encour-
ages NIH, and particularly NICHD and NIAID, to work with other
Federal, public, and private sector partners to accelerate research,
development and implementation of multipurpose prevention tech-
nologies that are effective, affordable, acceptable, and easy to de-
liver.
Multi-Year Funding of Research Project Grants [RPGs].—Histori-
cally, NIH research grants have been awarded for more than 1
year but funded incrementally wherein each year’s commitment is
obligated from that year’s appropriation provided by Congress. The
Committee notes that the fiscal year 2026 President’s Budget
States that in fiscal year 2026 NIH proposes to continue a fiscal
year 2025 policy to reserve half of the agency’s budget allocation
for competing RPGs for awards that fully fund their outyear com-
mitments as part of the initial grant obligation. The Committee is
concerned about the impact of this policy on application success
rates and that providing grantees with funding for every year of
the RPG upfront would significantly reduce the number of grants
NIH is able to fund. In fiscal year 2025 alone NIH estimates it will
award 3,991 or 40 percent fewer new RPGs and application success
rates for cancer research will decrease from 13.4 percent to 6.8 per-
cent and success rates for NIA-funded research which overwhelm-
ingly supports Alzheimer’s disease research would decrease from
18.0 percent to 6.0 percent. The Committee directs NIH to submit
a report within 60 days of enactment on grants and contracts that
were forward funded for each fiscal year from 2019–2024
disaggregated by Institute, Center, and funding mechanism as well
as on the number of new awards in fiscal year 2025 that were
made under this mechanism by Institute and Center, the fiscal
year 2025 decrease in the number of awards for each Institute and
Center compared to fiscal year 2024, the number of grant applica-
tions from early career researchers received by NIH in fiscal year
2025, and the number and dollar amount of awards made to early
career scientists using the multi-year funding model. Additionally,
NIH is directed to provide the Committee with an analysis of the
types of research funded by this model in fiscal year 2025, and the
selection criteria to identify grants to be funded by the multi-year
approach.
National Security.—The Committee believes that NIH should
consider relevant national security issues when developing and exe-
cuting the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan.
Neurofibromatosis [NF].—The Committee supports efforts to in-
crease funding and resources for NF research and treatment at
multiple Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI,
NICHD, NIMH, NCATS, and NEI. Children and adults with NF
are at elevated risk for the development of many forms of cancer,
deafness, blindness, developmental delays and autism. The Com-
mittee encourages NCI to continue to support a robust NF research
portfolio in fundamental laboratory science, patient-directed re-
search, and clinical trials focused on NF-associated benign and ma-

162
lignant cancers. The Committee also encourages NCI to support
preclinical research and clinical trials. Because NF can cause blind-
ness, pain, and hearing loss, the Committee urges NEI, NINDS,
and NIDCD to continue to support fundamental basic science re-
search on NF relevant to restoring normal nerve function. Based
on emerging findings from numerous researchers worldwide dem-
onstrating that children with NF have a higher chance of devel-
oping autism, learning disabilities, motor delays, and attention
deficits, the Committee encourages NINDS, NIMH, and NICHD to
continue their support of research investigations in these areas.
Since NF2 accounts for some genetic forms of deafness, the Com-
mittee encourages NIDCD to expand its investment in NF2-related
research. NF1 can cause vision loss due to optic gliomas. The Com-
mittee encourages NIH to expand its investment in NF1-focused re-
search on optic gliomas and vision restoration.
New Approach Methodologies.—The Committee supports NIH
Common Fund’s Complement Animal Research In Experimentation
[Complement-ARIE] Program, intended to spur the development,
standardization, validation, and use of new approach methodologies
[NAMs] to more accurately model human biology. The Committee
also encourages NIH, in new Announcements and other indications
of funding opportunities, to continue consideration of NAMs as an
option for areas of preclinical research when it is not appropriate
to use human participants and where the use of NAMs has been
demonstrated to support biomedical discoveries. The Committee
further encourages NIH to collect and make publicly available a re-
port that outlines how the use of vertebrate animal models in agen-
cy research contributes to the mission of NIH as well as efforts by
the agency to encourage the use of new approach methods or strat-
egies. This report should include examples of how other methods
have been used in NIH research to reduce, replace, and refine the
number of vertebrate animals used in research.
NIH-Wide Effort on Women’s Health Research.—The Committee
commends NIH for its cross-cutting effort to transform women’s
health across the lifespan, which will initially be supported by
$200,000,000 from NIH. This NIH-wide effort-a first step to trans-
form the way we approach and fund women’s health research-will
allow NIH to catalyze the ambitious, multi-faceted, interdiscipli-
nary research projects that women need, such as research on the
impact of perimenopause and menopause on heart health, brain
health, and bone health. This coordinated, NIH-wide effort will be
led by OD, ORWH, NIA, NHLBI, NIDA, NICHD, NIAMS, and any
other Institutes and Centers deemed relevant by the NIH Director.
The Committee urges NIH to continue to expand basic, clinical,
and translational research into women’s health, including the
mechanisms of endometriosis and other gynecological conditions, to
identify early diagnostic markers, and develop new treatment
methods. The Committee strongly encourages OD and all Institutes
and Centers to dedicate additional funds and participate in this
cross-cutting effort in fiscal year 2026, with a focus on grant oppor-
tunities to support research and education to improve women’s
health in diverse settings across the United States. NIH is directed
to provide an update on the progress and achievements of the key
projects and studies supported by this NIH-wide effort by reporting

163
on their objectives and anticipated/actual outcomes within 90 days
of enactment. Finally, within 30 days of enactment, the Committee
directs NIH to produce a report on all NIH research grants con-
cerning women’s health that have been terminated or renewals
that have been withheld since January 20, 2025, including the
grant number, grant recipient, and justification for grant termi-
nation or funds withheld. Within 60 days of enactment, the Com-
mittee directs NIH to reinstate those grants that have been termi-
nated, and provide weekly updates to the Committee on these ef-
forts until they are complete.
Notices of Funding Opportunities [NOFOs].—The Committee di-
rects NIH to post monthly on its website a list of the estimated
publishing and award dates of funding opportunities it plans to an-
nounce for the subsequent 6 months. Additionally, to the extent
practicable, the Committee directs NIH to post anticipated pub-
lishing and award dates of future funding opportunities in fiscal
year 2027.
Office of Nutrition Research [ONR].—The Committee supports
ONR’s plan to establish Centers of Excellence in Food Is Medicine
to advance research, education, patient care, and community out-
reach on the role of nutrition in preventing and treating diet-re-
lated chronic diseases. The Committee recognizes that food is medi-
cine services, such as medically tailored meals and produce pre-
scriptions, may improve health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs,
and address health disparities among vulnerable populations. The
Committee encourages NIH to collaborate with existing Food Is
Medicine stakeholders in academia, healthcare, and the nonprofit
sector to leverage their expertise and experience in this field. The
Committee urges NIH to support research on the efficacy of ’food
as medicine’ strategies to treat various diseases and conditions, in-
cluding Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The Committee urges
NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the agen-
cy’s plans to comprehensively invest in food is medicine research,
including through Food is Medicine Centers of Excellence and col-
laborations with existing external stakeholders.
Office of Research on Women’s Health [ORWH].—The Committee
notes bill language that was included in the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103) that funding for ORWH
be made available for direct grant making to address women’s
health research needs that are not being addressed by Institutes
and Centers. The Committee provides $106,480,000 in base funding
for the Office of Research on Women’s Health, an increase of
$30,000,000. The role of ORWH is to improve women’s health re-
search and research on sex and gender influences in health and
disease within the NIH scientific framework to achieve equity in
women’s health across the lifespan. Congress is committed to
prioritizing this research portfolio and ensuring ORWH has the re-
sources it needs to help fulfill its mission. Within this amount, the
Committee allocates $10,000,000 to the Building Interdisciplinary
Research Careers in Women’s Health [BIRCWH] program with the
goal of strengthening the workforce pipeline through mentorship of
early career scientists engaged in women’s health research. Recog-
nizing the impact of the BIRCWH program, the Committee urges
NIH to use these funds to support additional researchers focused

164
on women’s health and sex differences, including research focused
on cancer, maternal health, endometriosis, fibroids and pelvic floor
disorders. The Committee expects NIH to use these funds to en-
hance the BIRCWH program through research on health of women
and female-specific diseases or conditions.
Osteopathic Medical Schools.—Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine
educate 25 percent of all the Nation’s medical students and
prioritize research and training in primary care and rural and un-
derserved healthcare. The Committee understands osteopathic
medical schools and their principal investigators are welcome to re-
view and apply for any NIH funding opportunities in the same way
other organizations seeking NIH support do and that the same is
true for Doctors of Osteopathy [D.O.s] on NIH National Advisory
Councils and study sections. Further, the Committee recognizes the
historic relationship between osteopathic medicine and the re-
search priorities of NCCIH but that D.O.s have been designated on
applications submitted to and awarded from other NIH Institutes
and Centers. The Committee encourages NIH to continue engaging
with researchers from Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, encour-
aging them to apply for available funding opportunities across NIH
Institutes and Centers, and requests an update in the fiscal year
2027 CJ of how Institutes and Centers are expanding research and
representation opportunities for Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine.
Pain and Addiction.—The Committee commends NIH, NIDA,
and NINDS for their focus on addressing addiction and developing
alternatives to opioids for safe and effective pain management
strategies that reduce reliance on opioids. In particular, NIDA and
NINDS’ commitment to research on improved pain management
and prevention, treatment, and recovery from substance use dis-
orders as part of NIH’s HEAL Initiative continues to help fuel the
next generation of scientists and clinicians focused on mitigating
chronic pain with nonaddictive therapies and prevention and treat-
ment of drug addiction. The Committee encourages NIH, NIDA,
and NINDS to continue their efforts through the HEAL Initiative
in fiscal year 2024, with a focus on grant opportunities to support
research and education to improve outcomes for people with both
chronic pain and addiction in diverse settings across the United
States, particularly those located in areas with high incidence of
people at risk for chronic pain, substance use, and overdose.
Parkinson’s Disease.—The Committee applauds the significant
recent advances in PD research made possible in part by public-pri-
vate partnerships like the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for
PD [AMP PD] that is a collaboration between NIH, nonprofit orga-
nizations (The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research
and Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s Disease), and industry
that has led to significant discovery. The goal of AMP PD is to
identify and validate promising biological targets for therapeutics
and to accelerate the development of novel therapies for PD. One
of the AMP PD cohorts, the Michael J. Fox Foundation’s Parkin-
son’s Progression Markers Initiative [PPMI] program, independ-
ently replicated a potential biomarker for PD that may result in
new diagnostics and treatments for this common, life-altering
neurodegenerative disease. Continued partnerships with programs
like PPMI may greatly advance the field of PD research. The Com-

165
mittee encourages NIH and NINDS to continue to participate in
such public-private partnership opportunities with patient advo-
cacy groups and build on these exciting discoveries to accelerate ad-
vances against PD.
Peripheral Neuropathy.—Peripheral neuropathy is a condition
that affects 30 million Americans, many of whom experience con-
siderable pain and disability. The Committee encourages NIH to
develop a coordinated approach to the diagnosis and treatment of
various types of peripheral neuropathy. There are several known
causes, but more research is needed to better understand the mul-
tiple causes and manifestations of this debilitating condition.
Primate Research Centers.—The Committee includes $30,000,000
in funding to remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities
or construct new research facilities for non-human primate re-
source infrastructure, as authorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k.
Psychedelic Research.—The Committee recognizes the increased
interest and need to study psychedelics, including MDMA,
ketamine, and psilocybin, and their potential therapeutic effects.
The Committee encourages NIH to expand its current research
agenda across its Institutes and Centers, potentially by forming a
cross-Institute research group, and to encourage psychedelic re-
search at the NIH Clinical Center. The Committee also encourages
NIH to work with FDA in developing and supporting public-private
collaborations to advance all forms of psychedelic research for
therapeutic purposes.
RCDC Funding Levels.—The Committee provides discretionary
funding for specified programs, projects, and activities [PPAs] ac-
cording to the amounts included in this act and the report accom-
panying this act. For funding levels not specified in this act or the
report accompanying this act, the Committee urges NIH as appro-
priate to maintain consistent funding in fiscal year 2026 for sci-
entific categories included in the Research, Condition, and Disease
Categorization [RCDC] system. The Committee directs NIH to no-
tify the Committees on Appropriations regarding any deviation by
more than 10 percent of the average annual funding level provided
in fiscal years 2019–2024 for any RCDC category, and a justifica-
tion for that deviation. Finally, the Committee directs NIH to pro-
vide quarterly briefings to the Committee on up-to-date RCDC ex-
penditures.
Reducing the Administrative Burden on Researchers.—The Com-
mittee remains concerned about the status of NIH’s implementa-
tion plans following a 2019 final report on administrative burden.
The Committee reiterates the directives described in the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122).
Replication and Reproducibility Experiments.—The Reproduc-
ibility Project in Cancer Biology showed the difficulty in replicating
cancer biology studies published in top journals. Given the impor-
tance of reproducibility in scientific research, the Committee en-
courages NIH to establish a program to fund replication experi-
ments on significant lines of research. The Committee directs NIH
to brief the Committee within 180 days of enactment on the repro-
ducibility efforts NIH will undertake in fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
Research on Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens [ePPPs].—
The Committee commends NIH for its continued work with OSTP

166
and other Federal partners to ensure the safe and secure conduct
of biomedical research, particularly as it relates to ePPPs. NIH is
directed to provide guidance to research institutions regarding its
updated policy through an implementation office, as outlined in the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–122). The
Committee continues to provide $1,000,000 for this office to serve
as a main point of contact for research institutions regarding ePPP
policy, and develop tools and training guidance to strengthen risk-
assessment, safety, security, and ethical considerations sur-
rounding proposed ePPP research at research institutions. NIH
shall provide annual reports to the Committee on the progress and
activities of implementation. In addition, NIH is urged to review
and, where appropriate, identify needed relevant authorities when
considering appropriate actions for investigators and research insti-
tutions that fail to follow the research oversight framework under
the policy. NIH may also consider additional approaches for pro-
moting use of these or similar oversight procedures by research in-
stitutions that conduct life sciences research and do not receive
Federal funding. NIH is directed to provide a report on these ac-
tivities within 180 days of enactment.
Research Training and Career Development.—The Committee
continues to be concerned about the health of the research training
and career development pipeline that is crucial to ensuring the
next generation maintains U.S. leadership in medical research and
biotechnology. The challenges facing the full-spectrum of medical
research, including the need for physician-scientists and clinical re-
searchers, are particularly pronounced. NIH is encouraged to en-
hance and otherwise explore opportunities to bolster training
grants, their infrastructures, and related mechanisms, including by
leveraging opportunities in the CTSA program through timely in-
vestment with supplemental resources.
Research Transparency.—As demonstrated over the past several
years, the Committee remains committed to funding NIH research
and ensuring that our Nation’s researchers, particularly our early
career scientists, have the support to make the scientific break-
throughs that may transform healthcare. However, it is critical
that NIH can ensure funds are used for the best possible research
that fulfill the core research mission of NIH. The Committee appre-
ciates that in response to prior language, NIH continues to provide,
in writing made available on a publicly accessible website, that
each grant or agreement promotes efforts to seek fundamental
knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and/or
the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life,
and reduce illness and disability.
Restructuring NIH.—The Committee notes that Congress estab-
lished 24 NIH ICs in statute through section 401 of the Public
Health Service Act (Public Law 106–525). The Committee further
notes that section 401 of the Public Health Service Act (Public Law
106–525) requires that the Secretary provide the HELP Committee
and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Rep-
resentatives 180 days written notice of any determination to re-
structure or reorganize the functions of NIH’s ICs, which the Com-
mittees have not received. The Committee commends NIH for re-
convening the Scientific Management Review Board [SMRB], as di-

167
rected in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations Act, to review the
overall research portfolio of the agency and advise on the use of or-
ganizational authorities, including eliminating ICs, creating new
ones, and reorganizing existing structures. NIH is directed to pro-
vide a report to the Committee no later than 30 days after enact-
ment on SMRB activities, and an annual report on SMRB plans
and activities thereafter.
Spending Practices.—Congress appropriates funding to NIH to
carry out its mission each fiscal year and NIH is statutorily re-
quired to obligate appropriations during their period of availability.
For fiscal year 2025, Congress appropriated $48,301,000,000 to
NIH to carry out the agency’s mission, to remain available for obli-
gation until September 30, 2025 (Public Law 119–4). Within 60
days of enactment, the Committee directs NIH to produce a report
that summarizes the agency’s quarterly spending for fiscal years
2019 through 2025 disaggregated by Institute, Center, and Office
and funding mechanism. This report must be made publicly avail-
able on the agency’s website no later than 120 days after enact-
ment of this act.
NIH Staff.—The Committee recognizes NIH’s unique scientific
expertise, which has propelled the success and dominance of the
U.S. biomedical research enterprise. The Committee notes the
number of political appointees at NIH has increased significantly
and further notes the importance of maintaining staff with the
technical expertise to support the agency’s mission to seek funda-
mental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems
and apply that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and re-
duce illness and disability. Finally, to maintain and recruit the best
and most qualified scientists, clinicians, and experts in their fields
of discipline, it is also crucial that NIH is able to offer competitive
salaries in line with industry, universities, academic medical cen-
ters and hospitals. Therefore, NIH is directed to continue to offer
salary ranges for these employees to a maximum of $350,000 due
to their leadership roles and the much higher compensation earned
by their counterparts in other sectors.
Stopping Tax Dollars from Funding Chinese Military Research.—
The Committee is concerned about research awards funded by NIH
that are associated with Chinese defense entities. Therefore, the
Committee directs NIH to submit a report to the Committee within
180 days of enactment and annually thereafter until September 30,
2026 on all NIH-funded research awards (including intramural re-
search funding as well as both extramural prime and sub-awards)
that involved persons from the People’s Republic of China [PRC].
Study on the Impact of Screen Time on Learning Outcomes.—
Screen time for children rose throughout the COVID–19 pandemic
and has continued to remain high. One study showed that in 2021
teens spent an average of 8.5 hours on screens per day, and chil-
dren from ages 8–12 spent 5.5 hours on screens per day. The Com-
mittee is concerned over the implications of high screen time on
children’s ability to learn and process information in schools and
urges NIH to study the impact of increased screen time on chil-
dren’s learning and developmental outcomes. Further, the Com-
mittee directs NIH to study media consumption in children to de-
termine the impact of online content offered by streaming sites

168
compared to noncommercial educational programming on literacy,
math skills, and workforce readiness. In addition to learning out-
comes, the Committee urges NIH to study whether the type of
media consumed by children is linked to behavioral and social out-
comes.
Support Innovation in Women’s Health.—NIH’s SBIR and STTR
programs are directed to increase investments in supporting
innovators and early-stage small businesses engaged in research
and development on women’s health. NIH is directed to provide an
update on these activities within 120 days of enactment.
Temporomandibular Disorder [TMD].—The Committee notes the
issuance of the TMD Collaborative for Improving Patient-Centered
Translational Research [TMD IMPACT] by NIDCR and the first
step in the implementation of a national consortium for TMD re-
search. The Committee recognizes that TMD is a complex, multi-
system condition and therefore encourages the NIH Director to
work closely with the NIDCR Director to ensure that other Insti-
tutes, Centers, and Offices with the appropriate scientific expertise
participate and support NIDCR as it implements and manages this
project. NIH is encouraged to use the recommendations from the
recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine
report on TMDs, from the TMJ Patient-led RoundTable efforts, and
from patients themselves as guidelines in the development of this
consortium. The Committee also supports the creation and imple-
mentation of a Patient-Centered Coordinated Registry Network
[CRN] for TMDs, recognizing its critical role in advancing research
and collaboration across Federal agencies. The Committee is en-
couraged that TMD, a long neglected, misunderstood and under-
funded condition is now receiving the attention and support needed
to improve the understanding of TMD and develop evidence-based
treatments and care for this complex condition. The Committee re-
quests an update within 120 days of enactment on the development
and implementation of this large-scale Collaborative to ensure the
full participation of the many government and private entities nec-
essary to successfully launch the Collaborative.
Timely Access to Funds.—The Committee notes the importance of
grant and other award recipients receiving timely access to award-
ed funds. The Committee is concerned about ongoing delays in
awarding NIH fiscal year 2025 appropriated funds and notes that
in July 2025, NIH’s rate of grant awards and overall spending
lagged more than $5,000,000,000 behind the same period in fiscal
year 2024. This scale of slowdown in NIH spending threatens to
disrupt critical biomedical research projects across the country.
Therefore, the Committee directs NIH to award competitive grants
as expeditiously as possible and noncompetitive grant renewals
within 30 days of the end of their period of performance, except in
the case of a grant or award where there has been a finding of fi-
nancial mismanagement, research fraud, or malfeasance. Finally,
the Committee directs NIH to provide grant and other award re-
cipients timely access to their award dollars when they submit a
draw down request to the agency.
Wastewater Surveillance R&D.—The Committee recognizes the
potential and importance of wastewater surveillance in public
health surveillance. Building on the prior NIH-supported efforts,

169
the Committee encourages NIH to continue efforts supporting inno-
vation through developing and improving wastewater surveillance
capabilities including in rural communities.
Women’s Health Research Initiative and NIH-Wide SABV Pol-
icy.—The Committee supports greater investment in research on
conditions unique to or that occur predominantly in women or
manifest themselves differently in women than in men. The Com-
mittee directs NIH to further integrate and prioritize funding for
women’s health across its research portfolio and to study ways to
leverage AI to advance women’s health research. In addition to
NIH efforts to dedicate additional funds for research on women’s
health needs, NIH’s sex as a biological variable [SABV] policy has
helped ensure that research that NIH funds considers women’s
health in the development of study design and in data collection
and analysis. The Committee encourages NIH to track and analyze
progress in integrating SABV into biomedical research, where ap-
propriate, across its Institutes and Centers and to adopt NIH-wide
standards regarding how applicants, reviewers, and grantees
should consider SABV in funding opportunities, research designs,
analyses, and reporting. NIH is directed to provide an update on
relevant activities within 90 days of enactment.
Youth Tobacco Cessation Research.—The Committee recognizes
that despite millions of youth using at least one tobacco product,
there are no FDA-approved tobacco cessation therapies for people
under 17 and few well-studied, evidence-based behavioral interven-
tions for youth tobacco use. The Committee encourages NIH to con-
tinue to support research on effective tobacco cessation modalities
for youth under age 18, including pediatric studies of the safety
and effectiveness of cessation treatments currently approved for
adults. Studies should account for the broad range of tobacco prod-
ucts used by youth, including cessation options for individuals in-
terested in quitting cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and
cigars.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $350,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 350,000,000
The Committee includes $350,000,000, the same as the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level, for Buildings and Facilities. For the fifth
time in as many years, the recommendation does not include au-
thority for NIH to transfer up to 1 percent of its research funding
to the Buildings and Facilities account. This is extraordinary au-
thority for a Federal agency and NIH has yet to provide an expla-
nation for why this mechanism would be appropriate. Funding pro-
vided for research should not be unilaterally transferred without a
sound explanation and robust justification of need. The Committee
commends the agency for continuing to develop a sound capital
planning process and for keeping the Committee informed on such
activities. These efforts have been supported by the Committee
with modifications of section 216 of this act which permit NIH to
use up to $100,000,000 of research funding for alterations and re-
pairs. The Committee directs NIH to continue to provide biannual
updates of its efforts to develop best practices and its maintenance
and construction plans for projects whose cost exceeds $5,000,000,

170
including any changes to those plans and the original baseline esti-
mates for individual projects. Finally, the Committee also directs
NIH to describe in its fiscal year 2027 and future CJs how the
projects requested in its budgets tie to its capital planning process,
including the Research Facilities Advisory Committee’s role in de-
termining which projects are selected for inclusion in the budget.
NIH INNOVATION ACCOUNT, CURES ACT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $407,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 226,000,000
The Committee provides $226,000,000 to be spent from the NIH
Innovation Account for the All of Us precision medicine initiative
and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies [BRAIN] Initiative. The Committee expects NIH
to transfer funding shortly after enactment of this act.
ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY FOR HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,500,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,500,000,000
The Committee provides $1,500,000,000 for the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency for Health [ARPA–H], the same level as fis-
cal year 2025. The Committee continues to believe ARPA–H re-
quires a different culture and mission than NIH’s other 27 Insti-
tutes and Centers. The Committee continues to direct ARPA–H to
provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on its establishment
process, hiring, and scientific priorities and progress. The Com-
mittee expects such briefings to address how ARPA–H’s activities
are designed to advance biomedical research and development and
the mission to create breakthrough technologies, as well as how to
balance long-term trans-disciplinary scientific challenges with
short-term research goals.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS].—The Committee urges
ARPA–H to support $30,000,000 in R&D programs and projects to
develop therapies, targeted therapies, and treatments for ALS and
related neurodegenerative disorders.
Autism RWDP.—Consistent with what the Committee has noted
under this heading in the Office of the Director, and because NIH
has yet to address bipartisan concerns raised with a nearly iden-
tical proposal in 2023, the Committee strongly urges ARPA–H to
pause funding any awards associated with the RWDP. Within 30
days of enactment, the Committee directs ARPA–H to brief the
Committees on Appropriations about any current or proposed
agreements to support an Autism RWDP project at NIH. Finally,
ARPA–H shall notify the Committees on Appropriations at least 30
days in advance of entering into any interagency agreement greater
than $25,000,000 from any appropriation available to ARPA–H to
any other agency or Department. Such notification shall include
the source of funding, including the applicable legislative citation,
a description of the obligation, and a justification for the transfer.
Commercialization Network.—Speeding the translation of innova-
tive health technologies to market is essential for the success of
ARPA–H. This acceleration depends on meaningful collaboration
between researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors across sectors

171
and geographic areas. The Committee applauds the efforts of the
Investor Catalyst Hub in building a robust network that ensures
relevant stakeholders in all regions of the country have a stake in
advancing the commercialization of medical discoveries and ARPA–
H’s innovative agenda. The Committee notes the important role of
funding sprints to rapidly accelerate innovation in targeted priority
areas, by delivering specialized entrepreneurial assistance, com-
mercialization and market readiness programming, and other tar-
geted services for innovators as they seek to translate critical
transformative biomedical and health breakthroughs. The Com-
mittee urges ARPA–H to provide continued funding for the Inves-
tor Catalyst Hub in fiscal year 2026.
Emerging Health Threats.—The Committee recognizes that
ARPA–H plays a unique role in the U.S. science and technology en-
terprise. Modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Agency
[DARPA] and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
Authority [BARDA] but more broadly focused on improving health
outcomes for all Americans, ARPA–H is expected to pursue trans-
formative advances in health research beyond the scope of other
public or private efforts. U.S. citizens and interests can be threat-
ened by endemic and emerging diseases in any part of the world.
The Committee urges ARPA–H to contribute in unique ways to
combating existing and emerging health threats here and abroad,
and to strengthen U.S. science and technology capacity, competi-
tiveness, and leadership.
Increase Access and Reduce Costs for Cell Therapies.—ARPA–H
is charged with accelerating better health outcomes by advancing
innovative research through high potential, high-impact biomedical
and health research. Engineered cell therapies have emerged as
revolutionary therapies to treat selected diseases and malignancies,
including colorectal cancer which is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the United States. Access to engineered
cell therapies is significantly limited because of the current tech-
nical complexities required for such personalized medicine, lengthy
wait times, and the high cost of goods per treatment. ARPA–H’s
Engineering of Immune Cells inside the Body [EMBODY] program
is designed to address those limitations through the development
of novel approaches to the manufacturing of genetically engineered
immune cells, with the goal of developing such therapies at a scale
that significantly increases access to reduce the cost of goods per
treatment. The Committee urges ARPA–H to continue its support
for the EMBODY program.
Long COVID Research.—ARPA–H is urged to invest in Long
COVID research to ensure its high-risk, high-reward research is fo-
cused on drug trials, development of biomarkers, and research that
includes Long COVID associated conditions, such as dysautonomia,
postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS], and myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS]. The Com-
mittee urges ARPA–H to coordinate with NIH on these efforts to
augment NIH’s Long COVID research portfolio. ARPA–H is also
urged to prioritize the support of R&D programs and projects that
can enable clinical trials evaluating therapies which target key
symptoms and symptom complexes associated with Long COVID
including widespread pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, brain fog,

172
dizziness, post-exertional malaise [PEM], POTS and loss of taste
and smell.
Novel Alternative Methods.—The Committee is aware that
ARPA–H’s programs, many of which encompass a wide range of
biomedical research, utilize both animal and non-animal research
methodologies. Each program is led by a Program Manager [PM]
who oversees multiple groups of performers who aim to solve the
same problem through unique approaches. Acknowledging ARPA–
H’s operational model, the Committee urges ARPA–H to require
performers to specify expected use of animals and novel alternative
methods [NAMs] in their proposals, if known. ARPA–H shall aggre-
gate this data for anticipated awards and information from the
Vertebrate Animal Section submissions (required by the Office of
Laboratory Animal Welfare) into a comprehensive annual report
that reflects the methodologies used across their programs, includ-
ing descriptions and rationale for animal models and NAMs used.
This report shall be submitted to the Committee and made publicly
available within 90 days following the conclusion of each project
year. This activity will ensure accountability and transparency
across ARPA–H, fostering ethical research practices while advanc-
ing biomedical innovation.
Public Health Interventions.—The Committee urges the agency to
consider a new program focused on a data system to aid proactive
public health interventions.
Women’s Health.—The Committee was encouraged by ARPA–H’s
announcement of the Sprint for Women’s Health, a $100,000,000
commitment in response to the White House Initiative for Women’s
Health Research to fund transformative research and development
in women’s health. The Committee urges ARPA–H to continue this
important work to address women’s health and accelerate and scale
tools, products, and platforms to improve women’s health outcomes.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
The Committee provides $7,428,917,000 for the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA]. This ap-
propriation includes $133,667,000 in transfers available under sec-
tion 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended) and
$12,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund.
SAMHSA is the public health agency responsible for supporting
mental health programs and behavioral healthcare, treatment, and
prevention services throughout the country.
The Committee continues bill language that instructs the Assist-
ant Secretary of SAMHSA and the Secretary to exempt the Mental
Health Block Grant [MHBG], the Substance Use Prevention Treat-
ment, and Recovery Services Block Grant, and the State Opioid Re-
sponse grant from being used as a source for the PHS evaluation
set-aside in fiscal year 2026.
MENTAL HEALTH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,808,546,000

988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline [988 Lifeline].—Suicide is a lead-
ing cause of death in the United States, claiming over 49,000 lives
in 2023. The Committee provides $534,618,000 for the 988 Lifeline
and Behavioral Health Crisis Services. This amount includes fund-
ing to continue to strengthen the 988 Lifeline and enable the pro-
gram to continue to respond in a timely manner to an increasing
number of contacts. The 988 Lifeline coordinates a network of inde-
pendently operated crisis centers across the United States by pro-
viding suicide prevention and crisis intervention services for indi-
viduals seeking help. The Committee requests a briefing within 90
days of enactment, and quarterly briefings thereafter, on the 988
Lifeline spend plan and related activities.
988 Performance Metrics.—The Committee directs SAMHSA to
maintain a publically available Web site, to be updated monthly,
which provides data on the total number calls, texts, and chats
routed through 988. The metrics should include the answer rate,
response time, and contact length by contact type and the total
number of contacts by service type.
988 Program Integrity.—The Committee remains concerned
about the suicide rates among youth and young adults. The Com-
mittee recognizes the vital services provided through the 988 Life-
line and the important role of State partners in suicide prevention
and behavioral health. As States establish and develop 988 pro-
grams, the Committee encourages SAMHSA to ensure States have
the flexibility to use a technology platform that allows for low wait
times and that facilitates a seamless coordination with local crisis
and emergency response teams, accommodates a connection to fol-
low-up and community resources, and ensures that sensitive user
data is being safeguarded and protected. The Committee requests
SAMHSA include information on 988 program integrity activities,
including with respect to safeguarding 988 user data and privacy,
and a review of work with States and other 988 program partners
in the 988 Lifeline spend plan briefing.
988 Lifeline Text and Chat-Based Capabilities.—The Committee
encourages SAMHSA to continue to make funding competitively
available to chat and text backup centers to provide the capacity
and infrastructure to handle contacts from vulnerable youth
through calls, chats, and texts, including efforts to improve local
text and chat answer rates. Within the total for the 988 Lifeline,
the Committee continues $10,000,000 for specialized services for
Spanish speakers seeking access to 988 services through texts or
chats. SAMHSA shall make this funding available to one or more
organizations with the capacity and experience to offer culturally
competent, Spanish language text and chat services for mental
health support and crisis intervention.
The Committee supports SAMHSA’s efforts to ensure access to
the 988 Lifeline through various forms of communication, including
phone calls, text and chat functions, and video services through

175
American Sign Language for Americans who are deaf or hard of
hearing.
Adolescent and Young Adult Awareness of the 988 Lifeline.—The
Committee encourages SAMHSA to coordinate with the relevant
Departments and young adult behavioral health stakeholders, such
as stakeholders serving secondary school and postsecondary stu-
dents, to increase adolescent and young adult awareness of 988, in-
cluding via the publication of 988 on newly-printed standard issue
student identification cards.
Specialized Services for Youth.—The Committee restores
$33,100,000 for these services and instructs SAMHSA to follow the
directives included in Senate Report 118–84.
Unified 988 Lifeline Technology.—The Committee is aware that
988 Lifeline crisis contact centers have not all implemented the
unified technology that has been developed by SAMHSA’s 988 Life-
line Network Administrator. The Committee encourages SAMHSA
to inform crisis contact centers within the network about the avail-
ability of the 988 Unified Platform and to urge these same crisis
contact centers to use this technology if there is not a State-ap-
proved unified technology platform.
Youth-to-Youth Peer Support.—The Committee recognizes that
young people are uniquely situated to provide peer support for
teens and young adults who are struggling with their mental
health. The Committee is also aware that youth-to-youth engage-
ment, when conducted by youth with professional support and
training, has proven effective at reaching young people in crisis but
is currently underused across the Nation. The Committee encour-
ages SAMHSA to ensure that the 988 Lifeline maintains appro-
priate capacity, training, and referral capabilities to support youth
who contact the Lifeline for help, including through peer services.
The Committee further encourages SAMHSA to consider
partnering with a nonprofit organization that has delivered youth-
to-youth crisis intervention and hotline services to establish contin-
uous coverage for peer support services.
Eating Disorders.—The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA
to coordinate with HRSA to create a pediatric training model for
pediatric providers for prevention, early intervention, treatment,
and ongoing support protocols for youth with or at-risk of devel-
oping an eating disorder. The Committee requests a briefing within
180 days of enactment of this act on SAMHSA’s work to support
the identification, prevention, and treatment of eating disorders, in-
cluding through a public awareness campaign.
First Responder Mental Health.—The Committee is concerned by
the significant mental and behavioral health challenges faced by
first responders due to the demanding and often traumatic nature
of their work, which results in widespread stress, burnout, and
mental health struggles. The Committee requests a briefing within
180 days of enactment of this act on the steps SAMHSA is taking
to address the mental health challenges faced by first responders.
The briefing should include an analysis about how SAMHSA can
proactively support the well-being of first responders, including
through the use of confidential, peer specialists who can offer im-
mediate emotional support, crisis intervention, resources for mental

176
health treatment, and referrals to ongoing care and peer support
networks.
Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention.—The Committee
provides $43,806,000, of which $12,000,000 is included in transfers
from the PPH Fund, for Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Preven-
tion programs, which will support the development and implemen-
tation of early intervention programs and youth suicide prevention
strategies. Additionally, the Committee includes $11,000,000 for
the Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention Resource Center.
Garrett Lee Smith Campus Suicide Prevention Grant Program.—
The Committee recognizes the importance of addressing mental
health and suicide prevention on college campuses, including at in-
stitutions of higher education that are traditionally under-
resourced. The Committee understands that campus-based student
groups that both educate and train students on primary prevention
and intervention for those at risk of experiencing mental health
and substance use disorders can be beneficial in increasing the
likelihood classmates will seek treatment. The Committee rec-
ommends SAMHSA encourage applicants to seek input from rel-
evant stakeholders, including student-serving mental health groups
on campus, to better reach students in need of support. Addition-
ally, the Committee directs SAMHSA to continue the waiver of
matching funds for minority-serving institutions and community
colleges included in the 2024 funding notice and as directed in Pub-
lic Law 118–47. This will help meet these growing needs and ad-
dress disparities in access to mental health services. The Secretary
may continue to waive such requirement with respect to an institu-
tion of higher education not covered by those definitions, if the Sec-
retary determines that extraordinary need at the institution justi-
fies the waiver.
Healthy Transitions.—The Committee includes $18,451,000 for
the Healthy Transitions program, which provides grants to States
and Tribes to improve access to mental healthcare treatment and
related support services for young people aged 16 to 25 who either
have, or are at risk of developing, a serious mental health condi-
tion.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health.—The Committee pro-
vides $15,000,000 for grants to entities such as State agencies, trib-
al communities, universities, or medical centers that are in dif-
ferent stages of developing infant and early childhood mental
health services. These entities should have the capacity to lead
partners in systems-level change, as well as in building or enhanc-
ing the basic components of such early childhood services, including
an appropriately trained workforce. Additionally, the Committee
recognizes the importance of early intervention strategies to pre-
vent the onset of mental disorders, particularly among children.
Recent research has shown that half of those who will develop
mental health disorders show symptoms by age 14. The Committee
encourages SAMHSA to work with States to support services and
activities related to infants and toddlers, such as expanding the in-
fant and early childhood mental health workforce; increasing
knowledge of infant and early childhood mental health among pro-
fessionals most connected with young children to promote positive
early mental health and early identification; strengthening systems

177
and networks for referral; and improving access to quality services
for children and families who are in need of support.
Interagency Task Force on Trauma Informed Care.—The Com-
mittee includes $2,000,000 to continue the Interagency Task Force
on Trauma-Informed Care as authorized by the SUPPORT Act
(Public Law 115–271). The Committee supports the Task Force’s
authorized activities, including the dissemination of trauma-in-
formed best practices and the promotion of such models and train-
ing strategies through all relevant grant programs. The Committee
encourages the Task Force to collaborate with the National Child
Traumatic Stress Network on these activities.
Mental Health Awareness Training.—The Committee provides
$27,963,000 to continue existing activities, including Mental Health
First Aid. Mental Health Awareness Training and Mental Health
First Aid have allowed Americans, as well as first responders, to
recognize the signs and symptoms of common mental health dis-
orders. In continuing competitive funding opportunities, SAMHSA
is directed to include as eligible grantees local law enforcement
agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical units with a
special emphasis on training for crisis de-escalation techniques.
SAMHSA is also encouraged to allow training for college students,
veterans, armed services personnel, and their family members and
broaden applicable settings for trainings to include non-educational
and non-healthcare settings where appropriate within the Mental
Health Awareness Training program. Additionally, SAMHSA is en-
couraged to prioritize grants to eligible entities that will serve
within States where there is a high prevalence of adverse childhood
experiences and youth substance use disorders.
Mental Health Crisis Response Grants.—The Committee under-
stands the significant need for crisis services in order to divert peo-
ple experiencing a mental health crisis away from the criminal jus-
tice system and into mental health treatment. The Committee in-
cludes $20,000,000 for communities to create or enhance existing
crisis response programs that may include teams of mental health
professionals, law enforcement, emergency medical technicians, and
crisis workers to provide immediate support and stabilization to
those in crisis.
Minority Fellowship Program.—The Committee includes
$11,059,000 to support grants that will increase the number of cul-
turally competent behavioral health professionals who teach, ad-
minister, conduct services research, and provide direct mental ill-
ness services for underserved minority populations. The Committee
understands the importance of increasing the pool of culturally
competent pediatric mental health professionals, including child
and adolescent psychiatrists, to address the Nation’s youth mental
health crisis. The Committee again encourages SAMHSA to
prioritize and increase the number of pediatric behavioral health
treatment providers, including child and adolescent psychiatrists,
selected to participate in the minority fellowship program.
National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.—The Committee in-
cludes $28,200,000 for suicide prevention programs. Of the total,
$26,200,000 is for the implementation of the Zero Suicide model,
which is a comprehensive, multi-setting approach to suicide pre-
vention within health systems.

178
Additionally, suicide is often more prevalent in highly rural areas
and among the American Indian and Alaskan Native populations.
According to CDC, American Indian/Alaska Natives [AI/AN] have
the highest rates of suicide of any racial or ethnic group in the
United States. In order to combat the rise in suicide rates among
this population, the Committee includes $3,400,000 for AI/AN with-
in Zero Suicide.
The Committee also notes with concern that suicide has been the
leading cause of death for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and
Pacific Islander [AANHPI] youth ages 10 through 24 in recent
years. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to examine the preva-
lence and causes of behavioral health conditions among AANHPI
youth, including by identifying ways to address this disparity and
improve access to behavioral healthcare for AANHPI youth.
Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration Grants and
Technical Assistance.—The Committee notes that one of the goals
of the Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration Grant pro-
gram is to improve patient access to bidirectional integrated care
services. The Committee provides $55,877,000 for the program to
promote full integration and collaboration in clinical practice be-
tween behavioral healthcare and primary/physical healthcare, as
well as $2,991,000 for technical assistance, and directs SAMHSA to
fund the psychiatric collaborative care model implemented by pri-
mary care physician practices as authorized under section
1301(i)(2) of division FF of Public Law 117–328. Pursuant to such
law, these technical assistance centers may be funded through co-
operative agreements.
Further, the Committee directs SAMHSA to prioritize popu-
lations with co-occurring conditions of serious mental illness or
substance use disorders, along with chronic physical conditions, in-
cluding those defined as ‘‘special populations’’ under 42 U.S.C.
290bb–42(a)(4). Finally, the Committee directs SAMHSA to coordi-
nate with HRSA to facilitate dissemination of technical information
on screening at-risk patients in integrated care models to Federally
Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics.
Project AWARE.—The Committee provides $140,001,000 for
Project AWARE. This program increases awareness of mental
health issues and connects young people who have behavioral
health concerns and their families with needed services. The Com-
mittee encourages SAMHSA to continue using funds to provide
mental health services in schools and for school-aged youth and
provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Of the amount provided for Project AWARE, the Committee di-
rects SAMHSA to use $17,500,000 for discretionary grants to sup-
port efforts in high-crime, high-poverty areas and, in particular,
communities that are seeking to address relevant impacts and root
causes of community violence and collective trauma. These grants
should maintain the same focus as fiscal year 2024 grants.
SAMHSA is encouraged to continue consultation with the Depart-
ment of Education in administration of these grants. The Com-
mittee requests a report on progress of grantees in the fiscal year
2027 CJ.
The Committee recognizes the increased need for school and com-
munity-based trauma services for children, youth, young adults,

179
and their families and the need to support school staff with train-
ing in trauma-informed practices. Within the total for Project
AWARE, the Committee directs $12,000,000 for student access to
evidence-based, culturally relevant, trauma support services and
mental healthcare through established partnerships with commu-
nity organizations as authorized by section 7134 of the SUPPORT
Act (Public Law 115–271).
Project AWARE helps Tribes and tribal organizations to develop
sustainable school-based mental health programs and services.
Within the funds made available for Project AWARE, the Com-
mittee urges SAMHSA to consider the needs of Tribes and tribal
organizations.
School-Based Mental Health Services.—The Committee under-
stands the importance of providing mental health services to stu-
dents, including through annual, school-based mental health and
well-being screenings. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
work with the Department of Education to recommend regular
screenings in public schools that use evidence-based or scientif-
ically validated screening tools routinely used in healthcare sys-
tems, including through a digital platform or application, for use by
students at public schools.
Community Mental Health Services Block Grant
The Committee provides $1,007,571,000 for the Mental Health
Block Grant. This appropriation includes $21,039,000 in transfers
available under section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as
amended).
The MHBG distributes funds to 59 eligible States and territories
through a formula based on specified economic and demographic
factors. Grant applications must include an annual plan for pro-
viding comprehensive community mental health services to adults
with a serious mental illness and children with a serious emotional
disturbance.
The Committee continues bill language requiring that at least 10
percent of the funds for the MHBG program be set aside for evi-
dence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with
early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. The
Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to include in budget jus-
tifications a detailed table showing at a minimum each State’s al-
lotment, name of the program being implemented, and a short de-
scription of the program.
Crisis Set-Aside.—The Committee continues the 5 percent set-
aside within the MHBG for States to implement evidence-based,
crisis care programs to address the needs of individuals in crisis,
including those with serious mental illnesses and children with se-
rious mental and emotional distress. The Committee directs
SAMHSA to continue to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion
of eligible States and Territories, some or all of a set of core crisis
care elements, including 24/7 mobile crisis units, local and State-
wide call centers with the capacity to respond to distressed or suici-
dal individuals, and other programs that allow the development of
systems where individuals can always receive assistance during a
crisis.

180
AI/AN.—The Committee recognizes that AI/AN populations in
the United States have higher rates of illicit drug use, opioid mis-
use, and misuse of prescription drugs compared to other racial
groups. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to consider the needs
of Indian Tribes and tribal organizations within the MHBG.
Children’s Mental Health Services
The Committee provides $130,000,000 for the Children’s Mental
Health Services program. This program provides grants and tech-
nical assistance to support comprehensive, community-based sys-
tems of care for children and adolescents with serious emotional,
behavioral, or mental disorders. Grantees must provide matching
funds and services must be coordinated with the educational, juve-
nile justice, child welfare, and primary healthcare systems. The
Committee continues to include a 10 percent set-aside for an early
intervention demonstration program with persons not more than
25 years of age at clinical high risk of developing a first-episode
psychosis.
Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness [PATH]
The Committee provides $66,635,000 for PATH, which addresses
the needs of individuals with serious mental illness who are experi-
encing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness. Funds are used
to provide an array of services, such as screening and diagnostic
services, emergency assistance, case management, and referrals to
the most appropriate housing environment.
Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness
[PAIMI]
The Committee provides $40,000,000 for PAIMI. This program
helps ensure that the rights of mentally ill individuals are pro-
tected while they are patients in all public and private facilities or
while they are living in the community, including in their own
homes. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula based
on population and relative per capita incomes.
National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative
The Committee provides $98,887,000 for the National Child
Traumatic Stress Initiative, which develops and promotes effective
treatment and services for children and adolescents exposed to a
wide array of traumatic events.
The Committee supports the National Child Traumatic Stress
Network [NCTSN] for building, evaluating, disseminating, and de-
livering evidence-based best practices, including through univer-
sities, hospitals, and front-line providers, to prevent and mitigate
the impact of exposure to trauma among children and families. The
Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure the network maintains its
focus on collaboration, data collection, and the provision of direct
services, and that the NCTSN mission or grant opportunities not
be limited to training only.

181
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics [CCBHC]
The Committee includes $385,500,000 for the CCBHC expansion
program, which allows communities to improve access to mental
health and substance use disorder treatment services.
The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to prioritize re-
sources to entities within States that are able to quickly stand-up
a CCBHC, including those part of the demonstration authorized by
section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014
[PAMA] (Public Law 113–93).
Accreditation.—The Committee urges SAMHSA to examine and
approve accreditation products that certify CCBHCs in having met
requirements as established by SAMHSA. CCBHC grantees should
receive independent accreditation from an approved entity as part
of participation under this program. Funding included under this
program is permitted for grantees’ use to obtain any such required
independent accreditation in lieu of self-attestation for meeting the
CCBHC requirements as a part of reducing paperwork and admin-
istrative burden, and SAMHSA shall consider the costs of accredi-
tation when establishing funding levels for clinics under this grant.
The Committee further permits SAMHSA to use funds under this
program to establish the accreditation process and expand the au-
diences eligible to receive training and technical assistance, to in-
clude (but not limited to) demonstration CCBHCs and CCBHCs
participating in a State-led implementation effort under a Medicaid
State Plan Amendment, waiver, or other Medicaid authority.
Data Infrastructure.—The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
develop a CCBHC data infrastructure and data repository program
while establishing a data reporting partnership with at least one
State currently operating a Statewide CCBHC network. With more
than 500 CCBHCs operating in 46 States, it is incumbent upon the
agency to assure a high level of accountability in concert with ex-
panded access to intensive community-based services for persons
with serious mental illness and substance use disorders. Within 90
days of enactment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing
from SAMHSA on opportunities to undertake this project using the
funds provided.
Integrated Care.—The Committee recognizes that individuals liv-
ing with serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders face
higher risks for developing chronic physical conditions commonly
associated with long-term use of certain mental health medications,
including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and medication-induced
movement disorders. The Committee provides $500,000 to expand
technical assistance to improve integrated care through the
CCBHC State Technical Assistance Center and the CCBHC Expan-
sion Grantee National Training and Technical Assistance Center.
This technical assistance and training will enhance routine screen-
ing, prevention, and early intervention for physical health condi-
tions commonly associated with long-term use of antipsychotic
medications.
Eligible Audiences.—In alignment with the President’s budget re-
quest, the Committee affirms that funding under this line may be
used to support CCBHC technical assistance for CCBHC expansion
grant recipients, State CCBHCs outside of the expansion program,
States in the CCBHC Demonstration program, States planning to

182
be part of the Demonstration, States with CCBHC programs inde-
pendent of the Demonstration, and States considering adopting the
CCBHC model.
Planning Grants.—The Committee permits SAMHSA to use
funds under this program for cooperative agreements for CCBHC
State planning grants, authorized by section 223(c) of PAMA (Pub-
lic Law 113–93), to support States in developing and implementing
certification systems for CCBHCs, establish Prospective Payment
Systems for Medicaid reimbursable behavioral health services, and
prepare an application to participate in a 4-year CCBHC Dem-
onstration program.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,159,298,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,184,298,000
The Committee provides $4,184,298,000 for substance use dis-
order services and treatment programs, including PRNS and the
substance use prevention and treatment block grant to the States.
The Committee includes $81,200,000 in transfers available under
section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended).
Programs of Regional and National Significance
The Committee provides $561,219,000 for PRNS within the Cen-
ter for Substance Abuse Treatment. The Committee includes
$2,000,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act
(Public Law 78–410 as amended).
PRNS include activities to increase capacity by implementing
service improvements using proven evidence-based approaches, as
well as science-to-services activities that promote the identification
of practices thought to have potential for broad service improve-
ment.
Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:

Building Communities of Recovery and Peer Support Networks.—
The Committee urges SAMHSA to promote the expansion of recov-
ery support services and to reduce stigma associated with sub-
stance use disorders. The Committee recognizes the coordinated ef-
forts of this program to connect people in recovery to a wide array
of community resources, including housing services, primary care,
employment resources, among others, and urges the program to ex-
pand its reach to others in need of support. To further support
these recovery community organizations, the Committee continues
$2,000,000 for the National Peer Run Training and Technical As-
sistance Center to provide addiction recovery support to peer net-
works and recovery communities.
Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers.—The Committee in-
cludes $7,000,000, to help ensure that people with substance use
disorders can access proper treatment, as authorized by section
7121 of the SUPPORT Act.
Drug Courts.—The Committee provides $74,000,000 for Drug
Courts. The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to ensure that
all funding for drug treatment activities is allocated to serve people
diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their primary condition.
SAMHSA is further directed to ensure that all drug court recipi-
ents work with the corresponding State alcohol and drug agency in
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the grant. The
Committee further directs SAMHSA to expand training and tech-
nical assistance to drug treatment court grant recipients to ensure
evidence-based practices are fully implemented.
Emergency Department Alternatives to Opioids.—The Committee
includes $8,000,000 to award grants to hospitals and emergency de-
partments to develop, implement, enhance, or study alternatives to
opioids for pain management in such settings as authorized in sec-
tion 7091 of the SUPPORT Act.
First Responder Training.—The Committee provides $59,000,000
for First Responder Training grants. Of this amount, $34,000,000
is set aside for rural communities with high rates of substance use.
In addition, $13,500,000 of this funding is provided to make awards
through a new award competition to rural public and non-profit fire
and EMS agencies to train and recruit staff, provide education, and
purchase equipment (including medications such as naloxone and
protective equipment) as recently reauthorized in the Supporting
and Improving Rural EMS Needs Reauthorization Act (Public Law
118–84). The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure funding is for
new awardees and allows awards in amounts less than the max-
imum award amount to ensure nationwide funding.
Grants to Prevent Prescription Drugs/Opioid Overdoses.—The
Committee recognizes that the number of young Americans dying
due to opioid overdose is rising. The Committee acknowledges the
existing Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdoses pro-

184
gram and encourages the Secretary to expand eligibility to provide
schools access to this program for training and for opioid overdose
reversal agents, such as naloxone.
Medication-Assisted Treatment.—The Committee includes
$111,000,000 for medication-assisted treatment, of which
$14,500,000 is for grants to Indian Tribes, tribal organizations, or
consortia. These grants should target States with the highest age
adjusted rates of admissions, including those that have dem-
onstrated a dramatic age-adjusted increase in admissions for the
treatment of opioid use disorders. The Committee continues to di-
rect the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to ensure that
these grants include as an allowable use the support of medication-
assisted treatment and other clinically appropriate services to
achieve and maintain abstinence from all opioids, including pro-
grams that offer low-barrier or same day treatment options.
Medications for Opioid Use Disorder.—The Committee urges
SAMHSA to include as an allowable use of funds all FDA approved
medications for opioid use disorder and overdose reversal and other
clinically appropriate services to treat opioid use disorder.
Minority Fellowship Program.—The Committee includes
$7,136,000 to support grants that will increase the number of cul-
turally competent behavioral health professionals who teach, ad-
minister, conduct services research, and provide direct substance
use disorder treatment services for minority populations that are
underserved.
Opioid Treatment Program and Regulatory Activities.—The Com-
mittee is aware of the important work conducted by the Division
of Pharmacologic Therapies [DPT] to facilitate the use of medica-
tions for opioid use disorders in combination with other evidence-
based treatment and recovery support services. The Committee is
also aware of the important role State alcohol and drug agencies
play in leading this work at the State level. Therefore, the Com-
mittee urges CSAT/DPT to coordinate consistently with State alco-
hol and drug agencies across DPT’s portfolio to ensure maximum
efficiency and effectiveness.
Opioid Use Disorder Recurrence.—The Committee is concerned
that relapse following withdrawal management from opioids is a
contributing factor to the overdose crisis. The Committee appre-
ciates SAMHSA’s efforts to address this within the Federal grant
population by emphasizing the potential benefits of withdrawal
management for opioid use disorder followed by medication to pre-
vent recurrence and encourages SAMHSA to disseminate and im-
plement this policy in all settings where withdrawal management
is offered, including opioid treatment programs, rehabilitation cen-
ters, and criminal justice settings.
Opioid Use in Rural Communities.—The Committee is aware
that response to the opioid use disorder crisis continues to pose
unique challenges for rural America. Rural areas can struggle with
limited access to care and there is a shortage of health profes-
sionals necessary for identifying, diagnosing, and treating patients
with substance use disorders, as well as assisting individuals in re-
covery. As a result, responding to the opioid crisis in rural America
requires a comprehensive approach, which may involve: an inte-
grated approach to care; collaboration when appropriate with pa-

185
tients and their families; involvement of community partners and
institutions; advancing competency and skills development for
healthcare providers treating people with substance use disorders;
training to provide care in a culturally responsive manner; and the
use of technologies to ensure improved access to medically under-
served areas through the use of telehealth and the addition of
treatment programs where feasible. The Committee encourages
SAMHSA to support initiatives to advance these objectives, specifi-
cally focusing on addressing the needs of individuals with sub-
stance use disorders in rural and medically-underserved areas, as
well as programs that emphasize a comprehensive community-
based approach involving academic institutions, healthcare pro-
viders, and local criminal justice systems.
Pregnant and Postpartum Women Program.—The Committee in-
cludes $38,931,000 for the Pregnant and Postpartum Women pro-
gram, which uses a family-centered approach to provide com-
prehensive residential substance use disorder treatment services
for pregnant and postpartum women, their minor children, and
other family members. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
prioritize States that support best-practice collaborative models for
the treatment and support of pregnant women with opioid use dis-
orders.
Substance Use Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to
Treatment [SBIRT].—The Committee understands that substance
use disorders, including opioid use, typically begin in adolescence,
and that preventing early substance use is an effective strategy to
prevent problems later in life. The Committee is also aware that
SBIRT has been shown to be a cost-effective model for reducing
and preventing underage drinking and other substance use but
that many health providers, especially pediatricians and those in
underserved communities, have not been trained to use the method
effectively. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to use funds for
the adoption of SBIRT protocols in primary care and other appro-
priate settings that serve youth 12 to 21 years of age, as well as
for the adoption of system-level approaches to facilitate the uptake
of SBIRT into routine healthcare visits for adults.
Treatment Assistance for Localities.—The Committee recognizes
the use of peer recovery specialists and mutual aid recovery pro-
grams that support medication-assisted treatment and directs
SAMHSA to support evidence-based, self-empowering, mutual aid
recovery support programs that expressly support medications for
substance use disorder treatment in its grant programs.
Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support.—The Committee
includes $12,000,000 for SAMHSA to continue implementation of
section 7183 of the SUPPORT Act. Additionally, the Committee en-
courages SAMHSA to review the workforce categories eligible for
funding under the Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support
Grant and report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment
of this act on the percentage of current funding allocated to the de-
velopment and training of substance use disorder providers. Sub-
stance use disorder counselors serve a critical role in supporting in-
dividuals as they go through treatment, counseling, case manage-
ment, and other recovery-oriented services. The Committee encour-
ages SAMHSA to review of the eligible workforce categories under

186
this grant and include substance use disorder counselors where ap-
propriate in order to further assist communities in their ability to
grow the workforce pipeline and ultimately increase access to these
services.
Women’s Addiction Services Leadership Institute.—The Com-
mittee is aware that CSAT implemented for 10 years an important
workforce development initiative known as the Women’s Addiction
Services Leadership Institute [WASLI]. The program, which ended
in 2018 due to insufficient funding, strengthened the capacity of
emerging leaders to meet the needs of women with substance use
disorders by developing participants’ leadership skills and creating
a network of the next generation of leaders in women’s addiction
services. A total of 112 emerging leaders graduated from WASLI
and 56 coaches received training in executive coaching. The Com-
mittee supports reinstating WASLI within the Addiction Tech-
nology Transfer Centers in order to close a significant gap in Fed-
eral support to strengthen and retain the women’s substance use
disorder services workforce.
State Opioid Response [SOR] Grants
The Committee provides $1,595,000,000 for grants to States to
address the opioid crisis. Bill language provides not less than 4
percent for grants to Indian Tribes or tribal organizations. The
Committee supports the 15 percent set-aside for States with the
highest age-adjusted mortality rate related to substance use dis-
orders, as authorized in Public Law 117–328. The Assistant Sec-
retary is encouraged to apply a weighted formula within the set-
aside based on State ordinal ranking. Activities funded with this
grant may include treatment, prevention, and recovery support
services. The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to conduct a
yearly evaluation of the program to be transmitted to the Commit-
tees no later than 180 days after enactment of this act. SAMHSA
is directed to make such evaluation publicly available on
SAMHSA’s Web site. The Committee further directs SAMHSA to
continue funding technical assistance within the administrative
portion of the appropriated amounts for the SOR grants, to provide
locally based technical assistance teams as has been done through
the Opioid Response Network. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance and essential work currently being done by the Opioid Re-
sponse Network in delivering technical assistance to State and Ter-
ritory SOR grantees, sub-recipients, and others addressing opioid
use disorder and stimulant use disorder in their communities.
SOR Formula Data.—The Committee remains concerned that the
fatal overdose data used in determining the 15 percent set aside re-
flects all drug poisoning deaths, which does not accurately identify
rates of total overdoses from opioids, including fentanyl. The Com-
mittee urges the Assistant Secretary to consider using data per-
taining to opioid-specific drug overdoses.
SOR Funding Cliffs.—The Committee continues to direct
SAMHSA to avoid significant funding cliffs between States with
similar opioid mortality data and to prevent unusually large
changes in a State’s SOR allocation when compared to the prior
year’s allocation. The Committee acknowledges SAMHSA’s work to
avoid cliffs in recent funding cycles, for instance, by expanding the

187
number of States that are eligible for the 15 percent set aside.
SAMHSA shall submit to the Committees a work plan of the pro-
posed allocation of funds not later than 30 days prior to awarding
grants.
Rural Opioid Technical Assistance Regional Centers [ROTA–R]
Cooperative Agreements.—The Committee directs SAMHSA to
maintain funding for the 10 cooperative agreements under the
ROTA–R program at not less than the fiscal year 2024 level with-
out consolidation of the program.
Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services
[SUPTRS] Block Grant
The Committee provides $2,028,079,000 for the SUPTRS Block
Grant. This appropriation includes $79,200,000 in transfers avail-
able under section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law 78–410 as
amended).
The Committee recognizes the importance of the block grant
given its flexibility to allow States to direct resources to address
the most pressing needs. This funding stream is also critical in as-
sisting States to address all substance use disorders, including, but
not limited to, those related to alcohol, cocaine, and methamphet-
amine. In addition, States may use SUPTRS Block Grant funds to
support medications and recovery support for the treatment of alco-
hol use and other substance use disorders, including to support
peer recovery housing. The Committee also notes the importance of
the block grant’s 20 percent prevention set-aside, which is a vital
source of primary prevention funding. The block grant provides
funds to States to support alcohol and drug use prevention, treat-
ment, and rehabilitation services. Funds are allocated to States ac-
cording to a formula.
Funding Flexibilities.—To address the growing need for sub-
stance use disorder prevention and treatment, States, Territories,
and their communities have been developing innovative ways to en-
gage the millions of people with substance use disorders to access
treatment services. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to imple-
ment funding flexibilities that enables States, Territories, and their
communities the ability to roll over unused SUPTRS dollars, allow-
ing for these innovative programs to continue after they have been
implemented.
Synar Compliance.—The Synar program monitors and enforces
the prohibition on the sale or distribution of tobacco products to mi-
nors by requiring States to conduct random, unannounced inspec-
tions of tobacco retailers to prevent underage purchasing. The
Committee notes that under the new Federal Tobacco 21 law,
States that are out of compliance with Synar risk a 10 percent re-
duction in their SUPTRS Block Grant allocation. The Committee
recognizes the role of Synar implementation under Tobacco 21 to
increase tobacco retailer inspections, conduct retailer education,
and recruit additional personnel to fulfill this public health obliga-
tion.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $236,879,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 236,879,000

188
The Committee provides $236,879,000 for the Center for Sub-
stance Abuse Prevention [CSAP], the sole Federal organization
with responsibility for improving accessibility and quality of sub-
stance use prevention services.
The Committee continues to instruct SAMHSA to ensure that all
the funding provided to CSAP, as well as the 20 percent prevention
set aside in the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recov-
ery Services Block Grant, be used only for evidence-based sub-
stance use prevention activities.
Programs of Regional and National Significance
The Committee provides $236,879,000 for PRNS within CSAP.
These programs support the development of new practice knowl-
edge on substance use prevention; identification of proven effective
models; dissemination of science-based intervention information;
State and community capacity building for implementation of prov-
en, effective substance use prevention programs; and programs ad-
dressing new needs in the prevention system.
Within the total provided for PRNS, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:

Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Prevention of Under-
age Drinking [ICCPUD].—The Committee understands ICCPUD
funding has been used for activities that fall outside its authoriza-
tion as specified in Public Law 109–422. The funding provided in
this act for ICCPUD shall only be used for the purpose of pre-
venting or reducing underage drinking and not for any other pur-
pose.
Minority Fellowship Program Support for Prevention Work-
force.—The Committee directs SAMHSA to award $1,321,000 in
Minority Fellowship Program funds to support a separate preven-
tion fellowship program that will increase the number of culturally
competent prevention specialists to help expand prevention pro-
gramming for underserved minority populations.
Prevention Technology Transfer Centers [PTTC] Network.—The
Committee supports the work of the PTTC Network and efforts re-
lated to certified prevention specialists and the Prevention Fellow-
ship program. This program supported 16 early career prevention
fellows throughout each HHS region where they gained hands on
experience working in State alcohol and drug agencies. Fellows,

189
coached by mentors, developed leadership skills; received training
in professional development; acquired proficiency in core com-
petencies to prepare for certified prevention specialist exams; and
prepared for employment opportunities in the substance use pre-
vention field.
Strategic Prevention Framework.—The Committee provides
$135,484,000 for the Strategic Prevention Framework. Within the
total provided, $125,484,000 is for the Strategic Prevention Frame-
work-Partnerships for Success program, and $10,000,000 is for
Strategic Prevention Framework-Rx. The Strategic Prevention
Framework is designed to prevent the onset of substance misuse
while strengthening prevention capacity and infrastructure at the
State, community, and tribal levels. The Committee recognizes that
substance use prevention is underutilized relative to its ability to
prevent and delay substance use initiation, as well as slow the
pathways to addiction and overdose, and that demand for commu-
nity-based primary prevention resources far outpaces available
funding.
Sober Truth on Preventing [STOP] Underage Drinking Act.—The
Committee provides $14,500,000 for the STOP Act. Of this funding,
$11,000,000 is for community-based coalition enhancement grants,
$2,500,000 is for the National media campaign, and $1,000,000 is
for the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of
Underage Drinking.
Tribal Behavioral Health Grants.—SAMHSA has administered
Tribal Behavioral Health Grants for mental health and substance
use prevention and treatment for Tribes and tribal organizations
since fiscal year 2014. In light of the continued growth of this pro-
gram, as well as the urgent need among tribal populations, the
Committee continues to urge the Assistant Secretary for SAMHSA
to engage with Tribes on ways to maximize participation in this
program.
HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $169.583,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 207,294,000
The Committee provides $207,294,000 for Health Surveillance
and Program Support activities. The Committee includes
$31,428,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS
Act (Public Law 78–410 as amended).
This activity supports Federal staff and the administrative func-
tions of the agency. It also provides funding to SAMHSA’s surveil-
lance and data collection activities, including national surveys such
as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Within the total provided for Health Surveillance and Program

Block Grant Reporting Requirements.—The Committee acknowl-
edges the important role of the Community Mental Health Services
and Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services
Block Grants in supporting States’ efforts to provide resources for
expanded mental health and substance use disorder treatment and
prevention services. The Committee reiterates the request for a re-
port, as included in Public Law 118–47, regarding the lack of trans-
parency and information that is provided to Congress and the pub-
lic about how States are distributing those funds and for what pro-
grams or services they are being used.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—Within the funds included
in this account, $54,611,000 are for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending Items’’ at the end of this Committee Report.
Drug Abuse Warning Network.—The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for the Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN]. Au-
thorized by the 21st Century Cures Act, DAWN is a surveillance
system to monitor emergency department visits in order to help
public health workers, policy makers, and other stakeholders re-
spond effectively to emerging substance use trends.
Health Information Technology.—The Committee understands
that adoption of health information technology [health IT] among
behavioral health providers currently lags behind that of other pro-
vider types and recognizes the benefits of advancing health IT in
behavioral healthcare settings. The Committee supports the efforts
of the Behavioral Health Information Technology Initiative to pilot
the inclusion of behavioral health data elements in health IT with-
in the SUPTRS and Mental Health block grants. The Committee
encourages SAMHSA to explore providing States with flexibility
within the block grant administrative cap to pursue the additional
incorporation of health IT.
National Survey on Drug Use and Health [NSDUH].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of the NSDUH for providing crit-
ical data to inform best practices and public policy on mental
health and substance use. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to
continue collecting this data and analyzing trends for high-risk
populations.
Program Support.—The Committee includes $67,600,000 for pro-
gram support, to ensure SAMHSA has the resources and staff to
further its mission.
AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $369,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 345,380,000
The Committee provides $345,380,000 for the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ]. This funding is com-
bined with $133,000,000 in mandatory funding from the Patient-
Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. AHRQ’s mission is to en-

191
hance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health
services, as well as access to such services. AHRQ conducts, sup-
ports, and disseminates scientific and policy-relevant research on
topics, such as promoting high-quality care and patient safety,
eliminating healthcare disparities, using information technology,
and evaluating the effectiveness of clinical services.

HEALTH COSTS, QUALITY, AND OUTCOMES
Health costs, quality, and outcomes [HCQO] research activity is
focused on improving clinical practice, strengthening the healthcare
system’s capacity to deliver quality care, and tracking progress to-
ward health goals through monitoring and evaluation.
Within the total provided for HCQO, the Committee includes
funding for the following activities:
Center for Primary Care Research.—The Committee includes no
less than $2,000,000 for the Center for Primary Care Research au-
thorized by 42 U.S.C. 299b–4(b). The Center supports clinical pri-
mary care research, as well as strategies to improve primary care
delivery and advance the development of primary care researchers.
The Committee supports efforts to coordinate research in areas
such as multiple chronic conditions, symptom syndromes such as
Long COVID, behavioral and social health integration, telehealth
in primary care, shared decision-making, and patient experience of
care. The areas of focus should include, but not be limited to, ex-
panding research on persons with multiple co-morbid conditions
and improving primary care in rural and underserved areas and
health equity.
Improving Maternal Health.—The Committee continues to sup-
port AHRQ efforts to address the complex challenges of ensuring
safe and healthy pregnancies and childbirth, particularly for under-
served women who are at substantially higher risk of complication
and death.
Long COVID.—The extensive incidence of individuals suffering
from Long COVID (post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV–2 infection
[PASC]) presents an ongoing challenge to the healthcare system,
patients, and their caregivers. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $10,000,000 to continue the work of the Long COVID Cen-
ters of Excellence and the Long COVID Care Network. The Com-
mittee continues to direct AHRQ to coordinate these efforts with
other federally funded Long COVID research initiatives and to en-
courage robust data collection and data sharing efforts among
agencies and grantees.
Menopause Research.—The Committee provides $5,000,000 for a
Menopause Research to Action Network to scale and accelerate ex-

192
isting and emerging research evidence and care delivery models
into routine clinical practice. The Network shall focus on improving
treatment and management of perimenopause and menopausal
symptoms, as well as related chronic conditions to help improve
mid-life health outcomes among women. In doing so, the Com-
mittee directs AHRQ to: (1) prioritize projects that propose scaling
up evidence-based interventions that have demonstrated potential
for improving care delivery and outcomes; (2) ensure the Network
has the capability to collect and disseminate new findings and best
practices widely, including to rural and underserved areas; and (3)
coordinate these efforts with other Federal healthcare agencies.
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease
[MASLD].—The Committee acknowledges the public health burden
of MASLD and values having a comprehensive understanding of
MASLD. Therefore, the Committee encourages AHRQ, in collabora-
tion with other relevant Federal agency stakeholders, to evaluate
the prevalence, diagnoses, treatments, and complications associated
with MASLD. The Committee requests that such study: (1) assess
the prevalence of MASLD in the United States; (2) assess the costs
associated with individuals diagnosed with MASLD, including the
costs to patients, families, and government programs; (3) assess the
costs and impact on patients and the healthcare system if MASLD
is unaddressed and progresses to metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatohepatitis [MASH], liver failure, poor liver function, or liver
transplant; (4) identify and address barriers to preventing, diag-
nosing, and treating MASLD and MASH; and (5) include an anal-
ysis of any disparities in access to care and other outcomes, such
as health status, among minority populations. The Committee re-
quests that AHRQ provide an interim report on the findings of this
study in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Opioid Research.—The Committee supports AHRQ’s continued
research regarding opioid and substance use disorders, including
efforts focused on management of substance use disorders in pri-
mary care settings.
Patient Safety Data Platform.—The Committee continues to sup-
port AHRQ’s research to address failures in the diagnostic process
and to support continuing and new research to: (1) understand why
diagnostic adverse events occur; and (2) develop interventions, sys-
tems, measures, and new technology solutions to improve diag-
nostic safety and quality. Further, the Committee includes no less
than $4,000,000 to support an accessible Web based, evidence-
based patient safety data platform that provides a comprehensive
compendium of the most up-to-date information on best practices
and evidence-based protocols, research, case studies, and other re-
ports that contribute to improving patient outcomes and strength-
ening health system safety. The platform should be designed to
capture best practices and other relevant information across all
care settings, including out-patient settings and home healthcare,
and should include content that is specifically designed for patients
and their caregivers that is available in a format they can easily
access and understand.

193
United States Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF]
The Committee recommends $11,542,000 for the United States
Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], which works to improve
the health of people nationwide by making evidence-based rec-
ommendations about clinical preventive services. The USPSTF is
comprised of independent national experts in preventive medicine
and primary care who volunteer to serve the public interest. The
Committee directs the members of the USPSTF to continue to up-
hold their mission and commitment to scientific evidence, trans-
parency, and ensuring that Americans have access to affordable
preventive health services supported by a preponderance of sci-
entific evidence.
Medical Innovations.—The Committee continues to note concern
with the USPSTF’s ability to keep pace with medical innovation.
Emerging and innovative screening modalities can further public
health for all Americans and address health inequities by improv-
ing timely access to and compliance with USPSTF-recommended
screenings. The Committee continues to encourage the USPSTF to
utilize the Early Topic Update process described in the USPSTF
procedure manual to review a recommendation on an enhanced
timeframe upon a showing of new evidence. The Committee also
continues to urge the USPSTF to prioritize review of any new
screening test or preventive medication approved or cleared by the
FDA that is a preventive strategy or modality pertaining to, but
not included in, a previous USPSTF recommendation.
Evidence Reviews.—The Committee notes the increasingly com-
plex nature of evidence reviews for recommendations and appre-
ciates AHRQ’s prioritizing this activity within the funds provided.
MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEYS
The Committee provides $72,791,000 for Medical Expenditure
Panel Surveys [MEPS], which collect detailed information annually
from households, healthcare providers, and employers regarding
how Americans use and pay for healthcare. The data from MEPS
are used to develop estimates of healthcare utilization, expendi-
tures, sources of payment, and the degree of health insurance cov-
erage of the U.S. population.
PROGRAM SUPPORT
The Committee provides $58,480,000 for program support. This
activity funds the overall management of AHRQ, including sala-
ries, benefits, and overhead costs.
Agency Activities.—The Committee recognizes the vital role that
AHRQ plays in supporting research that informs and improves the
quality of healthcare for all Americans. The Committee encourages
the Administration to continue funding key activities to the benefit
of patients, health systems, the research enterprise, and other
stakeholders. Within 30 days of enactment and every 30 days
thereafter, AHRQ is directed to provide a monthly briefing to the
Committee on Appropriations regarding agency activities to im-
prove clinical practice and patient safety. The Committee directs
AHRQ to provide 48 hours advance notification of any significant

194
developments and public meetings, including meeting cancellations
or disbandments, related to the activities of the USPSTF.
CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES
GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAID
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................$383,609,399,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 508,148,791,000
The Committee provides $508,148,791,000 in mandatory funding
for Grants to States for Medicaid.
The fiscal year 2026 funding level excludes $261,063,820,000 in
fiscal year 2025 advance appropriations for fiscal year 2026. As re-
quested by the administration, $316,514,725,000 is provided for the
first quarter of fiscal year 2027.
The Medicaid program provides medical care for eligible low-in-
come individuals and families. It is administered by each of the 50
States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Federal
funds for medical assistance are made available to the States ac-
cording to a formula that determines the appropriate Federal
matching rate for State program costs. This matching rate is based
on the State’s average per capita income relative to the National
average and cannot be less than 50 percent.
PAYMENTS TO HEALTHCARE TRUST FUNDS
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................$521,757,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 593,817,000,000
The Committee provides $593,817,000,000 in mandatory funding
for payments to healthcare trust funds.
This entitlement account includes the general fund subsidy to
the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for
Medicare Part B benefits and for Medicare Part D drug benefits
and administration, plus other reimbursements to the Federal Hos-
pital Insurance Trust Fund for Part A benefits and related admin-
istrative costs that have not been financed by payroll taxes or pre-
mium contributions.
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,669,744,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,669,744,000
The Committee provides $3,669,744,000 for CMS program man-
agement, which includes funding for research and evaluations, pro-
gram operations and demonstrations, survey and certification pro-
grams, and Federal administration.
Program Operations
The Committee provides $2,479,823,000 for the Program Oper-
ations account, which covers a broad range of activities including
claims processing and program safeguard activities performed by
Medicare contractors. These contractors also provide information,
guidance, and technical support to both providers and beneficiaries.
Affordable Care Act Notifications.—The Committee continues bill
language requiring the administration to provide detailed enroll-

195
ment figures to the Committees on Appropriations not less than
two full business days before any public release of the information.
Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostics.—The Committee is encouraged
by innovations in diagnostic tools along with treatments for the un-
derlying biology of Alzheimer’s disease and some of its most serious
symptoms. The Committee urges CMS to help facilitate timely and
equitable beneficiary access to these diagnostic tools and services
and encourages continued collaboration between CMS and other
Federal agencies in their collective efforts to shift the standard of
care towards timely and accurate detection and diagnosis.
Alzheimer’s Disease Therapies.—The Committee continues to ex-
press disappointment with CMS’s decision to limit coverage of
FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alz-
heimer’s disease. The Committee urges CMS to reconsider the Na-
tional Coverage Determination policy to provide full access for
Medicare beneficiaries to these FDA-approved Alzheimer’s treat-
ments.
Biology Guided Radiation Therapy [BGRT].—The Committee rec-
ognizes CMS’s efforts to facilitate access to BGRT services but
notes that there are concerns regarding inadequate payment for
BGRT. The Committee encourages CMS to continue to collect ro-
bust claims data and work with stakeholders to establish appro-
priate and sufficient pricing for these services.
Biosimilars.—The Committee notes concerns about the lack of ac-
cess to lower cost biosimilars for Medicare Part D enrollees, includ-
ing the prevalence of formulary exclusions of lower priced
biosimilars and the application of step therapy by some plans. The
Committee notes the potential savings for patients and taxpayers
through swift inclusion of biosimilars on Medicare Part D
formularies. The Committee therefore urges CMS to examine exist-
ing barriers to biosimilar adoption, including Part D and Medicare
Advantage plan practices that impede access to lower priced prod-
ucts. CMS should also provide beneficiary focused education on the
availability of biosimilars on Medicare Plan Finder and real-time
benefit tools, as well as ensure guidance and regulations for Part
D formulary development and design appropriately encourage the
adoption of biosimilars with lower list prices. The Committee di-
rects CMS to make legislative recommendations in the fiscal year
2027 CJ on how Congress could address Part D plan practices that
currently impede access to lower priced products and how to im-
prove patient savings through a greater utilization of biosimilars.
Birthing Friendly Hospitals.—The Committee recognizes the
Birthing Friendly hospital designation as the first ever designation
to describe high quality maternity care and notes the importance
of assisting consumers in choosing hospitals that have dem-
onstrated a commitment to maternal health through the implemen-
tation of best practices that advance healthcare quality, safety, and
access for pregnant and postpartum patients. Within 60 days of en-
actment of this act, the Committee directs CMS to provide a brief-
ing on how the agency will support hospitals and health systems
in earning the designation, update criteria as needed, and addi-
tional steps CMS is taking to address maternal health outcomes
and improve patient care.

196
Breast Cancer Diagnostic Coverage.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of early screening and diagnostic tests for a number
of diseases, including breast cancer, which can be treated success-
fully if caught early. Under current law, health plans and health
insurance are required to provide no-cost coverage for breast cancer
screenings, but not diagnostic testing. The Committee encourages
CMS to evaluate ways to ensure that women have access to ap-
proved diagnostic tests to promote accuracy in diagnoses, lower
treatment costs, and support better outcomes.
Cardiovascular Disease [CVD].—The Committee recognizes that
one in three adults in the United States received care for a cardio-
vascular risk factor or condition in 2023 and that existing research
indicates that elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL–C]
levels can cause atherosclerotic CVD, which can lead to heart at-
tack or stroke. The Committee urges CMS to examine the impact
of adding a quality measure of appropriate LDL–C testing as part
of its Universal Foundation initiative.
Chronic Disease Management.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of coordinated and innovative strategies to address the
prevalence of chronic disease in the United States, as approxi-
mately 40 percent of Americans have multiple chronic conditions.
Despite efforts to increase awareness of certain chronic conditions,
including heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD], the Committee recognizes concerns that many primary
care clinicians lack the support and resources to provide effective
disease management. No later than 180 days after the enactment
of this act, the Committee directs CMS to provide a report on its
actions to increase beneficiary access to chronic disease manage-
ment, inform providers about available resources and payment for
chronic care management services, and identify gaps in current
quality measurement programs to support greater participation in
these programs. Further, the Committee encourages CMS to de-
velop service delivery models to increase access to high quality
chronic disease management, including COPD care.
Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD].—The Committee notes that Medi-
care spends nearly 25 percent of its annual budget on beneficiaries
with a kidney disease diagnosis. The Committee encourages CMS
to work to promote access to early screenings, testing, and diag-
nosis for individuals at high-risk for developing CKD, including fo-
cused efforts on reaching individuals who have developed CKD but
have not yet reached end-stage renal disease.
Coding Intensity.—The Committee notes that Medicare Advan-
tage [MA] payments are risk-adjusted to provide sufficient re-
sources to deliver comprehensive care for individuals with complex
health needs. CMS applies the intensity adjustment equally to all
MA health plans, regardless of the variance in coding intensity
that exists. The Committee encourages CMS to work with Congress
and relevant stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of imple-
menting reforms to coding intensity adjustments that have the po-
tential to enhance payment accuracy and protect patient access.
Cognitive Impairment.—The Committee directs CMS to include a
report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ identifying actions the agency can
take, within existing authorities, to improve early detection of mild
cognitive impairment [MCI] as part of the Medicare Annual

197
Wellness Visit [AWV] and the annual Initial Preventive Physical
Exam [IPPE]. This review should include opportunities to improve
early detection of MCI during the AWV and IPPE by ensuring the
use of evidence-based, reliable, cognitive impairment detection tools
identified by the National Institute on Aging.
Colorectal Cancer Screenings.—The Committee appreciates
CMS’s efforts to reduce barriers to colorectal cancer screening.
However, the Committee remains concerned about increases in
colon cancer incidence and death rates, especially among individ-
uals younger than age 50. The Committee highlights the rec-
ommendation of the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal
Cancer that after the initial screening, asymptomatic individuals
with a personal history of polyps should receive more frequent
colonoscopy exams given the increased risk of new polyps. The
Committee encourages CMS to consider this and other evidence-
based data when reviewing guidelines on colorectal cancer screen-
ing frequency.
Additionally, the Committee is concerned that current implemen-
tation of the Affordable Care Act preventive services mandate does
not consistently guarantee first-dollar coverage of all FDA-ap-
proved bowel preparations when prescribed in connection with a
screening colonoscopy. The Committee encourages CMS to update
its 2016 guidance to clarify coverage of all FDA-approved
colonoscopy preparation products that meet established medical ef-
ficacy guidelines.
Convenient Access Standards.—The Committee notes that exist-
ing convenient access standards for Medicare Part D beneficiaries
based on geographic distance may not take into account all meth-
ods of access to medications. The Committee encourages CMS to
consider appropriate updates to the existing network adequacy
standards and to provide feedback, information, and technical as-
sistance to Congress on policies that could improve patient access
to drugs and pharmacist services, including potential changes to
Part D network adequacy standards.
Critical Access Hospital [CAH] Recertification.—The Committee
acknowledges the importance of CAH designation as a lifeline for
hospitals in rural and remote locations and understands that losing
this status, including through the review and recertification proc-
ess, could jeopardize the viability of facilities that are already oper-
ating on thin financial margins, which could create voids in access
to care for patients in these communities. The Committee directs
CMS to use its existing authorities to work with hospitals that are
expected to lose their CAH designation or have had their CAH des-
ignation revoked within the last 2 years, particularly those hos-
pitals affected by the mileage requirement, to help support con-
tinuity of operations and availability of care at those facilities. The
Committee also directs CMS to consider the proximity of Rural
Emergency Hospitals and classify Rural Emergency Hospitals as a
hospital when recertifying CAHs. Finally, the Committee directs
CMS to provide a report within 180 days of enactment of this act
on the agency’s decision to update the definition of primary roads
in the CY 2023 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System
final rule and the effects of the regulatory change on the number
of CAHs recertified.

198
Disproportionate Share Hospital [DSH] Payments.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that the Federal Medicaid statute generally re-
quires DSH payments to hospitals treating large numbers of low
income patients in every State except Tennessee. The Committee
is concerned that Tennessee as the only State without permanent
funding is at a unique disadvantage and encourages the adminis-
tration to work with Congress to find a permanent solution to en-
sure a Medicaid DSH payment allotment is available to Tennessee.
Further, the Committee recognizes that some hospitals have expe-
rienced fluctuations in their Medicare DSH calculations due to a
variety of factors. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs HHS to provide a briefing on proposals or rec-
ommendations for hospitals to better anticipate Medicare DSH
changes.
Distance to Care.—The Committee is concerned that many Medi-
care and Medicaid beneficiaries have to travel long distances to ac-
cess medical care in many communities. Within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee directs CMS to provide a report
to the Committee about the average distances that beneficiaries
have to travel to access care in each State and actions the agency
is taking to make accessing healthcare easier for beneficiaries.
Emergency Medical Treatment.—The Committee supports med-
ical providers in providing stabilizing care to patients experiencing
a medical emergency regardless of their insurance status or ability
to pay. The Committee encourages CMS to work with hospitals to
ensure that all types of stabilizing care are provided in a timely
manner to patients experiencing an emergency medical condition to
protect patient health.
Ensuring Patient Assistance Counts Toward Out-of-Pocket Lim-
its.—The Committee requests a briefing within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on CMS’s enforcement of the rule in the 2020 HHS
Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters requiring that cost
sharing assistance paid by drug manufacturers on behalf of pa-
tients to reduce their out-of-pocket costs be counted toward the an-
nual limitation on cost sharing.
Essential Medical Devices.—The Committee is concerned by the
healthcare system’s increased reliance on Chinese-made medical
devices and supplies, which could negatively impact domestic man-
ufacturing capacity. The Committee supports efforts to promote
purchases of American-made medical devices and is similarly en-
couraged by CMS payment policies to provide new payment adjust-
ments to hospitals for their share of additional costs incurred for
certain supplies, such as domestically made N95 respirators. The
Committee requests a briefing 1 year after enactment of this act
on the payments for domestic N95 respirator procurement and ad-
ditional efforts by CMS to support domestic procurement of essen-
tial medical devices and supplies, including any new or proposed
supplemental payments for essential medical devices.
Generic Drug Shortages.—The Committee is concerned about ge-
neric drug shortages, particularly those impacting generic sterile
injectables, which include many cancer drugs, emergency medi-
cines, and anesthesiology medications. The Committee encourages
CMS to work with Congress and relevant stakeholders on ana-
lyzing Medicare and Medicaid payment policies’ impact on supply

199
chains and economic incentives for generic drug suppliers, whole-
salers, and healthcare providers.
Genetically Targeted Technologies.—Genetically targeted drugs
include a set of complex small molecule products that target pre-
dominantly rare, genetic-based diseases but can also target broader
populations in novel ways. The Committee recognizes concerns that
subjecting these highly complex drugs to negotiation so early in
their commercialization could disproportionally impact the use of
genetically targeted drugs to treat diseases with high unmet med-
ical need. The Committee encourages CMS to work with stake-
holders to address these considerations.
Graduate Medical Education [GME].—The Committee notes that
Congress has authorized additional GME Medicare positions in re-
cent years for four categories of hospitals: hospitals located in rural
areas; hospitals currently training over their caps; hospitals located
in States with new medical schools; and hospitals serving Health
Professional Shortage Areas [HPSAs]. Within the HPSA category,
the Committee encourages CMS to examine priority consideration
of future slot distribution to teaching hospitals associated with His-
torically Black Medical Schools or facilities physically located in
rural areas.
Ground Ambulance Data Collection.—The Committee recognizes
the work of CMS in establishing the first round of the Ground Am-
bulance Data Collection System and supports ongoing data collec-
tion efforts, including efforts to address stakeholder concerns. The
Committee notes that the Secretary may modify the data collection
instrument to address concerns and directs the Secretary to make
such data publicly available on its Web site, consistent with public
reporting requirements.
Health Insurance Exchange.—The Committee continues bill lan-
guage that requires CMS to provide cost information for the fol-
lowing: Federal Payroll and Other Administrative Costs; Exchange
related Information Technology [IT]; Non-IT Program Costs, includ-
ing Health Plan Benefit and Rate Review, Exchange Oversight,
Payment and Financial Management, Eligibility and Enrollment;
Consumer Information and Outreach, including the Call Center,
Navigator Grants and Consumer Education and Outreach; Ex-
change Quality Review; Small Business Health Options Program
and Employer Activities; and Other Exchange Activities. Cost infor-
mation should be provided for each fiscal year since the enactment
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [ACA]. CMS is
also required to include the estimated costs for fiscal year 2027.
Home and Community-Based Services [HCBS].—The Committee
is supportive of efforts to increase access to care in homes and com-
munities, which includes support for family caregivers and direct
care workers that provide essential care and services. Within exist-
ing resources, the Committee urges CMS to strengthen and expand
access to HCBS, facilitate State planning, encourage innovative
models that benefit the workforce and care recipients, and support
quality and accountability. Further, the Committee encourages
CMS to issue guidance outlining how States can implement inten-
sive home and community-based behavioral health services to ad-
dress the growing behavioral and mental health crisis. The Com-
mittee urges CMS to include in such guidance information regard-

200
ing: (1) best practices from States that have improved the avail-
ability of home and community-based mental health and substance
use disorder services; and (2) potential options for financing and
expanding access to home and community-based mental health and
substance use disorder services.
Hospice and Dementia Care.—The Committee recognizes the
value of hospice care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Re-
lated Dementias [ADRD], including hospice’s potential to both im-
prove quality of life and reduce Medicare expenditures. The Com-
mittee encourages CMS to work with Congress and relevant stake-
holders to ensure that Medicare’s enrollment and eligibility proc-
esses consider the unique nature of dementia care, including by re-
ducing unnecessary barriers to services. The Committee directs
CMS to provide a report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on its efforts
to analyze and address access challenges, including those that may
result from existing protocols or processes, for beneficiaries with
ADRD.
HPV Screenings for Cervical Cancer.—The Committee recognizes
that self-collection has the potential to reach individuals who are
never screened or under screened for HPV, which makes up about
half of women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the
United States. The Committee urges CMS to examine ways to en-
sure that there is appropriate coverage for this screening method-
ology upon FDA approval.
Insulin Pumps.—The Committee recognizes the importance of en-
suring Medicare coverage policies are consistent with current clin-
ical standards of care, including for those with diabetes. The Com-
mittee encourages CMS to review its coverage policies for insulin
pumps to ensure that all requirements, including the measurement
of C-peptide levels or antibody tests, are consistent with clinical
standards of care. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs CMS to provide a briefing on Medicare coverage
of medical devices used to manage diabetes, including insulin
pumps.
Long-term Care Facility Metrics.—The Committee supports ef-
forts to improve the quality of care and outcomes for individuals
served by long-term care facilities, including skilled nursing facili-
ties, and recognizes that many residents of these facilities have a
range of chronic and disabling conditions, including
neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias, neurodegenerative disorders, and serious
mental health issues. In 2021, the HHS Office of Inspector General
found that the current CMS measures related to the use of
antipsychotics are insufficient and do not distinguish appropriate
from inappropriate use. CMS is directed to closely examine the rec-
ommendations from the Inspector General, continue collecting data
on the use of the medications, ensure sufficient documentation by
the patient’s physician and independent facility pharmacist to dem-
onstrate appropriate use of antipsychotics in skilled nursing facili-
ties, and focus oversight on facilities in which trends may signal in-
appropriate use. The Committee requests that CMS provide an up-
date on these activities in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Maternal Health.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
rural hospitals in providing maternal healthcare services, edu-

201
cating patients, and ensuring postpartum safety. The Committee is
concerned that insufficient reimbursement, coupled with difficulties
in maternity care provider recruitment and retention, threaten the
viability of these services in rural hospitals. Such factors have con-
tributed to the closures of labor and delivery departments and
growing maternal health deserts. The Committee directs CMS to
provide a briefing to the Committee within 180 days of enactment
of this act detailing insights into closures of labor and delivery de-
partments.
Medicare Payment Systems Modernization [MPSM] Fund.—The
Committee supports efforts by CMS to modernize Medicare’s fee-
for-service claims processing systems portfolio. Doing so will help
the agency lay important groundwork for continued improvements
and efficiencies in service delivery and payments for Medicare
beneficiaries, providers, and claims processors. The Committee di-
rects CMS to include in its fiscal year 2027 CJ status updates on
all ongoing projects undertaken by CMS with respect to MPSM.
Merit-Based Incentive Payment System [MIPS] Feedback Re-
ports.—The Committee urges CMS to improve timely access to
MIPS feedback reports and claims data for providers, consistent
with existing law. In doing so, the Committee requests an update
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on actions CMS has taken to utilize
measures developed by national medical specialty societies, includ-
ing qualified clinical data registries maintained by national medical
specialty societies, for MIPS, MIPs Value Pathways, and alter-
native payment model reporting.
Mobile Stroke Units.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of mobile stroke units [MSUs] in diagnosing and treating acute
strokes in a prehospital setting. The Committee encourages CMS
to examine policies to provide appropriate access to MSU services,
including CT scans and medications, as well as policies that reflect
the unique nature of treatment in a MSU.
Non-addictive Opioid Alternatives.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the high mortality rate due to the opioid overdose epi-
demic and is pleased that FDA approved its first non-addictive
opioid alternative this year. The Committee, however, is concerned
that significant barriers continue to exist for beneficiaries’ access to
treatment for chronic pain. The Committee encourages CMS to
work with Congress on efforts to facilitate access to non-addictive
alternatives to opioids for acute pain treatment and management
and requests a briefing no later than 180 days after enactment of
this act on these efforts.
Non-pharmacologic Treatments for Pain.—Non-pharmacologic
treatments for pain management have shown to be effective in re-
ducing pain and reliance on prescription opioids. The Committee
encourages CMS to support access to non-pharmacologic treat-
ments, like osteopathic manipulative treatment and other alter-
native treatments as appropriate, for back and other pain.
Nutrition Interventions.—The Committee recognizes that healthy
foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, are key to individual
health and well-being, however cost can be a barrier for lower in-
come individuals. Nutrition support interventions, such as produce
prescriptions and medically tailored meals, continue to show great
promise in improving health among food insecure individuals who

202
suffer from chronic, diet-related conditions such as heart disease
and diabetes. Several States have received CMS approval to cover
certain nutritional supports and other services to address health
related social needs in certain circumstances; and in November of
2023, CMS published additional guidance and a framework out-
lining these State opportunities. The Committee encourages CMS,
in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health, to partner with stakeholder organizations, including quali-
fied academic institutions, to assist States in implementing nutri-
tional support and other health related social needs initiatives to
increase access to healthy foods.
Organ Procurement Organization [OPO] Performance.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that in recent years, CMS has taken steps to in-
crease oversight of OPOs, including by establishing new methods
to evaluate performance and issuing rules to decertify OPOs falling
below the median performance on certain metrics. The Committee
remains extremely concerned by the findings of a recent investiga-
tion by HHS that revealed practices by a major OPO that com-
promised patient safety. CMS has a considerable responsibility for
ensuring that OPOs operate in a safe, fair, and efficient manner
that is transparent, accountable, and effective. Patients are also at
risk if OPOs are unable to operate due to stringent or unworkable
requirements from CMS. As CMS continues to work with OPOs to
ensure that the organ donation system promotes patient safety and
operates effectively, the Committee encourages the agency to
prioritize outreach and education to stakeholders; alleviate disrup-
tion; ensure that OPOs can effectively expand into new service
areas, when necessary; and issue clarifying guidance. CMS is di-
rected to continue to promote accountability, identify
vulnerabilities, and issue strict corrective actions as needed to en-
sure that any donation processes do not continue if patient safety
concerns arise.
Organ Recovery Cost Reimbursement.—The Committee notes that
OPO Recovery Centers can increase the number of organs available
for transplantation and intensive care unit bed capacity for living
patients. The Committee recognizes that there are concerns with
the current reimbursement methodology for organ transportation
and recovery, including concerns that the methodology may serve
as a financial disincentive to utilize OPO Recovery Centers effec-
tively. Therefore, the Committee encourages CMS to assess exist-
ing policies to ensure that transplant centers are appropriately re-
imbursed for furnishing deceased donor organ management and re-
covery services.
Peripheral Artery Disease [PAD] Amputation Prevention Initia-
tive.—An estimated 21.0 million Americans have PAD, and ap-
proximately 200,000 of them suffer avoidable amputations every
year because of the disease. CMS is encouraged to promote ampu-
tation prevention services at hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers,
and office-based centers that focus on: (1) patient risk modification
and management; (2) early screening, detection, and surveillance;
(3) testing and treatment for PAD; and (4) improving care coordina-
tion for individuals at high risk for amputation.
Pharmacy Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees.—The Com-
mittee is concerned about the dramatic increase of retroactive

203
pharmacy price concessions commonly referred to as ‘‘pharmacy di-
rect and indirect remuneration [DIR] fees’’ in Medicare Part D. The
fees are often assessed weeks or even months after a prescription
has been filled, preventing pharmacies from knowing at the time
of dispensing what their true reimbursement will be for that pre-
scription. The Committee commends HHS and CMS for aiming to
address the DIR issue and urges continued administrative action
and oversight to further address this issue while working to pre-
vent financial strain on community pharmacies.
Physician Fee Schedule Codes.—When adjusting the number of
relative value units needed to account for coding changes, new data
on relative value components, or payment for new services, the
Committee notes that CMS may overestimate or underestimate uti-
lization, and therefore the overall cost of such changes, resulting in
substantial adjustments to physician fee schedule payments re-
quired by budget neutrality. The Committee encourages GAO to
study CMS estimates of the utilization of selected new fee schedule
codes over the last 10 years, data on related adjustments to the fee
schedule for these years, the effects of CMS utilization estimates
relative to actual utilization figures on physician fee schedule pay-
ments and spending for those services, and other items determined
appropriate by the Comptroller General.
Prescription Digital Therapeutics [PDT].—The Committee recog-
nizes the use of PDTs to treat conditions like substance use dis-
order, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, insomnia, major de-
pression, diabetes, stroke, schizophrenia, and cancer. The Com-
mittee encourages CMS to work with stakeholders and Congress to
promote appropriate access to PDTs.
Program of All-Inclusive Care.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the Program of All-Inclusive Care [PACE], which en-
ables medically complex older adults with significant long-term
care needs to remain living at home. Given the increasing need for
home and community-based care for older adults and those living
with disabilities, the Committee encourages the CMS to examine
ways to increase access to PACE services for Medicare bene-
ficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, and dually eligible individuals.
Protecting Medicare Beneficiary Access to Therapy.—The Com-
mittee is concerned with the HHS Office of Inspector General’s
findings that payors have denied or delayed timely Medicare bene-
ficiary access to medically necessary medication through the use of
‘‘utilization management.’’ The Committee acknowledges the timely
opportunity for the agency to improve transparency around the use
of utilization management and encourages CMS to take a holistic
approach to protecting beneficiary access to medication therapy, in-
cluding enhanced oversight and review of the use of utilization
management by Medicare Part D plan sponsors. The Committee
supports the administration’s engagement with stakeholders to ad-
dress these issues and requests an update in the fiscal year 2027
CJ on actions the agency is taking to better protect Medicare bene-
ficiaries by enhancing its oversight of and transparency related to
the use of utilization management by Part D plans to ensure no ad-
verse impacts to beneficiary access to therapies.
Psychosocial Rehabilitation Model.—The Committee notes the
health, economic, and overall societal benefits associated with alle-

204
viating social isolation among people with serious mental illness
[SMI]. Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Committee re-
quests that CMS provide a report on how the agency could address
loneliness and social isolation and other social drivers of health
through community-based models and how the Measures Manage-
ment System will test the feasibility of patient-reported outcome
measures related to social isolation and loneliness that could be in-
cluded in current and future value-based models.
Quality Measures.—The Committee appreciates CMS’s efforts to
ensure that the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries is of the
highest quality and understands that the agency partners with ex-
ternal entities to develop, validate, update, and maintain measures.
The Committee is concerned that the process to update screening
measures is not keeping pace with advances in science and practice
that can improve patient access to identification of undetected dis-
ease leading to earlier treatment. The Committee urges CMS to le-
verage its existing authority to utilize evidence-based guidelines to
update screening measures in a timely and efficient manner and
requests an update on improving screening measurements in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Reducing Costly Osteoporotic Fractures.—The Committee con-
tinues to note that current Medicare payment policies may not be
adequate to encourage comprehensive care to reduce osteoporosis-
related bone fractures. Therefore, the Committee encourages CMS
to establish a clear payment mechanism for evidence-based post-
fracture care that has been shown to reduce the rates of costly sec-
ondary fractures through improved screening, treatment initiation
and adherence, patient and caregiver education and counseling,
and comprehensive falls prevention strategies. Further, the Com-
mittee is concerned that postmenopausal osteoporosis [PMO] is re-
sponsible for nearly 2.0 million fractures every year in the United
States for women age 65 and older, and two out of three women
with PMO at high risk for fracture will break a bone in their life-
time. However, only one in six women receive osteoporosis treat-
ment in the months following an osteoporotic fracture. The U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] has recommended the
use of bone measurement testing to screen both women age 65 and
older for osteoporosis and postmenopausal women younger than 65
who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, but nationwide screening
of this high-risk population is lacking. The Committee directs CMS
to provide recommendations in the fiscal year 2027 CJ for changes
to CMS policies that could increase access to PMO care.
Reducing False-Positive Sepsis Blood Cultures.—The Committee
is aware that more than 40 percent of blood culture tests used to
diagnose blood stream infections, like sepsis, are false-positive re-
sults due to blood culture contaminations from a patient’s skin.
These false-positive test results can lead to serious morbidity and
mortality among misdiagnosed patients, significant spending on
unnecessary treatment, and the overuse of antibiotics. The Com-
mittee requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act
for CMS to provide an update on its efforts to review and adopt a
blood culture contamination rate measure.

205
Risk Corridor Program.—The Committee continues bill language
to prevent the CMS Program Management appropriation account
from being used to support risk corridor payments.
Reusable Respirators.—The Committee recognizes the use of re-
usable respirators within the hospital setting and encourages CMS
to examine ways to support their increased utilization when appro-
priate.
Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery [SRS].—The Committee re-
mains concerned that inadequate payments for robotic SRS and
robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy may threaten patient
access to this important treatment option for many types of cancer
in both the hospital and freestanding cancer settings. The Com-
mittee urges CMS to protect Medicare beneficiary access to these
services, which can safely deliver life-saving and life-changing can-
cer treatment in a timely and cost-efficient manner, improving pa-
tient compliance and reducing burdens on patients, providers, and
the healthcare system.
Rural and Critical Access Hospitals.—The Committee is con-
cerned that 25 rural hospitals have closed since 2021 and that 46
percent of rural hospitals are operating at a financial loss. The
Committee directs CMS to suggest options in the fiscal year 2027
CJ that would allow vulnerable, rural hospitals, including those
with Critical Access Hospital designation, to receive relief in the
near-term, as well as a new payment system that can ensure that
more hospitals serving rural and underserved populations can oper-
ate in a more financially sustainable way.
School-Based Services [SBS].—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of SBS in promoting the health of children and adoles-
cents. As more States look to expand SBS, the Committee encour-
ages CMS to examine State reporting requirements and review and
update reporting systems to better collect information about SBS
for students beyond what is provided pursuant to a student’s indi-
vidualized education program or individualized family services pro-
gram. Further, the Committee supports the work of the CMS Tech-
nical Assistance Center [TAC] to support education agencies and
reduce administrative burdens, particularly for small and rural
schools. Within 30 days of enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects CMS, in coordination with the Department of Education, to
provide a briefing on actions taken to expand access to SBS.
Stark Law Compliance.—The Committee is concerned that the
definitions of ‘‘commercially reasonable’’ and ‘‘fair market value,’’
which were updated in 2021 are not being applied during the re-
view of certain hiring practices by hospitals. The Committee en-
courages the agency to apply these updated definitions as estab-
lished in the CMS Final Rule ‘‘Medicare Program; Modernizing and
Clarifying the Physician Self-Referral Regulations’’ to help support
value-based care.
State Information Technology [IT] and Data Systems.—The Com-
mittee notes significant new demands on the data and IT systems
that support State Medicaid programs. The Committee directs the
CMS Administrator to work with governors and State Medicaid di-
rectors to implement effective strategies to reduce preventable cov-
erage losses and improve the accuracy of eligibility determinations.
Such an approach should include timely technical assistance and

206
promoting use of technology, electronic data sources, artificial intel-
ligence, and personnel to reduce data siloes, streamline
verifications, enhance data matching, uphold beneficiary privacy,
and upgrade system capacity.
Supplemental Oxygen.—The Committee notes that in 2018, CMS
developed a set of clinical data elements to identify the data nec-
essary to support medical necessity of supplemental oxygen claims
and allow for electronic prescribing of supplemental oxygen. CMS
has not approved of the use of this electronic template, and the
clinical data elements template and electronic prescribing has yet
to be implemented. Within 60 days of enactment of this act, the
Committee directs CMS to provide a briefing on updates to the e-
prescribing of supplemental oxygen, including a process and
timeline for provider adoption. The briefing should also include in-
formation on CMS’s efforts to work with community stakeholders
to improve access to supplemental oxygen.
Vaccine Coverage.—The Committee encourages CMS to ensure
that its regulations fully implement Section 2713 of the PHSA and
align with the statutory intent of such section, which generally re-
quires commercial insurance coverage of CDC-recommended vac-
cines without cost-sharing. CMS is directed to provide a report to
the Committee and post on a publicly available Web site no later
than 180 days after enactment of this act, on steps it will take to
ensure Section 2713 is fully implemented.
Whole Child Health.—The Committee recognizes the efforts of
the Integrated Care for Kids Model to improve the quality of care
for children covered by Medicaid and notes the importance of ad-
dressing the root causes of poor physical and mental health in chil-
dren served by Medicaid and CHIP. The Committee encourages
CMS to examine further efforts to advance pediatric payment and
delivery models that support disease prevention and improve
health, including through a whole child health demonstration pro-
gram.
State Survey and Certification
The Committee provides $397,334,000 for State Survey and Cer-
tification activities, which ensure that institutions and agencies
providing care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries meet Fed-
eral health, safety, and program standards. On-site surveys are
conducted by State survey agencies, with a pool of Federal sur-
veyors performing random monitoring surveys.
Annual Reports.—The Committee continues to direct CMS to pro-
vide, in the fiscal year 2027 CJ, a report to the Committees regard-
ing operational milestones and funding activities under this head-
ing. Such reports shall, at a minimum, include quarterly obliga-
tions, unobligated balances (including a breakdown of committed
and uncommitted balances), and expenditures of current year dis-
cretionary budgetary authority by originating statute. Such reports
shall also include operational metrics, such as those found on pages
82 and 85 of the fiscal year 2025 CJ, regarding the numbers and
rates of survey and complaint visits by provider type for the appli-
cable quarter.

207
Federal Administration
The Committee provides $772,533,000 for Federal Administra-
tion, which funds the majority of CMS’s staff and operating ex-
penses for routine activities, such as planning, implementing, eval-
uating, and ensuring accountability in the programs administered
by CMS.
HEALTHCARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $941,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 941,000,000
The Committee provides $941,000,000, to be transferred from the
Medicare trust funds, for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control ac-
tivities. The Committee recommendation includes a discretionary
base amount of $311,000,000 and an additional $630,000,000 in re-
sources through a budget cap adjustment, in alignment with the
parameters set forth in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.
Proactively identifying healthcare waste, fraud, and abuse con-
tinues to be a priority for the Committee.
ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND FAMILY
SUPPORT PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,924,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,147,000,000
The Committee provides $4,147,000,000 in fiscal year 2026 man-
datory funds for Child Support Enforcement and Family Support
programs. In addition, the Committee provides $1,800,000,000 in
advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027.
These funds support States’ efforts to promote the economic secu-
rity of low-income families, including administrative expenses,
matching funds, and incentive payments to States for child support
enforcement; grants to States to help establish and administer ac-
cess and visitation programs between noncustodial parents and
their children; payments to territories for benefits to certain aged,
blind, or disabled individuals; and temporary benefits for certain
repatriated citizens.
LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,025,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,045,000,000
The Committee provides $4,045,000,000 for the Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. LIHEAP provides
home heating and cooling assistance to low-income households.
Sudden, significant, and unexpected decreases in annual funding
for States, even when based in part on changes in home energy
costs or other formula factors, can be difficult for States to manage.
Accordingly, the Committee continues to limit year-to-year fluctua-
tions in allocations to States.
LIHEAP Formula Report.—Within 120 days of enactment of this
act, ACF is directed to submit to the Committees on Appropriations
and make publicly available a report evaluating the program’s for-
mula and allocations of funding among States, including specifying

208
the methods and data sources used to determine the grant amounts
provided to each State, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories
and commonwealths, and Indian Tribal organizations. The report
should also include an assessment of available data, how the pro-
gram provides assistance for both heating and cooling including
any recommendations for formula updates, and the percentage of
eligible households served, average assistance amount, and per-
centage of home energy costs covered by that amount by each
State.
LIHEAP Funding Release.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of the timely release of LIHEAP funding, particularly in
the fall as States finalize their plans for energy assistance for the
upcoming year. The Committee includes bill language requiring
ACF to release at least 90 percent of LIHEAP funds to States by
November 1, consistent with current practice.
LIHEAP Workforce.—The Committee notes that sufficient staff
funding for the LIHEAP office has been provided and strongly
urges ACF to address any vacancies that will affect program oper-
ations or its ability to fulfill its statutory responsibility to provide
home heating and cooling assistance to low-income households Na-
tionwide.
Technical Assistance and Program Administration.—Within the
total, the Committee includes up to $9,600,000 for program integ-
rity and oversight efforts, of which a portion is intended to continue
to support a formula system, which will allow ACF to provide esti-
mates more readily when requested by the Committee.
REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,327,214,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,691,033,000
The Committee recommends $5,691,033,000 in base discretionary
funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance [REA] programs.
These programs provide a variety of benefits and services to refu-
gees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, immigrants arriving on
Special Immigrant Visas [SIV], trafficking victims, and torture vic-
tims (collectively referred to below as ‘‘refugees’’). These programs
also provide temporary care and services for unaccompanied chil-
dren apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security [DHS]
or other law enforcement agencies, who have no lawful immigration
status in the United States until they can be placed with a parent,
guardian, or other sponsor while awaiting adjudication of their im-
migration status.
The Committee recommendation continues the directive to pro-
vide monthly updates to the Committees on Appropriations of ar-
rivals each month by category, including refugees, asylees, Cuban
and Haitian Entrants, SIVs, and unaccompanied children. Such up-
dates shall include any changes in estimated funding needs as a re-
sult of changing trends.
The Committee believes that the USRAP serves as a reflection
of U.S. humanitarianism as well as the Nation’s strategic interests.
The program provides for the safe resettlement of some of the most
vulnerable refugees and not only saves lives but also strengthens
our National security by providing support and shared responsi-
bility for strategic allies and regions.

209
The Committee notes the need to maintain a baseline of capacity
and encourages HHS, to the extent practicable, to ensure that re-
settlement agencies are able to maintain their infrastructure and
capacity at a level to continue to serve new refugees, previously ar-
rived refugees, and other populations of concern who remain statu-
torily eligible for integration services, and to ensure that there is
capacity for future arrivals to be adequately served.
Community Engagement and Quarterly Consultation.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that quarterly consultations and regular commu-
nity engagement are critical to support refugee integration and en-
courages HHS to pursue efforts to ensure robust participation in
regular community consultations.
Mental Health and Trauma Informed Care.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of ORR providing trauma informed, cul-
turally appropriate, comprehensive care to the individuals it
serves, including unaccompanied children, refugees, victims of traf-
ficking, and survivors of torture. Accordingly, the Committee en-
courages ORR to partner with an outside organization with exper-
tise in providing such care to evaluate the mental healthcare needs
of ORR-eligible populations and any ongoing gaps and challenges
in current mental health provision across populations ORR serves.
Spend Plan and Briefings.—The Committee directs ORR to re-
sume providing quarterly spend plans for the Unaccompanied Alien
Children [UAC] program with actual and estimated obligations by
major category, at the same level of detail that has been provided
in previous years. The Committee further expects at least this level
of detail to be included in future budget justifications. The Com-
mittee also directs the Director of ORR to resume providing weekly
briefings to the Committees, as has long been the practice.
Transitional and Medical Services
The Committee recommendation includes $564,000,000 for Tran-
sitional and Medical Services. This program provides grants to
States and nonprofit organizations to provide cash and medical as-
sistance to arriving refugees, as well as foster care services to un-
accompanied minors.
Matching Grant Program.—The Committee continues to support
the Matching Grant [MG] program and strongly encourages HHS
to continue steps that have been previously taken to improve the
program to address administrative challenges that can limit the
program’s reach and effectiveness.
Refugee Support Services
The Committee recommendation includes $307,201,000 for Ref-
ugee Support Services [RSS]. This program provides a combination
of formula and competitive grants to States and nonprofit organiza-
tions to help refugees become self-sufficient and address barriers to
employment.
The Committee strongly encourages ORR to the greatest extent
possible to allocate RSS funding based on the best data available
that reflects actual needs of providing services to newly arrived ref-
ugees. The Committee directs ORR to include information in its fis-
cal year 2027 CJ on what flexibilities ORR has applied in allo-

210
cating funding to better reflect needs and any ongoing limitations
in doing so.
Education, Training, and Career Opportunities.—The Committee
encourages ORR to ensure all eligible populations are made aware
of the variety of education, training, and career opportunities avail-
able to them through ORR or other Federal partners, including
adult education, credential evaluation, pre-apprenticeship, and reg-
istered apprenticeship programs. The Committee encourages ORR
to continue to collaborate with the Departments of Education and
Labor to ensure that new arrivals receive information about these
employment and training opportunities within the first 90 days
after arrival.
Preferred Communities.—The Committee supports the Preferred
Communities program, which supports intensive case management
and other services to address the needs to particularly vulnerable
refugee populations.
Victims of Trafficking
The Committee recommendation includes $30,755,000 for Victims
of Trafficking programs. These programs support a national net-
work of organizations that provide a variety of services-including
case management, counseling, benefit coordination, and housing as-
sistance-for victims of commercial sex and forced labor trafficking.
Within this amount the Committee recommendation includes no
less than $5,000,000 for the National Human Trafficking Hotline
(Hotline). The Committee notes concern with reports that the Hot-
line has not consistently and promptly reported tips, when appro-
priate and consistent with Federal and State law, of trafficking of
adults to law enforcement. The objectives of the Hotline include
providing information and service referrals to victims of trafficking
using a trauma-informed, victim-centered approach; and notifying
law enforcement agencies of potential cases of human trafficking as
well as instances when a trafficking victim is in imminent danger,
and documenting emerging trafficking schemes to assist in the de-
tection and investigation of trafficking cases.
It is critical that that the Hotline maintain a person-centered ap-
proach focused on the victim’s well-being and those who utilize the
Hotline’s services and wish to be anonymous should stay anony-
mous when it is safe and appropriate to do so. The Committee also
notes that Hotline plays an important role in notifying law enforce-
ment of potential trafficking when that is appropriate. Accordingly,
the Committee directs ACF to ensure the Hotline is complying with
applicable laws and policies regarding the operation of the Hotline,
assisting victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons, and re-
ferring potential cases of trafficking to law enforcement including
reporting all third-party tips of potential human trafficking to
State and local law enforcement when the signaler appears to be
in imminent danger.
Unaccompanied Alien Children
The Committee recommendation includes $4,770,077,000 in base
funding for the UAC program. The UAC program provides tem-
porary care for children who have no lawful immigration status in
the United States and who have been apprehended by DHS with-

211
out a parent or a guardian. HHS provides care for children until
they can be placed with a parent or other sponsor living in the
United States pending resolution of their immigration status.
Influx Care Facilities [ICFs].—The Committee continues to direct
ORR to ensure that ICFs will only be used in the future when ab-
solutely necessary and directs ORR to include in its fiscal year
2027 CJ estimates of how much it will spend on ICFs, its estimated
capacity needs, the methodology it uses and factors it considers
when estimating ICF capacity needs, and in what specific cir-
cumstances it will activate capacity in ICFs. The Committee also
directs that if ICFs are needed in the future, HHS will ensure they
have the physical infrastructure to provide developmentally appro-
priate care for children, including appropriate space for education
services, and confidential space for the provision of healthcare,
mental healthcare, and legal services.
Services for Children in ORR Care.—The Committee directs ORR
to ensure it is providing developmentally appropriate, trauma-in-
formed, culturally competent care in the least restrictive setting.
The Committee encourages ORR to work with residential care pro-
viders, disability experts, and child welfare experts to ensure ad-
herence to Federal, State, and local laws related to standards of
care for children, including children with disabilities. Finally, the
Committee recognizes that unaccompanied children often share ex-
tensive personal information to case managers, clinicians, or other
adults while in ORR care, and directs ORR and its grantees and
contractors to protect sensitive personal information, behavioral
health records, and mental health records consistent with all appli-
cable child welfare laws, regulations, and licensing requirements.
Office of the Ombuds.—The Committee strongly supports efforts
to increase independent oversight of the UAC program. Accord-
ingly, the Committee supports the Office of the Ombuds, to provide
independent oversight of the UAC program, and child-welfare fo-
cused recommendations to ORR and the Secretary regarding the
care of unaccompanied children.
Post-Release Child Welfare Services.—The Committee supports
the expansion of child-welfare focused post release services, and in-
creasing the percentage of children receiving in-person ORR-funded
post-release services and home studies conducted by child welfare
professionals. These services are critical to ensuring that children
are in safe and appropriate homes after they have been released
from ORR’s care. The Committee directs ORR to provide monthly
briefings to the Committees on the number of children receiving
ORR-funded post-release services and the types of services pro-
vided, and on the number of children receiving child welfare checks
from other Federal agencies, the data relied on for determining
which children should receive such child welfare checks, and the
outcomes of such child welfare checks.
Access to Counsel and Child Advocates.—The Committee directs
ORR to provide access to counsel consistent with the TVPRA of
2008, which recognizes that unaccompanied children are a particu-
larly vulnerable population requiring dedicated and uninterrupted
access to counsel in their immigration proceedings, including to
safeguard them from trafficking and exploitation. The Committee
also continues to direct ORR to ensure in-person Know Your Rights

212
presentations and legal screenings, administered by qualified pro-
viders, for every child in ORR custody and access to legal counsel
for any child in prolonged ORR-care. The Committee also continues
to direct ORR to ensure that legal services will be in person absent
exigent circumstances. The Committee directs ORR to provide
monthly briefings on the status of all contracts relating to the pro-
vision of these services.
Prioritization of Small-Scale, Community- and Family-Based
Placements.—The Committee continues to direct ORR to prioritize
the placement of children in small-scale, community- and family-
based care providers, including transitional foster care, small group
homes, and long-term foster care. The Committee directs ORR to
include information in its fiscal year 2027 CJ on its actual and
planned capacity by program type.
Report.—The Committee directs ORR to continue to submit bian-
nual reports to the Committees that include the number of UACs
that remain in HHS care for longer than 1 year and the number
of UACs that HHS has released to sponsors. The report should also
include an explanation of the methods ORR uses to follow-up with
unaccompanied children after releasing them to a sponsor, includ-
ing the follow-up method used and number of attempts made. The
Department shall make such a report available on its website.
Home Studies.—The Committee strongly encourages ORR to con-
duct a home study for every potential sponsor. The Committee di-
rects ORR to brief the Committees of jurisdiction, within 30 days
of enactment of this act, on the timeline and steps it will take to
meet the recommendations of the OIG report, ‘‘Gaps in Sponsor
Screening and Follow-up Raise Safety Concerns for Unaccompanied
Children’’ and to provide a report to the Committee within 90 days
of enactment of this act on the feasibility of conducting an in-per-
son home study for every potential sponsor and a full accounting
of minors that ORR has not been able to contact as part of safety
and well-being calls.
Youth Aging Out of ORR Care.—The Committee directs ORR to
have developed a concrete post-18 plan for every 17-year-old unac-
companied child in ORR care at least 30 days in advance of their
18th birthday to ensure that an appropriate placement has been
identified and arranged for the child, along with any necessary so-
cial support services, prior to discharge from ORR. The Committee
directs ORR to ensure that it is complying with its obligation to
protect children’s private and confidential information in fulfilling
its obligation to engage in post-18 planning for children aging out
of ORR care.
Length of Care.—The Committee directs ORR to continue to pro-
vide daily information to the Committees on the number of children
referred to ORR care and weekly reports that include information
on the length of care. In addition, the Committee directs ORR to
post publicly on its website each month the average length of care
for children in its custody.
Victims of Torture
The Committee recommendation includes $19,000,000 for the
Victims of Torture program to provide support to non-profit organi-

213
zations providing direct support to torture survivors and their fam-
ilies.
PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT
BLOCK GRANT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,746,387,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,831,387,000
The Committee provides $8,831,387,000 for the Child Care and
Development Block Grant [CCDBG], a formula grant to States that
provides financial assistance to families to help pay for child care,
and otherwise improve the quality of child care programs.
Data Reporting.—The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2026
CJ included fiscal year 2022 data regarding the number of children
and families served by CCDBG. The Committee is concerned by the
lag in this data reporting and requests a briefing, no later than 180
days after enactment, on the challenges relative to collecting this
data and recommendations for improving its timeliness.
Native Hawaiian Child Care Programs.—The Committee re-
quests a report within 90 days of enactment of this act providing
the rationale of the funding allocation for past three grant cycles
of the Native Hawaiian Non-Profit Organization Child Care Grant,
and a plan to align funding with the Native Hawaiian service pop-
ulation in subsequent awards.
SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,700,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,700,000,000
The Committee provides $1,700,000,000 for the Social Services
Block Grant [SSBG], a flexible source of funding that allows States
to provide a diverse array of services to low-income children and
families, the disabled, and the elderly in order to reduce poverty.
The Committee recognizes that Family Resource Centers provide
direct assistance to families through parenting support and edu-
cation, navigation of care and social services, mental health coun-
seling, early learning and afterschool activities, family financial
planning, and job training. The Committee notes that preliminary
data shows promise in this area, with a 63 percent reduction in
child abuse cases and a $4.93 return for every tax dollar invested,
according to current research. The Committee supports States that
choose to use a portion of their SSBG funding to support services
and programs at school and community-based Family Resource
Centers to strengthen families through a localized, family-centered
approach.
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,789,089,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,900,140,000
The Committee provides $14,900,140,000 for Children and Fami-
lies Services programs. These funds support a variety of programs
for children, youth, and families; Native Americans; survivors of
child abuse, neglect, and domestic violence; and other vulnerable
populations.

Head Start
The Committee provides $12,356,820,000 for Head Start. Head
Start provides grants directly to local organizations to provide com-
prehensive early childhood education services to children and their
families, from before birth to age 5.
Designation Renewal System [DRS].—The Committee continues
to encourage HHS to consider the unique challenges faced by Head
Start grantees in remote and frontier areas when reviewing such
grantees’ compliance with health and dental screening require-
ments as part of the DRS.
Facility Improvement Funding and Report.—The Committee con-
tinues to strongly encourage ACF to ensure that all Head Start
grantees are aware of any funding opportunities, or funding other-
wise available, for making capital improvements to their facilities.
Further, the Committee continues to encourage ACF to standardize
this process so all grantees have equal opportunity to apply and
are aware of priorities and eligible uses of such funds. Additionally,
the Committee directs the Office of Head Start to issue a report,
no later than 180 days of enactment of this act on the state of
Head Start facilities including any repair, renovation, rebuilding,
and replacement of Head Start facilities that is necessary to pro-
vide a safer and welcoming environment for children and staff.
Freely Associated States.—The Committee includes bill language
to establish Head Start programs in the Republic of the Marshall

215
Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, as authorized in
the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2024 (Public
Law 118–42).
Native Hawaiian Programs.—The Committee recognizes the Fed-
eral trust responsibility to the Native Hawaiian Community, and
that the provision of comprehensive early childhood education is
critical to advancing that responsibility. The Committee also notes
that the Secretary is required to report on facilities for Native Ha-
waiian Head Start programs. As such, without any current Native
Hawaiian Head Start programs, the Committee directs ACF to pro-
vide technical assistance to potential Native Hawaiian Head Start
providers interested in applying for Head Start funding opportuni-
ties. Identified providers shall be operated by a Native Hawaiian
Organization or a Native Hawaiian Educational Organization for
the purpose of serving Native Hawaiian children and families, in-
cluding Native American language immersion programs. ACF is di-
rected to brief the Committee on these efforts no later than 180
days after such a funding opportunity is made public.
Regional Office Closures.—The Committee is aware of the closure
of five Head Start regional offices across the country, which could
impact Head Start centers previously served by those offices. The
Committee requests a report within 60 days of enactment detailing
the justification for the closures, the process for reassigning grant-
ees to new regional offices and the notice provided to grantees, and
an analysis of the impact of the closures on agency operations.
Timely Notice of Awards.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the timely release of funding award notices for Head Start
grantees. The Committee includes new bill language directing the
Office of Head Start [OHS] to award funding for continuation
awards and new award cycles that continue previous activities
under existing awards no later than the day following the expira-
tion of the period of performance. For grants in the Designated Re-
newal System, OHS may extend the current award in lieu of pro-
viding a new award for the purposes of finalizing negotiations with
the grantee.
Tribal Colleges and Universities-Head Start Partnership Pro-
gram.—The Committee includes $8,000,000 for the Tribal Colleges
and Universities-Head Start Partnership Program.
Preschool Development Grants
The Committee provides $315,000,000 for Preschool Development
Grants. This program, as authorized in the Every Student Succeeds
Act (Public Law 114–95), provides competitive grants to States to
improve the coordination, collaboration, and quality of existing
early childhood programs; improve the transition from early child-
hood programs to kindergarten; implement evidence-based prac-
tices; improve professional development for early childhood pro-
viders; and generally improve educational opportunities for chil-
dren.
The Committee encourages ACF to continue to support States
that choose to use a portion of their renewal grant funding to
award sub-grants to programs in a mixed delivery system across
the State, particularly for low-income and disadvantaged children

216
prior to entering kindergarten, or to improve the quality of local
programs through the enhancement of early childhood systems.
The Committee requests a report, no later than 180 days after
enactment of this act, on the efforts undertaken by grant recipients
in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 to strengthen early care and edu-
cation systems in their respective States. The report should also in-
clude a table, detailing the number of planning and renewal grants
by State for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. For renewal grants, the
table should include which year each grantee falls within the 3-
year cycle.
Dual Language Learners [DLL].—The Committee encourages
ACF to support States that choose to develop high-quality and cul-
turally competent dual immersion preschool programs through Pre-
school Development Grants. The Committee encourages a focus on
training, professional development, and postsecondary education
for all caregivers, teachers, and directors to meet the needs of
DLLs through dual language acquisition, engaging culturally and
linguistically diverse families, home language support, and cul-
turally and linguistically appropriate assessment.
Consolidated Runaway and Homeless Youth Program
The Committee provides $125,283,000 for the Consolidated Run-
away and Homeless Youth program. This program supports the
Basic Centers program, which provides temporary shelter, coun-
seling, and after-care services to runaway and homeless youth
under age 18 and their families; the Transitional Living Program,
which provides longer-term shelter and services for older youth;
and a national toll-free runaway and homeless youth crisis hotline.
The Committee continues to support the ability of grantees to
provide prevention services such as counseling and case manage-
ment, regardless of their enrollment in residential services. The
Committee urges ACF to advise grantees that they are not re-
quired to enroll youth in shelter or residential services, nor require
the young person to physically travel to the grantee’s location in
order for an at-risk youth to receive prevention and supportive
services.
Timely Notice of Funding Opportunities.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the timely release of notices of funding op-
portunities for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs.
Section 531 directs the timely issue notices of funding opportunities
and awards. The Committee further directs ACF to issue separate
funding opportunities for the Street Outreach Program, Basic Cen-
ter Program, Transitional Living Program, and Maternity Group
Homes.
Education and Prevention Grants to Reduce Sexual Abuse of Run-
away Youth
The Committee provides $21,000,000 for Education and Preven-
tion Grants to Reduce Sexual Abuse of Runaway and Homeless
Youth. This program provides competitive grants for street-based
outreach and education services for runaway and homeless youth
who are subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual
abuse or exploitation.

217
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment State Grants
The Committee provides $105,091,000 for the Child Abuse Pre-
vention and Treatment State Grant program. This program pro-
vides formula grants to States to improve their child protective
service systems.
Infant Plans of Safe Care.—Within the total, the Committee in-
cludes $60,000,000 to help States continue to develop and imple-
ment plans of safe care as required by section 106(b)(2)(B)(iii) of
the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (Public Law 93–
247). The Committee again urges HHS to support States in their
implementation of the plans by providing specialized, non-punitive
family support services for infants and their birth parents affected
by substance use disorders to reduce the need for child welfare or
foster care system involvement. The Committee recognizes the in-
tent of plans of safe care and encourages these plans to be put into
place before the birth of a child to foster the best outcome for the
baby. The Committee continues to direct HHS to provide technical
assistance to States on best-practices in this area to address the
health, developmental, housing, and treatment needs of infants and
their parents and to evaluate States’ activities on plans of safe
care. The Committee also encourages HHS to provide technical as-
sistance to States on best practices for developing notification sys-
tems that are distinct and separate from the system used in the
State to report child abuse and neglect in order to promote a public
health response to infants affected by substance use disorders, and
not for the purpose of initiating an investigation of child abuse or
neglect. The Committee also encourages HHS to ensure such tech-
nical assistance includes an emphasis on the role of public health
focused plans of safe care in reducing racial disproportionality in
child protective services investigations and removals.
Child Abuse Discretionary Activities
The Committee provides $36,000,000 for Child Abuse Discre-
tionary Activities. This program supports discretionary grants for
research, demonstration, and technical assistance to increase the
knowledge base of evidence-based practices and to disseminate in-
formation to State and local child welfare programs.
Child Abuse Hotline.—The Committee continues funding for this
program.
Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention
The Committee provides $70,660,000 for the Community-based
Child Abuse Prevention program. This program provides formula
grants to States that then disburse funds to local community-based
organizations to improve local child abuse prevention and treat-
ment efforts, including providing direct services and improving the
coordination between State and community-based organizations.
The Committee recognizes the importance of prevention and en-
courages funds to be used for primary prevention activities and to
engage in partnerships at the State and local level to reduce child
abuse and neglect and provide supports to families.

218
Child Welfare Services
The Committee provides $268,735,000 for Child Welfare Services.
This formula grant program helps State and Tribal public welfare
agencies improve their child welfare services with the goal of keep-
ing families together. These funds help States and Tribes provide
a continuum of services that prevent child neglect, abuse or exploi-
tation; allow children to remain with their families, when appro-
priate; promote the safety and permanence of children in foster
care and adoptive families; and provide training and professional
development to the child welfare workforce.
The Committee understands that children at risk of entering fos-
ter care achieve better outcomes when families are able to provide
a safe and stable environment for their children, thereby allowing
children to stay safely at home. The Committee acknowledges
ACF’s recent regulatory efforts to allow Title IV–E foster care
agencies to claim Federal financial participation for the administra-
tive cost of an attorney providing legal representation to eligible
children and certain other individuals involved in foster care and
other civil legal proceedings.
Child Welfare Research, Training, and Demonstration
The Committee provides $21,984,000 for child welfare research,
training, and demonstration projects. This program provides grants
to public and nonprofit organizations for demonstration projects
that encourage experimental and promising types of child welfare
services, as well as projects that improve education and training
programs for child welfare service providers.
Driver’s License Program Foster Youth.—The Committee encour-
ages the establishment of a demonstration expanding foster care
and adoption assistance programs to provide driving preparation
assistance to foster youth and related training for foster parents,
as well as assistance to States and Tribal organizations for age-ap-
propriate foster youth to, among other things, obtain automobile in-
surance, complete driver’s education, obtain a driver’s license, and
purchase a vehicle.
Extending Foster Care.—The Committee recognizes the positive
educational, behavioral, social, and health outcomes associated
with participation in extended foster care under Title IV–E. The
Committee encourages GAO to update and expand its 2019 report
entitled ‘‘States with Approval to Extend Care Provide Independent
Living Options for Youth up to Age 21,’’ and provide a review of
States’ implementation of extended foster care under Title IV–E,
including options for youth to reenter the foster care system, eligi-
ble populations, living options and access to these options, and
model of case management. Additionally, such report shall include
input from youth participating in extended foster care, case man-
agers, and State child welfare services agency staff.
Strengthening State ICWA Compliance.—The Committee recog-
nizes the important role State child welfare agencies play in ensur-
ing the safety of Indian children who come into contact with the
State child welfare system. The Committee appreciates the work of
the Children’s Bureau and the Tribal Engagement Team to support
State compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA]
through technical assistance and through grants to develop strong

219
working relationships between States and tribes. The Committee
encourages continued staffing of this team to ensure the ability to
fulfill trust obligations to Native children and families The Com-
mittee continues $3,000,000 for State-Tribal partnership grants to
build collaborations between States and tribes to better address the
ongoing challenges Tribal communities face. Further, the Com-
mittee encourages ACF, in coordination with the relevant Federal
agencies, to develop guidance for States to better serve Indian chil-
dren who come into contact with the child welfare system. This
guidance may include best practices on the timely identification of
Indian children and extended family members; timely notice to
Tribes of State child custody proceedings; foster care or adoptive
placements of Indian children; and case recordkeeping as it relates
to transfers of jurisdiction, termination of parental rights, and in-
sufficient active efforts, as defined by ICWA. The Committee in-
structs the Children’s Bureau and the Tribal Engagement Team to
brief the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enact-
ment regarding implementation of the Indian Child Welfare Act.
Adoption Opportunities
The Committee provides $53,000,000 for the Adoption Opportuni-
ties program. This program funds discretionary grants to help fa-
cilitate the elimination of barriers to adoption and provide tech-
nical assistance to help States increase the number of children
adopted, particularly children with special needs.
The Committee recognizes that adoption arrangements at risk of
a disruption or dissolution that would result in a foster care place-
ment are eligible for funding under the Family First Prevention
Services Act. However, no programs expressly designed to meet the
needs of these families have been approved by the Title IV–E Pre-
vention Services Clearinghouse. The Committee directs not less
than $2,000,000 for the evaluation of such programs that could
qualify for funding under the Family First Prevention Services Act
and aim to meet the evidence standards established by the Title
IV–E Prevention Services Clearinghouse in accordance with the
Family First Prevention Services Act. The Committee encourages
ACF to prioritize the evaluation of programs with existing evidence
and to support studies that can be completed as rapidly as possible
while meeting the evidence standards of the Title IV–E Prevention
Services Clearinghouse.
The Committee provides $2,000,000 to continue the National
Adoption Competency Mental Health Training Initiative. This ini-
tiative supports ongoing resources for a national organization with
the capacity and expertise to continuously evaluate and update the
training curriculums, and will provide all States, tribes, and terri-
tories the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the curricu-
lums are appropriately used by State child welfare and mental
health professionals.
Adoption-Sensitive Clinical Care [ASCC].—The Committee en-
courages HHS to continue and enhance dissemination of this train-
ing to hospital-based professionals and other healthcare workers.
National Center for Adoption Competent Mental Health Serv-
ices.—The Committee recognizes the need for States to improve ac-
cessibility of mental health services that are responsive to the

220
needs of all youth in the care of the child welfare system and in
adoption/guardianship homes. The Committee continues to support
the work of the National Center for Adoption Competent Mental
Health Services to help States bridge the gap between child welfare
and mental health systems and better meet the complex needs of
vulnerable youth.
National Training and Development Curriculum [NTDC].—The
Committee directs HHS to provide $1,000,000, the same as the fis-
cal year 2024 enacted level, for the NTDC as directed in the ex-
planatory statement that accompanied Division D of Public Law
118–47.
Support for Birth Parents.—The Committee recognizes that birth
parents who voluntarily place their children for adoption often ben-
efit from post-adoption counseling, support, and resources. The
Committee supports programs that provide support groups, re-
sources, and services to birth parents.
Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments
The Committee provides $75,000,000 for the Adoption and Legal
Guardianship Incentive Payments program. This program provides
formula-based incentive payments to States to encourage them to
increase the number of adoptions of children from the foster care
system, with an emphasis on children who are the hardest to place.
Social Services Research and Demonstration
The Committee provides $71,063,000 for Social Services Research
and Demonstration. These funds support research and evaluation
of cost-effective programs that increase the stability and economic
independence of families and contribute to the healthy development
of children and youth.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—Within the funds included
in this account, $41,051,000 shall be for the Congressionally Di-
rected Spending projects, and in the amounts, as specified in the
table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending Items’’ at the end
of this Committee Report.
Diaper Distribution Grant Demonstration.—The Committee con-
tinues to provide $20,000,000 for the purposes of carrying out a di-
aper distribution grant program. The diaper distribution program
will provide grants to social service agencies or other non-profit or-
ganizations specifically for diaper and diapering supply needs.
Institutional Child Abuse Study.—The Committee provides
$2,000,000 and directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
[NASEM] to conduct a study to examine the state of youth in youth
residential programs and make recommendations. Pursuant to the
contract, NASEM shall issue a report informed by the study con-
ducted that includes identification of the nature, prevalence, sever-
ity, and scope of child abuse, neglect, and deaths in youth residen-
tial programs, including types of abuse and neglect, causes of
abuse, neglect, and deaths, and criteria used to assess abuse, ne-
glect, and deaths; identification of all funding sources for youth res-
idential programs; and identification of existing barriers in policy
for blending and braiding of funding sources to serve youth in com-
munity-based settings.

221
Preventing Youth Homelessness.—The Committee includes
$5,000,000 to continue the preventing youth homelessness dem-
onstration program to identify and implement strategies and serv-
ices for youth between ages 12 and 26 in order to prevent home-
lessness, including strategies designed to serve youth and young
adult populations with a high likelihood of imminently experi-
encing homelessness, housing instability, or other forms of victim-
ization such as human trafficking to include individuals
transitioning out of foster care, the juvenile justice system, or a
residential behavioral health system.
The Committee directs that a portion of funds be made available
to State agencies, tribes, counties, cities, other units of local gov-
ernment, or community-based organizations for planning and im-
plementation demonstration grants to provide primary prevention
for youth and young adults at risk of homelessness. Grantees shall
show collaboration with youth with lived expertise in project design
and implementation and funds may be used to support the estab-
lishment and operation of local youth advisory boards. The remain-
ing funds shall be used to support the demonstrations through
evaluation, training, and technical assistance. The Committee rec-
ognizes the important work accomplished by the one-time Runaway
and Homeless Youth prevention demonstration program and urges
the Family and Youth Services Bureau to continue to support those
efforts through a portion of the preventing youth homelessness
demonstration program.
Native American Programs
The Committee provides $60,500,000 for Native American pro-
grams. These funds support a variety of programs to promote self-
sufficiency and cultural preservation activities among Native Amer-
ican, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander organi-
zations and communities.
Native American Language Preservation.—Within the total, the
Committee includes $15,000,000 for Native American language
preservation activities, including no less than $6,000,000 for Native
American language immersion programs, as authorized by section
803C(b)(7)(A)-(B) of the Native American Programs Act (Public Law
88–452).
Tribal Programs.—The Committee notes the importance of inte-
grated and tribally-determined, high-quality early childhood serv-
ices for Tribal children and their families. The Committee requests
a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this act on the benefits
of allowing Tribes to fully integrate funding across Head Start,
CCDBG, and the Tribal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood
Home Visiting programs.
Community Services Block Grant
The Committee provides $770,000,000 for the Community Serv-
ices Block Grant [CSBG]. CSBG is a formula grant to States and
Indian tribes to provide a wide-range of services to alleviate causes
of poverty in communities and to assist low-income individuals.
States are required to pass on at least 90 percent of these funds
to local community-based organizations, the vast majority of which
are community action agencies.

222
Community Economic Development
The Committee provides $22,383,000 for the Community Eco-
nomic Development program. Community Economic Development
grants fund non-profit, Community Development Corporations that
help communities address the needs of low-income individuals and
families by creating employment and business development oppor-
tunities.
Rural Community Facilities
The Committee provides $12,000,000 for the Rural Community
Facilities program. The Rural Community Facilities program pro-
vides grants to regional non-profit organizations to provide tech-
nical assistance to small, low-income rural communities, that are
not served by other similar Federal programs, to help manage, de-
velop, and improve safe drinking and waste water facilities.
National Domestic Violence Hotline
The Committee provides $20,500,000 for the National Domestic
Violence Hotline. This national, toll-free hotline provides critical
emergency assistance and information to victims of domestic vio-
lence 24 hours a day.
The Committee provides continued support for the StrongHearts
Native Helpline, which provides critical support and resources to
meet the unique legal and cultural needs of American Indians and
Alaska Natives affected by domestic violence.
Family Violence Prevention and Services
The Committee provides $240,000,000 for Family Violence Pre-
vention and Services programs. These funds support programs to
prevent family violence and provide immediate shelter and related
assistance for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and
their dependents.
Culturally Specific Services for Domestic Violence and Sexual As-
sault.—The Committee continues $7,500,000 for culturally specific,
community-based organizations to provide culturally specific series
for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.
Family Violence Prevention and Services Resource Centers.—The
Committee understands the benefits of Family Violence Prevention
and Services Resource Centers to support communities in building
local responses and services for domestic violence survivors. The
Committee includes $2,000,000 for the Alaskan Native Women’s
Resource Center, $2,000,000 for the Native Hawaiian Resource
Center on Domestic Violence, and $2,000,000 for the National In-
digenous Women’s Resource Center to support critical networking
and coalition building between these communities across the State
and the Nation.
Intersection of Domestic Violence, Mental Health, Substance-use
Coercion, Housing Instability, and Child Welfare Involvement.—The
Committee recognizes that research has consistently demonstrated
that experiencing abuse by an intimate partner is associated with
a wide range of mental health and substance use-related con-
sequences, and it is not uncommon for an abusive partner to under-
mine efforts to maintain their recovery or intentionally use their
partner’s struggles with mental health against them. The Com-

223
mittee supports the work of the Office of Family Violence and Pre-
vention Services to invest in targeted support for families affected
by domestic violence at the intersection of domestic violence, hous-
ing insecurity, mental health and substance use conditions, while
ensuring families remain together through recovery and prioritize
the best interests of children exposed to violence in the home.
Sexual Assault Technical Assistance Initiative.—The Committee
strongly recommends providing $2,500,000 for technical assistance
grants to providers with extensive knowledge of and demonstrated
expertise in sexual assault prevention and response to support all
Office of Family Violence and Prevention Services grantees in serv-
ing victims of sexual assault.
Chafee Education and Training Vouchers
The Committee provides $44,257,000 for the Chafee Education
and Training Voucher program. This program supports vouchers to
foster care youth to help pay for expenses related to postsecondary
education and vocational training.
Disaster Human Services Case Management
The Committee provides $1,864,000 for Disaster Human Services
Case Management. This program assists States in establishing the
capacity to provide case management services in a timely manner
in the event of a disaster. It ensures that States are able to meet
social service needs during disasters by helping disaster victims
prepare recovery plans, referring them to service providers and
Federal Emergency Management Agency contacts to identify need-
ed assistance, and providing ongoing support and monitoring
through the recovery process.
Program Administration
The Committee provides $209,000,000 for the Federal costs of ad-
ministering ACF programs.
PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $417,515,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 482,515,000
The Committee provides $482,515,000 for the Promoting Safe
and Stable Families program. The Committee provides
$420,000,000 in mandatory funds authorized by the Social Security
Act (Public Law 74–271) and $62,515,000 in discretionary appro-
priations.
This program enables States to operate coordinated programs of
family preservation services, time-limited family reunification serv-
ices, community-based family support services, and adoption pro-
motion and support services.
Family First Clearinghouse.—The Committee provides
$2,750,000 for the Family First Clearinghouse. The Committee con-
tinues to recognize the need to support research into programs that
provide rigorous evaluations of established foster care prevention
and family support programs within the child welfare population,
including programs that support adoption arrangements at risk of
a disruption or dissolution that would result in foster care place-
ment, provide mental health prevention and treatment services,

224
substance abuse prevention and treatment services, in-home parent
skill-based programs, and kinship navigator programs.
PAYMENTS FOR FOSTER CARE AND PERMANENCY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,768,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,843,000,000
The Committee recommends $6,843,000,000 in mandatory funds
for Payments for Foster Care and Permanency. In addition, the
Committee recommends $3,800,000,000 in advance mandatory
funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. These funds sup-
port programs that assist States with the costs of maintaining eli-
gible children in foster care, prepare children for living on their
own, assist relatives with legal guardianship of eligible children,
and find and support adoptive homes for children with special
needs.
ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING
AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,518,774,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,528,679,000
The Committee provides $2,528,679,000 for the Administration
for Community Living [ACL], which includes $27,700,000 to be
transferred to ACL from the PPH Fund.
ACL was created with the goal of increasing access to community
support for older Americans and people with disabilities. It is
charged with administering programs authorized under the Older
Americans Act [OAA] (Public Law 116–131) and the Developmental
Disabilities Act (Public Law 106–402), as well as promoting com-
munity living policies throughout the Federal Government for older
Americans and people with disabilities. The Committee continues
to fund the Senior Medicare Patrol Program through the Health
Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account.
Home and Community-Based Supportive Services
The Committee provides $410,000,000 for the Home and Commu-
nity-Based Supportive Services program. This program provides
formula grants to States and territories to fund a wide-range of so-
cial services that enable seniors to remain independent and in their
homes for as long as possible. State agencies on aging award funds
to designated area agencies on aging that, in turn, make awards
to local service providers. This activity supports services such as
transportation, adult day care, physical fitness programs, and in-
home assistance.
Senior Centers.—Senior centers play an important role in pro-
viding programs to combat isolation and loneliness, which can be
risk factors for depression, substance use disorder, and even sui-
cide. The Committee encourages ACL and the State and local agen-
cies administering programs funded through the OAA to provide
ample funding to senior centers to support their general operations
and for programming that promotes the health and well-being of
seniors, including fitness and falls prevention programs, nutrition
classes and consultations, and foot clinics.

225
Preventive Health Services
The Committee provides $26,339,000 for Preventive Health Serv-
ices. This program funds activities such as medication management
and enhanced fitness and wellness programs. These programs help
seniors stay healthy and avoid chronic disease, thus reducing the
need for costly medical interventions. The Committee maintains
bill language that requires States to use these funds to support evi-
dence-based models that enhance the wellness of seniors.
Protection of Vulnerable Older Americans
The Committee provides $26,658,000 for grants to States for the
Long-term Care Ombudsman program and the Prevention of Elder
Abuse program. Both programs provide formula grants to States to
prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older individuals.
The Ombudsman program focuses on the needs of residents of
nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, while the elder
abuse prevention program targets the elderly community at large.
National Family Caregiver Support Program
The Committee provides $209,000,000 for the National Family
Caregiver Support program. Funds appropriated for this activity
establish a multifaceted support system in each State for family
caregivers, allowing them to care for their loved ones at home for
as long as possible. States may use funding to provide information
to caregivers about available services, assistance to caregivers in
gaining access to services, caregiver counseling and training, res-
pite care to enable caregivers to be temporarily relieved from their
caregiving responsibilities, and limited supplemental services that
fill remaining service gaps.
National Family Caregiver Strategy.—The Committee provides
$3,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000, to support demonstration
grants that develop, test, and scale models that implement commit-
ments and recommended actions from the National Strategy to
Support Family Caregivers. The Committee directs ACL to provide
a briefing for the Committee on Appropriations no later than 90
days after enactment of this act with an update on the implemen-
tation of this effort.
Native American Caregiver Support Program
The Committee provides $12,000,000 to carry out the Native
American Caregiver Support program. This program provides
grants to Tribes for the support of American Indian, Alaskan Na-
tive, and Native Hawaiian families caring for older relatives with
chronic illness or disability, as well as for grandparents caring for
grandchildren.
Congregate and Home-Delivered Nutrition Services
The Committee provides $565,342,000 for congregate nutrition
services and $381,342,000 for home-delivered meals. These pro-
grams address the nutritional needs of older individuals, thus help-
ing them to stay healthy and reduce their risk of disability. Funded
projects must make home-delivered and congregate meals available
at least once per day, 5 days a week, and each meal must meet a
minimum of one-third of daily dietary requirements. While States

226
receive separate allotments of funds for congregate meals, home-de-
livered meals, and supportive services, they have flexibility to
transfer funds between these programs.
Community-Based Organizations.—The Committee recognizes
the important work of community-based organizations that provide
home-delivered and congregate meals and act as a point of social
connection for vulnerable older adults. The Committee encourages
State units on aging and area agencies on aging to continue to
work with experienced, community-based organizations, such as
Meals on Wheels programs, when selecting local nutrition pro-
viders and distributing OAA funding.
Nutrition Services Incentives Program [NSIP].—The Committee
provides $112,000,000 for NSIP. NSIP augments funding for con-
gregate and home-delivered meals provided to older adults. States
and Tribes may choose to receive all or part of their funding in the
form of commodities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Aging Grants to Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations
The Committee provides $38,264,000 for grants to Native Ameri-
cans. This program provides grants to eligible Tribal organizations
for the delivery of nutrition and supportive services to Native
Americans.
In-Home Modifications.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of in-home services in facilitating the ability of older individ-
uals to remain at home. The Committee encourages ACL to better
understand these needs in Native American communities and en-
courages ACL to undertake an evaluation of the level of need for
in-home services that include accessible home modifications for
older individuals who are Native Americans. In doing so, ACL
should also examine the extent to which current ACL programming
is able to meet such needs.
Native American Nutrition and Support Services.—The Com-
mittee is aware of concerns regarding potential barriers to Indian
Tribes accessing programs and resources under title VI and title III
of the OAA. The Committee encourages ACL to convene with stake-
holders to understand these concerns and work to ensure that pro-
grams and resources are reaching Tribal members.
Aging Network Support Activities
The Committee provides $30,461,000 for Aging Network Support
activities. These funds support activities that expand public under-
standing of aging and the aging process, apply social research and
analysis to improve access to and delivery of services for older indi-
viduals, test innovative ideas and programs, and provide technical
assistance to agencies that administer programs authorized by the
OAA.
Holocaust Survivor Assistance.—The Committee provides
$8,500,000 for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance program, which
provides supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors and
their families, and to other older adult populations that have been
exposed to and impacted by traumatic events, including aging mili-
tary veterans, first responders, victims of childhood and domestic
violence, and survivors of man-made or natural disasters.

227
Housing-Based Care Management Models.—The Committee is
supportive of efforts to maintain, expand, or adapt evidence-based,
existing population health models serving older adults and young
adults with a disability. The Committee encourages ACL to explore
the feasibility of housing-based care management models that are
scalable, increase primary care access for low-income Medicare and
dual eligible beneficiaries on a continuous longitudinal basis, re-
duce the rate of growth in Medicare spending and nursing home
driven Medicaid costs, and benefit those living in any type of pub-
licly assisted housing and the surrounding community where resi-
dents have chronic health conditions and are in need of preventive
health programs.
Alzheimer’s Disease Program
The Committee provides $16,800,000, including $14,700,000 to be
transferred from the PPH Fund, for the Alzheimer’s Disease Pro-
gram which includes Demonstration Grants to States and the Alz-
heimer’s Disease Initiative. Within this funding, the Committee
supports the continuation of the National Alzheimer’s Call Center,
which is available in all States, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
year-round, to provide expert advice, crisis counseling, care con-
sultation and information referral services in at least 140 lan-
guages, for persons with Alzheimer’s disease, their family members
and informal caregivers. The Committee provides no less than
$2,000,000 to continue the National Alzheimer’s Call Center.
Lifespan Respite Care
The Committee provides $11,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000,
for the Lifespan Respite Care program. The Lifespan Respite Care
program provides grants to States to expand respite care services
to family caregivers, improve the local coordination of respite care
resources, and improve access to and quality of respite care serv-
ices, thereby reducing family caregiver strain.
Chronic Disease Self-Management Program
The Committee provides $8,000,000 to be transferred from the
PPH Fund to ACL for the Chronic Disease Self-Management Pro-
gram [CDSMP]. This program assists those with chronic disease
with education to manage their conditions and improve their
health status. Topics covered by the program include nutrition; ap-
propriate use of medications; fitness; and effective communications
with healthcare providers. Multiple studies have shown CDSMP to
result in significant and measurable improvements in health and
quality of life, as well as reductions in hospitalizations and emer-
gency room visits.
Elder Falls Prevention
The Committee provides $7,500,000, including $5,000,000 to be
transferred from the PPH Fund, for Elder Falls Prevention activi-
ties at ACL. Preventing falls will help seniors stay independent
and in their homes and avoid costly hospitalizations and hip frac-
tures, which frequently lead to nursing home placement.

228
Elder Rights Support Activities
The Committee provides $33,874,000 for Elder Rights Support
activities, which support programs that provide information, train-
ing, and technical assistance to legal and aging services organiza-
tions in order to prevent and detect elder abuse and neglect.

Assistance Programs, which provide accurate and understandable
health insurance information to Medicare beneficiaries and their
families.
Paralysis Resource Center
The Committee provides $10,700,000 for the Paralysis Resource
Center [PRC]. This program has long provided essential, com-
prehensive information, and referral services that promote inde-
pendence and quality of life for the over five million people living
with paralysis and their families. The Committee directs ACL to
support the National PRC at not less than $10,000,000.
Limb Loss
The Committee provides $4,200,000 for the Limb Loss program,
which supports programs and activities to improve the health of
people with limb loss and promote their well-being, quality of life,
prevent disease, and provide support to their families and care-
givers. Maintaining these programs is critical to support inde-
pendent living within the disability community across their life
course.
Traumatic Brain Injury
The Committee provides $13,118,000 for the Traumatic Brain In-
jury program. The program supports implementation and planning
grants to States for coordination and improvement of services to in-
dividuals and families with traumatic brain injuries. Such services
can include pre-hospital care, emergency department care, hospital
care, rehabilitation, transitional services, education, employment,
long-term support, and protection and advocacy services.
Developmental Disabilities State Councils
The Committee provides $81,000,000 for State Councils on Devel-
opmental Disabilities. These Councils work to develop, improve,
and expand the system of services and supports for people with de-
velopmental disabilities at the State and local level. Councils en-
gage in activities such as training, educating the public, building
capacity, and advocating for change in State policies with the goal
of furthering the inclusion and integration of individuals with de-
velopmental disabilities in all aspects of community life.

229
Technical Assistance.—The Committee directs ACL to provide not
less than $800,000 for technical assistance and training for the
State Councils on Developmental Disabilities. In addition, the Com-
mittee encourages ACL to consult with Developmental Disabilities
Assistance and Bill of Rights Act [DD Act] stakeholders prior to an-
nouncing opportunities for new technical assistance projects and to
notify the Committee prior to releasing new funding opportunity
announcements, grants, or contract awards with technical assist-
ance funding.
Developmental Disabilities Protection and Advocacy
The Committee provides $45,000,000 for protection and advocacy
programs for people with developmental disabilities. This formula
grant program provides funds to States to establish and maintain
protection and advocacy systems that protect the legal and human
rights of persons with developmental disabilities who are receiving
treatment, services, or rehabilitation.
Proper Settings of Care.—The Committee encourages ACL to con-
sider the needs and desires of patients, families, caregivers, legal
representatives, and other stakeholders, as well as the need to pro-
vide proper settings for care, in its enforcement of the DD Act.
Voting Access for Individuals with Disabilities
The Committee provides $10,000,000 to improve voting access for
individuals with disabilities. This program provides grants to pro-
tection and advocacy organizations to ensure that individuals with
disabilities have the opportunity to participate in every step of the
electoral process, including registering to vote, accessing polling
places, and casting a vote.
Developmental Disabilities Projects of National Significance
The Committee provides $12,250,000 for projects of national sig-
nificance to assist persons with developmental disabilities. This
program funds grants and contracts that develop new technologies
and demonstrate innovative methods to support the independence,
productivity, and integration into the community of persons with
developmental disabilities.
University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities
The Committee provides $43,119,000 for the University Centers
for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities [UCEDDs] to continue
to meet their obligations under the DD Act. UCEDDs provide train-
ing, technical assistance, service, research, and information dis-
semination to people with disabilities, their families, State and
local government agencies, and providers, to build the capacity of
communities and create improvements in the service delivery sys-
tem for people with I/DD and other disabilities, including those
from underrepresented populations. The funding also will support
technical assistance to strengthen and support the National net-
work of UCEDDs as they disseminate research, training, and prac-
tices nationwide.

230
Independent Living
The Committee provides $128,183,000 for the Independent Liv-
ing program, which helps ensure that individuals with disabilities
can live productive and independent lives in society. Funding helps
States sustain, improve, and expand independent living services
and establish and support a network of centers for independent liv-
ing.
National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabili-
tation Research [NIDILRR]
The Committee provides $119,000,000 for the NIDILRR, which
supports research and activities that help to maximize the full po-
tential of individuals with disabilities in employment, independent
living, and social activities. NIDILRR is the only government entity
charged to focus on the whole person with a disability and their
ability to function independently and maintain a high quality of life
among all personal, societal and environmental factors. The appro-
priation continues funding to support the Traumatic Brain Injury
Model Systems National Data and Statistical Center.
Assistive Technology
The Committee provides $40,000,000 for Assistive Technology
[AT]. AT provides States with funding to support individuals with
disabilities of all ages to obtain devices and services that will in-
crease, maintain, or improve their functional capabilities. With the
reauthorization of the 21st Century Assistive Technology Act, the
Committee supports implementation to meet the increased demand
for access to assistive technology for people with disabilities and
older adults. In doing so, the Committee eliminates the alternative
financing program that duplicates resources already available
under the 21st Century Assistive Technology Act.
Program Administration
The Committee provides $41,000,000 for program administration
at ACL. These funds support salaries and related expenses for pro-
gram management and oversight activities.
Congressionally Directed Spending.—The Committee includes
$13,968,000 for aging and disability services projects, as specified
in the table at the end of this Committee Report.
Grant Tables.—The Committee notes with disappointment, the
failure to include in its fiscal year 2026 Congressional Justification
[CJ], relevant formula and competitive grant award tables and out-
come and output tables. It is critically important for Congress to
conduct oversight of appropriated funding for formula and competi-
tive grants. In the fiscal year 2027 CJ, the Committee directs ACL
to include grant tables and outcome and output tables, consistent
with the fiscal year 2025 CJ.
Report.—Within 60 days of enactment of this act and every 60
days thereafter, the Committee directs ACL to provide a report de-
tailing the status of funding for Congressional Directed Spending
projects for the previous three fiscal years. Such a report shall be
presented in Excel format and include a project description, House
and Senate requestors, the type of award, total obligations, total
disbursements, and the percent disbursed.

231
ADMINISTRATION FOR STRATEGIC PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
The Committee provides $3,616,597,000 for the Administration
for Strategic Preparedness and Response [ASPR]. This appropria-
tion supports the activities of ASPR and other components within
the Office of the Secretary to prepare for the health consequences
of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including pan-
demic influenza.
Department of Defense Coordination.—The Committee under-
stands the critical role of the Department of Defense [DoD] in the
larger U.S. Government and private sector efforts to address chem-
ical, biological, radiological, and nuclear [CBRN] threats as well as
emerging infectious diseases. The DoD possesses unique capabili-
ties that contribute to interagency efforts to prevent, detect, and re-
spond to outbreaks of infectious disease worldwide. The Committee
encourages prioritizing and aligning investments in medical coun-
termeasures among all Federal stakeholders to ensure that effec-
tive countermeasures are developed to meet both military and civil-
ian needs, and to prevent potential duplication of efforts. The Com-
mittee urges ASPR and DoD to coordinate to leverage private in-
dustry expertise to meet these needs.
Health Security and Preparedness.—Global health crises includ-
ing Ebola, COVID–19, mpox, and avian influenza, have highlighted
weaknesses in our National ability to respond to biothreats. Within
1 year after enactment, ASPR shall deliver a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations on all-hazards preparedness at HHS. The
report must include an integration of preparedness and future re-
sponse plans from the National Disaster Medical System [NDMS],
National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Cen-
ter [NETEC], and others relevant HHS programs.
Interagency Alignment of Biomedical Countermeasures Research
and Development.—The Committee has prioritized investments in
R&D of biodefense medical countermeasures through several dif-
ferent HHS components, depending on their particular missions
and areas of expertise; however, there are no rigorous mechanisms
in place to ensure the alignment of medical countermeasures re-
quirements, priorities, projects, and project transitions across each
of the agencies responsible for various phases of product develop-
ment, including basic research, preclinical development, advance
development, and procurement. The Committee urges ASPR to co-
ordinate with the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness
and Response [OPPR], and interagency partners that comprise the
Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, to
improve alignment and efficiency of medical countermeasures re-
search and development activities across Federal agencies, espe-
cially to ensure the end-to-end development of needed products,
technologies, or platforms. ASPR is encouraged to work with
NIAID, BARDA, FDA, CDC, related efforts of the Department of
Defense’s biodefense R&D programs, and similar R&D programs
funded by the Department of Energy.
Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise
[PHEMCE].—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
PHEMCE in ensuring the Nation’s preparedness for CBRN and
emerging infectious disease threats. The Committee directs ASPR

232
to continue to partner with PHEMCE interagency partners in the
execution of those functions. The Committee further directs ASPR,
working with PHEMCE and intelligence community partners, to
provide an annual classified threat briefing to the Committees on
Appropriations, and as situations arise that may materially impact
our medical countermeasure enterprise. This advisory committee
should encompass a diverse array of external partners to ensure
comprehensive expertise in addressing various threats, thus for-
tifying the Nation’s overall preparedness. To the extent practicable,
PHEMCE’s strategic planning and decision-making around stock-
pile needs, requirements, and interactions with other government
agencies and the communication of such decisions should be made
in concert with the advisory committee considering the inputs from
private partners. ASPR is directed to report to the Committee with-
in 120 days of enactment to provide an update on these activities,
including efforts to engage industry representatives.
Reporting.—The Committee directs ASPR to brief the Commit-
tees on Appropriations monthly regarding activities funded by this
act and other available appropriations. The agency shall notify the
Committees on Appropriations at least 24 hours in advance of any
obligation greater than $25,000,000 from any appropriation avail-
able to ASPR. The agency shall also notify the Committees on Ap-
propriations at least 24 hours in advance of any grant or contract
termination greater than $25,000,000 from any appropriation avail-
able to ASPR. Such notification shall include the source of funding,
including the applicable legislative citation, a description of the ob-
ligation, and a justification for the termination, if applicable. In ad-
dition, ASPR shall submit two separate monthly reports in elec-
tronic format summarizing the details of any grant or contract obli-
gations and terminations to the Committees on Appropriations.
Such reports shall be due not later than 30 days after the end of
each month and shall be cumulative for the fiscal year with the
most recent obligations or terminations listed at the top. Further-
more, ASPR shall include in this monthly report the current inven-
tory of COVID–19 therapeutics, as well as the deployment of these
therapeutics during the previous month as reported by States and
other jurisdictions until the inventory is expended. Finally, ASPR
shall also notify the Committees on Appropriations at least 24
hours in advance of any funding transfer greater than $25,000,000
from any appropriation available to ASPR to any other agency or
Department. Such notification shall include the source of funding,
including the applicable legislative citation, a description of the ob-
ligation, and a justification for the transfer.
Report on Essential Medicines Risk Assessment.—The Committee
requests the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaries of De-
fense and Homeland Security as well as the Director of the Office
of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, to submit a report
within 18 months of enactment of this act, assessing the FDA’s up-
dated Essential Medicines List. Specifically, the report shall assess
and identify, to the extent available: (1) key starting materials and
excipients used in manufacturing the active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients and drugs on the essential medicines list; (2) the names of
the active pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs on the essential
medicines list that rely on high-risk foreign suppliers for more than

233
50 percent of production; (3) current domestic manufacturing capa-
bilities for drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients on the es-
sential medicines list, including their key starting materials and
excipients, and any cost-effective manufacturing technologies, in-
cluding advanced manufacturing, that should or should not be con-
sidered; (4) national security risks, including cybersecurity threats
and critical infrastructure designations; (5) any deficiencies, lack of
authorities, or limitations in policy or process that limit the De-
partments of Health and Human Services, Defense, or Homeland
Security to address any national security risks in the pharma-
ceutical supply chain; and (6) how the Departments of Health and
Human Services, Defense, or Homeland Security will mitigate such
national security risks, including through its use of the Defense
Production Act.
Rural Medical Autonomy.—The Committee is fully aware of the
challenges facing emergency medical response to natural or man-
made disasters in rural areas. Resources are often limited and re-
mote, leading to delays in treatment that result in poor outcomes.
The role of autonomous systems can be invaluable, quickly pro-
viding life-saving tools across a range of medical applications such
as drone delivery of critical medical supplies and drugs, as well as
autonomous air and ground systems that evaluate safety in a
chem-bio, electrical hazard or fire environment. Autonomous sys-
tems can be paired with telemedicine capabilities to deliver real-
time connectivity between emergency responders and Level 1 trau-
ma centers and other emergency medicine professionals. ASPR is
directed to report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment
on efforts to develop, test and demonstrate the role that autono-
mous systems can play to improve emergency medical applications
in rural America.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND PROCUREMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,135,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,127,991,000
The Committee provides $3,127,991,000 for ASPR’s Research,
Development, and Procurement activities. This appropriation sup-
ports the advanced research, development, regulatory approval,
and procurement of life-saving medical products-drugs, vaccines,
therapeutics, diagnostics, and medical devices—that are collectively
known as medical countermeasures [MCMs]. These MCMs serve as
life-saving technologies during public health emergencies involving
CBRN threats and other emerging threats, while advancing the
day-to-day public health and medical capabilities. In addition to de-
veloping these products, this appropriation also supports ensuring
certain qualifying MCMs and medical supplies are stockpiled to be
ready to deploy when needed.
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority
[BARDA]
The Committee recommendation includes $1,015,000,000 for
BARDA. BARDA supports the advanced development of vaccines,
therapeutics, diagnostics and devices for potential serious public
health threats, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nu-
clear threats, pandemic influenza, and emerging and re-emerging

234
infectious diseases. BARDA played a critical role in the COVID–19
and Mpox outbreak responses, and swiftly acted in response to re-
cent Marburg, Sudan, and Ebola Zaire outbreaks. The Committee
encourages BARDA to expand its portfolio of partnerships for
broader success.
Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee continues to
support advanced research and development of broad-spectrum
antimicrobials, particularly for multi-drug resistant pathogens, and
next-generation therapeutics that address the increasing incidence
of antimicrobial resistance.
Antimicrobial Resistance Research Using Bispecific Agents.—The
Committee understands that research exists to develop therapies
that directly engage the host immune system to kill bacterial cells,
mirroring treatments in proven cancer drugs. Such an approach
may open the door to new variations of treatment, allowing for
more personalized and more precise medicinal treatments. The
Committee encourages BARDA to invest in these and additional
novel ways to treat bacterial infections that reduce or circumvent
the antimicrobial resistance seen with conventional antibiotics.
Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Partnership [BioMAP].—The
Committee appreciates BARDA taking steps to strengthen our Na-
tion’s MCM enterprise, including through the BioMaP and supports
efforts to expand domestic manufacturing infrastructure for MCMs.
Given the global nature of certain clinical research, development,
and manufacturing activities, it is critical for BARDA to strength-
en, expand, and make progress in onshoring these programs. With-
in 120 days of enactment, BARDA shall brief the Committee on
BARDA’s plans in fiscal year 2025 to support the onshoring of
MCM development activities, including actions taken by BioMaP.
Blood Supply.—The Committee remains concerned about the vul-
nerability of the blood supply after the peak COVID shortages and
the HHS Advisory Committee on Blood and Tissue Safety and
Availability report indicating that the blood supply faces significant
threats and challenges. The Committee supports the report’s rec-
ommendation to implement new technologies to improve the safety
and reliability of the blood supply. The BARDA strategic objective
to develop next generation blood products must go beyond treat-
ment of radiation injuries and be expanded to include products that
can be used regardless of the patient’s blood group, expand avail-
ability to all hospitals, prevent shortages, and be suitable for use
throughout the continuum of care including first responders. Suit-
able products that are in clinical trials should be considered a pri-
ority for funding. The Committee urges BARDA to expand the de-
velopment of freeze-dried hemostatic products, especially platelet-
derived products, to include a wide range of indications encom-
passing treatment of hemorrhagic disease, use in general surgery,
obstetrics, and trauma. Further, the Committee recommends con-
sideration for investments in next generation blood products should
be prioritized based on the clinical stage of development to ensure
a rapid deployment of product(s) which fulfill existing capability
gaps for a resilient blood supply. The Committee encourages the
Secretary to consider a pilot project to expand manufacturing ca-
pacity such that a regional cryopreserved platelet [CPP] pilot pro-
gram can be established in an at-risk geographic location. The Sec-

235
retary shall provide a biannual report to the Committee detailing
the progress on these efforts.
CBRN Threats.—The Committee expresses deep concern regard-
ing the heightened risks posed by CBRN weapons worldwide. The
Committee provides robust funding for BARDA’s core national se-
curity mission to protect Americans against these deliberate, man-
made threats. The Committee urges ASPR to prioritize the develop-
ment and stockpiling of critical CBRN vaccines, treatments, and
diagnostics to ensure uninterrupted access to these life-saving
MCMs within the Strategic National Stockpile [SNS]. The Com-
mittee encourages ASPR to engage more frequently with private
sector partners to speed the development of new MCMs and stock-
piling of existing MCMs against CBRN threats.
Clostridioides difficile [C. diff].—The Committee recognizes that
C. diff infections are an urgent problem in patient care settings, re-
sulting in 476,000 infections which cause 20,500 deaths annually
in the United States. Currently, one in six patients diagnosed with
C. diff will be re-diagnosed in the subsequent 2–8 weeks and one
in 11 people over the age of 65 diagnosed with healthcare associ-
ated C. diff infection die within 1 month. The Committee strongly
encourages BARDA to support research and clinical trials for the
development of a novel treatment for C. diff that prevents anti-
biotic resistance and recurrent infection, as seen in existing treat-
ments.
Diagnostic Rapid Response Initiative [DxR2].—Biological threats
remain a persistent and evolving danger, requiring robust and
proactive preparedness measures. The Committee is encouraged by
HHS and BARDA leadership in developing the DxR2. It is critical
that BARDA moves forward expeditiously to establish an afford-
able, scalable solution that leverages or enhances existing commer-
cial infrastructure to address these ongoing national security
threats. This program strikes the necessary balance, safeguarding
public health while strengthening the Nation’s capacity to respond
effectively to emergencies with a long-term, affordable, and sustain-
able approach. Continued investment in DxR2 is essential to en-
hancing our National ability to rapidly respond to biothreat inci-
dents. BARDA is encouraged to maintain this important program
as a priority within the PHEMCE portfolio.
Fungal Threats.—The Committee also recognizes the health se-
curity threat presented by rising global fungal infection rates and
increasing antifungal resistance. The Committee urges BARDA to
consider its role in protecting Americans from fungal infections by
reviewing vaccine, drug, and therapeutics in the development pipe-
line with specific consideration for partnerships to develop fungal
products.
Infectious Diseases.—The Committee supports robust funding for
BARDA’s naturally occurring infectious disease programs, includ-
ing emerging infectious diseases, AMR, and pandemic influenza.
The Committee encourages BARDA to account for low-resource set-
tings and vulnerable populations, such as children and neonates, in
its funding decisions to produce tools that have wide applicability
for many geographies in the United States and globally that lack
advanced health infrastructure. The Committee encourages ASPR
to project its spending on emerging infectious diseases, AMR, and

236
pandemic influenza in its annual 5-year budget plan. The Com-
mittee requests that BARDA continue publicly updating its re-
search portfolios to include pathogen, product, phase, and funding
data for all its programs, and to provide the underlying data in
tabular form. Finally, the Committee requests BARDA provide a
report within 180 days of enactment on its role to date in equip-
ping the United States to address potential, naturally occurring, or
engineered infectious agents that risk the health, security, eco-
nomic wellbeing and lives of Americans.
Infectious Disease Outbreaks With Pandemic Potential.—The
Committee supports robust funding for BARDA to engage in public-
private partnerships to support advanced R&D of innovative plat-
form technologies and MCM programs focused on (but not limited
to) vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other MCMs for emerg-
ing infectious diseases, including novel pathogens and viral fami-
lies with pandemic potential. The Committee encourages ASPR to
prioritize the identification and development of promising tech-
nologies that can be leveraged to address a range of future patho-
gens, including virus families with significant pandemic potential.
In addition, the Committee directs BARDA to allocate no less than
$10,000,000 in fiscal year 2025 to support the Disease X Medical
Countermeasure Program at BARDA for expeditious development
of MCMs against priority viral families, including those effective
against novel pandemic pathogens.
Next Generation Smallpox Biodefense.—As tensions with coun-
tries of concern continue to increase, the Committee recognizes the
need to ensure preparedness against biological terror threats. The
Committee is concerned about the ongoing threat smallpox poses to
both national security and public health, and recognizes there are
existing gaps in vaccination and treatment, that would prevent a
timely and effective response in the event of an outbreak. The
Committee is aware of advancements in next generation thera-
peutics for smallpox, specifically monoclonal antibody drugs, which
could address safety and efficacy issues associated with products
currently available in the stockpile. Therefore, the Committee
urges ASPR to prioritize the advanced development of monoclonal
antibody drug products for the treatment of smallpox. Additionally,
to ensure the government is investing in safe and effective medical
countermeasures, the Committee urges ASPR to partner with ap-
propriate Federal agencies like NIH to conduct a review of natural
and engineered resistance of biothreat agents in the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile. ASPR is directed to update the Committee on
these efforts within 1 year of enactment.
Preventing Respiratory Infections in Hospitals.—The Committee
is concerned about the continued public health threat posed by
healthcare-associated infections [HAIs], especially respiratory infec-
tions that are the greatest contributor to HAIs. Respiratory HAIs
are directly responsible for deaths and rising healthcare costs; con-
tribute to the growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance by increas-
ing the use of antibiotics and antivirals; and severely strain our
healthcare systems during times of pandemics or potential bio-at-
tacks. The Committee therefore encourages BARDA to prioritize ef-
forts to advance respiratory technologies like ultraviolet [UV] res-
pirators intended for use by patients in hospital and healthcare fa-

237
cility settings who have respiratory infections, which eliminate
pathogens in exhaled breath and thereby stop the spread of these
infections.
Securing BARDA’s Partnerships from Malign Actors.—The Com-
mittee directs BARDA to submit a report to the Committees within
180 days of enactment on all partnerships with entities that are
based in the People’s Republic of China [PRC] or under the juris-
diction of the PRC government and their subsidiaries. The report
shall include partnerships spanning the entire scope of BARDA’s
work including the development of vaccines, drugs, therapies, and
diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies such as
CBRN accidents, incidents and attacks; pandemic influenza [PI],
and emerging infectious diseases [EID]. Additionally, the report
shall include the type of agreement that BARDA has entered into
with a PRC entity, the scope of the agreement, the length of the
agreement, and what data or information has been or will be
shared with the BARDA partner.
Tuberculosis [TB].—Drug resistant TB is identified as a serious
threat level pathogen to the United States by the Combating Anti-
biotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator [CARB–X].
As drug resistant TB cases are on the rise globally, the threat to
the United States also grows and BARDA’s investment in new TB
diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines is critical. The Committee requests
an update on BARDA’s investments in drug resistant TB research
in the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Project Bioshield Special Reserve Fund
The Committee recommendation includes $825,000,000 for
Project Bioshield. The Committee is committed to ensuring the Na-
tion is adequately prepared against chemical, biological, radio-
logical, and nuclear attacks. These funds support the acquisition of
promising MCMs developed through BARDA contracts for the most
serious public health threats.
Strategic National Stockpile
The Committee includes $980,000,000 for the Strategic National
Stockpile [SNS].
Acute Radiation Syndrome [ARS].—The Committee notes ASPR
has the responsibility of developing and procuring MCMs for natu-
rally occurring and intentional threat agents while ensuring that
these are quickly available in the event of an emergency, and that
these threats include nuclear and radiological events. The Com-
mittee is concerned, however, that ASPR/SNS has only been able
to meet 45 percent of the published requirement to protect Ameri-
cans from ARS. Considering the risks associated with international
supply chains and recent geopolitical developments, the Committee
directs ASPR/SNS to prioritize domestically sourced FDA-approved
MCMs for ARS and thermal burns. Additionally, given the antici-
pated delays in treatment initiation due to the extended time need-
ed to deploy personnel and MCMs in the event of a nuclear or radi-
ological incident, the Committee urges ASPR/SNS to prioritize
FDA-approved countermeasures with an extended treatment win-
dow. Such countermeasures should be effective for deployment at
least 48 hours after a radiological event and when administered in

238
the absence of blood products and other hospital level supportive
care. The Committee requests a report within 30 days of enactment
that includes an update on ASPR’s plans to ensure existing ARS
products are maintained at a level that meets the requirement and
secure the continued availability of a diverse set of domestically
manufactured countermeasures that will be effective under ex-
pected conditions of deployment and use.
Antimicrobial Resistance Class Review System.—The Committee
encourages ASPR, in coordination with the Food and Drug Admin-
istration [FDA] and Centers for Disease Control [CDC], to imple-
ment a class review system to regularly assess the safety, efficacy,
and vulnerability to antimicrobial resistance of existing SNS assets
that could be used to respond to CBRN and public health threats
and to support efforts to maintain an inventory of medical counter-
measures appropriate to respond to the continued evolution of anti-
microbial resistant organisms.
Made in America Strategic National Stockpile.—The Committee
is concerned about the Nation’s limited infrastructure to produce
essential products such as medical devices, medical equipment,
pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equipment [PPE]. The
Committee strongly urges ASPR to develop a long-term sustainable
procurement plan that gives preference to and results in purchases
directly from domestic manufacturers to the maximum extent prac-
ticable.
Medical Countermeasure Stockpile Preparedness.—The most re-
cent Medical Countermeasures Preparedness Review, submitted to
Congress as part of the required annual threat-based review of the
SNS, found the Department has not met medical countermeasure
stockpiling requirements for numerous public health threats. Fur-
thermore, the review demonstrated how the SNS often relies on
decades-old products to fulfill other stockpiling requirements. The
SNS is a key pillar in the Nation’s broader strategy to protect the
American people against man-made threats—like anthrax and
smallpox—as well as natural disasters. Gaps in the stockpile’s pre-
paredness against these threats jeopardizes national security.
Within 180 days of enactment, the Committee requests a briefing
from ASPR regarding progress made by the Department in ad-
dressing the stockpile shortfalls identified by the Medical Counter-
measures Preparedness Review.
Poxvirus Countermeasures.—The Committee commends ASPR for
their role in the successful campaign to stop the 2022 MPox out-
break in the United States by deploying medical countermeasures
that were previously developed, purchased and stockpiled for small-
pox preparedness. The Committee is concerned however that there
may now be an insufficient supply of poxvirus vaccine for
immunocompromised individuals as well as poxvirus treatments in
the stockpile, especially in light of the continued national security
threat of an intentional or accidental release of smallpox. The Com-
mittee urges ASPR to prioritize replenishment of MCMs used dur-
ing the MPox outbreak and requests a briefing within 60 days of
the date of enactment on the stockpiling requirements for poxvirus
vaccine and therapeutics as included in the 2022 Medical Counter-
measure Preparedness Report, submitted to Congress as part of the
required annual threat based review of the SNS.

239
Replenishing Influenza Antivirals.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the perennial threat of pandemic influenza, which
could be exacerbated by expiring antivirals in the SNS. The Com-
mittee strongly urges HHS to diversify and replenish its stockpile
of emergency influenza antivirals to ensure the Nation has mul-
tiple current treatment options in the event of an influenza pan-
demic.
Resupply of Nerve Agent Countermeasures.—The Committee re-
mains concerned that the Nation is not sufficiently prepared for the
threats posed by chemical weapons and nerve agents, particularly
threats to the American public. Anti-convulsant medicines provide
a key means of treatment, yet the SNS currently stockpiles only
diazepam auto-injectors, all of which expired in October 2023. The
Committee notes each of ASPR’s fiscal year 2023, 2024, and 2025
congressional justifications requested funding to procure FDA-ap-
proved next generation midazolam auto-injectors to resupply the
SNS. However, the Committee is concerned that ASPR does not in-
tend to execute the appropriated funds for FDA-approved
midazolam auto-injectors from fiscal year 2023 or 2024 and reiter-
ates the request for a report included in the Further Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–47). Therefore, the Com-
mittee urges ASPR to take appropriate steps to resupply the ex-
pired stock of anti-convulsant medicines in the SNS.
Reusable Respirators.—The Committee recognizes the substantial
evidence supporting the value of strategic stockpiling of reusable
respirators, as documented by the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine. These respirators provide enhanced
protection compared to disposable surgical and N95 masks through
their superior face-seal characteristics. They provide superior de-
fense for emergency service and other critical infrastructure per-
sonnel against infectious diseases, biological weapons, and chemical
agents. Due to their longer operational lifetime and extended shelf-
life when compared with disposable masks, reusable respirators are
also more cost-effective to stockpile. Stockpiling American made re-
usable respirators will also ensure that first responders have rapid
access to effective protective equipment and not be solely depend-
ent on foreign supply chains and disposable products.
Shelf-life Extension Program [SLEP].—The Committee remains
concerned with aging products in the SNS and the use of the SLEP
for MCMs. While the SLEP can result in cost savings and effi-
ciencies, it is not a substitute for the timely replenishment of aging
products in stockpile. For example, the most recent Medical Coun-
termeasures Preparedness Review, submitted to Congress as part
of the required annual threat-based review of the SNS, found that
ASPR often relies on decades-old products to fulfill current
PHEMCE stockpiling requirements. The Committee remains con-
cerned that efforts to achieve cost savings through SLEP could neg-
atively impact the distribution of, patient adherence to, and ulti-
mately consumer confidence in products in the SNS used during an
emergency. In the annual SNS threat-based review, the Secretary
will include the quantity of each countermeasure that is beyond 10
years of the initial FDA expiration date and the number of these
aged products in the SLEP that have no industry sponsor.

240
State Strategic Stockpiles.—The Committee supports a State
stockpile program, as authorized in Public Law 117–328, to supple-
ment the Federal SNS by allowing States to secure appropriate
drugs, vaccines, and other biological products, medical devices, and
other medical supplies necessary to respond to a public health
emergency or a major disaster. This may include products for re-
gional threats such as mosquito-borne diseases and natural disas-
ters such as hurricanes, tornados, blizzards, or extreme drought or
international threats. The Committee recognizes the importance of
guidance to States on how best to establish, expand, procure, re-
plenish, maintain, and manage State stockpiles, while ensuring ap-
propriate collaboration with the Federal SNS. ASPR is directed to
report to the Committees within 180 days of enactment to provide
an update on plans to issue guidance related to state stockpiles.
The Committee notes that empowering States to support their own
stockpiles and to stockpile products that may not be procured on
the Federal level will improve States’ ability to protect their spe-
cific populations and appropriately prepare for and respond to
emergencies. Therefore, ASPR is encouraged to establish, expand,
or maintain a State stockpile program for States’ specific and
unique needs, while ensuring such a program is appropriately co-
ordinating with the Federal SNS. The Committee directs ASPR to
include an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on its plans to imple-
ment the program, including providing a draft budget. ASPR is di-
rected to report to the Committee on their plans no less than 15
days prior to releasing a funding opportunity announcement.
SNS Resource Allocation Strategy and Guidance.—The Com-
mittee urges ASPR to enhance transparency on the process for re-
questing resources from the SNS and how product is allocated to
those requesting support during declared public health emer-
gencies. Within 1 year of enactment, the Committee directs ASPR
to provide a briefing on efforts to implement activities to support
transparency and information on how to request support and how
allocation of resources is determined.
SNS Transparency.—In prior years, the Committee has provided
the SNS with funding increases on top of the tens of billions of dol-
lars it received during the COVID–19 pandemic. Yet, the Com-
mittee continues to hear significant concerns with the SNS’ con-
tracting bandwidth and its ability to execute on contracts in a time-
ly manner. In addition, as products move through development and
are approved by BARDA, which is publicly disclosed, the Com-
mittee does not have visibility into which products are entering the
stockpile and when. Therefore, the Committee directs ASPR to in-
clude in its monthly briefings to the Committee information on
which products approved by BARDA are being stockpiled. The
briefing should be accompanied by a semiannual report on the con-
tracts executed in the past 6 months. This should be an ongoing
listing that will allow the Committee to continuously track prod-
ucts as they move through the development pipeline from BARDA
through the lifecycle of product replenishment for all products in
the SNS. Such semiannual reports shall include a forecasting of
products that ASPR reasonably expects will move from BARDA to
the stockpile over the next year.

241
Temperature Sensitive Products.—The Committee encourages
ASPR to ensure that vaccines, drugs, and other temperature sen-
sitive products are packaged, stored, and distributed using best
practices for appropriate temperature control, including through
the use of temperature monitoring technologies that may be placed
on individual packaging.
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness
The Committee recommendation includes $307,991,000, for Pan-
demic Influenza Preparedness. This funding supports efforts to
modernize influenza research and development of vaccines and
next-generation influenza medical countermeasures, preparedness
testing and evaluation, as well as critical domestic vaccine manu-
facturing infrastructure.
Biotechnology Platform Technologies.—The Committee directs the
Department to focus on developing and validating biotechnology
platform technologies that may be capable of addressing a variety
of health security threats, including emerging infectious diseases.
The success of Operation Warp Speed highlighted the effectiveness
of platform technologies to rapidly accelerate the development and
manufacturing scale-up of novel vaccines and therapeutics to ad-
dress evolving or unknown threats. There is an urgent need for a
suite of similar bio-platform technologies. Recognizing the chal-
lenges of developing single MCMs to address a wide range of
known and unknown threats, the Committee underscores the im-
portance of early-stage development and validation of innovative,
platform-based technologies to the point where ASPR would be con-
fident in the ability of the platform to achieve such results, without
developing a specific product for a specific threat.
Test-to-Treat.—The Committee believes the test-to-treat model,
which was implemented for COVID–19 in retail pharmacies and
health clinics, can make other infectious disease treatments avail-
able more quickly and reduce disease transmission and illness se-
verity. The availability of accurate diagnostics and the rapid pre-
scription of treatments is especially critical given the recent co-cir-
culation of multiple respiratory diseases during the winter season.
The Committee believes the test-to-treat model should be evaluated
for the confluence of influenza, COVID–19 and RSV, given the
availability of multiple diagnostic tests and antivirals. The Com-
mittee directs HHS to submit a report to Congress within 120 days
of enactment on the findings of the NIH Home Test-to-Treat dem-
onstration for influenza, lessons learned from the COVID–19 Fed-
eral Retail Pharmacy Program, and the design of a potential test-
to-treat demonstration for COVID–19, influenza, and RSV to serve
vulnerable populations.
OPERATIONS, PREPAREDNESS, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $499,606,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 488,606,000
The Committee provides $488,606,000 for ASPR’s Operations,
Preparedness, and Emergency Response activities. This appropria-
tion supports the operations and logistics capabilities across
ASPR’s programs as well as the tools and resources necessary to
support its emergency preparedness and response mission. This in-

242
cludes ASPR’s financial management, acquisition, information tech-
nology, and its suite of integrated Federal medical response capa-
bilities that is prepared to respond when disaster strikes.
Supply Chain Control Tower [SCCT] Program.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of the SCCT Program, a voluntary col-
laboration between distributor partners and ASPR, to provide par-
tial visibility for supply chain monitoring and readiness. In addi-
tion to providing insights for demand and supply forecasting, the
Committee encourages ASPR to coordinate with FDA and CDC to
use the SCCT to monitor the availability of a broader list of essen-
tial health and medical products.
Preparedness and Emergency Operations
The Committee includes $31,154,000 for Preparedness and Emer-
gency Operations. The Preparedness and Emergency Operations
account funds the Office of Emergency Management, which sup-
ports the full spectrum of emergency management responsibilities,
including planning, coordination, logistics, training, and responding
to planned events and unplanned incidents.
National Disaster Medical System
The Committee includes $78,904,000, for the National Disaster
Medical System [NDMS] to improve the disaster readiness of the
Nation by better coordinating existing assets with States and re-
gions.
Mission Zero.—The Committee includes $4,000,000, for civilian
trauma centers to train and incorporate military trauma care pro-
viders and teams into care centers.
Pediatric Disaster Care.—The Committee includes $7,000,000, to
support the pediatric disaster care program.
Public Health Preparedness Equipment.—The Committee in-
cludes $2,000,000 for ASPR to maintain next generation air mobil-
ity solutions that will ensure more cost-effective health delivery
systems.
Prepositioning Response Medical Caches Outside the Contiguous
United States.—The Committee recognizes the geographic distance
of Hawaii and the U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands [USAPI] and the
need to pre-position emergency medical resources in Hawaii to
mitigate risks associated with disrupted transportation networks,
communications, and supply chains. The Committee urges ASPR to
maintain its prepositioning of response medical caches in Hawaii to
serve the State and USAPI. These medical caches should have a
minimum capability to support up to two 38-person Disaster Man-
agement Assistance Teams, in order to provide immediate support
to Hawaii and the USAPI during a public health or disease re-
sponse.
Health Care Readiness and Recovery
The Committee’s recommendation includes $309,055,000, an in-
crease of $4,000,000, for Health Care Readiness and Recovery
[HCRR], formerly the Hospital Preparedness Program. The HCRR
portfolio includes critical programs and activities that strengthen
healthcare sector readiness to provide innovative, coordinated, and
lifesaving care in the face of emergencies and disasters. The Com-

243
mittee believes this funding should be carefully coordinated within
communities to continue to provide our Nation’s hospitals and
emergency responders the necessary tools to respond quickly and
collaboratively to public health emergencies. Within HCRR, the
Committee includes $240,000,000, for cooperative agreements, crit-
ical support to State, local, and regional partners to advance
healthcare system preparedness and response.
Biocontainment Care Capabilities.—The Committee requests a
briefing within 60 days of enactment on the planning and design
resource requirements of Next Generation Biocontainment Care
Capabilities at a leading civilian NDMS medical surge pilot site, as
called for in section 741 of the National Defense Authorization Act
for fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Committee supports ASPR’s
Portable Biocontainment Units, and requests the briefing include
estimated funding needs for developing a regional capability to
transport highly infectious patients during infectious disease out-
breaks. This capability would enable medical personnel to provide
safe, reliable, timely patient evacuation and transportation.
Collaborative Learning Models.—The Committee notes the use of
technology-enabled collaborative learning models, such as Project
ECHO, during the COVID–19 pandemic and encourages ASPR to
leverage these solutions in its healthcare emergency preparedness
and response.
EMS Preparedness and Response Workforce Shortage Program.—
The Committee urges ASPR to address the crippling EMS work-
force shortage, including in underserved, rural, and Tribal areas
and/or address health disparities related to accessing prehospital
ground ambulance healthcare services, including critical care trans-
port. The Committee encourages ASPR, in consultation with the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of EMS, to
develop a national pilot program of grants to governmental and
non-governmental EMS organizations to support the recruitment
and training of emergency medical technicians and paramedics in
underserved, rural, and Tribal areas and/or addressing health dis-
parities related to accessing prehospital ground ambulance
healthcare services.
National Special Pathogen System [NSPS].—The Committee in-
cludes $7,500,000, to continue to support the National Emerging
Special Pathogens Training and Education Center [NETEC], and
$21,000,000 to continue to support existing Regional Emerging
Special Pathogen Treatment Centers [RESPTCs] and Special
Pathogen Treatment Centers [SPTCs] to prepare for future pan-
demic threats. Funding will support efforts to maintain and im-
prove the Nation’s preparedness against highly infectious pathogen
threats. Funding will continue to be available to NETEC and
RESPTCs for readiness to respond to outbreaks of infectious dis-
eases, for additional treatment centers, for special pathogen med-
ical transport and further establish the National Special Pathogen
Systems of Care tier network.
Regional Disaster Health Response System.—The Committee in-
cludes $7,000,000 to support ASPR’s efforts to improve disaster
readiness by better coordinating healthcare infrastructure and sys-
tems with States and across regions. The Committee urges ASPR
to continue improving regional readiness efforts to increase re-

244
gional ability to respond to threats, leverage local, State, and Fed-
eral healthcare assets across coalition and State lines, and improve
communications and coordination among participating agencies.
Trauma Care Readiness and Coordination.—The Committee in-
cludes $4,000,000 to support the efforts of States and consortia of
States to coordinate and improve emergency medical services and
trauma care during a public health emergency. ASPR shall use
these funds to award up to five grants to eligible entities for the
purpose of carrying out research and demonstration projects to sup-
port the improvement of emergency medical services and trauma
care in support of the duties and functions included in 42 U.S.
Code Section 1A300hh–10 (b)(4)(C) of the Public Health Service
Act.
Medical Reserve Corps
The Committee recommendation includes $6,240,000 for the
Medical Reserve Corps [MRC] program, which is a national net-
work of local volunteer doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and
other community members. The Committee appreciates that fund-
ing for MRCs has historically been provided to local units quickly
and effectively, thereby allowing for grants to help build and sus-
tain local communities’ ability to prepare for and respond to emer-
gencies. The Committee encourages ASPR to continue this locally-
driven approach and to allocate this funding and any remaining
funding from the American Rescue Plan Act via established mecha-
nisms that provide funds directly to local MRC units, which are
made up of representatives from their communities.
Industrial Based Management and Supply Chain [IBMSC]
The Committee provides $10,000,000 for ASPR’s Pandemic Pre-
paredness and Biodefense activities. This appropriation supports
the permanent establishment of the Industrial Based Management
and Supply Chain Office to ensure that critical supplies are manu-
factured in the United States. It also provides resources to bolster
pandemic preparedness and biodefense against new and emerging
threats, which may include investments to accelerate advanced de-
velopment of investigational vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics;
support emergency manufacturing of critical MCMs and ancillary
supplies; and, to the extent feasible, invest in the expansion of the
domestic medical supply chain.
The Committee recognizes that deployment of cutting-edge man-
ufacturing technology is an essential component of a feasible path-
way toward a resilient domestic manufacturing base for medicines,
active pharmaceutical ingredients, and diagnostics. The Committee
directs that this funding shall be used to continue and expand on-
going work to build and validate advanced manufacturing proc-
esses and facilities capable of storing, producing, and deploying es-
sential medicines and diagnostics in the event of a national health
emergency.
Medical Countermeasures Domestic Manufacturing.—The Com-
mittee supported BARDA’s investment to accelerate the expansion
of domestic manufacturing capacity for ancillary supplies, like nee-
dles and syringes, during the COVID–19 pandemic. ASPR should
continue to support domestically-produced medical counter-

245
measures by investing in domestic capacity to manufacture essen-
tial medical products. ASPR should also explore ways to support
the market for these products by deploying a variety of stockpiling
methods, including vendor managed inventory strategies and bulk
purchases. The Committee directs ASPR to provide details in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts it has made or will make to support
domestic capacity for essential medical products, like needles, sy-
ringes, and blood collection products.
Diagnostic Manufacturing.—The Committee remains concerned
investments made by U.S. headquartered diagnostic companies for
end-to-end domestic manufacturing during the COVID–19 pan-
demic are being undone without warm-base investment. Therefore,
the Committee directs the ASPR to invest in public-private part-
nerships and create policies for flexible contracting with U.S. diag-
nostic test manufacturers to create a sustainable warm-base and
supply chain for end-to-end domestic manufacturing.
Improving Biomanufacturing Capabilities.—The Committee
urges ASPR to increase coordination with relevant Manufacturing
USA institutes to address pandemic preparedness, CBRN defense,
and emerging biopharmaceutical manufacturing strategies. Such
coordination will aim to develop, demonstrate, and deploy tech-
nologies and response capabilities to improve public health and
medical preparedness.
Industrial Base Manufacturing and Supply Chain.—The Com-
mittee provides funding for ASPR’s continued Pandemic Prepared-
ness and Biodefense activities. This appropriation supports the per-
manent establishment of the Industrial Based Management and
Supply Chain Office to ensure that critical supplies are manufac-
tured in the United States. It also provides resources to bolster
pandemic preparedness and biodefense against new and emerging
threats, which may include investments to accelerate advanced de-
velopment of investigational vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics;
support emergency manufacturing of critical MCMs and ancillary
supplies; and, to the extent feasible, invest in the expansion of the
domestic medical supply chain. The Committee urges ASPR to
prioritize the development of new Abbreviated New Drug Applica-
tion [ANDA] by a domestic manufacturer for priority essential
drugs in shortage or at risk of shortage to have domestic manufac-
turers able to produce a drug if it goes into shortage.
The Committee recognizes that cutting-edge manufacturing tech-
nology is an essential component of a resilient domestic manufac-
turing base for medicines, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and
diagnostics. The Committee urges ASPR to use this funding to con-
tinue ongoing work to build and validate advanced manufacturing
processes and facilities capable of storing, producing, and deploying
essential medicines and diagnostics in the event of a national
health emergency.
Prioritizing Domestic Producers of Essential Medicines.—The
Committee is concerned about drug shortages of essential medi-
cines. Therefore, the Committee urges ASPR to utilize U.S. manu-
factures that are producing critical medicines, like the antibiotic
amoxicillin, over non-U.S. producers.
Rapid Detection of Bioterrorism Agents.—The Committee is con-
cerned that the Nation is not prepared to rapidly detect biological

246
agents, such as anthrax, tularemia, melioidosis, glanders, and
plague, even though BARDA has successfully supported develop-
ment of diagnostic technologies that detect such biothreats, in some
cases simultaneously. The Committee strongly urges ASPR to
prioritize partnerships with domestic manufacturers capable of pro-
ducing rapid diagnostics that can detect such threats and develop
a diagnostic testing preparedness plan for use during public health
emergencies, disasters, and other serious public health threats.
Strengthening Domestic Manufacturing and Production.—The
Committee commends ASPR for its support of industrial base man-
agement capabilities launched during the COVID–19 pandemic, in-
cluding global supply chain situational awareness, market capabili-
ties, rapid acquisition execution, and coordination of Defense Pro-
duction Act [DPA] and Emergency Support Function [ESF]—8 au-
thorities. This work has been essential to creating a secure and re-
silient domestic supply of quality and affordable essential medi-
cines and PPE. These strategic investments in domestic tech-
nologies and industries ensure our Nation’s health and biosecurity.
However, the Committee remains concerned about the Nation’s
limited infrastructure to produce essential products such as med-
ical devices, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and PPE. The Committee
supports efforts by ASPR to expand upon the domestic industrial
base to end the reliance on foreign sourced medical equipment,
PPE, diagnostic tests, medical devices, and to secure the pipeline
for critical medicines, including antibiotics. The Committee directs
IBMSC to use available funds to continue and expand ongoing
work to build and validate advanced manufacturing processes and
facilities capable of storing, producing, and deploying essential
medicines in the event of a national health emergency. IBMSC
should seek opportunities to expand domestic manufacturing facili-
ties with end-to-end capabilities to produce bulk drug substance,
support platform technologies for MCMs, and provide fill-finish ca-
pacity. The Committee urges ASPR to use available funds to sup-
port manufacturers in building, expanding, upgrading, modifying,
and/or recommissioning facilities in the United States to increase
manufacturing capacity of critical medicines or their active phar-
maceutical ingredients. The Committee directs ASPR to provide de-
tails in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on efforts it has made to support
domestic capacity for essential medical products.
Trusted Domestic Vaccine Supplier Capability.—The Committee
continues to recognize the need for domestic manufacturing of key
biological starting materials [KSM], including plasmid DNA and
mRNA, antibodies, and other MCMs, to ensure timely response to
unanticipated health emergencies. Therefore, the Committee en-
courages ASPR to expand domestic manufacturing of KSMs and
collaborate with U.S. companies that have pharmaceutical capabili-
ties to ensure the development and stockpiling of synthesized medi-
cines for future pandemics and biothreats.
Warm-Base Manufacturing.—The Committee supports warm-
base surge production capacity contracts with domestic manufac-
turers, including NIOSH-approved N95 respirators and other do-
mestic PPE manufacturers who received Federal funding to expand
manufacturing capacity during the COVID–19 pandemic. ASPR is
encouraged to maintain domestic manufacturing surge capacity

247
and capabilities to prepare for, or respond to, an existing or poten-
tial public health emergency or otherwise address threats that pose
a significant level of risk to national security.
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $710,955,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 677,964,000
The Committee provides $677,964,000 for General Departmental
Management [GDM]. The recommendation includes $64,828,000 in
transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act (Public Law
78–410 as amended).
This appropriation includes funding for cybersecurity and sup-
ports activities that are associated with the Secretary’s role as pol-
icy officer and general manager of the Department. It supports
health activities performed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Health [OASH], including the Office of the Surgeon General.
GDM funds also support the Department’s centralized services car-
ried out by several Office of the Secretary staff divisions, including

AD/RD Early Intervention.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to prioritize early interventions for Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias, and to identify and implement a com-
prehensive set of actions to assess risk factors for cognitive decline
and dementia. Such an assessment should emphasize historically
underserved communities, including individuals with Down syn-
drome. Actions should include: conducting health risk assessments;
identifying opportunities to address known risk factors; examining
incentives to promote brain health; providing payments for preven-
tion and care delivery models that incorporate brain health as part
of care and treatment of other conditions; and examining the devel-
opment and implementation of quality measures specifically related
to brain health.
Alzheimer’s Advisory Council.—The Committee is encouraged by
the Department’s leadership to ensure that risk reduction is part
of our Nation’s plan to end Alzheimer’s disease and continues fund-
ing for the Advisory Council on Alzheimer’s Research, Care and
Services. The Committee notes the Department is required to hold
quarterly Advisory Council meetings and issue a yearly strategic

248
plan, per the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (Public Law 111–
375) and directs the Department to do so. More than 3 years ago,
the Secretary announced that the 2021 plan update would include
a sixth goal [Goal Six] of reducing risk factors for Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. The Committee requests a briefing within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on progress made toward meeting that goal. The
briefing should include information on funding allocated toward
achieving Goal Six; how progress is being measured and tracked;
and an overview of how HHS and other Federal agencies are imple-
menting prevention strategies and working with non-governmental
organizations to meet Goal Six.
Antimicrobial Resistance [AMR].—The Committee continues to
support the administration’s proposal to combat antibiotic-resistant
infections by strengthening national One Health surveillance ef-
forts, encouraging the development of innovative diagnostic tests
for resistant bacteria, and accelerating the development of new
antibiotics, other therapeutics, and vaccines. Within 60 days of en-
actment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing detailing
how HHS and its agencies are coordinating their AMR-related ef-
forts, as well as domestic and international AMR trends.
Bereavement Care.—The Committee is concerned that individuals
and families often suffer severe health, social, and economic de-
clines following the death of a loved one, be it a child, sibling,
spouse, or parent. The Committee encourages the Secretary to co-
ordinate efforts across HHS to advance bereavement care for fami-
lies, including interventions or programs that could help coping or
adaptive processing.
Biotech Reagents.—The Committee is concerned by the increased
reliance on foreign imports of active pharmaceutical ingredients,
which are often made from U.S. exports of basic organic chemicals
and biochemical reagents. The Committee encourages the Secretary
to consult with drug manufacturers, scientific experts, and across
Federal agencies to compile a list of organic chemicals and bio-
chemical reagents required to produce active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients, biopharmaceutical treatments, and other medicines listed
on the World Health Organization’s essential medicines list. Fur-
ther, the Secretary should examine, to the extent possible, addi-
tional medical and non-medical industrial uses of such identified
reagents.
Budget Requests.—The Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide current and valid hyperlinks to all HHS budget requests for
the previous five fiscal years, including all operating divisions
budget requests, on the HHS Website.
Children’s Interagency Coordinating Council.—The Committee
recognizes the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation’s
[ASPE] role in supporting the work of the Children’s Interagency
Coordinating Council. The Committee continues current funding at
$3,000,000 for the Interagency Council’s activities. The Committee
requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act on the
Interagency Council’s activities, including efforts to establish a per-
manent leadership structure and identify officials from key agen-
cies across the government who will participate as members of the
council.

249
Chronic Numbness and Pain after Mastectomy.—The Committee
recognizes research demonstrating that long-term impacts after
mastectomy can lead to significant functional impairment and
quality of life issues for breast cancer survivors. The Committee is
aware of technological procedure advancements that can restore
normal breast functions, such as sensation, and improve functional
impairment, physical safety, and quality of life for breast cancer
survivors. The Committee encourages the Secretary, in collabora-
tion with other relevant HHS agencies, to explore technological ad-
vances impacting health outcomes after mastectomy and requests
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ about this issue.
Communications With the Committee.—The Committee relies on
its relationship with the Assistant Secretary for Financial Re-
sources [ASFR] and agency budget offices to make decisions about
how to best allocate budget resources and provide oversight over
how taxpayer dollars are spent. ASFR has a responsibility to en-
sure that the Committees receive accurate and timely information
including by ensuring that individual agencies and operating divi-
sions provide program-specific information in a timely manner
upon request. The Committee directs ASFR to improve the quality
and timeliness of the information it provides, including by reform-
ing and streamlining internal clearance processes, and allowing in-
dividual budget offices and congressional liaisons to communicate
directly with the Committee as they have done historically. Given
the current inadequate levels of communication and transparency
provided by congressional liaisons at ASFR, upon enactment, the
Committee directs the heads of each operating division to provide
no less than monthly briefings to the Committees. In addition, the
Committee directs the budget offices of each operating division to
provide monthly briefings to the Committees.
Coordination and Mitigation of H5N1.—The Committee recog-
nizes the ongoing impact of H5N1. Within 60 days of enactment of
this act and every 60 days thereafter, the Committee directs HHS,
in coordination with CDC, NIH, ASPR, FDA, USDA, and other rel-
evant Federal entities to provide a briefing on: (1) progress in miti-
gating H5N1 outbreaks, including USDA’s progress in imple-
menting its five-pronged strategy; (2) current Federal efforts to co-
ordinate with State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners to iden-
tify and mitigate the spread of the virus through testing and sur-
veillance or other means, including any limitations in carrying out
these efforts; (3) current Federal efforts to collaborate with global
partners in responding to H5N1 outbreaks around the world; and
(4) projected demand, capacity, and stockpiles for critical medical
products, including PPE and antivirals, needed in response to a po-
tential pandemic.
Dietary Guidelines.—The Committee recognizes that existing re-
search has shown that ultra-processed plant-based alternatives to
dairy are not nutritionally equivalent, and that consumers may not
fully understand the nutritional differences between dairy and
plant-based alternatives. The Secretary should ensure that the
process for developing the 2025 Dietary Guidelines includes rec-
ommendations that are based on the preponderance of scientific
and medical evidence consistent with section 5341 of title 7 of the
U.S. Code, and that it is fully transparent and includes a balanced

250
representation of individuals who are unbiased and free from con-
flicts of interest.
Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign.—The Committee con-
tinues funding at $1,000,000 for the Embryo Adoption Awareness
Campaign to educate Americans about the existence of frozen
human embryos (resulting from in-vitro fertilization), which may
be available for donation/adoption to help other couples build their
families. The Committee includes bill language permitting these
funds to be used to provide medical and administrative services to
individuals adopting embryos, deemed necessary for such adop-
tions, consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations.
Ending the HIV Epidemic.—The Committee continues support
for this initiative but is concerned by a lack of quantifiable data
showing outcomes of a program started in 2019. Therefore, the
Committee directs HHS to: (1) provide a spend plan to the Commit-
tees no later than 60 days after enactment of this act, to include
resource allocation by State; (2) brief the Committees on the fiscal
year 2026 plans no later than 90 days after enactment of this act;
(3) provide the Committees an update on the program’s perform-
ance data since the beginning of the initiative through the latest
available data, making sure to address each of the initiative’s goals
and performance metrics, no later than 180 days after enactment
of this act and updated annually throughout the life of the initia-
tive.
Faith and Community-Based Organizations.—The Committee
notes the impact of ongoing efforts and local partnerships to pro-
mote healthcare access and address chronic health challenges in
underserved communities. The Committee encourages HHS to
maintain and advance these partnerships, including with houses of
worship and community organizations.
Food is Medicine.—The Committee continues to provide
$2,000,000 to support ongoing efforts in OASH for the Food is Med-
icine [FIM] project to implement a Federal strategy to reduce nutri-
tion-related chronic disease, address food insecurity, and improve
health outcomes. The Committee encourages HHS to maintain and
regularly update the knowledge hub and to collaborate with other
Federal agencies on best practices, tools, and guidance related to
FIM interventions, including design, implementation, and evalua-
tion of pilot programs. Given the potential to improve patient care
and lower healthcare costs, particularly for individuals with chronic
and costly illness, the Committee encourages the Office of Sec-
retary to convene stakeholders and coordinate activities and de-
velop a national action plan to help increase access to medical foods
and medical nutrition therapy.
The Committee appreciates that the Administration is
prioritizing this initiative in alignment with its Make America
Healthy Again goals. The Committee also notes that various agen-
cies throughout the Department currently have or plan to under-
take FIM-related programs. Consequently, the Committee directs
the Secretary to coordinate FIM activities across the Department
and explore how to align these initiatives in a synchronized strat-
egy. Further, the Committee notes the importance of research and
evidence to examine policies that support reimbursement and scal-
ing of FIM interventions in healthcare. Therefore, the Committee

251
urges the Secretary to coordinate and consult with other Federal
departments with expertise in nutrition such as USDA, VA, and
IHS to continue to look towards innovative approaches to improve
access to FIM. Finally, given the important role of nutrition edu-
cation in expanding access to FIM, the Committee encourages the
Department to continue to pursue all opportunities to engage with
medical accrediting bodies and State continuing medical education
[CME] organizations to further incorporate nutrition competencies
into training requirements.
Global Health Research.—The Committee requests an update in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ on how CDC, FDA, BARDA, NIH, including
the Fogarty International Center, and other agencies jointly coordi-
nate global health research activities with specific metrics to track
progress and collaboration toward agreed upon health goals.
Group Purchasing Organizations’ [GPOs] Role in Prescription
Drug Costs.—The Committee seeks to better understand the influ-
ence of pharmacy benefit managers [PBMs] and their respective
GPOs on prescription drug pricing. The Committee encourages the
Secretary, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and
the CMS Administrator, to examine the role and impact of GPOs
employed by PBMs in negotiating prescription drug pricing, re-
bates, and fees associated with formulary placement by the PBM,
including options for enhancing transparency and oversight of
PBM–GPO arrangements. The Committee directs the Secretary to
provide the Committees a briefing within 120 days of enactment
and a final report no later than 1 year after the enactment of this
act.
Health Data Coordination.—The Committee notes the potential
for improving health and wellness through new technologies that
measure broad biomarkers, digital data, and other health span,
longevity, and status indicators. The Committee encourages the
Secretary to coordinate with officials from the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy and Department of Defense to
identify and coordinate Federal investments in technology and re-
search to generate and make use of health data for the purpose of
improving health and wellness while ensuring the continued pro-
tection of individually identifiable health information, including the
development of new technologies to generate data on health states
from biological samples and artificial intelligence systems that can
better integrate health data.
Hospital Cybersecurity Infrastructure.—The Committee recog-
nizes that cybersecurity has been one of the most significant in-
vestments hospitals have had to make in the past decade in terms
of technology, workforce, and insurance. As the number of health-
related cyber-attacks increase, hospitals are reporting that cyber
insurance premiums are increasing at a rate of 20–50 percent per
year. The Committee encourages the administration to work with
hospitals, especially small and rural providers, and other
healthcare stakeholders prior to finalizing any new cybersecurity
standards.
Housing-Related Supportive Services.—Individuals who have se-
rious and complex health challenges, including mental health and
substance use disorders, and chronic medical conditions, require
additional supports to maintain stable housing. The Committee

252
supports coordination between the Department of Housing and
Urban Development [HUD], CMS, SAMHSA, ACL, and ASPE to
provide direct technical assistance to communities leveraging exist-
ing programs, like Medicaid, to cover and provide housing-related
supportive services and behavioral healthcare. The Committee di-
rects HHS and HUD to jointly brief the Committees on Appropria-
tions on this effort within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Infectious Diseases.—The Committee recognizes the crucial role
HHS plays in advancing progress in the prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment of infectious diseases. Within 1 year of enactment of this
act, the Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to Con-
gress detailing the steps that HHS and its agencies are taking to
accelerate progress in the fight against infectious disease both do-
mestically and globally, including progress combatting tuberculosis,
influenza, avian flu, antimicrobial resistance, sepsis, valley fever,
Lyme disease, and other existing and future viral, bacterial, fungal,
and parasitic infections. Such report shall include up-to-date de-
tailed spending on each disease area by agency and operating divi-
sion and comparisons to prior fiscal years.
Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Promotion of Optimal
Birth Outcomes.—The Committee continues to provide $2,000,000
to provide regular progress reports on activities and outcomes of
HHS programs directed toward improving maternal health out-
comes.
LymeX.—The Committee continues to provide $5,000,000 to ad-
vance public-private partnerships and innovation in Lyme disease
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through the HHS Office of the
Chief Technology Officer.
Maternal Health.—Research continues to demonstrate that the
United States has higher rates of maternal mortality and adverse
maternal health outcomes than peer countries. The Committee re-
mains concerned by these findings, and directs HHS to prioritize
efforts to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce maternal
mortality by expanding the maternity care workforce, developing a
maternal health quality outcomes measure, and enhancing
postpartum social supports for families. Further, the Committee di-
rects HHS to focus on efforts to improve coordination across mater-
nal health programs and requests a report within 180 days of en-
actment of this act detailing plans to further such collaboration and
leverage agency expertise.
Mental Health Grants Dashboard.—The Committee encourages
the Secretary to establish and operate an interactive, user friendly,
Internet website-based dashboard that improves public access to
information about Federal grants related to mental health and sub-
stance use disorder, including for potential applicants for such
grants.
National Parkinson’s Project.—The Committee is encouraged by
the Department’s implementation of the National Parkinson’s
Project, as created by the Dr. Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable
Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act (Public Law
118–66). Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department
shall provide a report on the projected costs of full implementation
of the act and describe steps the agency will take to implement the

253
act, as well as an update on activities of the Advisory Council on
Parkinson’s Research, Care, and Services.
Neglected Tropical Diseases.—The Committee notes that the in-
creasing presence of Neglected Tropical Diseases [NTDs] in the
United States, particularly among the Nation’s most vulnerable
populations, represents a significant health and economic burden.
Within 180 days of enactment of this act, the Committee requests
a briefing on HHS’ efforts to assess the incidence and prevalence
of NTDs and identify gaps in research and development impeding
the Nation’s ability to combat these threats.
Mental Health Parity.—The Committee encourages the Secretary
to support State insurance departments for the implementation of
mental health parity as authorized in Public Law 117–328.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund [NEF].—The Committee directs the
Secretary to prioritize obligations from resources in the NEF for
projects currently underway. The Secretary should complete out-
standing projects in a timely manner and prior to funding new
projects. As part of the annual CJ, the Department is directed to
include the anticipated balances available for transfer into and
uses of the NEF for the current and budget fiscal years. Addition-
ally, the Department is directed to provide the Committees quar-
terly reports for all ongoing projects. The report shall include the
following for each project: a description and timeline for each
project; the date the project was notified to the Committees; total
obligations to date; obligations for the prior fiscal year; anticipated
obligations for current fiscal year; any expected future obligations;
and the total unobligated balance in the NEF. In addition, the
Committee requests biannual reports on expired balances that are
eligible for transfer to the NEF. Such report shall include the
Treasury Account Fund Symbol, program name, unobligated bal-
ance, and unexpended balance. Such report shall be transmitted 30
days after the close of the second quarter and within 45 days after
the close of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
Obesity.—The Committee notes that the CDC formally recognizes
obesity as a disease and recommends that it should be treated with
evidence-based therapies. Intensive behavioral therapy, improved
diet and nutrition, and medication, in addition to surgical proce-
dures, can lead to weight loss and have the potential to improve
health outcomes for those with obesity-related health conditions in-
cluding diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. Addi-
tionally, evidence points to rural areas and communities of color as
having a higher rate of disease burden. Obesity is a preventable
condition with a significant potential for reduction in burden of dis-
ease with adequate investment in proven prevention measures. The
Committee encourages HHS to take a comprehensive approach to
preventing and treating obesity as a chronic disease, including col-
laborating with other Federal agencies and conducting an evalua-
tion of the work and research being done across HHS agencies on
the costs, risks, and benefits of preventive measures and treat-
ments, and uptake of medications such as GLP–1 agonists. The
Committee requests a briefing on this effort within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Payment Management System [PMS].—The Committee notes
with concern reports of payment delays and disruptions from the

254
PMS, which can cause significant challenges and inefficiencies for
states and local organizations administering Federal programs.
Within 30 days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs
HHS to brief the Committees on the status of the PMS and any
technical improvements that HHS has made to improve payees
ability to use the PMS to access funds in a timely manner. The
Committee further directs HHS to immediately notify the Commit-
tees of any PMS outages or technical problems exceeding 48 hours,
and any payment delays or disruptions in the PMS distribution of
funds exceeding 14 days for individual payees, including any delays
resulting from Executive Order 14158 or Executive Order 14222.
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Risk Assessment.—The Committee
directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaries of De-
fense and Homeland Security, as well as with the Director of the
Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, to provide a
risk assessment of the pharmaceutical supply chain within 18
months of enactment of this act. The assessment shall be done in
coordination with the private sector and examine drugs, including
generic drugs, to identify a list of medicines: (1) that are reason-
ably likely to be required to respond to a public health emergency
or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear [CBRN] threat; (2)
whose shortage would pose a significant threat to the U.S.
healthcare system or at-risk populations; and (3) whose shortage
would pose a risk to national security. The assessment shall also
assess and identify: (1) key starting materials and excipients used
in manufacturing the active pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs
on the list; (2) current domestic manufacturing capabilities; (3) crit-
ical vulnerabilities, including cybersecurity threats; and (4) any de-
ficiencies, lack of authorities, or limitations in policy or process
that limit the ability of the Departments of HHS, Defense, or
Homeland Security to address vulnerabilities in the pharmaceutical
supply chain and how it will mitigate such vulnerabilities.
Psychedelic Therapies.—The Committee encourages the Secretary
to examine evidence-based care models for psychedelic or
entactogenic-assisted therapies for treatment of mental health and
substance use disorders. Specifically, HHS should assess the im-
pact of current policies, oversight, and regulatory structures on
care quality and patient outcomes; the cost implications of scaling-
up models of care; focus areas for future Federal research; and care
delivery best practices as well as challenges and opportunities in
implementing these care delivery models in Federal health pro-
grams. The Committee requests an update on these activities in
the fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the contributions of the United States Public Health Serv-
ice Commissioned Corps [USPHSCC] in providing public health
and medical expertise and in responding to public health crises do-
mestically and abroad. The nation’s ability to respond to future
health crises is hindered without adequate funding to sustain the
active duty and reserve components. The Committee encourages
the Secretary to continue to fund the USPHCSS to adequately
carry out their unique mission as the only uniformed service with
a public health mission.

255
Rare Diseases.—The Committee recognizes that multiple Federal
departments, agencies and programs exist to address the needs of
people impacted by rare diseases and improve the lives of members
of the rare diseases community. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of enhanced coordination and collaboration across the
Federal Government and encourages the Secretary to initiate ef-
forts to focus on optimizing rare disease activities across the Fed-
eral Government and assess all Federal agency activities con-
cerning rare diseases.
Reimbursements for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists
[CRNAs].—The Committee is aware of recent efforts to reduce re-
imbursement for CRNA provided anesthesia, in conflict with sec-
tion 2706(a) of the Public Health Service Act. The Committee di-
rects the Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor
to take appropriate action to address this issue and protect access
to anesthesia services for rural and underserved communities.
Reorganizations.—The Department has long collaborated with
the Committee on any reorganization proposals, including on the
substance of the proposal and on the technical elements of aligning
appropriations language with the organizational and functional
structure of the Department. The Committee shares the Depart-
ment’s goal of improving the health of all Americans and remains
committed to working with the Department on shared priorities.
However, the Committee is concerned by the lack of information
provided thus far on HHS’ current plans for reorganization, espe-
cially in light of Department personnel actions that resulted in
statutorily required activities being stalled. The Department’s pro-
grams touch the lives of nearly every American and it is para-
mount that any reorganization improves HHS’ ability to carry out
its responsibilities, including carrying out the programs, projects,
and activities funded in this act in a timely manner.
Rural Health Strategy.—The Committee recognizes the persistent
disparities in health outcomes and access to care between rural and
urban communities. These disparities are often driven by factors
such as workforce shortages, geographic isolation, and facility clo-
sures. The Committee directs the Secretary, in coordination with
CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and CMS, to develop a coordinated rural
health strategy. Within 90 days of enactment, the Committee re-
quests a report outlining all existing Department-funded activities
specifically targeting rural communities, including those focused on
technical assistance, service delivery, workforce, and research, as
well as rural-specific components embedded in broader programs.
Additionally, the Committee urges the Secretary to ensure the ex-
periences of rural communities are accurately captured and ad-
dressed in Department-supported research, data collection, and
program evaluation efforts, including public data releases.
Rural News Media and Advertising Campaigns.—The Committee
continues to recognize the critical role local media plays in deliv-
ering public health messages to small or rural communities. There-
fore, the Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that local
media in small or rural markets are part of Federal public health
advertising campaigns. To further this goal, the Committee directs
the Secretary, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Pub-
lic Affairs and the Department’s media buyer contractors, to utilize

256
local news media in small or rural areas for HHS and its related
agencies’ public advertising campaigns to reach citizens with key
health messages. Local media includes newspapers, including non-
daily newspapers; television; and radio. Within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee directs the Office of the Secretary
to provide a briefing on the efforts of the Department in its utiliza-
tion of local media in small and rural areas as part of the Depart-
ment’s public health advertising campaigns for fiscal year 2026 and
future fiscal years, and the amount of money allocated to local
media in small and rural areas for fiscal year 2025 broken down
by Statewide newspapers, non-daily newspapers, TV and radio. The
Committee also directs the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in
consultation with the CDC’s Office of Rural Health to undertake a
review of the use of local media in small and rural communities in
a HHS public health advertising campaign in fiscal year 2026 in
several States to better understand the role of local media as a key
delivery system to reach small and rural communities with impor-
tant health messages. The Committee requests a report detailing
this review within 1 year of enactment of this act.
Sleep Disorders.—The Committee notes the lack of dedicated
sleep health and sleep disorders activities across HHS despite the
number of Americans affected, the economic cost and burden of ill-
ness, and the connection between sleep and serious chronic dis-
eases, including obesity and heart disease. HHS is encouraged to
establish a coordinating effort to promote sleep health and provider
education and awareness of sleep disorders.
Smoking Cessation.—The Committee acknowledges the Depart-
ment’s commitment to combatting chronic disease and notes that
this priority issue cannot be adequately addressed without advanc-
ing innovation in smoking cessation treatment to help all patients,
including those with chronic diseases, be more effective in their
quit attempts and treatment outcomes. Within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee requests a briefing from the De-
partment on the specific actions it will take working with the FDA
to incorporate a focus on smoking cessation treatment innovation
in the Department’s work to help Americans be healthy.
Staffing Reports.—The Committee provides funding levels across
HHS for the Department and its operating divisions to carry out
their statutory responsibilities including carrying out the programs,
projects, and activities funded in this act in a timely manner. With-
in 30 days of enactment of this act and monthly thereafter, the
Committee directs the Department to submit a staffing report in
Excel table format to the Committees which shall include the num-
ber of on-board staff for each operating and staff division as of the
end of fiscal year 2024, the end of fiscal year 2025, and monthly
thereafter. For each operating and staff division this shall include
the number of competitive service, excepted service (delineated by
schedule A, B, C, D, and title 42), and detailees. For HRSA, this
shall include the number of on-board staff at the program, project,
and activity level disaggregated by Bureau. For CDC, this shall in-
clude the number of on-board staff disaggregated by Center, Pro-
gram, and Office. For NIH, this shall include the number of on-
board staff at the program, project, and activity level,
disaggregated by Institute, Center, and Office. For ACF, this shall

257
include the number of on-board staff disaggregated by Program and
Office. For ACL, this shall include the number of on-board staff
disaggregated by the Center, Office, Administration, and Institute
level. The Committee notes that these monthly staffing reports
should demonstrate the Department and agencies’ progress in com-
ing into compliance with the directives included in this report. Ad-
ditionally, as required under section 228 of this act, the Depart-
ment shall provide the Committees on a biannual basis an excel
table which includes the names, titles, grades, agencies or divi-
sions, and date of hire of all of the political appointees that were
employed by the Department during the previous 180 days.
Substance Use Disorder Treatment Outcomes.—The Committee
recognizes that long-term, evidence-based outcomes research on
various treatment modalities for substance use disorder is limited.
The Committee directs the Department to expand and coordinate
evidence-based, long-term outcomes research for different modali-
ties of treatment and recovery support for substance use disorder
treatment. Such research should consider measures of mortality,
morbidity, and physical health, as well as quality-of-life measures,
such as employment, criminal justice involvement, family relation-
ships, and stable housing. The Department is further directed to
conduct research across the demographic populations of people with
substance use disorders, including those that have historically been
under-researched.
Vector Borne Diseases.—The Committee commends the Depart-
ment for the 2024 release of the National Public Health Strategy
to Prevent and Control Vector Borne Diseases in People and en-
courages continued collaboration and innovation to reach targeted
public health outcomes for the United States, including the target
of reducing the number of Lyme disease cases (laboratory con-
firmed) 25 percent by 2035.
Wuhan Institute of Virology.—The Committee is encouraged by
the actions taken to debar the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chi-
nese Academy of Sciences Capital Construction and EcoHealth Alli-
ance, Inc. from participating in United States Federal Government
programs and ensure that they are unable to receive Federal Gov-
ernment funding, pursuant to 42 CFR 180.800. Accordingly, this
bill does not include funding for either entity.
The Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the
Committee within 30 days of enactment of this act regarding com-
pliance with the debarment, any updates on debarment pro-
ceedings, as appropriate, and ways the Department is ensuring
that Federal funds are not awarded to entities based on evidence
that provides cause for suspension under 2 CFR 180.700 and
180.800.
Teen Pregnancy Prevention
The Committee provides $101,000,000 for the Teen Pregnancy
Prevention Program [TPPP]. This program supports competitive
grants to public and private entities to replicate evidence-based
teen pregnancy prevention approaches and develop and evaluate
new and innovative approaches to prevent teen pregnancy and
STIs among adolescents. In addition, the recommendation includes
$6,800,000 in transfers available under section 241 of the PHS Act.

258
TPPP.—The Committee includes $900,000 for ASPE to support
the TPPP Evidence Review. The Evidence Review is an inde-
pendent, systematic, rigorous review of evaluation studies that in-
forms grant making and provides a clearinghouse of evidence-based
programs for other Federal, State, and community initiatives.
Office of Minority Health
The Committee provides $70,835,000 for the Office of Minority
Health [OMH]. The Office focuses on strategies designed to de-
crease health disparities and to improve the health status of racial
and ethnic minority populations in the United States. OMH estab-
lishes goals and coordinates all departmental activity related to
identifying and disseminating innovative and effective approaches
for improving health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority indi-
viduals.
Within the total provided for OMH, the Committee provides not
less than the following amounts:

Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
[AANHPI] Youth Mental Health.—The Committee notes with con-
cern that suicide has been the leading cause of death for AANHPI
youth ages 10 through 24 in recent years. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to examine the prevalence and causes of be-
havioral health conditions among AANHPI youth, including by
identifying ways the Department can address this disparity and
improve access to behavioral healthcare for AANHPI youth.
Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of promoting Indigenous solutions to ad-
vance health, and continues to provide $4,000,000 for the Center
for Indigenous Innovation and Health. The Committee recognizes
the Center’s efforts to partner with institutions of higher education
with a focus on Indigenous health research, education, and policy
among American Indians and Alaska Natives, as well as a focus on
Indigenous health policy and innovation among Native Hawaiians
and Pacific Islanders. The Committee encourages the Center to
both continue and expand these efforts, including by focusing on
improving health outcomes for Indigenous youth.
Middle Eastern and North African [MENA] Communities.—The
Committee recognizes that accurate and representative health data
may improve the ability for underserved populations to receive
greater access to healthcare services. The Committee encourages
the Department to examine access to its programs and initiatives
for Middle Eastern and North African [MENA] populations, includ-
ing by assessing gaps in previously collected data on race and eth-
nicity.
National Lupus Training, Outreach, and Clinical Trial Edu-
cation [Lupus Program].—The Committee continues to provide
$2,000,000 for the Lupus Program to eliminate health disparities,

259
improve health outcomes, and encourage participation in clinical
trials among minority populations affected by the disease.
Promoting Language Access Services.—The Committee continues
no less than $4,000,000 to support the development of methods of
informing limited English proficient [LEP] individuals about their
right to and the availability of language access services. The Com-
mittee supports the Department’s efforts to improve external com-
munications, which should include mediums such as television and
radio, to reach LEP communities. The Committee encourages the
Department to review communication practices and create uniform
applications across all HHS agencies to strengthen communication
practices to include digital, television, and radio advertising when
working with LEP communities.
Improving Maternal Health Outcomes.—The Committee con-
tinues to provide $10,000,000 to support community-based and
other eligible organizations located in geographic areas with high
rates of adverse maternal health outcomes, particularly among ra-
cial and ethnic minority families. The Department should support
activities that include but are not limited to identifying evidence-
based and evidence-informed practices for: addressing non-medical
factors that affect health outcomes; promoting evidence-based
health literacy and pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting education
programs; providing support from perinatal health workers; and
providing culturally congruent, linguistically appropriate, and trau-
ma-informed training to perinatal health workers.
Minority HIV/AIDS
The Committee provides $56,000,0000 for the Secretary’s Minor-
ity HIV/AIDS Fund [MHAF] to strengthen and expand services
provided by minority-serving community-based organizations
[CBOs] for HIV education and awareness campaigns, testing, pre-
vention, linkage to care, and engagement in care to racial and eth-
nic minority individuals at risk for or living with HIV in order to
address the decline in HIV testing and the challenges with linkage
to and retention in care and treatment that occurred during the
COVID–19 pandemic. Funding may be prioritized for minority-
serving CBOs in the South, which has the highest burden of HIV
of any region nationwide. The Committee includes $5,000,000 in
funding for the Tribal set aside within the MHAF.
Office of Women’s Health
The Committee provides $42,140,000 for the Office of Women’s
Health [OWH]. This office develops, stimulates, and coordinates
women’s health research, healthcare services, and public and
healthcare professional education across the Department. It ad-
vances important crosscutting initiatives and develops public-pri-
vate partnerships, providing leadership and policy direction to ad-
dress the disparities in women’s health.
Within the total provided for OWH, the Committee provides not
less than the following amounts:

Access to Lactation Support Services.—The Committee continues
to support HHS’ initiatives to improve access to lactation support
services for all women who choose to breastfeed. The Committee
notes that despite guidance from the HHS Women’s Preventive
Services Initiative recommending that families receive comprehen-
sive lactation support services to optimize the successful initiation
and maintenance of breastfeeding, many families struggle to gain
access to quality lactation care. The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2023 (Public Law 117–328) included funding for HHS to
enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM] to provide an evidence-based,
non-partisan analysis of the macroeconomic, health, and social
costs of U.S. breastfeeding rates and national breastfeeding goals.
The Committee expects that this analysis should also examine how
health insurers have implemented comprehensive lactation serv-
ices, the standards set to determine reimbursement rates for
breastfeeding supplies and services, and the current best practices
used to provide coverage to help women breastfeed.
Combatting Violence Against Women.—The Committee includes
$10,100,000 to combat violence against women through the State
partnership initiative. This program provides funding to State-level
public and private health programs to partner with domestic and
sexual violence organizations to improve healthcare providers’ abil-
ity to help victims of violence and improve prevention programs.
The Committee continues to recommend OWH create a State-level
pilot program to incentivize substance use disorder treatment pro-
viders to be trained on intimate partner violence.
Eating Disorders.—The Committee remains concerned that eat-
ing disorders have one of the highest fatality rates of any psy-
chiatric illness, with girls and women at heightened risk for devel-
oping an eating disorder during their lifetime. The Committee rec-
ognizes the efforts of OWH to address eating disorders, and con-
tinues to provide $750,000 for such efforts. The Committee encour-
ages OWH to address early detection and treatment protocols for
women and girls with or at-risk of developing an eating disorder,
and to examine the lack of pediatric and adolescent screening in
the primary care and pediatric settings. Further, the Committee
encourages OWH to convene with relevant Federal agencies and
stakeholders to ensure coordination among Federal efforts to ad-
dress eating disorders research, prevention, intervention, and treat-
ment, and gather recommendations for better administration of ex-
isting Federal programs.
Pregnant and Lactating Women’s Advisory Committee.—The
Committee provides no less than $200,000 for the Pregnant and
Lactating Women’s Advisory Committee. The Committee requests
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on progress and Federal ac-
tivities undertaken to implement the Task Force on Research Spe-
cific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women [PRGLAC] rec-

261
ommendations and recommendations for further implementation of
PRGLAC recommendations.
Reporting on Access to Medical Forensic Exams.—The Committee
provides $5,000,000 to OWH to support grants to States and Tribes
to collect data and report on access to medical forensic exams for
sexual assault survivors, in order to implement sections 503 and
504 of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of
2022 (Public Law 117–103). OWH should work collaboratively with
States and Tribes, and using data-driven approaches, identify areas
for improvement in healthcare delivery systems providing forensic
examinations to survivors of sexual assault.
Stillbirth Working Group.—The Committee provides $1,750,000
under the Office of the Secretary to support the continued imple-
mentation of the recommendations of the Stillbirth Working Group.
The Committee directs the Department to prioritize (1) improved
data collection and surveillance systems including the moderniza-
tion of fetal death reporting and interstate data harmonization, (2)
identification of evidence-based risk reduction strategies, especially
in disproportionately affected populations, and (3) initiatives to
support maternal mental health and bereavement care. The De-
partment is directed to submit an update to the Committee no later
than 180 days after enactment of this act on the status of imple-
mentation efforts and remaining gaps.
Women’s Health Research Study.—To address the persistent gaps
in knowledge of women’s health and improve access to care, the
Secretary should continue to coordinate with NIH and NASEM in
support of research that explores the proportion of research on con-
ditions that are more common or unique to women. This research
should establish how these conditions are defined and ensure that
it captures conditions across the lifespan and determine the appro-
priate level of funding that is needed to address gaps in women’s
health research at NIH and submit to Congress a report containing
the findings and recommendations of the study no later than 18
months after enactment of this act.
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration
Cybersecurity
The Committee provides $100,000,000 for information technology
cybersecurity in the Office of the Chief Information Officer and
HHS-wide to strengthen the Department’s cybersecurity posture.
These funds provide continuous monitoring and security incident
response coordination for the Department’s computer systems and
networks.
Office of National Security
The Committee provides $8,983,000 for the Office of National Se-
curity to support strategic all-source information, intelligence, de-
fensive counterintelligence, insider threat intelligence, enterprise
supply chain risk management, security for classified information,
and communications security support across the Department.
These funds sustain the Department’s security and threat aware-
ness and its ability to respond swiftly and effectively to national
and homeland security threats.

262
Office of Global Affairs
The Committee provides $7,009,000 for the HHS Office of Global
Affairs to support its work to lead global health diplomacy and pol-
icy coordination efforts for HHS to strengthen U.S. health security
and pandemic preparedness.
OFFICE OF MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $196,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 196,000,000
The Committee provides $196,000,000 for the Office of Medicare
Hearings and Appeals [OMHA]. This Office is responsible for hear-
ing Medicare appeals at the Administrative Law Judge [ALJ] level,
which is the third level of Medicare claims appeals. OMHA ensures
that Medicare beneficiaries who are dissatisfied with the initial de-
cisions about their benefits or eligibility can appeal and exercise
their right to a hearing in front of an ALJ.
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $69,238,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 69,238,000
The Committee makes available $69,238,000 in transfers avail-
able under section 241 of the PHS Act, to the Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology [ONC]. ONC is re-
sponsible for coordinating Federal health information systems and
collaborating with the private sector to develop standards for a na-
tionwide interoperable health information technology infrastruc-
ture.
Health Information Exchanges [HIE].—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of electronic health data as a critical piece to
address the health needs and care delivery challenges of diverse
communities. The Committee strongly encourages HHS to work
with States to designate existing neutral, trusted, and nonprofit
HIEs to be the State’s health data utility [HDU]. HDU models are
designed and implemented in alignment with States’ policies and
priorities to address the needs of a broader health and healthcare
ecosystem. A HDU can be defined as one or more entities, guided
by a diverse stakeholder governance structure, that combine, en-
hance, and exchange disparate electronic health data sets for treat-
ment, care coordination, quality improvement, population health,
public health emergencies, and other public and community health
purposes. The Committee recognizes that each State designated
HDU is essential in establishing a national framework that fulfills
a current gap in healthcare by implementing a comprehensive dig-
ital health infrastructure as a public utility that will support data
sharing between public and private health data stakeholders. The
Committee directs HHS to leverage existing authorities, funds, and
other resources to construct policy and regulations that strengthen
existing HIE infrastructure to facilitate their transition into HDUs.
If necessary, the Committee encourages the Secretary to issue pol-
icy guidelines, or best practices, to encourage each State to des-
ignate a HIE or HIEs to be a State’s HDU.

263
Information Blocking Guidance.—The Committee recognizes that
ONC’s rule to implement the interoperability and information
blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114–
255) took significant steps forward to give patients greater access
to and improve the electronic flow of electronic health information
across care settings. Given the significant penalties and other con-
sequences for information blocking, the Committee urges ONC to
continue providing regulated entities and other affected stake-
holders clear, practical guidance regarding foundational concepts in
the rule, including activities that are not regarded as information
blocking.
Standards for Interoperability.—The Committee continues to in-
clude not less than $5,000,000 to support interoperability and infor-
mation sharing efforts related to the implementation of Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources standards or associated im-
plementation standards. ONC is responsible for coordinating Fed-
eral health information systems and collaborating with the private
sector to develop standards for a nationwide interoperable health
information technology infrastructure.
Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement
[TEFCA].—The Committee notes that during fiscal year 2025, the
Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National Co-
ordinator for Health Information Technology [ASTP/ONC] ex-
panded the implementation of the Trusted Exchange Framework
and Common Agreement [TEFCA]. The Committee notes that the
intention of this framework is to provide policies, procedures, and
technical standards necessary to exchange patient records and
health information between providers, state and regional health in-
formation exchanges, and Federal agencies. The Committee, how-
ever, recognizes concerns regarding unintended consequences, in-
cluding the potential for consolidation. The Committee emphasizes
that TEFCA needs to remain a voluntary means of data exchange
as authorized under section 4003 of the 21st Century Cures Act
(Public Law 114–255). The Committee requests a briefing by ASTP/
ONC within 60 days of enactment of this act on its planned ongo-
ing implementation of TEFCA.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $87,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 87,000,000
The Committee provides $87,000,000 for the HHS Office of In-
spector General [OIG].
OIG conducts audits, investigations, and evaluations of the pro-
grams administered by the Department’s operating and staff divi-
sions, including the recipients of the Department’s grant and con-
tract funds. In doing so, OIG addresses issues of waste, fraud, and
abuse and makes recommendations to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the Department’s programs and operations.
Digital Health Innovation.—The Committee notes that OIG ad-
dresses issues of waste, fraud, and abuse and makes recommenda-
tions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Depart-
ment’s programs and operations. The Committee also notes that ex-
isting regulations, such as the anti-kickback statute, have not been
updated to account for new digital health tools and technologies.

264
Through the statutory authority found in section 1128B(b) of the
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1320a–7b(b)), the Committee en-
courages the Inspector General to put forth recommendations, in-
cluding safe harbor exemptions, that modernize and improve access
to care using digital health technologies while protecting against
waste, fraud, and abuse. The Committee requests a briefing by the
Inspector General within 60 days of enactment of this act on rec-
ommendations to remove regulatory barriers that impede health in-
novation and access to care.
OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS
Appropriations, 202 ............................................................................... $39,798,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 39,798,000
The Committee provides $39,798,000 for the Office for Civil
Rights [OCR] in budget authority. OCR is responsible for enforcing
civil rights-related statutes in healthcare and human services pro-
grams. To enforce these statutes, OCR investigates complaints of
discrimination, conducts program reviews to correct discriminatory
practices, and implements programs to generate voluntary compli-
ance among providers and constituency groups of health and
human services.
RETIREMENT PAY AND MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR COMMISSIONED
OFFICERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $894,795,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 947,182,000
The Committee provides an estimated $947,182,000 in manda-
tory funds for Retirement Pay and Medical Benefits for Commis-
sioned Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service. This account pro-
vides for retirement payments to PHS officers who are retired due
to age, disability, or length of service; payments to survivors of de-
ceased officers; and medical care to Active Duty and retired offi-
cers, as well as their dependents.
PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND
In fiscal year 2026, the level transferred from the Prevention and
Public Health Fund after accounting for sequestration is
$1,438,075,000. The Committee includes bill language in section
222 of this act that requires that funds be transferred within 45
days of enactment of this act to the following accounts, for the fol-
lowing activities, and in the following amounts:

TITLE III
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
Any references in this title of the Committee Report to the ‘‘Sec-
retary’’ or the ‘‘Department’’ shall be interpreted to mean the Sec-
retary of Education or the Department of Education, respectively,
unless otherwise noted.
EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $19,107,790,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 19,157,790,000
The Committee provides $19,157,790,000, for programs in the
Education for the Disadvantaged account. Funds appropriated in
this account primarily support activities in the 2026–2027 school
year.
Grants to Local Educational Agencies
The Committee provides $18,456,802,000, for the title I–A grants
to local educational agencies [LEAs] program. Title I–A grants to
LEAs provide supplemental education funding, especially in high-
poverty areas, for LEAs to provide extra academic support to help
raise the achievement of eligible students or, in the case of school-
wide programs in which the vast majority of students participate
in title I–A programs, help all students in high-poverty schools
meet challenging State academic standards. Title I–A grants are
distributed through four ESEA formulas in amounts provided by
this act: basic, concentration, targeted, and the education finance
incentive grant [EFIG].
Of the funds available for title I–A grants to LEAs, up to
$5,000,000 shall be available on October 1, 2025, for transfer to the
Census Bureau for poverty updates; $8,229,490,000 will become
available on July 1, 2026; and $10,841,177,000 will become avail-
able on October 1, 2026. The funds that become available on July
1, 2026, and October 1, 2026, will remain available for obligation
through September 30, 2027.
School Support and Improvement.—The Committee appreciates
steps the Department has taken to improve compliance with ESEA
requirements for school support and improvement. These include
the targeted monitoring of ESEA provisions, additional rounds of
targeted monitoring on school improvement requirements, and
issuance of comprehensive guidance on school support and improve-
ment requirements. The Department must continue to increase its
efforts to ensure compliance of these requirements at all levels, in-
cluding through additional technical assistance, support, and moni-
toring. This should also include consideration of the least burden-
some ways to monitor, support, and ensure compliance of SEA,
LEA, and school support and improvement requirements.
(268)

269
The Committee also believes more transparency is needed
around findings and implementation of corrective actions from com-
prehensive and targeted monitoring of ESEA school support and
improvement requirements and the use of section 1003 school sup-
port and improvement funds. While the Department’s website has
information on its monitoring protocol and reports, it lacks trans-
parency on all of its monitoring activity, including on implementa-
tion of corrective actions that bring SEAs and LEAs into compli-
ance with the law’s requirements. The Committee directs the De-
partment to update its 2024 Report to Congress with implemented
actions and continue to provide public reporting of the Depart-
ment’s findings and actions it is requiring or recommending SEAs
to take in response to all monitoring and performance reviews of
State implementation of title I–A of the ESEA. This must include
findings from both comprehensive and targeted program moni-
toring, and the implementation of corrective actions and rec-
ommendations from such monitoring. Further, the Committee di-
rects the Department to publish the results of targeted monitoring
of State compliance with provisions under title I–A, including re-
port cards, for individual States on its website within 30 days of
providing such findings to SEAs. Finally, the Committee encour-
ages the Department to act to improve the reporting of section
1003 funds, particularly the evidence-based interventions required
to be implemented, the student populations supported, and the out-
comes achieved. The Committee requests a briefing not later than
60 days after enactment on the Department’s completed actions
and plans to continue making progress toward improved SEA,
LEA, and school implementation of related requirements and the
additional high-quality educational opportunities being made avail-
able to students for whom such opportunities are not currently
available.
State Reservation for Administration of Title I.—The Committee
bill includes new language that increases the amount of title I–A
funds States reserve for administration of parts A, C, and D of title
I of the ESEA. The new language provides each State with admin-
istrative resources of the greater of $500,000 or 1 percent of its al-
lotment under such parts of title I and each outlying area with a
reservation of $60,000. In addition, the new language requires the
1 percent reservation calculation to be updated to reflect the fiscal
year 2015 enacted appropriations for such programs.
Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grants
The Committee provides $194,000,000 for the Comprehensive
Literacy State Development Grants program. This program pro-
vides competitive grants to SEAs that then subgrant at least 95
percent of such funds to eligible entities to support efforts to im-
prove the literacy skills of children and students from birth
through 12th grade in high-need schools and early education pro-
grams in a State for each of several age bands through implemen-
tation of evidence-based practices and interventions.
Evidence-Based Instruction for Students with Language-Based
Learning Disabilities.—The Committee is aware ESEA requires the
Secretary to prioritize applications proposing evidence-based activi-
ties to develop or enhance comprehensive literacy instruction plans

270
that ensure high-quality instruction and effective strategies in
reading and writing for children from early childhood education
through grade 12. The Committee requests the Department to de-
scribe in the fiscal year 2027 CJ how grantees plan to use funds
for activities designed to strengthen and enhance teacher training
on the identification of language-based learning disabilities and
evidence-based methods of literacy instruction for students with
language-based learning disabilities.
Innovative Approaches to Literacy
The Committee provides $30,000,000 for the Innovative Ap-
proaches to Literacy program. This program provides competitive
grants to national not-for-profit organizations and school libraries
for providing books and childhood literacy activities to children and
families living in high-need communities.
The Committee continues to direct the Department to reserve no
less than 50 percent of funds under this program for grants to de-
velop and enhance effective school library programs, which may in-
clude providing professional development to school librarians,
books, and up-to-date materials to high-need schools. School library
programs increase access to a wide range of print and electronic re-
sources and provide learning opportunities for all students, particu-
larly those who are less likely to have access to such materials at
home. The Committee also encourages the Department to use a
portion of the funds under this program for grants to pediatric lit-
eracy programs that are provided during well-child visits by med-
ical providers trained in research-based methods of early language
and literacy.
In addition, the Committee directs the Department to ensure
that grants are distributed among eligible entities that will serve
geographically diverse areas, including communities that are rural,
Tribal, or where English is not the primary language. The Com-
mittee also encourages the Department to include a priority for ini-
tiatives that support biliteracy and multilingual approaches or pro-
vide professional development in multilingual education for exist-
ing school staff and teachers.
Migrant Education Program
The Committee provides $375,626,000 for the title I Migrant
Education program. This funding supports grants to SEAs to en-
sure that migratory children receive full and appropriate opportu-
nities to meet the same challenging State academic standards that
all children are expected to meet and help such children overcome
educational disruption and other factors that inhibit the ability of
such children to succeed in school. Funding also supports activities
to improve interstate and intrastate coordination of migrant edu-
cation programs, as well as identify and improve services to the mi-
grant student population.
Neglected and Delinquent
The Committee provides $49,239,000 for the Neglected and De-
linquent program. This program, authorized under subpart 1 of
title I–D of the ESEA, provides financial assistance to SEAs for
education services to neglected and delinquent children and youth

271
in State-run institutions and for juveniles in adult correctional in-
stitutions. States are authorized to set aside at least 15 percent,
but not more than 30 percent, of their Neglected and Delinquent
program funds to help students in State-operated institutions make
the transition into locally operated programs and to support the
successful reentry of youth offenders who are age 20 or younger
and have received a secondary school diploma or its recognized
equivalent. The Department is authorized to reserve up to 2.5 per-
cent of the appropriation for national activities, including technical
assistance. The Committee continues to urge the Department to in-
crease its direct and technical assistance support to further assist
grantees in their efforts to improve and report on program out-
comes.
Special Programs for Migrant Students
The Committee provides $52,123,000 for Special Programs for
Migrant Students, which consist of the High School Equivalency
Program [HEP] and the College Assistance Migrant Program
[CAMP]. HEP projects are 5-year grants to institutions of higher
education and other nonprofit organizations to recruit migrant stu-
dents ages 16 and older and provide the academic and support
services needed to help them obtain a high school equivalency cre-
dential and subsequently gain employment, attain admission to a
postsecondary institution or a job training program, or join the
military. CAMP projects are 5-year grants to institutions of higher
education and nonprofit organizations to provide tutoring, coun-
seling, and financial assistance to migrant students during their
first year of postsecondary education in order to support postsec-
ondary education program completion. The Committee urges the
Department to accelerate the program development timeline so no-
tices inviting applications can be issued early enough for the De-
partment to make new and non-competing continuation awards be-
fore July 1.
IMPACT AID
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,625,151,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,625,151,000
The Committee provides $1,625,151,000, for the Impact Aid pro-
gram. Impact Aid provides financial assistance to LEAs affected by
the presence of Federal activities and federally owned land. These
LEAs face unique challenges because they must educate children
living on federally owned land, such as military bases, while feder-
ally owned property is also exempt from local taxes, a primary
source of revenue for LEAs. LEAs also enroll students residing on
private property whose parents may be exempt from paying sales
and income taxes, reducing the revenue available to support these
LEAs.
Basic Support Payments
The Committee provides $1,474,000,000 for the Basic Support
Payments program. Under this statutory formula, payments are
made on behalf of all categories of federally-connected children to
compensate school districts for lost tax revenue.

272
Payments for Children With Disabilities
The Committee bill provides $48,316,000 for Payments for Chil-
dren With Disabilities. Under this program, additional payments
are made for certain federally connected children eligible for serv-
ices under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA].
Facilities Maintenance
The Committee provides $4,835,000 for Facilities Maintenance.
This activity provides funding for emergency repairs and com-
prehensive capital improvements to certain school facilities owned
by the Department and used by LEAs to serve federally connected
military dependent students. Funds appropriated for this purpose
are available until expended.
Construction
The Committee provides $19,000,000 for eligible LEAs for school
construction activities allocated through the authority for competi-
tive grants to LEAs under section 7007(b) of the ESEA. The bill
also allows the funds to be available for obligation through Sep-
tember 30, 2027.
Payments for Federal Property
The Committee provides $79,000,000 for Payments for Federal
Property. These payments compensate LEAs specifically for rev-
enue lost due to the removal of Federal property from local tax
rolls, regardless of whether any federally connected children attend
schools in the LEA.
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $5,776,178,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,781,178,000
The Committee provides $5,781,178,000 for the School Improve-
ment Programs account.
Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants
The Committee provides $2,190,080,000 for Supporting Effective
Instruction State Grants. States and LEAs may use funds for a
range of activities related to the certification, recruitment, profes-
sional development, and support of teachers and administrators.
Activities may include reforming teacher certification and licensure
requirements, addressing alternative routes to State certification of
teachers, recruiting teachers and principals, improving equitable
access to effective teachers, and implementing teacher mentoring
systems, evaluation and support systems, merit pay, and merit-
based performance systems. These funds may also be used by LEAs
to hire teachers to reduce class sizes.
The appropriation for this program primarily supports activities
associated with the 2026–2027 academic year. Of the funds pro-
vided, $508,639,000 will become available on July 1, 2026, and
$1,681,441,000 will become available on October 1, 2026. These
funds will remain available for obligation through September 30,
2027.

273
Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers
The Committee provides an appropriation of $1,329,673,000 for
the Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers pro-
gram. Funds are allocated to States by formula, which in turn,
award at least 95 percent of their allocations to LEAs, community-
based organizations, and other public and private entities. Grant-
ees use these resources to establish or expand community learning
centers that provide activities offering significant extended learn-
ing opportunities, such as before and after-school programs, rec-
reational activities, drug and violence prevention, and family lit-
eracy programs for students and related services to their families.
Centers must target their services to students who attend schools
that are eligible to operate a school-wide program under title I of
the ESEA or serve high percentages of students from low-income
families.
The Committee is aware of concerns with the lack of efficiency
and the delivery process within the 21st Century Community
Learning Center program, and urges the Department to examine
the distribution of funds through State departments of education to
ensure that their competitive grant and reporting process is
streamlined, adheres to congressional intent, is void of additional
regulations, and does not disadvantage rural schools, including but
not limited to, creating barriers to partnership with non-profit or-
ganizations. Furthermore, the Department is directed to report to
the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act on its
progress and findings and any additional measures taken to ad-
dress the program’s overall standards.
State Assessments Grants
The Committee provides $380,000,000 for the State Assessments
Grants program. This program provides formula grants to States
for the development and implementation of standards and assess-
ments required by the ESEA, including improving such assess-
ments through the adoption of through-course assessments and
other innovative assessments that meet ESEA’s requirements. This
program may assist States and LEAs in carrying out audits of their
assessment systems to eliminate low-quality or duplicative assess-
ments. It also provides competitive grants to States, including con-
sortia of States, to improve the quality, validity, and reliability of
academic assessments. These competitive grants may also be used
to support State planning leading to an Innovative Assessment
Demonstration Authority [IADA] application. The appropriation in-
cludes more than the statutorily required amount for formula
grants that would be available for competitive grants for state as-
sessments [CGSA].
Report on Improvements in Assessments.—The Committee recog-
nizes that assessments serve different purposes, ranging from
formative purposes to inform classroom instruction to summative
purposes to inform school accountability and improvement. CGSA
was authorized to support grantees seeking to improve both forma-
tive and summative assessments, depending on needs within their
States. The Committee directs the Department, through IES, to re-
port on innovative work it has or is supporting on assessments, in-
cluding through awards made through fiscal year 2025 under the

274
CGSA program. The report shall include an analysis of the assess-
ment work undertaken by recent CGSA grantees, any best prac-
tices that have emerged from CGSA grantees and how the Depart-
ment has shared and will continue to share those and other best
practices with other States in order to help all States improve their
assessments, how CGSA grantees have used funds to support IADA
work, how CGSA grantees have improved assessments for English
learners and students with disabilities, how CGSA grantees are
supporting through-course assessments to provide more real time
data to educators and parents, and how CGSA grantees are devel-
oping more culturally aware and responsive assessments. Such re-
port shall also describe how the Department is supporting, moni-
toring, and evaluating the CGSA program and its grantees and in-
clude recommendations for how ongoing innovative assessment
work can better support learning in classrooms, while maintaining
the importance of annual, statewide, summative assessment data
that produces disaggregated results for students and their families.
The Committee requests an initial update on this work not later
than 180 days after enactment of this act.
Education for Homeless Children and Youth
The Committee recommends $129,000,000 for carrying out edu-
cation activities authorized by title VII, subtitle B of the McKinney-
Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This program provides assistance
to each State to support an office of the coordinator of education
for homeless children and youth to develop and implement State
plans for educating children and youth experiencing homelessness,
and to make subgrants to LEAs to support the education of those
children and youth. Grants are made to States based on the total
that each State receives in title I–A grants to LEAs. States must
subgrant not less than 75 percent of funds received to LEAs and
may reserve remaining funds for State level activities. Under the
McKinney-Vento Homeless Children and Youth Program, SEAs
must ensure that children and youth experiencing homelessness
have equal access to the same free public education, including a
public preschool education, as is provided to other children and
youth.
The Committee bill continues to include language providing an
additional 12 months for educational agencies and institutions to
obligate and expend EHCY funds.
The Committee directs the Department to issue guidance clari-
fying that funds provided under title VII, subtitle B of the McKin-
ney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act may be used for the provision
of extraordinary or emergency assistance needed to enable home-
less children and youths to attend school and participate fully in
school activities as allowed under law. This shall include paying for
short-term, temporary emergency housing (such as a hotel or motel
room) on a case-by-case basis if reasonable and necessary to facili-
tate school attendance, and as a last resort when other funding
sources are not readily available.
Training and Advisory Services
For Training and Advisory Services authorized by title IV of the
Civil Rights Act (Public Law 88–352), the Committee provides

275
$6,575,000. The funds provided will support awards to operate re-
gional equity assistance centers [EACs]. EACs provide services to
LEAs, SEAs, and other customers upon request. Activities include
disseminating information on successful practices and legal re-
quirements related to nondiscrimination in educational programs
on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin and evidence-
based activities to improve access to high-quality educational set-
tings for all students, particularly students facing the greatest bar-
riers.
Native Hawaiian Education
The Committee provides $45,897,000 for the Education for Na-
tive Hawaiian program. In addition, the Committee bill continues
a provision that clarifies the use of funds for administrative costs.
The Committee bill provides $650,000 for the Native Hawaiian
Education Council, which is an increase of $150,000 for the Council
to fulfill the statutory requirement for data collection.
The Committee bill continues the set-aside of funds made avail-
able for the Education for Native Hawaiians program for grants for
construction, renovation, and modernization of any public elemen-
tary school, secondary school, or structure related to a public ele-
mentary school or secondary school, that serves a predominantly
Native Hawaiian student body. The Committee intends should
funds be available for new awards that they shall be made competi-
tively available to organizations in need of assistance with infra-
structure improvement for increased capacity to serve a predomi-
nantly Native Hawaiian student body.
Alaska Native Education
The Committee provides $44,953,000 for the Alaska Native Edu-
cation. These funds help address the unique educational needs of
Alaska Native schoolchildren. Funds are used for the development
of supplemental educational programs to benefit Alaska Natives.
Outreach and Program Responsiveness.—The Committee directs
the Department to make every effort to ensure that grants are
awarded well in advance of the school year, to maximize grantees’
ability to hire the necessary staff and have their programs ready
to go with the start of Alaska’s school year in mid-August. The
Committee continues to direct the Department to ensure that Alas-
ka Native Tribes, Alaska Native regional non-profits, and Alaska
Native corporations, particularly those that have received no or few
grants under this program, have the maximum opportunity to suc-
cessfully compete for grants under this program by providing these
entities multiple opportunities for technical assistance in devel-
oping successful applications for these funds, both in Alaska and
via various forms of telecommunications. The Committee also
strongly encourages the Department to include as many peer re-
viewers as possible who are Alaska Natives or who have experience
with Alaska Native education and Alaska generally on each peer
review panel.
Use of Funds.—The Committee continues bill language that al-
lows funding provided by this program to be used for construction
and overrides the authorizing statute’s requirement to make non-
competitive awards to certain organizations.

276
Rural Education
The Committee provides $225,000,000 for rural education pro-
grams. The Committee directs rural education funding to be equal-
ly divided between the Small, Rural School Achievement Program,
which provides funds to LEAs that serve a small number of stu-
dents, and the Rural and Low-Income School Program, which pro-
vides funds to LEAs that serve concentrations of poor students, re-
gardless of the number of students served.
The Rural Education Achievement Program [REAP] is the only
dedicated Federal funding stream for supporting rural schools. In
2020, the Department announced that some LEAs were using alter-
native poverty data to demonstrate eligibility for the Rural and
Low-Income School Program in place of the U.S. Census Bureau’s
Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as required by section
5221(b)(1)(A)(i) of the ESEA. The Department had routinely accept-
ed these data since the program was created in 2002. In fiscal
years 2021, 2022, and 2023, those LEAs that would have been
eliminated abruptly from eligibility were held harmless at a declin-
ing rate that would have continued to fall through fiscal year 2027.
In fiscal year 2024, bill language was included to hold the affected
LEAs harmless at the fiscal year 2023 level. The Committee has
also increased funding for REAP in the fiscal year 2021 through
2024 bills and includes an increase of $5,000,000 for this fiscal
year. The Committee understands that changes to eligibility for
funding received under this program create very significant chal-
lenges for several LEAs and States, at no fault of their own, and
therefore continues to include bill language that will hold the af-
fected LEAs harmless at the fiscal year 2023 level during this fiscal
year.
Comprehensive Centers
The Committee provides $50,000,000 for the Comprehensive Cen-
ters program. These funds provide support to a network of com-
prehensive centers that are operated by research organizations,
agencies, institutions of higher education, or partnerships thereof.
Centers provide training and technical assistance identified in an-
nual State service plans to build the capacity of SEAs and the Bu-
reau of Indian Education [BIE], and through them LEAs, and
schools, to provide a high quality education to all students.
Section 202 of the Educational Technical Assistance Act of 2002
requires centers to report on their activities and the SEAs and
LEAs assisted during the preceding year. The Committee requests
the Secretary post these reports not later than 180 days after en-
actment of this act.
The Committee is supportive of the work of the centers in sup-
porting SEAs, LEAs, Tribal Education Agencies, and schools in se-
lecting, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based programs,
policies, practices, and interventions to improve academic achieve-
ment and addressing corrective actions or results from audit find-
ings and ESEA program monitoring. Further, centers play an im-
portant role in supporting State and local efforts to close oppor-
tunity gaps and improve educational outcomes, particularly for stu-
dents attending schools implementing comprehensive support and
improvement or targeted or additional targeted support and im-

277
provement activities. The Committee directs the Department to
brief the Committee not later than 60 days after enactment on how
center annual service plans and center services are addressing
school support and improvement activities of SEAs and LEAs.
Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants
The Committee provides $1,380,000,000 for Student Support and
Academic Enrichment [SSAE] Grants. This program provides for-
mula grants to States based on each State’s share of title I–A
grants, which then sub-grant to LEAs, to help improve academic
achievement by supporting activities that provide students with a
well-rounded education, ensure safe and supportive learning envi-
ronments, and use technology to improve instruction.
Technical Assistance and Capacity Building.—The Committee
notes the limited information provided in the fiscal year 2026 CJ
on expenditures for the 2 percent set-aside for technical assistance
and capacity building from prior year appropriations. The reserva-
tion for technical assistance and capacity building shall be used to
support SEAs and LEAs in carrying out authorized activities under
this program identified by SEAs and LEAs. In future CJs, the De-
partment shall continue to provide current and planned expendi-
tures for this reservation and include a plan for how resources will
be spent to provide technical assistance and to build the capacity
of SEAs and LEAs.
Report on Use of Funds.—The Committee directs the Department
to obtain and examine data on State and local expenditures, out-
lined by specific authorized activities, and provide information
about how LEAs plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their activi-
ties. The Committee directs the Department, within 180 days after
the enactment of this act, to provide a briefing to the Committee
on implementation of this directive.
INDIAN EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $194,746,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 194,746,000
The Committee provides $194,746,000 for Indian Education pro-
grams.
Grants to Local Educational Agencies
For grants to LEAs, the Committee provides $110,381,000. These
funds provide financial support to elementary and secondary school
programs that serve Indian students, including preschool children.
Funds are awarded on a formula basis to LEAs, schools supported
and operated by the Department of the Interior/Bureau of Indian
Education, and in some cases directly to Indian Tribes.
Special Programs for Indian Children
The Committee provides $72,000,000 for Special Programs for In-
dian Children. Funds are used for demonstration grants to improve
Indian student achievement from early childhood education
through college preparation programs, and for professional develop-
ment grants for training Indians who are preparing to begin ca-
reers in teaching and school administration.

278
The Department is directed to use no less than $5,000,000 of
funds available to continue the teacher retention-initiative in-
tended to help address the shortage of Indian, Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian educators and to expand their impact on students’
education. The initiative must support teacher leadership models
as a method to increase the retention of effective, experienced In-
dian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian teachers. Outcomes and
models of culturally-responsive teacher leaders participating in this
program must have their growth and effectiveness measured and
these findings shall support the development of evidence-, research-
and culturally responsive teacher leadership models. The Depart-
ment is directed to publish such findings within a year of enact-
ment of this act.
National Activities
The Committee provides $12,365,000 for National Activities.
Funds are used to expand efforts to improve research, evaluation,
and data collection on the status and effectiveness of Indian edu-
cation programs, and to continue grants to Tribal educational de-
partments for education administration and planning. The bill in-
cludes language allowing more than 20 percent of these funds to
be used for grants for Native American Language Immersion. The
Committee bill also continues language from the current appropria-
tions act, which allows the Secretary to make such awards for a pe-
riod not to exceed 5 years.
Native American Language Immersion Programs.—The Com-
mittee provides not less than $4,500,000 for Native American Lan-
guage Immersion programs. This amount will support new and
continuation awards in fiscal year 2026. Funds for the Native
American Language Immersion program shall continue to be allo-
cated to all types of eligible entities, including both new and exist-
ing language immersion programs and schools, to support the
greatest possible geographical distribution and language diversity.
Further, the Department shall continue to give the same consider-
ation to applicants that propose to provide partial immersion
schools and programs as to full immersion, as the local Tribes,
schools, and other applicants know best what type of program will
most effectively assist their youth to succeed.
Native American Language Resource Centers.—The Committee
recognizes the importance of the Native American Languages Re-
source Centers, and that such centers are integral to supporting
the revitalization of such Native American languages, including by
encouraging and supporting the use of Native American languages
as a medium of instruction. In addition, the Committee recognizes
the need to encourage and support early childhood education pro-
grams, elementary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of
higher education to include Native American languages in the cur-
riculum as the primary mode of instruction, and in the same man-
ner as other world languages, including through cooperative agree-
ments and distance education, and to grant proficiency in Native
American languages the same full academic credit as proficiency in
other world languages. The Committee recommendation includes
$2,390,000 to continue to carry out the policy set forth in Public

279
Law 117–335 and direction provided in prior fiscal years to estab-
lish Native American Language Resource Centers.
INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,115,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,183,647,000
The Committee provides $1,183,647,000 for programs within the
Innovation and Improvement account.
Education Innovation and Research
The Committee provides $235,000,000 for the Education Innova-
tion and Research [EIR] program. This program supports the cre-
ation, development, implementation, replication, and scaling up of
evidence-based, field-initiated State and local innovations designed
to improve student achievement and attainment for high-need stu-
dents. EIR incorporates a tiered evidence framework that provides
early-phase, mid-phase, and expansion and replication grants. This
supports interventions throughout the pipeline, from smaller
grants for early stage projects that are willing to undergo rigorous
evaluation to test their efficacy to larger grants to scale-up proven-
effective interventions that have demonstrated significant impacts
through at least one rigorous evaluation.
Briefing Requirement.—The Committee directs the Department
brief the Committees on the fiscal year 2026 funding opportunities
available under this program, including any proposed priorities, not
less than 14 days prior to publication in the Federal Register.
Grant Priorities.—The Committee notes there is significant de-
mand from the field to test many types of strategies and to exam-
ine promising techniques that can be scaled-up in different set-
tings. For example, the EIR program can be a highly effective tool
for developing innovative solutions to critical problems, such as
worsening teacher shortages, widening achievement gaps, and dis-
parate access to advanced courses for promising students. The pro-
gram could also support scalable STEM initiatives that serve rural
and economically transitioning communities, including those pro-
grams that integrate agricultural technology, data science, and
project-based learning to strengthen workforce readiness and
teacher capacity. The Committee also supports EIR funds being
used for grants for evidence-based projects that foster knowledge
and promote the development of foundational skills that support
schools and parents to prepare students to be informed, thoughtful
and productive individuals ready to succeed in school and life. The
Committee directs funds to continue to support diverse and field-
initiated interventions such as the ones noted above, rather than
a single nationwide program or award focused solely on one area
of educational innovation.
School Support and Improvement.—The Committee recognizes
that funds under section 1003(a) of the ESEA are meant to support
schools that are currently identified for support, consistent with
the statutory requirements for identifying schools for CSI, ATSI,
and TSI, but continuing to build the evidence base for school im-
provement efforts in schools that have exited status and are no
longer identified is also important. The Committee encourages the

280
Department to prioritize grants to LEAs meeting EIR requirements
that would support capacity-building and school improvement ac-
tivities for schools that have exited improvement status.
Rural Set-Aside.—The Committee supports the required 25 per-
cent set-aside within EIR for rural areas and encourages the De-
partment to take steps necessary to ensure the set-aside is met and
that EIR funds are awarded to diverse geographic areas. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to invest in rural, high-need
communities by ensuring grants are awarded to a diverse set of in-
stitutions, affecting varied geographic locations, including areas
with substantial minority students, which have submitted high
quality applications meeting EIR program requirements.
Charter School Program
The Committee provides $440,000,000 for the Charter School
Program [CSP]. This program supports the start-up, replication,
and expansion of high-quality public charter schools prepared to ef-
fectively serve all students. The Committee also include a new gen-
eral provision allowing the Department to transfer up to
$60,000,000 from the nonrecurring expenses fund to the CSP for
additional CSP activities as allowed under this act.
Program Activities.—The Committee continues bill language pro-
viding increased flexibility within the program to effectively re-
spond to the changing needs of the sector and increase the likeli-
hood that Federal funds will be invested in high-quality charter
schools prepared to serve all students effectively. Both the author-
izing statute and prior year appropriations bills dictated the use of
the appropriation in ways that prevented the Department from al-
locating funds based on the number of high quality applications in
grant competitions and emerging needs of the field. To facilitate
this, the Committee directs the Department to run competitions for
charter school programs on similar cycles. The language will con-
tinue to allow the Department to allocate not more than
$140,000,000 for replication and expansion of high-quality charter
schools through the Charter Management Organization [CMO] pro-
gram established in ESEA.
The bill also allocates not less than $60,000,000 for Facilities
Grants under section 4304, including the Credit Enhancement pro-
gram. The Committee is supportive of construction and renovation
of charter school facilities, including storm shelters, safe rooms,
and other infrastructure improvements such as fortified roof and
wall construction to improve windstorm, tornado, and hurricane re-
silience. The bill also provides not more than $16,000,000 for na-
tional activities to provide technical assistance, disseminate best
practices, and evaluate the impact of the charter school program.
Finally, funds are available for use under 4305(a)(2) for Developer
grants and under section 4303 for State Entity grants. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to provide a briefing on its planned
use of flexibility provided not later than 14 days prior to the an-
nouncement of any notice of proposed priorities, notice inviting ap-
plications for CSP activities, and announcement of grant awards.
No-Cost Extensions.—The Committee is aware that recipients of
grants under the CSP are sometimes unable to complete their
projects within the original project period, often for reasons beyond

281
their control (such as lower than anticipated subrecipient applica-
tions received, trouble obtaining charter school authorization, and
delays in Department approval of charter school authorizers, uses
of funds, or the allocation of subgrant funds). The Committee
strongly urges the Department to act favorably on requests for
longer extensions in these situations, including for States receiving
a new award in fiscal year 2025, particularly when an extension
would enable the completion of subgrants made late in the grant
period or when it is clear that the delays in carrying out project
activities were largely unavoidable by the grantees and, thus, that
requests likely meet the requirements of section 75.261 of the
EDGAR regulations. The Committee directs the Department to
brief the Committee on the Department’s response to this concern
within 90 days of publication of this report and to provide an up-
date in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the Department’s implementa-
tion of any changes in practice related to this issue.
Pre-application Support.—The Committee is aware that there is
currently no source of consistent public funding to support the ap-
plication phase of developing a new public charter school. Yet re-
search shows that this kind of pre-application support results in
stronger charter school applications, higher authorization rates,
and more effective school openings. The Committee urges the De-
partment to support activities such as pre-application webinars and
best practice resources to enable potential applicants to develop
proposals meeting all ESEA requirements, including in creating
new public charter schools prepared to expand opportunities for
children with disabilities, English learners, and other traditionally
underserved students to attend charter schools and meet chal-
lenging State academic standards.
State Entity Subgrantees.—Under the CSP, State Entities receive
competitive grants that are subsequently distributed as subgrants
to support the opening of new charter schools, the replication of
high-quality charter schools, and the expansion of high-quality
charter schools. As required by ESEA, when eligible State Entities
apply for these grants, they include in their applications the pro-
jected number of subgrants that they expect to make in each of
those three categories. After completing their subgrant competi-
tions, however, State Entities will typically find that they must de-
viate from their initial projections in order to support the highest-
quality applicants, regardless of category. The Committee notes
State Entities received awards based on the quality of their appli-
cations, including projections of schools to be opened. However, if
the State Entity attempts to but is unable to implement the ap-
proved plan, the timely approval of amendments to subgrant pro-
jections could facilitate the most effective use of these resources in
creating high-quality public educational options for students. The
Committee directs the Secretary to allow State Entities to diverge
from their original projections after conducting competitions that
do not meet subgrant projections in their approved application, in
order to fund the highest-quality subgrant applicants that meet all
Federal requirements. The Committee further directs the Depart-
ment to report on the implementation of this directive in next
year’s CJ.

282
Technical Assistance.—The Department is directed to continue to
support and evaluate flexibility in the availability and effective use
of CSP State Entity technical assistance resources; evaluate how
such funds are used to ensure subgrantees are equipped to meet
the needs of all students, and specifically students with disabilities
and English learners as required by law; and, brief the Committees
not later than 90 days after enactment of this act on its actions
and continued plans to effectively oversee the CSP program.
Uses of Funds.—The Committee notes that grant recipients
under the Charter Schools Grants to State Entities program often
encounter delays in their implementation of their grants because of
uncertainty over whether certain uses of funds are allowable under
the ESEA and while the Department goes through the process of
reviewing individual costs for compliance monitoring. For example,
while section 4303(h) allows funding of ‘‘appropriate, non-sustained
costs when such costs cannot be met from other sources’’, it is often
unclear whether specific costs should be considered sustained or
non-sustained, with the confusion sometimes emanating from un-
clear language in the State statutes that provide funding for char-
ter schools. In other situations, a funding category such as ‘‘educa-
tor compensation’’ could encompass activities that are either sus-
tained or non-sustained, depending on the manner in which those
activities are carried out.
The Committee therefore strongly urges the Department to re-
solve these spending issues in a timely manner and in a manner
that provides grantees with maximum flexibility consistent with
the statute. The Department shall allow State Entities to support
all activities listed under section 4303(h), including transportation,
renovation, and staff expenses, so long as they contribute to the ob-
jective of developing, implementing, expanding, and replicating
high-quality charter schools. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to brief the Committee on the Department’s response to this
concern within 90 days of publication of this report and to provide
an update in the fiscal year 2027 CJ on the Department’s imple-
mentation of any changes in practice related to this issue.
Magnet Schools Assistance
The Committee provides $139,000,000 for the Magnet Schools
Assistance program. This program supports grants to LEAs to es-
tablish and operate magnet schools that are part of a court-ordered
or federally approved voluntary desegregation plan. Magnet schools
are designed to attract substantial numbers of students from dif-
ferent social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. Grantees
may use funds for planning and promotional materials; salaries of
instructional staff; transportation, as long as such expenses are
sustainable beyond the grant period and not a significant portion
of the grant; and the purchase of technology, educational materials,
and equipment.
Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants
The Committee provides $60,000,000 for Teacher and School
Leader Incentive Grants. This program provides competitive grants
to eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or expand
human capital management systems or performance-based com-

283
pensation systems in schools. Funds can be used for a wide-range
of activities, including developing or improving evaluation and sup-
port systems that are based in part on student achievement; pro-
viding principals with necessary tools to make school-level deci-
sions; implementing a differentiated salary structure based on a
variety of factors; improving the recruitment and retention of effec-
tive teachers, principals, and other school leaders; and instituting
career advancement opportunities that reward effective teachers,
principals and other school leaders.
Ready-To-Learn Television
The Committee provides $28,500,000 for the Ready-to-Learn Tel-
evision program. This program is designed to facilitate student aca-
demic achievement by leveraging the power and reach of public tel-
evision to develop and distribute educational video programming,
and digital content, for preschool and elementary school children
and their parents, caregivers, and teachers.
Arts in Education
The Committee provides $31,500,000 for the Arts in Education
program. The funding is used for a program of competitive awards
for assistance for arts education, including professional develop-
ment for arts educators, teachers and principals; developing and
disseminating accessible instructional materials and arts-based
educational programming; and for national and community out-
reach activities that strengthen relationships among LEAs, schools,
communities and arts organizations. Funds also are used for eval-
uation and dissemination activities.
National Program.—The Committee recommendation includes no
less than $8,000,000 for a national program grant competition. The
Committee includes bill language intended to ensure the Depart-
ment does not administer the Arts in Education program activities
in a consolidated grant competition as it did in fiscal year 2021.
The language further requires the Department to use not less than
$8,000,000 for an Arts in Education National Program competition
following priorities and program requirements of the fiscal year
2022 competition.
Javits Gifted and Talented Students
The Committee provides $16,500,000 for the Javits Gifted and
Talented Students Education program. Funds are used for awards
to State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher edu-
cation, and other public and private agencies for research, dem-
onstration, and technical assistance activities designed to enhance
the capability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the spe-
cial educational needs of gifted and talented students. Under
ESEA, the Department gives priority to making awards for projects
that include evidence-based activities or that develop new informa-
tion to improve the capacity of schools to operate gifted and tal-
ented education programs or to assist schools in identifying and
serving traditionally underserved students

284
Supporting Effective Educator Development
The Committee provides $90,000,000 for the Supporting Effective
Educator Development [SEED] program. SEED provides competi-
tive grants to improve teacher and principal effectiveness by sup-
porting pathways that help teachers, principals, or other school
leaders with non-traditional preparation and certification obtain
employment in underserved LEAs; providing evidence-based profes-
sional development; and making services and learning opportuni-
ties freely available to LEAs.
Effective School Leaders.—The Committee recognizes the signifi-
cant impact of effective school principals and other school leaders
on student achievement and other student outcomes, and believes
the SEED program provides important support for helping ensure
that more highly trained school leaders are available for service in
schools that have concentrations of students from low-income fami-
lies. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary to continue to
use a portion of funds made available for SEED for new awards
supporting the preparation of principals and other school leaders.
American History and Civics Education
The Committee provides $23,000,000 for American History and
Civics Education, including $3,000,000 for Presidential and Con-
gressional Academies for American History and Civics and
$20,000,000 for American History and Civics Education National
Activities.
Presidential Academies for the Teaching of American History and
Civics offer residential workshops to elementary and secondary
school teachers to strengthen their knowledge through instruction
and interaction with primary scholars and accomplished teachers
in these fields. The Congressional Academies for Students of Amer-
ican History and Civics provide similar workshops to students to
enrich their understanding of American history and civics.
Statewide Family Engagement Centers
The Committee provides $20,000,000 for Statewide Family En-
gagement Centers. This program provides competitive grants to
statewide organizations to promote and implement evidence-based
family engagement activities in education programs, and provide
training and technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, schools, and other
organizations for carrying out such activities.

285
Promise Neighborhoods
The Committee provides $91,000,000 for the Promise Neighbor-
hoods program. This program awards competitive grants to not-for-
profit, community-based organizations for the development of com-
prehensive neighborhood programs designed to combat the effects
of poverty and improve educational and life outcomes for children
and youth, from birth through college. Each Promise Neighborhood
grantee serves a high-poverty urban neighborhood or rural commu-
nity. Grants are for up to 5 years, with the final 2 years of funding
contingent on grantee performance against program- and project-
level performance objectives. Further, grants may be extended an
additional 2 years beyond the 5-year project period contingent on
grantee performance. The bill continues to provide extended avail-
ability of these funds, to allow the Department more flexibility for
the timing of new awards and maximize the time for grantee plan-
ning activities.
Promise Neighborhoods Extensions.—The Committee directs the
Department to use any available fiscal year 2026 funds, not being
used for continuation awards, only for 2-year extension grants to
high quality Promise Neighborhood grantees that have dem-
onstrated improvements in program performance indicators or for
new 5-year implementation awards. If the Departments runs a
grant competition for new 5-year awards, it is directed to allow pre-
viously awarded grantees with programs that may have recently
expired to compete for additional funding for the same neighbor-
hood, provided they have at least 5 years of successfully submitting
GPRA data, demonstrated improvements in Promise Neighbor-
hoods indicators, and justify the need for additional funding for
their continued implementation of high quality plans and evidence-
based activities.
School Safety National Activities
The Committee provides $190,000,000 for School Safety National
Activities, including up to $5,000,000 as necessary for Project
SERV, which provides assistance to schools and institutions of
higher education to respond and recover in the aftermath of violent
or traumatic events disrupting the learning environment. School
Safety National Activities funding also supports several grant and
technical assistance activities intended to improve the safety,
health, and well-being of all students. The Committee requests a
briefing not later than 14 days prior to the issuance of any notice
inviting applications or notice of proposed priorities.
Mental Health Service Professional Development Grant Program
and School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program.—With
the goal of addressing the shortage of school-based mental health
professionals in our Nation’s elementary and secondary schools by
expanding the pipeline of these professionals and improving dis-
tricts’ ability to recruit and retain these professionals, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to allocate all funds not required for
continuation awards or Project SERV awards to be equally split be-
tween the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration
Grant Program and the School-Based Mental Health Services
Grant to increase the number of well-trained school counselors,
school social workers, and school psychologists, or other mental

286
health professionals qualified to provide school-based mental health
services. The Committee recognizes the significant impact of sub-
stance use disorders and adverse childhood experiences on the
mental health and academic success of students. Therefore, the
Committee encourages the Department to continue to prioritize
grants to eligible entities with demonstrated need, which should in-
clude States with a high prevalence of adverse childhood experi-
ences and youth with substance use disorders.
Full Service Community Schools
The Committee provides $135,000,000 for Full-Service Commu-
nity Schools. This program provides support for the planning, im-
plementation, and operation of full-service community schools that
improve the integration, accessibility, and effectiveness of services
for children and families, particularly for children attending high-
poverty schools, including high-poverty rural schools.
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $890,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 890,000,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $890,000,000 for the
English Language Acquisition [ELA] program.
The Department makes formula grants to States based on each
State’s share of the Nation’s limited-English-proficient and recent
immigrant student population. The program is designed to increase
the capacity of States and school districts to address the needs of
these students. The authorizing statute requires that 6.5 percent of
the appropriation be used to support national activities, which in-
clude professional development activities designed to increase the
number of highly qualified teachers serving limited-English-pro-
ficient students; and a National Clearinghouse for English Lan-
guage Acquisition and Language Instructional Programs. National
activities funds are available for 2 years.
Briefing.—The Committee recognizes that every State has
English language learners who rely on targeted instruction and
dedicated programmatic support to access the curriculum and meet
academic standards. The Committee notes the role that the former
Office of English Language Acquisition played in managing the Na-
tive American and Alaska Native Children in Schools grants, Na-
tional Professional Development grants, and the National Clearing-
house for English Language Acquisition program as well as pro-
viding technical assistance to States and enforcing title III require-
ments of the ESEA. The Committee intends for these activities to
continue as the Department carries out its statutory responsibil-
ities under ESEA with respect to English learner students and re-
quests a briefing not later than 90 days after enactment on the De-
partment’s implemented actions and plans to improve outcomes for
English learners, which shall also include information on staffing
levels and fulfillment of statutory requirements.
SPECIAL EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,467,264,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,517,264,000

287
The Committee provides an appropriation of $15,517,264,000 for
special education programs. The Committee notes the important
role that the Office of Special Education Programs [OSEP] plays in
ensuring States’ compliance with IDEA and requests an update in
the fiscal year 2027 congressional justification on OSEP’s IDEA
monitoring and technical assistance support efforts maintained by
funding provided in this act.
Grants to States
The Committee provides $14,263,704,000 for IDEA part B Grants
to States. This program provides formula grants to assist States,
outlying areas, and other entities in meeting the costs of providing
special education and related services for children with disabilities.
States pass along most of these funds to LEAs, but may reserve
some for program monitoring, enforcement, technical assistance,
and other activities. The appropriation for this program primarily
supports activities associated with the 2026–2027 academic year.
Of the funds available for this program, $4,980,321,000 will become
available on July 1, 2026, and $9,283,383,000 will become available
on October 1, 2026. These funds will remain available for obligation
through September 30, 2027.
Preschool Grants
The Committee provides $420,000,000 for Preschool Grants. This
program provides formula grants to States to assist them in mak-
ing available special education and related services for children

funds to LEAs. States must serve all eligible children with disabil-
ities aged 3 through 5 and have an approved application under the
IDEA.
Grants for Infants and Families
The Committee provides $540,000,000 for the Grants for Infants
and Families program under part C of the IDEA. Part C of IDEA
authorizes formula grants to States, outlying areas, and other enti-
ties to implement State-wide systems for providing early interven-
tion services to all children with disabilities, ages 2 and younger,
and their families. IDEA also gives States the option of extending
eligibility for part C services to children 3 and older if they were
previously served under part C and will continue to be served until
entrance to kindergarten.
State Personnel Development
The Committee provides $38,630,000 for the State Personnel De-
velopment program. Ninety percent of funds must be used for pro-
fessional development activities. The program supports grants to
SEAs to help them reform and improve their personnel preparation
and professional development related to early intervention, edu-
cational, and transition services that improve outcomes for stu-
dents with disabilities.
Technical Assistance and Dissemination
The Committee provides $39,345,000 for Technical Assistance
and Dissemination. This program supports awards for technical as-

288
sistance, model demonstration projects, the dissemination of useful
information, and other activities. Funding supports activities that
are designed to improve the services provided under the IDEA.
National Transition Technical Assistance Center for Students and
Youth with Disabilities.—The Committee notes the National Tran-
sition Technical Assistance Center for Students and Youth with
Disabilities has supported state special education and vocational
rehabilitation personnel in improving practices that promote better
outcomes, specifically leading to competitive integrated employ-
ment for students and youth with disabilities, by providing infor-
mation, tools, and assistance in the use of evidence-based practices.
The Committee notes the IDEA requires the Secretary to make
competitive grants to, or enter contracts or cooperative agreements
with eligible entities to disseminate information about innovative,
effective, and efficient curricula designs, instructional approaches,
and strategies, and identify positive academic and social learning
opportunities, that provide effective transitions between edu-
cational settings or from school to post-school settings, and the Re-
habilitation Act of 1973 allows the Secretary to provide grants to,
or enter into contracts with, eligible entities to improve transition
from education, including postsecondary education to employment,
particularly in competitive integrated employment, for youth who
are individuals with significant disabilities. The Committee re-
quests the Department provide an update on the required work,
outcomes, and multi-year goals and objectives of the center in the
fiscal year 2027 CJ.
Personnel Preparation
The Committee provides $115,000,000 for the Personnel Prepara-
tion program. Funds support competitive awards to help address
State-identified needs for personnel who are qualified to work with
children with disabilities, including special education teachers and
related services personnel. The program is required to fund several
other broad areas, including training leadership personnel and per-
sonnel who work with children with low-incidence disabilities, and
providing enhanced support for beginning special educators.
Parent Information Centers
The Committee provides $33,152,000 for Parent Information
Centers. This program makes awards to parent organizations to
support parent training and information centers, including commu-
nity parent resource centers. These centers provide training and in-

for Vocational Rehabilitation [VR] State Grants. State Grants as-
sist States in providing a range of services to help persons with
physical and mental disabilities prepare for and engage in mean-
ingful employment. The Committee provides an increase in VR
State Grants according to the CPI–U, consistent with the author-
izing statute.
Disability Innovation Fund [DIF].—The Committee directs the
Department to use a portion of DIF funds for competitive grants,
to be awarded in coordination with the Office of Disability Employ-
ment Policy, to eligible entities in partnership with State VR agen-
cies for innovative strategies that significantly increase competitive
integrated employment of youth and adults with disabilities. The
Committee expects this will focus on expanding the capacity and
the State network of eligible entities providing employment sup-
ports in States, prioritizing States that have returned funds to RSA
or States from the two lowest quintiles of labor force participation
rates for people with disabilities.
The Committee directs the Department to continue to brief the
Committees on Appropriations; the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate; the Committee on Edu-
cation and Workforce of the House of Representatives; the Com-
mittee on Finance of the Senate; and the Committee on Ways and
Means of the House of Representatives at least every 6 months
with updates on activities funded within DIF.
Client Assistance State Grants
The Committee provides $13,000,000 in discretionary funds for
Client Assistance State Grants. This program funds State formula
grants to help VR clients or client applicants understand the bene-
fits available to them. States must operate client assistance pro-
grams to receive VR State Grant funds.

Early Language Acquisition Project [ELAP].—The Committee in-
cludes $8,500,000 to continue the National expansion of ELAP
through the Gallaudet University regional centers, of which the
current partner is a regional center. ELAP supports early language
acquisition for children from birth through age three who are deaf
or hard of hearing. This program also supports activities to im-
prove early language acquisition training for early educators, care-
takers, and other professionals and allows Gallaudet to expand and
build on its current research in this area, and test and evaluate
interventions in diverse geographic areas.
CAREER, TECHNICAL, AND ADULT EDUCATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,181,436,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,181,436,000
Career and Technical Education
The Committee provides $1,452,269,000 for Career and Technical
Education [CTE] programs.
State Grants.—The Committee provides $1,439,848,000 for CTE
State grants. Funds provided under the State grant program assist
States, localities, and outlying areas to expand and improve their
CTE programs and ensure equal access to CTE for populations
with special needs. Persons assisted range from secondary students
in pre-vocational courses through adults who need retraining to
adapt to changing technological and labor market conditions. Per
the authorization of the program, after reservations for required
set-asides and small State minimums, funds are distributed to a
baseline level of the amount awarded to each State in fiscal year
2018, with any remaining funds allocated according to a formula
based on State population and State per capita income.
Under the Indian and Hawaiian Natives programs, competitive
grants are awarded to federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal
organizations and to organizations primarily serving and rep-
resenting Hawaiian Natives for services that are additional to what
these groups receive under other provisions of the Perkins Act
(Public Law 88–210).
Of the funds available for this program, $648,848,000 will be-
come available July 1, 2026, and $791,000,000 will become avail-
able on October 1, 2026. These funds will remain available for obli-
gation until September 30, 2027.

293
National Activities.—The Committee provides $12,421,000 for na-
tional activities, including up to $6,100,000 for Innovation and
Modernization grants.
The Committee notes that section 114(d)(2) of the Perkins Act re-
quires the Department to use funds appropriated for national ac-
tivities for ‘‘a series of research and evaluation initiatives for each
year for which funds are appropriated.’’ The Committee directs the
Department to provide a briefing to the Committees, the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the
House Committee on Education and Workforce no later than 90
days after enactment on the Department’s implementation of the
requirements under section 114(d)(2) of the Perkins Act, including
past and planned uses of funds for research and evaluation initia-
tives. The Committee directs the Department to provide a list of
the research and evaluation initiatives carried out with such funds
for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026, the amounts planned or
obligated for each initiative, and the timeline for competition of
each such initiative as well as planned uses for funds in fiscal year
2027 in the fiscal year 2027 CJs.
The Committee continues to encourage the Department to work
with the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Commerce to develop
a pilot project to increase the quality of, and participation in, CTE
programs related to the skills needed for new submarine construc-
tion.
The Committee strongly encourages the Department to include a
priority for projects that include, as a component of an innovative
career and technical education program, evidence-based school-
based mentoring activities focused on providing students with the
skills and experiences needed to be successful in the workplace in
any new competitions under the Innovation and Modernization
grants authority.
The Committee requests the Department provide a briefing to
the Committees 180 days after enactment detailing any plans the
Department has to include a priority for grants that support the
establishment of online savings accounts as authorized under the
Innovation and Modernization Grants authority in section 114(e) of
the Perkins Act.
The Committee recognizes the importance of preparing students
for postsecondary education and the workforce, including through
the Career Connected High School Program as described in the
Federal Register on August 14, 2023 (88 Fed. Reg. 54908). This
program provides students with access to dual enrollment, work-
based learning opportunities, in-demand industry credentials, and
career navigation systems, and prioritizes opportunities for stu-
dents from families with low incomes and students living in rural
areas to complete high-quality career pathways that culminate
with an associate, bachelor’s or advanced degree or completion of
a Registered Apprenticeship program after high school. The Com-
mittee urges the Department to continue to support this program
through the Innovation and Modernization Grants authority.
Adult Education
The Committee provides $729,167,000 for Adult Education pro-
grams.

294
Adult Education State Grants.—The Committee recommendation
provides $715,455,000 for Adult Education State Grants which pro-
vide funding for States for programs that assist adults in becoming
literate and in obtaining the skills necessary for employment and
self-sufficiency.
National Leadership Activities.—The Committee provides
$13,712,000 for adult education national leadership activities.
The Committee encourages the Department to support technical
assistance that will help build the evidence-base of adult education
programs, including supporting States in prioritizing rigorously
evaluated programs and the development of rigorous evidence such
as funding randomized control trials, quasi-experimental studies
and other evaluation methods that provide for a causal under-
standing of the effects of programs.
The Committee also encourages the Department to prioritize ac-
tivities that reengage adults who have dropped out of the labor
force, with a priority on States that have low labor participation
rates.
STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $24,615,352,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 24,615,352,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $24,615,352,000 for
programs under the Student Financial Assistance account.
Federal Pell Grant Program
The Committee provides $22,475,352,000 in current year discre-
tionary funding for the Pell grant program. This funding combined
with the additional $10,500,000,000 provided to support the discre-
tionary costs of the program in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
(Public Law 119–21) will ensure the Pell grant program does not
face a funding shortfall in fiscal year 2026.
The Committee recommendation includes $6,335 for the discre-
tionary portion of the maximum Pell grant award. Combined with
mandatory funding, under current law, this would provide a total
maximum award of $7,395 for the 2026–2027 award year.
Pell Grant Restoration and Prison Education Program.—The
Committee continues to recognize the value of the Pell Grant in
supporting effective prison education programs for incarcerated in-
dividuals, reducing recidivism rates, and saving taxpayer dollars by
reducing the overall cost of incarceration. The Committee directs
the Department to provide technical assistance that encourages ad-
ditional institutions to establish a Prison Education Program [PEP]
and work to transition all former Second Chance Pell experimental
sites to become a PEP. In addition, the Committee strongly encour-
ages the Department to coordinate with the Bureau of Prisons,
State departments of corrections, county and local jail administra-
tors, and accrediting agencies to enroll new PEP providers. The
Committee directs the Department to publish a publicly available
list of approved PEPs on a quarterly basis so that incarcerated stu-
dents, corrections officials, and policymakers have a public source
of information about PEP availability.

295
The Committee also encourages the Department to develop and
provide technical assistance and guidance to institutions of higher
education on how to support formerly incarcerated students as they
leave prison, reenter society, and reenroll in postsecondary edu-
cation. This guidance should address evidence-based strategies for
helping formerly incarcerated people to secure housing, employ-
ment, and other Federal benefits, as well as re-enroll in college, ac-
cess Federal and State financial aid, and secure campus housing
and student employment. The Department should convey to insti-
tutions of higher education that they should work to ensure that
every student who participates in a Prison Education Program is
able to reenter their communities successfully post-release.
Workforce Pell Grants.—The Committee directs the Department
to collect and report to Congress, no later than 270 days after en-
actment of this act and each year thereafter, a complete list of in-
stitutions of higher education and programs at such institutions
that have gained eligibility for Workforce Pell Grants, as enacted
under Public Law 119–21, and for each eligible institution or pro-
gram, the information obtained by the Department for each such
program used to determine whether such programs meet each met-
ric associated with the program eligibility criteria described under
section 481(b)(3)(A)(iv) of the Higher Education Act [HEA] (Public
Law 89–329), as amended. The Department is further directed to
provide quarterly briefings to the Committees, the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House
Committee on Education and Workforce on the implementation of
Workforce Pell, including how the Department will verify the com-
pletion, job placement rates, and tuition and fees compared with
the value-added earnings of each program.
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program
The Committee provides $910,000,000 for the Supplemental Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant [SEOG] program. The SEOG program
provides funds to institutions of higher education for need-based
grants to students. Institutions must contribute at least 25 percent
toward SEOG awards.
Federal Work-Study Program
The Committee bill provides $1,230,000,000 for the Federal
Work-Study [FWS] program. This program provides grants to insti-
tutions of higher education to help undergraduate, graduate, and
professional students meet the costs of postsecondary education
through part-time employment. Institutions must provide at least
25 percent of student earnings.
Within the total for FWS, the Committee recommendation in-
cludes $11,053,000, for the Work Colleges program authorized
under section 448 of the HEA.
STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,058,943,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,058,943,000
The Committee provides $2,058,943,000 for the Student Aid Ad-
ministration account. These funds are available until September

296
30, 2027, and support the Department’s student aid management,
including administration and operation, expenses.
The Committee directs the Department to provide a detailed
spend plan of the planned uses of funds in this account within 45
days of enactment, and to provide quarterly briefings on its imple-
mentation not later than 10 days prior to the start of the quarter.
This shall continue to include, but not be limited to, detailed break-
outs by baseline operations and development efforts; and servicing,
student aid core systems, IT activities, and other Office of Federal
Student Aid [FSA] activities. These spend plans should also include
details on major activities, including the Unified Servicing and
Data Solution [USDS], the Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility
Reform [SABER] initiative, and implementation of the FUTURE
Act, FAFSA Simplification Act, Joint Consolidation Loan Separa-
tion Act, Stop Student Debt Relief Scams Act, and One Big Beau-
tiful Bill Act, and other activities as appropriate. Further, the
spend plan shall include a crosswalk to activities funded under ad-
ministrative costs and servicing activities, and any reallocation of
funds between those two activities shall be treated as a reprogram-
ming of funds, and the Committees shall be notified in advance of
any such changes.
The Committee includes updated bill language requiring the De-
partment to provide monthly briefings on Federal student loan
servicing and repayment. Additionally, the Department is directed
to continue to notify the Committees of awarded contract Change
Requests from the preceding month by the 10th day of the next cal-
endar month regarding changes to student loan servicing.
Briefing Requirement.—The Committee directs the Secretary to
continue providing monthly briefings and reports to the Commit-
tees and to the Committees on Education and Workforce of the
House of Representatives and on Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions of the Senate on student aid administrative activities and
data for Federal student loans during fiscal year 2026, including
implementation of the higher education provisions in the One Big
Beautiful Act. Information in the briefings and reports should also
include, but not be limited to, borrower status, including the per-
centage of total borrowers and the percentage of at-risk borrowers
(defined as borrowers who have one or more of the following risk
factors: a previous history of default, missing a payment in the first
3 months of entering repayment, not completing their degree pro-
gram, or pausing payments multiple times) in repayment by repay-
ment plan; the percentage of borrowers and the percentage of at-
risk borrowers who are delinquent or not making payments; share
of borrowers at-risk of defaulting on their student loans currently
in active repayment (defined as repayment that is not in deferment
or forbearance), by repayment plan; average and median amount
repaid through the duration of repayment by repayment plan; aver-
age and median income of borrowers who receive forgiveness
through IDR; share of borrowers making $0 payments; metrics on
communications with borrowers who are severely delinquent in
their loans, including open and click through rates for emails and
repayment actions; the Department’s progress on processing the
backlog of IDR applications; and any changes to communications
with borrowers based on data or behavioral economics assumptions

297
gathered during communications campaigns. The Committee fur-
ther directs the Department to include updates on its campaign
around resumed collections of student loans, including the mecha-
nisms used in the communications campaign and outcomes of such
campaign including number of borrowers reached, actions taken,
the number of borrowers who have called the Debt Management
and Collections System call center, and the number of borrowers
who have exited default as a result of the communications cam-
paign in the monthly reports and briefings provided. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department to produce and broadly dissemi-
nate an accessible public report that summarizes this data on an
annual basis.
College Scorecard.—The Committee recognizes the value of insti-
tution-level outcomes data, including graduation rates, student
loan repayment rates, and post-college earnings data for higher
education accountability and directs the Department to maintain
the College Scorecard and update the College Scorecard’s data no
less than once annually. The Committee also encourages the De-
partment to continue refining the existing measures to maximize
transparency about postsecondary educational opportunities and
outcomes for students.
FAFSA Data.—The Committee directs the Department to main-
tain and expand the frequency and detail of FAFSA reporting, in-
cluding quarterly Application Volume Reports, on the FSA Student
Aid Data Center. This data shall include, at minimum: (1) The
number of FAFSA submissions and completions processed by FSA
and disaggregated by State, demographic characteristics, secondary
school, and postsecondary school; (2) The number of submissions
which contained inaccuracies thereby requiring resubmission to the
Department; and (3) The amount of Federal student aid disbursed
disaggregated by type of aid. The Department shall post the quar-
terly FAFSA reports no later than 60 days after the end of each
applicable quarter.
FAFSA Administration.—The Committee appreciates the
progress FSA has made regarding implementation of the FAFSA
Simplification Act, including the strong customer service statistics
for the past 6 months, but remains concerned about the adminis-
tration of the FAFSA and is interested in ensuring that the level
of customer service being provided to students and their families
by FSA is adequate. During previous application cycles, financial
aid applicants and financial aid administrators faced a number of
problems, including with the functionality of the FAFSA form, ac-
curacy of the application of the Federal financial aid formula, the
transmission of data to institutions of higher education to accu-
rately process financial aid, availability of corrections, long call cen-
ter wait times, and the capabilities of FAFSA contractors to ad-
dress some issues. It is essential that the Department continue on
its current path to ensure sufficient staffing and support for
FAFSA implementation to avoid any disruptions to the continued
administration of the 2025–2026 FAFSA and the upcoming launch
of the 2026–2027 FAFSA. While the use of technology, including
artificial intelligence, is helpful, it cannot replace the need for expe-
rienced Department staff who have knowledge and expertise in the
administration of financial aid and technical product development.

298
The Committee directs the Department to ensure full functionality
for the 2026–2027 FAFSA when it launches by October 1, 2025.
This functionality shall include FAFSA processing, school receipt of
processed FAFSAs, processing of paper FAFSAs, and FAFSA cor-
rection functionality for applicants, institutions of higher education,
and States. In advance of the October 1st launch, the Committee
urges a timely release of the Federal student aid estimator, the
FAFSA demonstration site, communication and training materials,
a user-friendly Pell look-up table, eligibility and technical guides,
and a quick, effective, and secure process for attaining an FSA ID.
Funds provided under this account should be allocated to improve
customer service, including by conducting rigorous consumer test-
ing as required by law. The Committee directs the Department to
continue to provide monthly briefings on FAFSA administration,
including on the timeline for the launch of the 2026–2027 FAFSA,
consumer testing, FSA ID creation, transmission of ISIRs, and
availability of corrections. Should the launch of the form be delayed
after October 1 of the year prior to the upcoming award year, the
Department shall provide the Committees, the Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Com-
mittee on Education and Workforce with written notification and a
written timeline for the upcoming FAFSA launch no later than 10
days after enactment of this act and continue to update the written
notification and written timeline every week until complete.
Federal Fund and Guaranty Agency Reporting.—Not later than
180 days after enactment, the Department is directed to produce
and make publicly available on the FSA Data Center, a report re-
garding the Federal Funds authorized under section 422A of the
HEA. The Committee directs such report to include the following
for each guaranty agency: total amount in the Federal Fund avail-
able for expenses, a list of expenses (detailed by amount and type)
from the previous fiscal year from the Federal Fund, the total
amount the Secretary transferred to the Operating fund in the pre-
vious fiscal year, changes in the Federal Fund and forecasted per-
formance of the guaranty agencies, and how the Department en-
sures effective oversight of the Federal Fund. The report shall also
include, for each guaranty agency, how much from the Federal
Fund was expensed to Project Success for the previous fiscal year,
a list of Project Success partner institutions for that fiscal year, a
summary by partner institution of what Project Success funds were
spent on in that fiscal year, and for each guaranty agency and
partner institution (as applicable), the metrics the Department is
using to evaluate the effectiveness of the Project Success funds,
how the Department selected current Project Success partner enti-
ties, and how many students were served by each Project Success
partner entity. Finally, the report should include what is commu-
nicated to Guaranty Agencies when Federal funds are released for
any grantmaking or programmatic purposes, including about the
duration of project performance, the timely outlaying of funds for
agreed upon activities, what percent of funds are allowed be held
onto by Guaranty Agencies for administrative or indirect costs, and
how the Department ensures Guaranty Agencies are adhering to
basic grantmaking standards and requirements such as the stand-

299
ards and requirements other entities are required to adhere to in
EDGAR.
Financial Aid Data.—The Committee notes that FSA retains
sensitive information on millions of Americans and reminds the De-
partment of its obligation to fulfill all statutory requirements re-
garding data sharing and privacy. While data-sharing can produce
important new insights and reduce administrative burden for appli-
cants and recipients of Federal benefits, unlawful or inappropriate
access of such data undermines the trust that individuals place in
the government to use the data responsibly and legally. Within 30
days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs FSA to pro-
vide a report detailing the agency’s compliance with the Privacy
Act of 1974, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act,
and other applicable statutes governing the use and disclosure of
individual financial aid data (including data in the National Stu-
dent Loan Data System, the Financial Management System, and
the FAFSA processing system), including the Internal Revenue
Code, the HEA, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act. Such report shall also include an overview of any data-sharing
agreements signed or amended between FSA and other Federal
agencies in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, a list of any instances
where personally identifiable information was shared with another
Federal agency without a data sharing agreement in place in fiscal
years 2025 and 2026, including a description of what data was
shared, with whom data was shared, for what purpose, and under
what statutory authority. The report shall also include a descrip-
tion of the procedures FSA has put in place to ensure individual
financial aid data is not accessed by unauthorized persons, inappro-
priately used, or shared outside of FSA in unauthorized ways.
Higher Education Data Reporting.—The Committee notes that
accurate information about costs and outcomes in postsecondary
programs is vital to students and their families as they make one
of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. The Committee di-
rects the Department to fully implement and enforce all statutory
data reporting and collection requirements under the HEA, includ-
ing the requirement to update and improve the Integrated Postsec-
ondary Education Data System [IPEDS], the requirement that in-
stitutions of higher education participate in Federal data collec-
tions, including IPEDS, and maintaining the expanded IPEDS data
elements required by the HEA.
Identity Verification.—The Committee recognizes the need for
identity verification procedures to ensure Federal student aid is
being properly provided to eligible students. However, the Com-
mittee notes the burden increased identity verification procedures
could pose to first-generation and first-time FAFSA filers. There-
fore, the Committee directs the Department to support institutions
of higher education and students experiencing any difficulties with
the new verification processes.
Institutional Oversight.—The Committee directs the Department
to continue to update and post all regularly produced public report-
ing on the FSA Student Aid Data Center related to oversight of in-
stitutions of higher education. FSA should review applicable stat-
utes and regulations to determine if any of the reports mandate
specific reporting actions and update public websites accordingly.

300
Interagency Coordination for Benefits Outreach and Financial
Aid.—The Committee notes that students and families would ben-
efit from additional information on public and tax benefit programs
that can help them meet their basic needs and cost of attendance,
and that the recipients of public and tax benefit programs would
benefit from information on financial aid to help them enroll in
higher education. The FAFSA Simplification Act supports inter-
agency coordination to conduct outreach for such purposes under
sections 483(c)(3) and 485E(c) of the HEA, respectively. Within 60
days of enactment, the Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide a briefing on the status of implementation of these provisions,
including interagency coordination with Federal agencies, and
other efforts to expand notifications to students about public and
tax benefit programs. Further, the Committee strongly encourages
the Department to promote such outreach through direct and reg-
ular notices to financial aid applicants, technical assistance to in-
stitutions, and communications with States.
Maintaining Higher Education Transparency and Research.—The
Committee is concerned by reports that existing higher education
research and data collection organizations are being limited con-
trary to Congressional intent under the FAFSA Simplification Act.
Collecting and publishing timely and relevant student access and
outcome data that does not publicly release personally identifiable
information and related analyses through mechanisms such as
third-party research agreements, agency surveys, and administra-
tive data collections with strong privacy protections have been and
continue to be essential for the planning, administration, operation,
and evaluation of the student aid programs and higher education
grant programs. Additionally, students and their families benefit
from targeted outreach and enrollment into public and tax benefit
benefits for which they may be eligible and which help them afford
the cost of college. Such data uses do not result in publicly dis-
closing personally identifiable information. The Committee urges
the Department to maintain secure data collection, reporting that
does not publicly release personally identifiable information, pri-
vacy-protected research, and interagency data-sharing for students’
educational purposes only, including tax information such as in-
come and family size, as part of the administration of the Federal
student aid programs under the HEA. Further, the Committee di-
rects the Department to issue guidance to reaffirm such data uses
to further transparency, research, evaluation, and accountability in
higher education while still ensuring student privacy. Further, the
Committee directs the Department to permit the secure use of stu-
dent and family tax data and issue guidance on Federal tax infor-
mation data use, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service
guidelines, to satisfy Federal data collection and reporting require-
ments.
Office of the Chief Economist.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of the work of the Office of the Chief Economist. The Com-
mittee encourages FSA to collaborate with the Office of the Chief
Economist to develop research and data analysis that will support
informed policymaking, including studying measures of labor mar-
ket outcomes of graduates by program and institution type; ana-
lyzing the types of borrowers who have received or are making

301
progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness; and how meas-
ures of short-term repayment outcomes relate to long-term repay-
ment outcomes.
Ombudsman.—The Committee notes that the Student Loan Om-
budsman is required under section 141 of the HEA and plays a
critical role in supporting borrowers. The Committee directs the
Secretary to provide a briefing to the Committees, the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House
Committee on Education and Workforce on the Department’s
progress on addressing unanswered complaints submitted to the
ombudsman. The Committee also directs the Department to include
the following information in the annual report required under sec-
tion 141: data demonstrating the activities and effectiveness of the
ombudsman function, the number of complaints received, the num-
ber of cumulative open complaints, the number of pending com-
plaints that have received an initial response, and the number of
complaints resolved.
Promoting Safe Campuses.—The Committee is concerned by re-
ports of increased discrimination on college campuses, including
hate crimes motivated by anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim prejudice.
As FSA conducts its fiscal year 2026 work on enforcement of the
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act [Clery Act], including complaint assessments,
media assessments, and program reviews, the Committee encour-
ages FSA to include institutions where known anti-Semitic or anti-
Muslim hate crimes have occurred during the 2024–2025 academic
year in such assessments and reviews. The Committee further en-
courages the Department to issue appropriate and timely fines for
violations of the Clery Act.
PSLF Processing.—The Committee is interested in receiving in-
formation regarding PSLF processing. The Committee directs the
Secretary to continue including information in the monthly loan re-
payment briefings for the Committees, the Senate Committee on
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Committee
on Education and Workforce on the Department’s progress on proc-
essing PSLF in fiscal year 2025. The Committee also directs the
Department to provide updated data on the FSA Student Aid Data
Center on the number of PSLF applications processed, approved, or
denied on a quarterly basis.
Return of Title IV Funds.—The Committee continues to encour-
age the Department to pursue efforts to simplify and streamline
the Return of Title IV Funds process for institutions of higher edu-
cation and students.
State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements.—The Committee
notes that State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements [SARAs],
with strong consumer protections, can serve as an efficient and ef-
fective provider of uniform requirements for postsecondary distance
education. SARAs can expand educational choice for students to
adapt to a changing professional landscape, enable institutions to
provide more efficient and consistent distance education to a broad-
er range of students, and reduce institutional costs and bureauc-
racy. The Committee urges the Department to continue to support
these agreements, including supporting the expansion of SARAs, as
appropriate, for Federal financial aid or regulatory purposes, so

302
long as such SARAs are accompanied by strong consumer protec-
tions and maintain the ability of States to exercise regulatory au-
thority over such SARAs serving students in their States.
State-Based and Non-Profit Servicing Organizations.—The Com-
mittee continues to note that many State-based and non-profit
servicing organizations have demonstrated and specialized experi-
ence in helping struggling borrowers, and continues to encourage
the Department and Federal student loan servicers to work with
state and nonprofit organizations to help student and parent bor-
rowers repay their Federal student loans.
STOP Act Implementation.—The Committee is concerned that
the Department has not fully implemented the Student Debt Relief
Scams Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–251), also known as the STOP
Act, which requires the Department to enable third-party data sys-
tem access to NSLDS as described in section 485B(e) of the HEA
to ensure attorneys, State officials, and others have information to
support student borrowers in addressing issues with their students
loans. The Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing
no later than 90 days after enactment to the Committees, the Sen-
ate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the
House Committee on Education and Workforce on implementation
of the STOP Act, including how many requests the Department has
received for third-party access to NSLDS.
Unaccompanied Homeless Youth and Other Students Without
Parent or Family Support.—The Committee continues to be con-
cerned that youth who do not have parental support are experi-
encing significant challenges completing the FAFSA and financial
aid process. Students experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness and
who do not have documentation have been incorrectly categorized
as provisionally independent and have been arbitrarily limited in
how they can document their experience with homelessness in pre-
vious FAFSA cycles. The Committee directs the Department to
work with institutions of higher education to correct these errors
for the 2026–2027 cycle. The Committee directs the Department to
make publicly available the data about unaccompanied homeless
youth and foster youth required by the FAFSA Simplification Act
under section 483(c)(1)(D) of the HEA within 60 days of enactment
of this act. The Committee further directs the Department to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees, the Senate Committee on
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Committee
on Education and Workforce within 90 days of enactment on how
the Department reviews and conducts oversight on institutions of
higher education that have high rates of unfulfilled requests for
unaccompanied homeless youth determinations.

of faculty; support for academic programs; institutional manage-
ment; and purchase of educational materials.
The Committee continues to support funding for programs that
promote and support collaboration between Hispanic-serving insti-
tutions and LEAs that serve a significant number or percentage of
Hispanic or Latino students for the purpose of improving edu-
cational attainment, including increasing high school graduation
rates and postsecondary enrollment, transfer, and completion rates
among Hispanic or Latino students, such as by strengthening path-
ways to postsecondary and workforce development programs.
Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Ameri-
cans.—The Committee provides $27,451,000 for competitive, 5-year
grants to HSIs to help Hispanic Americans gain entry into and suc-
ceed in graduate study. Institutions may use funding to support
low-income students through outreach programs; academic support
services; mentoring and financial assistance; acquisition, rental, or
lease of scientific or laboratory equipment; construction and other
facilities improvements; and purchase of educational materials.
The Committee continues to encourage the Department to
prioritize awards for projects that support consortiums of HSIs that
award PhDs to develop and test new models of cross-institutional
partnerships that facilitate mutually reinforcing activities, such as
resource-sharing learning communities, mentorship programs for
PhD students, graduate research experiences, faculty mentor ca-
pacity-building, and other uses associated with the pursuit and
completion of PhDs by Hispanic students.
Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities
[HBCUs].—The Committee provides $400,966,000 for the Strength-
ening HBCUs program. The program makes formula grants to
HBCUs that may be used to purchase equipment; construct and
renovate facilities; develop faculty; support academic programs;

ening HBGIs program. This program provides 5-year grants to pro-

304
vide scholarships for low-income students and academic and coun-
seling services to improve student success. Funds may also be used
for construction, maintenance, and renovation activities; the pur-
chase or lease of scientific and laboratory equipment; and the es-
tablishment of an endowment.
Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions [PBIs].—The
Committee provides $22,412,000 for the Strengthening PBIs pro-
gram. This program provides 5-year grants to PBIs to plan and im-
plement programs to enhance their capacity to serve more low- and
middle-income students.
Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions [AANAPISIs].—The Committee pro-
vides $18,682,000 for competitive grants to AANAPISIs that have
an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent
Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander students.
Grants may be used to improve their capacity to serve Asian Amer-
ican and Native American Pacific Islander students and low-income
individuals.
Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Insti-
tutions [ANNHs].—The Committee provides $24,555,000 for the
Strengthening ANNHs program. The purpose of this program is to
improve and expand the capacity of institutions serving Alaska Na-
tive and Native Hawaiian students and low-income individuals.
Funds may be used to plan, develop, and implement activities that
encourage faculty and curriculum development; improve adminis-
trative management; renovate educational facilities; enhance stu-
dent services; purchase library and other educational materials;
and provide education or counseling services designed to improve
the financial and economic literacy of students or their families.
The Committee includes new bill language that will permit ANNH
grantees to use funding for construction and maintenance of class-
rooms, libraries, and other instructional facilities.
Strengthening Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Institu-
tions.—The Committee provides $11,462,000 for this program,
which serves institutions that enroll at least 10 percent Native
American students and at least 50 percent low-income students.
This program helps institutions plan, develop, and implement ac-
tivities that encourage faculty and curriculum development; im-
prove administrative management; renovate educational facilities;
enhance student services; and purchase library and other edu-
cational materials. The Committee includes new bill language that
will permit grantees to use funding for construction and mainte-
nance of classrooms, libraries, and other instructional facilities.
Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities
[TCCUs].—The Committee provides $51,807,000 for this program.
Tribal colleges and universities rely on a portion of the funds pro-
vided to address developmental needs, including faculty develop-
ment, curriculum, and student services. Funds can also be used for
construction and renovation. The Committee notes that our Na-
tion’s Tribal colleges and universities have significant unmet infra-
structure needs. Tribal colleges are also uniquely situated-they
often lack access to State funding and other resources available to
other public institutions of higher education.

305
Strengthening Master’s Degree Programs at Historically Black
Colleges and Universities.—The Committee provides $20,037,000
for this program, authorized by section 723 of the HEA. This pro-
gram provides grants to specified colleges and universities making
a substantial contribution to graduate education opportunities at
the master’s level in mathematics, engineering, the physical or nat-
ural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing,
allied health, or other scientific disciplines.
International Education and Foreign Language Studies
The bill provides a total of $80,664,000 for International Edu-
cation and Foreign Language Studies programs. Funds are used to
increase the number of experts in foreign languages and area or
international studies to meet national security needs through visits
and study in foreign countries.
Domestic Programs.—The Committee provides $70,353,000 for
domestic program activities related to international education and
foreign language studies under title VI of the HEA. Funds are used
to support centers, programs, and fellowships. The Committee
urges the Secretary to preserve the program’s longstanding focus
on activities and institutions that address the Nation’s need for a
strong training and research capacity in foreign languages and
international studies, including increasing the pool of international
experts in areas that are essential to national security and eco-
nomic competitiveness.
Overseas Programs.—The Committee provides $10,311,000 for
overseas programs authorized under the Mutual Educational and
Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (Public Law 87–256), popularly
known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. Funding is provided for group,
faculty, or doctoral dissertation research abroad, as well as special
bilateral projects. Grants focus on training American instructors
and students to improve foreign language and area studies edu-
cation in the United States.
Model Transition Programs for Students With Intellectual Disabil-
ities into Higher Education
The Committee provides $13,800,000 for the Model Transition
Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities into Higher
Education [TPSID] program. The TPSID program provides competi-
tive grants to institutions of higher education or consortia of insti-
tutions of higher education to enable them to create or expand high
quality, inclusive model comprehensive transition and postsec-
ondary programs for students with intellectual disabilities. The
Committee directs the Department to ensure the TPSID program
maintains support for a national Coordinating Center and a tech-
nical assistance center to translate and disseminate research and
best practices to IHEs more broadly.
Minority Science and Engineering Improvement
The Committee provides $16,370,000 for the Minority Science
and Engineering Improvement program. Funds are used to provide
discretionary grants to institutions with minority enrollments
greater than 50 percent to purchase equipment, develop curricula,

306
prove science and engineering education programs and increase the
number of minority students in the fields of science, mathematics,
and engineering.
Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institu-
tions
The Committee provides $11,953,000 for tribally controlled post-
secondary vocational institutions. This program provides grants for
the operation and improvement of tribally controlled postsecondary
vocational institutions to ensure continued and expanding opportu-
nities for Indian students.
Federal TRIO Programs
The Committee provides $1,191,000,000 for Federal TRIO pro-
grams, which provide a variety of services to improve postsec-
ondary education opportunities for low-income individuals and
first-generation college students. This includes: Upward Bound
which offers disadvantaged high school students academic services
to develop the skills and motivation needed to pursue and complete
a postsecondary education; Student Support Services which pro-
vides developmental instruction, counseling, summer programs,
and grant aid to disadvantaged college students to help them com-
plete their postsecondary education; Talent Search which identifies
and counsels individuals between ages 11 and 27 regarding oppor-
tunities for completing high school and enrolling in postsecondary
education; Educational Opportunity Centers [EOC] which provide
information and counseling on available financial and academic as-
sistance to low-income adults who are first-generation college stu-
dents; and the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement
Program which supports research internships, seminars, tutoring,
and other activities to encourage disadvantaged college students to
enroll in doctoral programs.
The Department is directed to allocate funding for each of the in-
dividual TRIO programs at no less than the following levels: Talent
Search $190,182,000; Upward Bound $380,830,000; Veterans Up-
ward Bound $22,253,000; Upward Bound Math-Science
$79,614,000; EOCs $59,450,000; Student Support Services
$380,816,000; Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement
Program $61,357,000; and TRIO Training Grants $4,150,000.
The Department is also directed to ensure that the notices invit-
ing applications for new awards for the Talent Search and Edu-
cational Opportunity Centers grant competitions are published no
later than December 1, 2025. The Department is further directed
to take steps necessary to issue grant award notifications for all
TRIO programs (both new and non-competing continuation award
notices) no later than June 30, 2026.
TRIO and Justice-Impacted Students.—The Committee recog-
nizes that EOCs have a long history of helping justice-impacted
adults to enroll in college. The restoration of Pell Grants for people
in prison presents an opportunity for EOCs to reach more students.
The Committee encourages the Department to provide technical as-
sistance and guidance to EOCs on best practices for supporting jus-
tice-impacted students, including examples of programs that can
serve as models to others. In addition, the Committee encourages

307
the Department to consider how other TRIO programs can support
justice-impacted students and provide guidance to institutions of
higher education.
Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro-
grams [GEAR UP]
The Committee provides $388,000,000 for GEAR UP, which pro-
vides grants to States and partnerships of colleges, middle and
high schools, and community organizations to assist cohorts or stu-
dents in middle and high schools serving a high percentage of low-
income students. Services provided help students prepare for and
pursue a postsecondary education.
The Committee directs the Department to announce Notices In-
viting Applications for New Awards for State Grants and Partner-
ship Grants in the Federal Register. In such notice for State
Grants, the Committee directs the Department to uphold the long-
standing guidance that States may only administer one active
State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is directed to pro-
vide written guidance in the Federal Register notifying applicants
that only States without an active State GEAR UP grant, or States
that have an active State GEAR UP grant that is scheduled to end
prior to October 1, 2026 will be eligible to receive a new State
GEAR UP award funded in whole or in part by this appropriation.
In making new awards, the Department shall ensure that not less
than 33 percent of the new award funds are allocated to State
awards, and that not less than 33 percent of the new award funds
are allocated to Partnerships awards, as described in section 404(b)
of the HEA. The Secretary is further directed to ensure that no re-
quest from a State Grant applicant to receive an exception to the
GEAR UP scholarship described in section 404E(b)(2) of the HEA
shall be denied on the basis of 34 CFR 694.14(c)(3).
Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need
The Committee provides $23,547,000 to support the Graduate
Assistance in Areas of National Need [GAANN] program. GAANN
supports fellowships through 3-year competitive grants to graduate
academic departments and programs in scientific and technical
fields and other areas of national need as determined by the Sec-
retary. Fellowship recipients must have excellent academic records
and high financial need and must be pursuing doctoral degrees or
the highest graduate degrees in their academic field. Each fellow-
ship consists of a student stipend to cover living costs and an insti-
tutional payment to cover each fellow’s tuition and other expenses.
Institutions of higher education must match 25 percent of the grant
amount.
Teacher Quality Partnership Program
The Committee provides $65,000,000 for the Teacher Quality
Partnership [TQP] program. The TQP program helps improve the
quality of teachers working in high-need schools and early child-
hood education programs by supporting teacher preparation and
residency programs.
The Committee recognizes the need to remove barriers to entry
to the teaching profession in order to address teacher shortage

308
issues. Therefore, the Committee urges the Department to
prioritize grants to eligible grantees that assist in removing such
barriers by providing need-based scholarships or grants and aca-
demic supports to help teacher candidates successfully complete
preparation programs and meet state licensure requirements.
The Committee recognizes the increasing number of and demand
for ‘‘Grow Your Own’’ teacher preparation programs in our Nation.
The Committee urges the Department to continue to support ‘‘Grow
Your Own’’ teacher preparation programs, with a focus on pro-
grams that increase recruitment efforts in local communities, pro-
vide high quality pathways into the profession, improve teacher re-
tention, and improve student outcomes.
The Committee also notes the need to ensure future teachers are
well trained in data literacy, including how to use data in the class-
room to differentiate instruction and improve student outcomes.
The Committee urges the Department to prioritize TQP funding for
applicants that seek to develop data literacy skills in future teach-
ers.
Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools
The Committee provides $75,000,000 for the Child Care Access
Means Parents in Schools [CCAMPIS] program. This program pro-
vides competitive grants to institutions of higher education to es-
tablish or support campus-based child care programs, to help sup-
port needs and participation of low-income parents in post-sec-
ondary education.
The Committee directs the Department to prioritize grants to eli-
gible entities serving a significant percentage of Pell-eligible or
other low-income students. The Committee urges the Department
to prioritize grants to eligible entities that propose flexible child
care arrangements (such as evening, weekend, and drop-in child
care) in any future competition. The Committee further urges the
Department to prioritize grantees who will conduct direct outreach
to parenting students regarding State and Federal public benefits,
the Child Tax Credit, and education tax benefits for which the stu-
dent parent may be eligible. The Committee also urges the Depart-
ment to require new grantees to collect data on the total number
of parenting students enrolled at the institution and the number of
parenting students served by CCAMPIS grant funds. Additionally,
the Committee strongly encourages the Department to assist grant-
ees in leveraging other funding opportunities to help parenting stu-
dents afford child care, by providing technical assistance and other
support to grantees.
Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education
The Committee provides $146,000,000 for the Fund for the Im-
provement of Post-Secondary Education. Within the total provided
for the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education, the

Basic Needs Systems Grants.—The Committee recommendation
includes $10,000,000 for competitive grants to IHEs (as defined in
section 101 of the HEA), consortia of such IHEs, systems of higher
education, or States to advance systemic solutions to identify, ad-
dress, and prevent student basic needs insecurity. Such grants
shall include one or more of the following activities: establishing
processes to automatically identify and conduct outreach to stu-
dents who may be eligible for public and tax benefit programs; con-
ducting surveys or assessments of student basic needs security, in-
cluding surveys of student needs conducted upon enrollment; pro-
viding referrals or case management to students to enroll in local,
State, and Federal public and tax benefit programs; or coordinating
and collaborating with government and community-based organiza-
tions to execute such activities. Activities may also include pro-
viding direct services such as temporary or affordable housing, free
or subsidized food, access to on-campus childcare, emergency finan-
cial aid, and connecting students to mental and behavioral health
services, so long as such activities are part of systemic plan to ad-
dress and prevent student basic needs insecurity. The Committee
directs the Department to prioritize eligible entities enrolling or
serving a significant percentage of Pell-eligible or other low-income
students, including community colleges, HBCUs, and other MSIs.
Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program.—The
Committee recommendation includes $9,000,000 for the Centers of
Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program.
National Center for Information and Technical Support for Post-
secondary Students with Disabilities.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $2,000,000 for the continued operation of
the National Center for Information and Technical Support for
Postsecondary Students with Disabilities, also known as the Na-
tional Center for College Students with Disabilities, as authorized
under section 777(a) of the HEA.
Open Textbook Pilot.—The Committee recommendation includes
$7,000,000 for the Open Textbook Pilot program. The Committee
directs the Department to issue a notice inviting applications, allow
for a 60-day application period, and make a significant number of
grant awards under the same terms and conditions as in prior
years. The Committee further directs the Department to prohibit
institutions of higher education receiving grants from charging stu-
dents course material fees for any course utilizing free open text-
books, including equitable access fees or inclusive access fees. The
Committee also directs the Department to ensure that any data
collected from grantees about the performance of the open textbook
pilot program does not include data from courses subject to such
course material fees, unless such data is clearly disaggregated from
data on the use of free open textbooks.
Postsecondary Student Success Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $40,000,000 for competitive Postsecondary

310
Student Success Grants, to scale evidence-based practices and re-
forms to improve postsecondary retention and completion rates
among underserved students. These funds support grants to States,
TCCUs, and systems of institutions of higher education to imple-
ment or expand evidence-based, statewide, and institutional level
practices and reforms that improve student outcomes, including en-
rollment, retention, transfer, and completion among underserved
students including students of color, low-income students, students
with disabilities, students in need of remediation, first generation
college students, homeless youth, foster youth, and student par-
ents. The Committee directs the Department continue to carry out
this program as a tiered-evidence competition, and require rigorous
independent evaluations of grantee projects. The Committee fur-
ther directs the Secretary to prioritize the awarding of Postsec-
ondary Student Success grants to institutions of higher education
that serve a significant percentage of Pell-eligible or other low-in-
come students and that have a demonstrated commitment to imple-
menting evidence-based strategies to improve student outcomes for
such underserved students.
Research and Development Infrastructure Investments at HBCUs,
TCCUs, and MSIs.—The Committee recommendation includes
$38,000,000 to increase the capacity of HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs
to conduct innovative research in emerging technology and indus-
tries. These funds support planning and implementation grants de-
signed to promote transformational investments in research infra-
structure, such as physical infrastructure, capital improvement, re-
search-related equipment, and hiring and retaining of faculty and
research-related staff.
Rural Postsecondary and Economic Development Grant Pro-
gram.—The Committee recommendation includes $40,000,000 for
competitive grants to States, institutions of higher education, con-
sortia of such institutions, or non-profit organizations to support
rural students in the enrollment, retention, transfer, and comple-
tion of postsecondary education through the Rural Postsecondary
and Economic Development [RPED] Grant Program. The Com-
mittee recognizes that rural-serving institutions and communities
face unique challenges and barriers. In particular, smaller, rural-
serving colleges, universities and non-profit organizations may
have significantly fewer staff, and less experience, in preparing to
respond to Federal grant opportunities. The Committee encourages
the Department to consider ways to better support rural applicants
by recognizing the unique challenges facing rural communities, in-
cluding but not limited to providing greater flexibility, longer appli-
cation timelines, and targeted technical assistance for RPED
grants. The Committee further urges the Secretary to prioritize the
awarding of RPED grants to rural applicants that serve a signifi-
cant percentage of Pell-eligible or other low-income students.
Congressionally Directed Spending
The Committee provides $226,974,000 for the projects, and in the
amounts, specified in the table at the end of this Committee Re-
port.

311
Hawkins Centers of Excellence
The Committee provides $15,000,000 for Hawkins Centers of Ex-
cellence. This program supports the expansion and improvement of
teacher education programs at HBCUs and other MSIs in order to
support diverse, well-prepared, and effective educators.
The Committee recognizes the importance of high-quality teacher
preparation for student learning and teacher retention, and there-
fore directs the Secretary to prioritize grants to eligible institutions
that propose to establish or scale up high-quality teacher prepara-
tion pathways that offer extensive preservice clinical training and
mentoring by exemplary teachers in grade and subject areas
deemed high need by their state. The Committee also recognizes
the value of a diverse teacher workforce and directs the Secretary
to prioritize grants to eligible institutions that commit to providing
scholarships or grants, based on financial need, as well as academic
supports to help teacher candidates successfully complete the prep-
aration program and state licensure requirements, and to publicly
report on these efforts and outcomes.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $304,018,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 254,018,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $254,018,000 for
Howard University. Located in the District of Columbia, Howard
offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees through
12 schools and colleges. The university also administers the How-
ard University Hospital. The Committee includes, within the funds
provided, not less than $3,405,000 for the endowment program.
Howard University Hospital.—Within the funds provided, the
Committee includes $27,325,000 for Howard University Hospital.
The hospital provides inpatient and outpatient care, as well as
training in the health professions. It also serves as a major acute
and ambulatory care center for the District of Columbia and func-
tions as a major teaching facility attached to the university. The
Federal appropriation provides partial funding for the hospital’s op-
erations. The Committee notes the reduction of $50,000,000 for the
hospital reflects the fulfillment of the planned Federal contribution
in fiscal year 2025 to support construction of the new hospital.
COLLEGE HOUSING AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES LOANS PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $298,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 298,000
The Committee provides $298,000 for Federal administration of
the CHAFL, College Housing Loans, and Higher Education Facili-
ties Loans programs. Prior to fiscal year 1994, these programs pro-
vided financing for the construction, reconstruction, and renovation
of housing, academic, and other educational facilities. While no new
loans have been awarded since fiscal year 1993, costs for admin-
istering the outstanding loans will continue through 2030. These
funds will be used to reimburse the Department for administrative
expenses incurred in managing the existing loan portfolio.

312
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING
PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $20,678,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 20,678,000
The Committee provides $20,678,000 for the HBCU Capital Fi-
nancing Program. The HBCU Capital Financing Program makes
capital available to HBCUs for construction, renovation, and repair
of academic facilities by providing a Federal guarantee for private
sector construction bonds. Construction loans will be made from
the proceeds of the sale of the bonds.
The Committee includes $20,150,000 for loan subsidy costs in
guaranteed loan authority under this program. This will support
an estimated $500,000,000 in new loan volume in fiscal year 2026.
In addition, the Committee includes $528,000 for administrative
expenses.
INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $793,106,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 793,106,000
The Committee provides $793,106,000 for the Institute of Edu-
cation Sciences [IES]. This amount includes $73,500,000 for admin-
istrative expenses and centralized support costs for IES. The bill
also includes a rescission of $25,000,000 in previously appropriated
funds for program administration.
This account supports education research, development, dissemi-
nation, utilization and evaluation; data collection and analysis ac-
tivities; the assessment of student progress; and administrative ex-
penses related to such activities. Funds provided to IES are avail-
able for obligation for 2 fiscal years.
Under the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 [ESRA], Con-
gress established IES to provide national leadership in expanding
fundamental knowledge and understanding of education from early
childhood through postsecondary study. ESRA requires IES, in car-
rying out its mission, ‘‘to compile statistics, develop products, and
conduct research, evaluations, and wide dissemination activities in
areas of demonstrated national need and ensure that such activi-
ties conform to high standards of quality, integrity, and accuracy
and are objective, secular, neutral, and nonideological and are free
of partisan political influence’’ and it is the Committee’s expecta-
tion that IES will meet those statutory duties and obligations this
year and have plans in place to continue doing so in the future.
Program Administration.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $73,500,000 for administrative expenses and centralized
support costs. Section 310 of this act ensures sufficient funding for
centralized support costs is available and properly charged to this
appropriation. The Committee directs the Department, IES, and
NCES to work together to provide in the fiscal year 2027 and fu-
ture CJs, as well as the fiscal year 2026 operating plan, the
amount for NCES administrative expenses supported by this pro-
gram administration appropriation necessary to meet statutory du-
ties and obligations.
Administrative and Staffing Plan.—Not later than 30 days after
enactment of this act and each quarter thereafter, the Committee

313
directs the IES Director and NCES Commissioner to submit admin-
istrative and staffing plans for their respective centers outlining
staffing ceilings by national center, the factors considered in allo-
cating staffing ceilings by national center, actual FTE by national
center, and an explanation by national center for FTE changes
from the preceding quarter. Additionally, the Committee directs
the IES Director and NCES Commissioner (with Department and
NAGB input as necessary) to describe the planned use of resources
and FTEs to meet all statutory deadlines and requirements of
ESRA related to education statistics, data collections, research,
evaluations, assessments, surveys, and reports.
Cybersecurity and other Requirements.—The Committee notes the
importance of IES’s statutorily-required activities related to cyber-
security, privacy, accuracy, and confidentiality. The Committee di-
rects the required administrative and staffing plan to include a de-
scription of implemented actions and a plan and associated
timeline for future actions needed to comply with applicable re-
quirements.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DISSEMINATION
The Committee provides $245,000,000 for education research, de-
velopment, evaluation, and national dissemination activities. These
funds support activities that are aimed at expanding fundamental
knowledge of education and promoting the use of research and de-
velopment findings in the design of efforts to improve education
outcomes for students.
Accelerate, Transform, and Scale Initiative.—The Committee sup-
ports steps IES has taken to use funds for creating scalable, high
impact solutions to improve education outcomes for all learners and
eliminate persistent achievement and attainment gaps, including
through pilot efforts modeled on Federal advanced research
projects agencies. This includes the updated Transformative Re-
search in the Education Sciences program, which is supporting
partnerships between researchers, industry professionals, and edu-
cation agencies to propose transformative solutions to intractable
education problems leveraging advances in technology combined
with research insights from the learning sciences. The Committee
requests quarterly updates on progress on the initiative including
the Seedlings to Scale program.
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Lit-
eracy Study.—Recent NAEP and Program for the International As-
sessment of Adult Competencies scores show a troubling decline in
literacy achievement for public school students and adult learners.
The Committee shares the Administration’s stated priority to im-
prove literacy outcomes and includes $1,500,000 for the Director to
enter into an agreement with the NASEM to conduct a study of lit-
eracy attainment across the life-course, which shall include an
analysis of factors that contribute to the current state of literacy
attainment in the U.S., what is known about how to improve lit-
eracy attainment across the life-course, and implications for the
well-being of individuals, communities, as well as national security
and global competitiveness. The report shall include recommenda-
tions for Federal, state, and local policy and practice that take the
varied landscape of how Americans develop literacy into account

314
and how best to maintain literacy attainment, including for English
learners and students with disabilities.
STATISTICS
The Committee provides $121,500,000 for data gathering and
statistical analysis activities at the National Center for Education
Statistics [NCES].
NCES is headed by a Commissioner appointed by the President
and has statutory authority without supervision or approval of the
Director for carrying out the work of NCES. The Commissioner
also serves as the Department’s Chief Statistical Officer under the
Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018. NCES
collects data on educational institutions at all levels, longitudinal
data on student progress, and data relevant to public policy. NCES
also provides technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, and postsec-
ondary institutions. Activities are carried out directly and through
grants and contracts.
Information on College Admissions.—The Committee is aware of
the lack of data available demonstrating how legacy status, or rela-
tionship to alumni of the institution, factors in first-time, first-year,
degree-seeking admissions decisions. Starting with the 2022–2023
IPEDS admission surveys, NCES began to ask if IHEs consider leg-
acy status. The Committee appreciates that NCES will continue to
ask if IHEs consider legacy status in the IPEDS Admissions sur-
vey. The Committee encourages NCES to consider collecting data
on applications, admission, and enrollments by applicants with leg-
acy status at institutions eligible to participate in Title IV pro-
grams under the HEA and those IHEs that also provide legacy
preferences according to their IPEDS response.
National Postsecondary Student Aid Study [NPSAS].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the critical role NCES is statutorily required to
undertake through the administration of NPSAS and the impor-
tance of the postsecondary information NPSAS provides to re-
searchers, policymakers, and the public. The Committee believes
that NPSAS plays a vital role in postsecondary empirical research
and analysis and directs NCES to maintain the study’s current col-
lection frequency of every 4 years and, to the extent practicable, to
continue the administrative-only collection, as was done for
NPSAS:18–AC, in the 2 years in between the full collection. NCES
is directed to brief the Committees not later than 60 days after en-
actment of this act on how they intend to come into compliance
with this directive.
Privacy.—The Committee notes the importance of maintaining
privacy when collecting data for statistical purposes. The Com-
mittee supports the statutory requirements in ESRA regarding the
collection, dissemination, and handling of data to ensure confiden-
tiality and prevent unauthorized disclosure. The Committee is also
aware that Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Effi-
ciency Act is no longer among the privacy assurances that NCES
is following when collecting data. Not later than 30 days after en-
actment, NCES is directed to brief the Committees on how the De-
partment will continue to assure privacy is maintained when col-
lecting data.

315
School Pulse Panel.—The Committee appreciates the timely in-
formation made available through the School Pulse Panel survey
initiated during President Trump’s first term. Prior to its develop-
ment, the Department did not have basic information about the
status of school operations, staffing vacancies, access to school
based mental health services, and other useful information for pol-
icy makers and the public to understand about the nearly real-time
operation of our Nation’s schools. The Committee requests a brief-
ing within 180 days of enactment on steps NCES could take to
make timely information once again available.
REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL LABORATORIES
The Committee provides $53,733,000 to continue support for the
Regional Educational Laboratories [REL] program.
The laboratories are responsible for promoting the effective use
and development of knowledge and evidence in broad-based sys-
temic strategies to increase student learning and well-being and
further school improvement efforts. The Committee urges IES to
continue its efforts to strengthen the connections between practi-
tioners and the research community, so that federally supported re-
search is timely, relevant, and responsive to the needs of the field,
helps build capacity of LEAs and SEAs to effectively integrate evi-
dence use in decision-making and is effectively utilized in education
policy and practice.
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
The Committee provides $64,255,000 for research and innovation
in special education conducted by the National Center for Special
Education Research [NCSER].
The Center addresses gaps in scientific knowledge to improve
policies and practices in special education and early intervention
services and outcomes for infants, toddlers, and children with dis-
abilities. The Committee directs NCSER to continue to fund longi-
tudinal studies and other research initiatives to support States in
recruiting and training special and general educators and special-
ized support personnel so that students with disabilities can access
universally designed and inclusive classrooms designed to provide
accessible instruction, curricula, materials, and assistive tech-
nology, and receive specialized services and supports consistent
with the IDEA.
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDIES AND EVALUATIONS
The Committee provides $13,318,000 for special education stud-
ies and evaluations.
This program supports competitive grants, contracts, and cooper-
ative agreements to assess the implementation of IDEA. Funds are
also used to evaluate the effectiveness of State and local efforts to
deliver special education services and early intervention programs.
STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEMS
The Committee provides includes $28,500,000 for the Statewide
Data Systems program.

316
This program supports competitive grants to SEAs to support the
development, maintenance, and expansion of State longitudinal
data systems. Support for these systems will further strengthen
State data infrastructure and linkages; contribute to improved data
access, and use for evidence-based policymaking; and build capacity
in States to secure and protect data. Early childhood, postsec-
ondary, and workforce information systems may be linked to such
systems or developed with program funds. The bill also continues
to allow up to $6,000,000 to be used for awards to improve data
coordination, quality, and use, including support for the Privacy
Technical Assistance Center that serves as a resource on privacy
issues for SEAs and LEAs, the postsecondary education commu-
nity, and others engaged in building and using education data sys-
tems.
ASSESSMENT
The Committee provides $193,300,000 to provide support for the
National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], a congres-
sionally mandated assessment created to measure and report the
educational achievement of American students in a range of sub-
jects and analyze trends over time.
Within the funds appropriated, the Committee recommends
$8,300,000 for the National Assessment Governing Board [NAGB],
which is responsible for formulating policy for NAEP.
The Committee recommendation continues support of
$10,000,000 for research and development investments activities to
modernize and innovate assessments while reducing future pro-
gram costs. NAGB and NCES should continue to consult with the
authorizing and appropriations committees of Congress as it con-
siders strategies, including those identified by NASEM, in achiev-
ing cost efficiencies in and upgrades of its assessment program.
Further, the Committee requests that the fiscal year 2027 CJ and
fiscal year 2026 administrative and staffing plan describe imple-
mented and planned strategies for cost efficiencies and necessary
research and development projects.
Assessment Schedule.—The Committee notes the new voluntary
assessment schedule for NAEP approved by the NAGB on April 21,
2025. The Committee requests regular updates on NCES’s progress
in implementing the new schedule.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $419,907,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 379,907,000
The Committee provides $379,907,000 for program administra-
tion. Funds support personnel compensation and benefits, travel,
rent, communications, utilities, printing, equipment and supplies,
automated data processing, and other services required to award,
administer, and monitor Federal education programs. Support for
program evaluation and studies and advisory councils is also pro-
vided under this account.
Accreditation.—Congress, under section 496(a)(4)(A) of the HEA,
requires that accreditors respect the stated mission, including reli-

317
gious missions, of institutions of higher education. The Committee
requests, within 180 days of enactment, a report describing the
steps accreditors currently take to comply with section 496(a)(4)(A)
and how such current practices could be improved. The report
should also include any recommendations the Department or Con-
gress could take to improve oversight of accreditors’ compliance
with section 496(a)(4)(A).
Campus Antisemitism.—The Committee is deeply concerned with
continued reports of increased discrimination and harassment on
college campuses, including incidences of antisemitic discrimination
and harassment. The Committee encourages the Department to
continue to offer guidance to institutions of higher education for
the development of campus policies to combat religiously-based dis-
crimination, harassment, and other incidents. The Committee also
encourages the Department to offer guidance to institutions of
higher education to encourage the prompt reporting of instances in
which a member of the University community violates the institu-
tion’s policies regarding discrimination and harassment, any dis-
ciplinary actions taken by the institution in response to such viola-
tions, and how the reporting of such violations and disciplinary ac-
tions is conducted in a manner that complies with all applicable
privacy laws and policies.
Citizenship and Civics Postsecondary Education.—The Com-
mittee is concerned by recent surveys indicating that more than 70
percent of Americans lack a basic understanding of the structure
of government and rights and responsibilities of citizens in our de-
mocracy. As an educated citizenry is critical to our system of de-
mocracy, the Committee urges the Department to support institu-
tions of higher education in their efforts to increase student knowl-
edge of, and service to, American civil society.
College Costs.—The Committee is concerned by the increase in
college costs over the past 20 years and how those increases have
contributed to growing student loan debt. The Committee notes
that the Department annually publishes the College Affordability
and Transparency List as required by the HEA. The College Afford-
ability and Transparency List provides valuable information for
students and families on the most and least expensive IHEs by
both published tuition and net price. The Committee directs the
Department to ensure that this important resource is prominently
displayed on the Department’s website, including on the College
Scorecard website. The Committee encourages the Department to
use recently reported data from institutions of higher education to
develop detailed estimates of net prices by program for students of
different income levels, and to incorporate those measures on the
College Affordability and Transparency List and the College Score-
card. The Committee also encourages the Department to note on
the College Scorecard profile of any IHE, such IHE’s inclusion on
the College Affordability and Transparency List, if applicable.
Competitive Grant Priorities for Rural Areas.—The Committee
continues to encourage the Department to continue efforts to en-
sure competitive grants are reaching rural areas so that support
and solutions developed with Federal funding are relevant to and
available in such areas.

318
Comprehensive Literacy Resources.—The Committee believes it is
important for all educators to be prepared to provide high-quality
comprehensive literacy instruction for students. Free online com-
prehensive literacy resources with a specific focus on children in
kindergarten through sixth grade that are evidence-based and
build upon existing programs that leverage public partnerships and
multidisciplinary tools could assist educators with being more pre-
pared to provide such instruction.
EDFacts.—The Department’s EDFacts system centralizes per-
formance data supplied by SEAs with other data, which enables
the use of performance data to inform decisionmaking and re-
search. This system includes State-reported information from re-
quired assessments that is reported in a standard format, allowing
researchers to measure school improvement that is comparable for
all schools and LEAs. The Committee encourages the Department
to reinstate the more detailed reporting on assessments, which was
in effect through 2019, to allow SEAs, LEAs and schools to monitor
their performance against similar entities and continue to act to
improve their results.
Education Research Data Access.—The Committee directs the
Department to respond to all properly filed requests for education
research data access-restricted or otherwise-within a reasonable
timeline. The Committee requests a report not later than 30 days
after the end of the fiscal year on the number of properly filed re-
quests, the number of data access requests granted, and the aver-
age time for processing such requests.
Educator Reporting.—The Committee commends the Depart-
ment’s work to support implementation of and enforce the require-
ments in section 1111(g)(1)(B) of the ESEA. The Committee directs
continued efforts by the Department to work with each State to
publicly report in an accessible manner not less than every 2 years
progress made to ensure low-income and minority children enrolled
in public schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffec-
tive, out-of-field, or inexperienced teachers. The Committee re-
quests a briefing not later than 60 days after enactment of this act
on the Department’s planned support and monitoring efforts and
corrective actions and recommendations implemented by States.
Evidence-Based Grant Making.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to use demonstrated evidence of effectiveness as part of
the selection criteria through its Education Department General
Administrative Regulations, consistent with authorizations, for all
competitive grant programs. Further, non-competitive formula
grant funds have a range of evidence requirements and preferences
and the Committee directs the Department to support entities re-
ceiving funding through those programs through enhancements to
its technical assistance and support activities.
Foreign Influence.—Under section 117 of the HEA, institutions of
higher education receiving Federal financial assistance are re-
quired to disclose gifts from, or contracts with, foreign sources if
the value is $250,000 or more. They must also disclose ownership
or control by a foreign source. The Committee strongly urges the
Department to work with IHEs to ensure they are fully complying
with this statutory requirement. The Department shall report to
the Committee on any steps that it has taken to address undue for-

319
eign influence within IHEs and K–12 schools and any actions that
it has taken to ensure IHEs are fully complying with section 117
of the HEA. The Department shall also report to the Committee on
the presence and influence of Confucius Institutes and Confucius
Classrooms and their successor programs as well as the amount of
Federal funding for foreign language studies that IHEs with a Con-
fucius Institute or a successor program have received in the last
decade and whether such Federal funding was utilized by the Con-
fucius Institute or successor program.
Foundation for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.—The Com-
mittee continues to believe that the execution of the Foundations
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act will enhance the evidence-
building capacity of Federal agencies, strengthen privacy protec-
tions, improve secure access to data, and provide more and higher
quality evidence to policymakers. Therefore, the Committee directs
the Department to continue to include in the fiscal year 2027 and
future CJs updates on the implementation and planned implemen-
tation of such act for the current and future budget years.
Grant Payment Conditions.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to provide the Committees with notification 3 days prior to
putting more than a quarter of the all grantees in individual pro-
grams on route payment or instituting any other grant payment
condition to more than a quarter of all grantees in any individual
program. The Committee further directs the Department to provide
quarterly reports to the Committees on the number of grantees on
grant payment conditions by program, disaggregated by grant pay-
ment condition type. Such report shall also detail how long the
grantees have been on route payment status and the reasons for
placement in such status.
High-Quality Tutoring/Title I Evidence-Based Interventions.—
The Committee notes that research shows that using high-quality,
evidence-based tutoring programs with evidence of effectiveness, as
defined in the 2015 reauthorization of the ESEA, can significantly
improve achievement levels in reading and math. These proven
systems include three to five sessions a week, integrated as part
of the school day, delivered by a human tutor in person or virtually
to a group of one to not more than four students at a time; and
use a well-structured process, high-quality materials designed for
tutoring during the school day, ongoing professional development
and coaching for tutors, and assessment tools to benchmark stu-
dent achievement. Proven tutoring models can bring struggling stu-
dents up to the achievement level of their peers. The Committee
encourages the Department to promote and provide technical as-
sistance to LEAs and support partnerships between LEAs and edu-
cation-related community-based organizations to implement evi-
dence-based tutoring models.
Information Collection Activities.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of trusted, transparent, timely, disaggregated, and com-
parable data on how schools and districts are meeting the needs of
the students they serve and directs the Secretary to ensure that
the Department is fulfilling its responsibilities as required by law.
Legacy and Donor-Affiliated Admissions Practices.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to work with accrediting agen-
cies to assess whether accreditors consider preferences given to ap-

320
plicants based on alumni or donor affiliation in their review of in-
stitutional admissions policies, and to provide recommendations on
how these practices could be addressed through existing accredita-
tion standards.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund.—As part of the annual CJ, the De-
partment is directed to include the anticipated balances available
for transfer into and uses of the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund
[NEF] for the current and budget fiscal years. Additionally, the De-
partment is directed to provide the Committees quarterly reports
for all ongoing projects. The report shall include the following for
each project: a description and timeline for each project; the date
the project was notified to the Committees; total obligations to
date; obligations for the prior fiscal year; anticipated obligations for
current fiscal year; any expected future obligations; and the total
unobligated balance in the Fund. In addition, the Department is re-
quired to provide biannual reports on expired balances that are eli-
gible for transfer to the NEF. Such report shall include the Treas-
ury Account Fund Symbol, program name, unobligated balance,
and unexpended balance. Such report shall be transmitted 30 days
after the close of the second quarter and within 45 days after the
close of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
Pooled Evaluation Authority.—The Committee requests that the
Department provide a report to the Committee on the planned use
of pooled evaluation funds under section 8601 of the ESEA, con-
sistent with the required plan under such section, not later than
15 days prior to any transfer of funds. The Committee also directs
the Department to provide a report to the Committee on the
planned use of pooled evaluation funds under section 309 of this
act not later than 15 days prior to any transfer of funds.
Post-Secondary Transfer Articulation Agreements.—Transfer ar-
ticulation agreements between community colleges and 4-year
IHEs can play an important role in promoting access, affordability,
and completion in higher education. The Committee encourages the
Department to gather input from States that have implemented
comprehensive statewide programs to determine best practices for
implementation, enhancement, or scaling-up of agreements. The
Department should also seek input from States that do not have
comprehensive statewide programs to identify barriers to scaling-
up agreements. This information should be disseminated to States
by the Department with the goal of further enhancing or imple-
menting statewide transfer articulation agreements.
Program Priorities and Requirements.—The Committee notes
that authorizing laws contain program priorities and requirements
across a range of formula and competitive grant programs. The
Committee expects the Department to adhere to those priorities
and requirements when developing and issuing notices inviting ap-
plications and program guidance and administering multi-year
grants.
Protecting Personally-Identifiable Information.—The Committee
continues to direct the Department to ensure that its employees,
contractors, and grantees, including States that receive funds from
Statewide Longitudinal Data System grants, adhere to the strictest
and highest standards for protecting personally identifiable infor-
mation.

321
Reports to Congress.—The Department is directed to provide 5
business days’ notice to the Committee before release of any con-
gressionally directed report.
Responsiveness to GAO.—The Committee notes that there have
been prior engagements where the Department unnecessarily de-
layed in providing GAO with timely and complete information in
response to GAO requests. The Committee directs the Department
to provide timely and complete information to GAO on its engage-
ments within timeframes as GAO may specify. The Committee fur-
ther directs GAO to develop timeliness criteria to measure the De-
partment’s responsiveness to GAO requests for information. GAO
activities are crucial to Congressional oversight, and the develop-
ment of such criteria will assist GAO in the timely completion of
work. GAO should consult with the Department, as GAO deter-
mines appropriate, in developing such criteria.
Secondary Education Workforce Development Programs.—The
Committee supports State and local efforts to improve the align-
ment of workforce development efforts with secondary education,
including supporting expanded industry-recognized skills instruc-
tion, training, and other work-based learning opportunities to ad-
dress workforce development needs in in-demand industries and ca-
reer pathways leading to quality jobs, specifically in fields with
high, unmet demand like maritime and advanced manufacturing.
The Committee encourages the Department to support efforts for
secondary schools to partner with institutions of higher education,
business, workforce development organizations, and industry orga-
nizations seeking to develop education programs designed to lead
to or prepare individuals for high-demand careers in maritime and
advanced manufacturing.
Staffing Report.—Not later than 30 days after enactment, the
Department is directed to provide the Committee with a staffing
report identifying the total FTE and non-personnel allocations sup-
ported by the student aid administration, office for civil rights, and
office inspector general appropriations, and the FTE and non-per-
sonnel allocations for each program office supported by the pro-
gram administration appropriation provided by this act. In addi-
tion, the Department shall provide on a monthly basis the number
of on-board staff, attrition, approved hires not yet on-boarded and
projected full-year FTE usage, including approved hires, and actual
non-personnel expenses, for each program office supported by, and
in total for, the each of the student aid administration, program ad-
ministration, office for civil rights, and office inspector general ap-
propriations provided in this act. The monthly reports should be
detailed by competitive (including career SES) and excepted (in-
cluding noncareer and limited term SES) service staff. The Depart-
ment shall also provide the Committee on a biannual basis an excel
file which includes the names, titles, grades, program office, and
date of hire of all of the political appointees that were employed by
the Department during the previous 180 days.
OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $140,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 140,000,000

322
The Committee provides $140,000,000 for the Office for Civil
Rights [OCR]. OCR is responsible for the enforcement of laws that
prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin,
sex, disability, and age in all programs and institutions that re-
ceive financial assistance from the Department. To carry out this
responsibility, OCR investigates and resolves discrimination com-
plaints, supports civil rights data collection, monitors desegregation
and equal educational opportunity plans, reviews possible discrimi-
natory practices by recipients of Federal education funds, and pro-
vides technical assistance to recipients of funds to help them meet
these civil rights requirements.
The Committee notes the importance of OCR in enforcing Fed-
eral civil rights laws and directs the Department to continue to
post a list of all open investigations and case resolution documents.
The Committee also requests that OCR provide the Committee
with quarterly reports on the average case processing timelines for
each category of directed investigations and compliance reviews
and the number and type of complaints dismissed, opened for in-
vestigation, closed, or resolved.
Combatting Antisemitism.—The Committee is concerned by re-
ports of increased discrimination, including antisemitic harass-
ment, in our Nation’s education system. The Committee directs
OCR to ensure timely processing of all current and incoming
shared ancestry complaints and directed investigations, including
those relating to antisemitism. The Committee further directs the
Department to provide the Committees with quarterly reports on
the status of OCR shared ancestry investigations, including those
related to antisemitism, and an initial report no later than 30 days
after enactment of this act. Such reports should include a brief
overview, including timeline, status of the investigation, and any
actions taken by OCR.

amount, $3,000,000 is available until expended to provide flexi-
bility for hiring delays and the year-end return of funds for com-
mon support provided by the Department that may turn out cost-
ing less than anticipated.
OIG has the authority to investigate all departmental programs
and administrative activities, including those under contract or
grant, to prevent and detect fraud and abuse, and to ensure the

TITLE IV
RELATED AGENCIES
COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR
SEVERELY DISABLED
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,124,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,124,000
The Committee provides $13,124,000 for the Committee for Pur-
chase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled [Commis-
sion], of which no less than $3,150,000 shall be made available for
the Office of Inspector General.
The Commission provides employment opportunities to approxi-
mately 40,000 Americans who are blind or severely disabled each
year. The primary purpose of this program is to increase the em-
ployment opportunities for people who are blind or have other se-
vere disabilities and, whenever possible, to prepare them to engage
in competitive employment. Encompassing nearly $4,000,000,000 in
products and services procured, it is the Federal Government’s
largest employment program for the severely disabled.
Reports.—Consistent with the explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328, the Committee directs the Commis-
sion to submit in an electronic format quarterly reports on CNA
Fees and CNA Expenditures, due no later than 60 days after the
end of the fiscal quarter, to the Committees on Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform and Education and the Workforce of the House of
Representatives, Committees on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the
Senate, and Committees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.
CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE
The Corporation for National and Community Service [CNCS]
was established to enhance opportunities for national and commu-
nity service. CNCS administers programs authorized under the Do-
mestic Volunteer Service Act (Public Law 93–113), the National
and Community Service Trust Act (Public Law 103–82), and the
SERVE America Act (Public Law 111–13). Grants are awarded to
States, public and private nonprofit organizations, and other enti-
ties to create service opportunities for students, out-of-school youth,
adults, and seniors.
The Committee provides CNCS a total program level of
$1,252,806,000.
Staffing Report.—Not later than 30 days after enactment, CNCS
is directed to provide the Committee an operating plan identifying
(324)

325
the total FTE, contract support, and non-personnel allocations sup-
ported by each appropriations account, including operating ex-
penses, salaries and expenses, and office of inspector general for
each agency department and office supported by each of these ap-
propriations provided by this act. In addition, CNCS shall provide
on a monthly basis the number of on-board staff, including FTEs
and contractors, attrition, approved hires not yet on-boarded and
projected full-year FTE usage, including approved hires, and actual
non-personnel expenses, for each agency department and office sup-
ported by, and in total for each appropriations account, including
operating expenses, salaries and expenses, and office of inspector
general, provided in this act. The monthly reports should be de-
tailed by service type (including excepted or appointment) and ap-
pointment type (including permanent, term, temporary, and career
SES) for all agency staff. The Department shall also provide the
Committee on a biannual basis an excel file which includes the
names, titles, pay bands, agency department or office, and date of
hire of all of the employees in a position in the excepted service
employed by the Department during the previous 180 days.
Timely Notice of Awards.—Historically, CNCS has posted notices
of funding opportunities early in the year to give grantees time to
submit high quality applications and effectively plan for the use of
grant funds. The Committee directs CNCS to ensure funding oppor-
tunity announcements for competitive grant programs funded in
this act are published no later than January 1, 2026 and directs
CNCS to make every effort to award funds for competitive grant
programs funded under this Act no less than 60 days prior to the
expiration of their period of availability. Additionally, the Com-
mittee directs CNCS to award renewal and non-competing continu-
ations prior to the end of the period of performance, except in the
case of a grant or award where there has been a finding of finan-
cial mismanagement, research fraud, or malfeasance. Finally, the
Committee notes the inclusion of report language directing CNCS
to provide a report to the Committees listing all grants during the
previous month for which a scheduled non-competing continuation
or renewal award was not made within 14 days of the end of the
previous period of performance, including an explanation for the
delay.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $975,525,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 975,525,000
The Committee provides $975,525,000 for the operating expenses
of CNCS.
Volunteers in Service to America [VISTA]
The Committee provides $103,285,000 for VISTA. This program
provides capacity building for small, community-based organiza-
tions with a mission of combating poverty. VISTA members raise
resources, recruit and organize volunteers, and establish and ex-
pand programs in housing, employment, health, and economic de-
velopment activities.

326
National Senior Volunteer Corps
The Committee provides $236,917,000 for the National Senior
Volunteer Corps programs, a collection of programs that connect
Americans older than the age of 55 with opportunities to contribute
their job skills and expertise to community projects and organiza-
tions. These programs include the Retired Senior Volunteer Pro-
gram, the Foster Grandparent Program, and the Senior Companion
Program.
AmeriCorps State and National Grants
The Committee provides $635,323,000 for AmeriCorps State and
National Grants, which provide funds to local and national organi-
zations and agencies to address community needs in education,
public safety, health, and the environment. Each of these organiza-
tions and agencies, in turn, uses its AmeriCorps funding to recruit,
place, and supervise AmeriCorps members. AmeriCorps members
receive a modest living allowance and other benefits proportional
to their level of time commitment.
Alumni Engagement Activities.—The Committee notes significant
Congressional and stakeholder interest in those activities, includ-
ing strengthening identification with the AmeriCorps brand; ex-
panding education and workforce pipelines; soliciting feedback from
alumni on member experience; directory data sharing; and inter-
agency collaboration on national, public, and military service. The
Committee encourages CNCS to support these and other alumni
engagement activities.
Civic Bridge Building.—The Committee supports CNCS’ goal of
uniting Americans through national service and recognizes that
service is a proven model of civic bridge building. To advance these
shared goals, the Committee continues to encourage CNCS to con-
sider awarding grants, within existing competitions, to: (1) support
civic bridge building programs and projects to reduce polarization
and community divisions; and (2) provide training in civic bridge
building skills and techniques to CNCS members and host sites
and provide resources that can be publicly disseminated to support
local civic bridge building efforts, among other activities.
Collaboration on Outreach and Recruitment.—The Committee
commends collaboration among the Department of Defense, CNCS,
the Selective Service System, Peace Corps, and the Office of Per-
sonnel Management on raising public awareness about military
and national service opportunities. The Committee directs these
agencies to continue exploring mutually beneficial ways to promote
each agency’s service opportunities, including sharing market re-
search, providing ineligible or non-selected applicants with infor-
mation about other forms of service, piloting joint recruitment ef-
forts, and providing information to individuals transitioning out of
military and national service about other opportunities to serve.
The Committee requests a briefing from CNCS no later than 60
days after enactment that provides an update on these collabora-
tion efforts.
Commission Investment Fund [CIF].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2024 level for
the CIF, which provides funds to State commissions for training
and technical assistance activities to expand the capacity of current

327
and potential AmeriCorps programs, particularly in underserved
areas.
Fixed Price Grant Program.—The Committee believes the fixed
amount AmeriCorps State and National grant is a flexible, useful
grant vehicle that helps minimize risk and lowers administrative
burden on grantees. Section 129(l) of the National and Community
Service Act of 1990, as amended by Public Law 111–13, provides
the agency with the authority to adopt other terms and conditions
based on the risks associated with the Fixed Price grant program.
The Committee directs CNCS to review the risks associated with
the current drawdown formula that only allows recipients to incre-
mentally receive awarded grant funds as service hours are recorded
by enrolled members. The Committee notes that this formula may
not always account for the many start-of-service program costs and
the expenses grantees incur, regardless of whether a member
serves a full term. The Committee urges CNCS to modify the draw-
down formula to cover allowable grant expenses that occur at the
start of year and to minimize the impact that under-enrollment, at-
trition, and service hour disruptions can have on grantee oper-
ations. CNCS should report to the Committees, in the fiscal year
2027 CJ, on the modifications CNCS will make and if any congres-
sional action is required to authorize or help implement the
changes.
Flexibility for Programs.—The Committee notes it provided
CNCS with the authority to fund certain member service positions
under 1,700 hours to help provide flexibility for programs to con-
tinue to operate and best meet the needs of their local commu-
nities.
National Civilian Community Corps [NCCC]
The Committee provides $37,735,000 for NCCC, a full-time,
team-based residential program for men and women ages 18 to 24.
Members are assigned to one of five campuses for a 10-month serv-
ice commitment.
Innovation, Demonstration, and Assistance Activities
The Committee provides $14,706,000 for innovation, demonstra-
tion, and assistance activities.
Volunteer Generation Fund.—Within the total, the Committee in-
cludes $8,558,000 for the Volunteer Generation Fund authorized
under section 198P of the SERVE America Act (Public Law 111–
13).
National Days of Service.—The Committee provides $6,148,000
for National Days of Service including the September 11th Na-
tional Day of Service and Remembrance and the Martin Luther
King, Jr. National Day of Service. CNCS may give priority to mak-
ing grants, entering into Cooperative Agreements, or providing
other forms of support to eligible organizations with expertise in:
representing families of victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks and other impacted constituencies; promoting the establish-
ment of September 11 as an annually recognized National Day of
Service and Remembrance; and organizing volunteers to engage in
service to meet community needs and advance the life and teach-
ings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

328
Service Learning.—The Committee encourages CNCS to continue
to be a convener of the important work surrounding service learn-
ing, including programs in public schools and institutions of higher
education.
Evaluation
The Committee provides $6,250,000 for CNCS evaluation activi-
ties.
Effective Interventions.—The Committee is aware of CNCS initia-
tives to help service providers apply scientific evaluation methods
to better understand interventions and encourages CNCS to con-
tinue its use of randomized control trials to build causal evidence
for effective interventions.
State Commission Grants
The Committee recommendation provides $19,538,000 for State
Commission Grants.
THE NATIONAL SERVICE TRUST

National Service Trust.
The National Service Trust makes payments of Segal education
awards, pays interest that accrues on qualified student loans for
AmeriCorps participants during terms of service in approved na-
tional service positions, and makes other payments entitled to
members who serve in the programs of CNCS.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $99,686,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 89,686,000
The Committee provides an appropriation of $89,686,000 for
CNCS salaries and expenses. The salaries and expenses appropria-
tion provides funds for staff salaries, benefits, travel, training, rent,
equipment, and other operating expenses necessary for manage-
ment of CNCS programs and activities. The Committee notes the
inclusion of bill language to support staffing levels necessary to
carry out CNCS’ statutory responsibilities.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,595,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,595,000

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 291,800,000
The Committee provides $291,800,000 for the Institute of Mu-
seum and Library Services [IMLS]. This agency supports programs
for museums and libraries that encourage innovation, provide life-
long learning opportunities, promote cultural and civic engage-
ment, and improve access to a variety of services and information.

(Executive Order 14189). IMLS has a key role in supporting exist-
ing activities at the State and local levels that enhance civic en-
gagement through local community collaboration by facilitating
partnerships with local museums. The Committee encourages the
Office of Museum Services to support efforts of state 250th commis-
sions through existing programs, such as Museums for All or Na-
tional Leadership Grants. Such efforts will preserve and share
American history at this once-in-a-generation moment resulting in
greater civic engagement beyond the Semiquincentennial.

struct IMLS to issue guidance on how consortia of Indian tribes or
Tribal organizations could be eligible to apply for Tribal library and
related grants.
Museum and Library Facilities.—The Committee continues to be
concerned about the physical condition of library and museum fa-
cilities. The Committee looks forward to receiving the GAO report
required in Senate Report 118–84 on this issue. In addition, the
Committee appreciates IMLS’s work to conduct a study on this
issue and the publication of the resulting report.

ment insurance trust funds that may be used by the Board for ad-
ministrative expenses.
The Committee continues to request annual updates on the

Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000
The Committee provides $15,000,000 in mandatory funds for
payments to Social Security trust funds. This account reimburses
the Old Age and Survivors Insurance [OASI] and Disability Insur-
ance [DI] trust funds for special payments to certain uninsured
persons, costs incurred administering pension reform activities, and
the value of the interest for benefit checks issued but not nego-

334
tiated. This appropriation restores the trust funds to the same fi-
nancial position they would have been in had they not borne these
costs and they were properly charged to general revenues.
SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $46,349,317,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 49,447,965,000
The Committee provides $49,447,965,000 in fiscal year 2026
mandatory funds for the SSI program. This is in addition to the
$22,100,000,000 provided in the fiscal year 2025 appropriations act
for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. In addition, the Committee
provides $23,500,000,000 in advance funding for the first quarter
of fiscal year 2027. The SSI program guarantees a minimum level
of income to individuals who are disabled, blind, or older than age
65, and meet certain income and resource limitations.
Federal Benefit Payments
The Committee provides a fiscal year 2026 program level of
$66,762,000,000 for Federal benefit payments.
Beneficiary Services
The Committee provides $75,000,000 in new mandatory budget
authority for beneficiary services.
These funds reimburse vocational rehabilitation [VR] agencies for
successfully rehabilitating disabled SSI recipients by helping them
achieve and sustain productive, self-supporting work activity.
Funds also support the Ticket to Work program that provides SSI
recipients with a ticket to offer employment networks [ENs], in-
cluding VR agencies, in exchange for employment and support serv-
ices. Instead of reimbursing ENs for specific services, the Ticket to
Work program pays ENs based on recipients achieving certain
milestones and outcomes.
Research and Demonstration
The Committee provides $91,000,000 in mandatory funds for re-
search and demonstration projects conducted under sections 1110,
1115, and 1144 of the Social Security Act (Public Law 74–271), as
amended. These funds support a variety of research and dem-
onstration projects designed to improve the disability process, pro-
mote self-sufficiency and assist individuals in returning to work,
encourage savings and retirement planning through financial lit-
eracy, and generally provide analytical and data resources for use
in preparing and reviewing policy proposals.
Administrative Expenses
The Committee provides $4,619,965,000 for SSI program admin-
istrative expenses. This appropriation funds the SSI program’s
share of administrative expenses incurred through the Limitation
on Administrative Expenses [LAE] account.
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,297,978,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,891,978,000

335
This account provides resources for SSA to administer the OASI,
DI, and SSI programs, and to support CMS in administering the
Medicare program. The LAE account is funded by the Social Secu-
rity and Medicare trust funds for their share of administrative ex-
penses, the general fund for the SSI program’s share of administra-
tive expenses, and applicable user fees. These funds support core
administrative activities including processing retirement and dis-
ability claims, conducting hearings to review disability determina-
tion appeals, issuing Social Security numbers and cards, processing
individuals’ annual earnings information, and ensuring the integ-
rity of Social Security programs through continuing disability re-
views [CDR] and SSI redeterminations of non-medical eligibility.
The Committee provides $2,397,000,000 for program integrity ac-
tivities, including CDRs, SSI redeterminations of non-medical eligi-
bility, and Cooperative Disability Investigations units. This in-
cludes $273,000,000 in base funding and $2,124,000,000 in budget
adjustment funding.
The Committee also provides up to $171,000,000 for administra-
tive activities funded from user fees. This includes up to
$170,000,000 in fees collected from States that request SSA to ad-
minister State SSI supplementary payments and up to $1,000,000
from fees collected from non-attorney claimant representatives.
The Committee also provides not less than $2,700,000 for the So-
cial Security Advisory Board. This board advises the Commissioner
of Social Security and makes recommendations to Congress and the
President on policies relating to the OASI, DI, and SSI programs.
Beneficiary Information on Claims Timing.—The Committee is
concerned many retiring beneficiaries make their claiming decision
without a full understanding of the financial implications of benefit
reductions for early retirement or delayed retirement credits. The
Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2027 CJ describing
SSA’s protocols, operating procedures, and informational materials
(including nomenclature) used to inform retiring beneficiaries of
how changes in their claiming date may affect their monthly ben-
efit after claiming. Such report shall also include changes to such
protocols, procedures, materials, and nomenclature SSA has consid-
ered using to help beneficiaries make more informed decisions re-
garding the timing of their retirement claim and improve the
public’s understanding of the effect of different claiming strategies.
Codebase Modernization.—The Committee supports efforts to up-
date SSA’s codebase from the COBOL programming language,
which would provide better access to beneficiary data, expedite
claim processing, reduce need for manual data entry, and lower the
number of improper payments. The Committee directs the SSA,
within 180 days of issuance of this report, to submit to the Com-
mittees a report on SSA’s progress on the secure migration of the
codebase to a modern programming language.
Communications to my Social Security Account Holders.—The
Committee directs SSA to ensure that its communications with the
public, particularly direct emails to my Social Security Account
holders, be nonpartisan and factual.
Cooperative Disability Investigations [CDI].—The Committee di-
rects SSA to provide an update in its fiscal year 2027 CJ on CDI
units, including updates on the program’s projected savings to

336
SSA’s disability programs, total recovery amounts, and projected
savings to other Federal and State programs. Such updates shall
also include suggestions regarding other ways Federal and State
agencies may partner on anti-fraud initiatives with respect to So-
cial Security programs.
Data Sharing and Systems Integration.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of improving access to accurate and timely in-
formation to support eligibility determinations and program integ-
rity across Federal and State-administered programs. The Com-
mittee encourages the Social Security Administration [SSA], in co-
ordination with the Department of Labor [DOL], to conduct a legal
review of the authority, requirements, and limitations governing
the sharing of relevant SSA- and DOL-held data with State agen-
cies and third-party entities. The Committee further encourages
SSA to evaluate opportunities for secure system integration or
automated data exchange solutions while protecting individual pri-
vacy and ensuring compliance with applicable law.
Digital Identify Authentication.—The Committee recognizes po-
tential efforts to adopt digital identity authentication technologies
to accompany Federal benefit verification practices. The Committee
requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment on SSAs efforts in
this area, including how it is addressing the digital literacy and ac-
cessibility needs of the populations it serves and how it is miti-
gating potential risks and ensuring data privacy.
IT Activities.—The Committee directs SSA to provide a report to
the Committee, within 90 days of enactment of this act, detailing
the number and amount of contracts, grants, and cooperative
agreements awarded for the purpose of maintaining, expanding,
modernizing, or enhancing its information technology capabilities
and infrastructure. Such report shall include, at a minimum, the
name of the contractor or grantee, the amount of funding, the con-
tract duration, the governmental purpose, and the programmatic
area(s) within SSA’s IT portfolio (as described on Table 3.24 of the
fiscal year 2026 CJ) the contract serves.
Service Delivery.—The Committee notes there are significant
service delivery challenges at SSA that are impacting critical serv-
ices that millions of Americans count on. The Committee directs
SSA to provide monthly briefings to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the steps
it is taking to address these issues, including but not limited to, de-
creasing disability claim processing times, ensuring prompt proc-
essing of retirement claims, addressing delays on SSA’s 1–800
number and in field offices, and general improvement to customer
experience when contacting SSA. The Committee directs SSA to
provide the Committees a monthly report of performance metrics
that measure SSA’s progress on addressing key service delivery
challenges. In addition, the Committee directs GAO to conduct a
review of service delivery challenges at SSA and SSA’s steps to ad-
dress them. Finally, the Committee directs SSA to ensure that
changes to internal policies, including changes to its Program Oper-
ations Manual System are deliberate and include public and stake-
holder input when appropriate. The Committee directs SSA to no-
tify the Committees in advance of any changes to its internal poli-

337
cies that could reasonably be expected to meaningfully impact the
public’s interactions with SSA.
Rural and Frontier Service Delivery.—The Committee is con-
cerned that senior citizens and Americans with disabilities in rural
and frontier areas of the Nation are unable to access in-person So-
cial Security services and that access by phone or videoconference
is limited. The Committee strongly urges SSA to evaluate its serv-
ice delivery options in rural and frontier areas and, when feasible,
implement expanded access to options that have been most effec-
tive for residents of these areas to ensure that SSA is able to pro-
vide timely assistance, whether in-person, by phone, or by video-
conference.
Staffing Plan.—The Committee notes the importance of ensuring
SSA has the necessary workforce to operate efficiently and provide
high-quality service to program beneficiaries. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $100,000,000 above the budget request in
order to help address workforce challenges. The Committee directs
SSA to provide a monthly report of staff on board by component as
of the beginning of fiscal year 2025, the beginning of fiscal year
2026, and for each month starting with the month after the date
of enactment of this act, including the number of staff on board by
field office.
Survivor Benefits Processing.—The Committee notes the impor-
tance of ensuring that timely, quality beneficiary services are ren-
dered to current and prospective recipients of survivors benefits.
The Committee emphasizes that, as with other types of Social Se-
curity benefits, the timing of claiming and associated services can
be critical for the livelihood of survivors, especially child bene-
ficiaries.
Ticket to Work Improvements.—The Committee recognizes that
the Ticket to Work program may be underutilized and can provide
important resources for individuals looking to return to work. The
Committee encourages SSA to work to identify ways to improve the
program’s effectiveness through existing and relevant statutory au-
thorities.
Vocational Guidelines.—The Committee is aware that implemen-
tation of the Occupational Information System [OIS] project, which
aims to bring the vocational list used in disability determinations
in line with current job opportunities, is ongoing. The Committee
notes that SSA has obligated and expended significant resources
and time on this project to-date. Therefore, the Committee directs
SSA, within 90 days of enactment of this act, to provide a briefing
to the Committees on Appropriations and Finance of the Senate
and the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means of the
House of Representatives regarding SSA’s status in making these
changes to occupational data, completed actions to-date, and
planned actions for this project over the coming fiscal year.
Work Incentives Planning and Assistance [WIPA] and Protection
and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security [PABSS].—The
Committee provides $23,000,000 for WIPA and $10,000,000 for
PABSS. These programs provide valuable services to help Social
Security disability beneficiaries return to work. The Committee
notes that delayed suitability determinations have in some cases
significantly affected the ability of PABSS grantees to carry out

338
their mission to protect the rights and best interests of individuals
with disabilities.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $114,665,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 114,665,000
The Committee provides $114,665,000 for SSA’s OIG. This in-
cludes $82,665,000 funded from the OASI and DI trust funds for
those programs’ share of OIG’s expenses and $32,000,000 funded
from general revenues for the SSI program’s share of expenses.
Combating Social Security Impersonation Scams.—The Com-
mittee continues to commend the work that SSA OIG has done to
combat Social Security impersonation scams. The Committee again
encourages SSA OIG to prioritize work with SSA to increase
awareness of this scam and to pursue the criminals perpetrating
this fraud.

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests). Following is a list of congressionally directed spending
items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this ex-
planatory statement, along with the name of each Senator who
submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item
so identified. Neither the Committee recommendation nor this re-
port contains any limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as
defined in rule XLIV.
