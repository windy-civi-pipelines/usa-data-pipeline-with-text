quires covered entities to label covered products clearly and con-
spicuously with ‘‘Do Not Flush’’ labels and symbols.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Wastewater treatment systems have been increasingly impacted
by clogs and fatbergs resulting from the flushing of non-flushable
wipes. In a 2019 study, the National Association of Clean Water
Agencies (NACWA) estimated that wipes result in approximately
$441 million in additional yearly operating costs at U.S. clean
water utilities.1 According to NACWA, just in the state of Cali-
fornia, flushed wipes have cost utilities $47 million in additional
annual operating costs.2 Similar trends can be seen across the
United States, prompting some state legislators to offer legislation
to address the clogged drains and expensive repairs associated with
the improper disposal of non-flushable wipe.3
Organizations have used a combination of outreach and surveys
to probe and increase consumer’s understanding of appropriate
wipe-flushing practices. For example, in April 2023, the Respon-
sible Flushing Alliance (RFA) released survey data of California
consumers measuring their general awareness of the ‘‘Do Not
Flush’’ symbol. Surprisingly, though most respondents believed
that they were somewhat knowledgeable about what can be
flushed, a notable portion of respondents falsely believed that some
non-flushable products are flushable.4 In an attempt to address
this consumer uncertainty, some wastewater treatment companies
have issued notices to residents to educate them on what products
can and cannot be flushed down the toilet.5
Based on the available data, there is an apparent disconnect be-
tween consumers’ understanding of whether certain wipes products
are flushable, and the information directed towards wipes con-
sumers. To address the ongoing infrastructure and environmental
issues caused by the misinformed flushing of non-flushable wipes,
consumers must be clearly notified when a wipe is non-flushable.
The requirements posed by H.R. 2269 would ensure that wipe man-
ufacturers, and other covered entities, clearly and conspicuously
label and notice non-flushable wipes accordingly. By enacting a
uniform, national policy to ensure wipe manufacturers, or other
covered entities, appropriately label the packaging of their wipe
products with ‘‘Do Not Flush’’ notices and symbols, consumers will
be better equipped to help prevent the damaging consequences that
lead to costly breakdowns and backups in American wastewater
systems associated with flushing non-flushable wipes.
