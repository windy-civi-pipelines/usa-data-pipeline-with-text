LA PAZ COUNTY SOLAR ENERGY AND
JOB CREATION ACT
JULY2, 2025.—Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 1043]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 1043) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey cer-
tain Federal land in Arizona to La Paz County, Arizona, and for
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon without amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 1043 is to direct the Secretary of the Interior
to convey certain Federal land in Arizona to La Paz County, Ari-
zona, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Approximately 95 percent of the land in La Paz County, Arizona,
is under federal, state, or Tribal management, with only five per-
cent of the land available for private ownership.1 The Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) is the largest single land manager in
this rural county, controlling roughly 58 percent of the total land
mass.2 The county’s economy is primarily dependent on tourism
and agriculture.3 Like many other Western communities with large
federal land footprints, La Paz County faces significant challenges
in meeting the economic needs of its residents.

In an effort economically diversify and create additional employ-
ment opportunities, the County worked with Representative Gosar
(R–AZ–09) to pursue a legislative conveyance of 5,935 acres of BLM
land for the development of a large-scale solar farm. That legisla-
tion, the ‘‘La Paz County Land Conveyance Act,’’ was signed into
law in 2019 as part of the ‘‘John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Man-
agement and Recreation Act.’’4 After the bill’s passage, La Paz
County executed development grants with 174 Power Global, a re-
newable energy company, and the solar project is currently under-
way.5 The project, one of the largest in the United States, is ex-
pected to produce 1,000 megawatts of solar power, as well as hun-
dreds of megawatts of battery storage.6
H.R. 1043 seeks to build on the success of this project by con-
veying an additional 3,400 acres of BLM land adjacent to the initial
project site to the County. This acreage was part of Representative
Gosar’s initial legislation but was ultimately removed in the final
version of the bill that became law in 2019. While BLM has ana-
lyzed most of the proposed acres for renewable energy develop-
ment, the County believes this additional land will provide impor-
tant economic benefits and much-needed revenues to support its
residents.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 1043 was introduced on February 6, 2025, by Representa-
tive Paul Gosar (R–AZ). The bill was referred to the Committee on

Resources met to consider the bill. The bill was then ordered favor-
ably reported to the House of Representatives by unanimous con-
sent.

cluding lands with significant cultural, environmental, wildlife, or
recreational resources. Section 3 stipulates that La Paz County, or
any subsequent owner of the conveyed land, must make good faith
efforts to avoid disturbing Tribal artifacts, minimize impacts if
Tribal artifacts are disturbed, coordinate with the Colorado River
Indian Tribes Tribal Historic Preservation Office to identify cul-
turally significant items, and permit Tribal representatives to
rebury unearthed artifacts at or near their original location. Sec-
tion 3 also allows the Secretary and County to mutually agree to
make minor boundary adjustments or to correct clerical errors in
the acreage estimate or legal description. Section 3 makes the map
of the conveyed land available for public inspection in the appro-
priate BLM offices and withdraws the conveyed land from oper-
ation under mining and mineral leasing laws. Finally, Section 3 re-
quires the County to cover the administrative costs of the convey-
ance and pay the appraised value of the land, with all proceeds de-
posited in the Federal Land Disposal Account established under
the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act.7
