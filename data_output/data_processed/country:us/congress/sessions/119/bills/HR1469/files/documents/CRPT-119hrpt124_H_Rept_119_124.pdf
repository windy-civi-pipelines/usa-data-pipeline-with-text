PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1469, the Senior Security Act of 2025, was introduced on
February 21, 2025, by Representative Josh Gottheimer (NJ–05).
H.R. 1469 establishes the Senior Investor Taskforce within the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Taskforce must re-
port on topics relating to investors over the age of 65, including in-
dustry trends and serious issues impacting such investors, and
make recommendations for legislative or regulatory actions to ad-
dress problems encountered by senior investors. The bill also re-
quires the Government Accountability Office to report on the finan-
cial exploitation of senior citizens.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Fraud and exploitation of any kind in our capital markets threat-
en their integrity. They harm investors seeking to save for retire-
ment or for major expenses like a child’s tuition or buying a home.
It is especially problematic when such fraud targets senior inves-
tors. This bill supports and enhances the SEC’s current efforts to
protect against the increasing instances of financial exploitation
against senior investors.

estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.

the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule and section 402 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, a cost estimate was not made available to the Com-

Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congres-
sional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director

dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 1469 as the ‘‘National Senior Investor Ini-
tiative Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘Senior Security Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Senior Investor Taskforce
This section establishes a Senior Investor Taskforce within the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), charged with identi-
fying and addressing issues affecting investors over the age of 65,
including financial exploitation and cognitive decline. The section
requires the Taskforce to be staffed by existing SEC personnel and
to coordinate with other internal and external entities such as self-
regulatory organizations and state and federal authorities. This
section also mandates the Taskforce to produce a detailed report
every two years for Congress, analyzing trends, regulatory initia-
tives, challenges and best practices related to senior investors, and
may recommend legislative or regulatory changes. The section also
sunsets the Taskforce ten years after the enactment of this bill.
Section 3. GAO study
This section requires the Comptroller General of the United
States to conduct and submit a comprehensive study on the finan-
cial exploitation of senior citizens to Congress and the Senior In-
vestor Taskforce within two years of bill’s enactment.
This section mandates that the study must assess the economic
costs of such exploitation to victims, government programs, and the
private sector, and identify additional relevant financial impacts. It
must also evaluate the frequency of exploitation and analyze con-
tributing risk factors, such as age, race, income, education, and so-
cial isolation. Additionally, the study must examine how often fi-
nancial abuse goes unreported, why it may not be reported, and
how current reports are handled by agencies.

House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,
