a pilot program under which a private sector firm can receive a li-
cense to conduct nominal financial transactions to and through
sanctioned entities in furtherance of the firm’s investigations.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
OFAC licenses are authorizations allowing OFAC to engage in a
transaction that otherwise would be prohibited. H.R. 1450 would
work similarly to law enforcement’s ability to request financial in-
stitutions to maintain accounts. During the process of investigating
financial crimes, law enforcement can provide written requests to
financial institutions, wherein they may have an interest, to ensure
an account remains open. These requests are done with the under-
standing that tracking the financial flows through the account can
benefit law enforcement’s investigation.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
118TH CONGRESS
On October 25, 2023, the Subcommittee on National Security, Il-
licit Finance, and International Financial Institutions of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled ‘‘How America

Sanctions and Financing Terror,’’ which examined challenges to
law enforcement in its investigations of financial crimes. Witnesses

Iran; Mr. Richard Goldberg, Senior Advisor at the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies; Mr. Gabriel Noronha, Fellow at The
Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy at the Jewish Institute

utive Officer of Inca Digital; and Mr. Matthew Levitt, Director of
the Reinhardt Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence and

tion, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On November 14, 2023,

lative session and reported it favorably, as amended, to the House

atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
