PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 275, the ‘‘Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2024,’’ re-
quires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to publish acces-
sible monthly reports on the number of special interest aliens
(SIA), to include specifications on the encounter location and their
country of origin.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
An SIA is a non-U.S. person who, based on a DHS analysis of
travel patterns, may pose a national security risk to the United
States or its interests. DHS analysis includes an examination of
travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments associated
with current assessments of national and international threat envi-
ronments.
Under the Biden administration, DHS faced an unprecedented
number of SIAs from outside the Western Hemisphere, including
individuals from adversarial nations including the People’s Repub-
lic of China, Iran, and Russia.1 For instance, according to Customs
and Border Patrol (CBP) data, apprehensions of Chinese foreign
nationals nationwide increased from approximately 350 in FY 2021
to nearly 38,000 in FY 2024.2 Record migration flows led to in-
creases in SIAs traversing the region on their way to the South-

counters.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee ad-
vises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee,
based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X, are in-
corporated in the descriptive portions of this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE, NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY,
ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX EXPENDITURES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII
and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and
with respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII and
section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee adopts as its own the estimate of any new budget authority,
spending authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in
revenues or tax expenditures contained in the cost estimate pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
H.R. 275 would require the Department of Homeland Security to
publish, on a publicly available website, a monthly report on the
number and nationalities of Special Interest Aliens encountered by
the department during the previous month. Special Interest Aliens
are non-U.S. nationals who, based on an analysis of their travel
patterns, potentially pose national security risks to the United
States.
On the basis of information about similar reporting require-
ments, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less
than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Such spending would be
subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is David Rafferty. The
estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Di-
rector of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.

MINORITY VIEWS
Committee Democrats support efforts to improve transparency
and accountability at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
However, such efforts should be carefully crafted so that the infor-
mation released cannot be easily exploited by criminals and other
bad actors. As reported out of committee, H.R. 275 could make
American communities less safe by tipping off bad actors about law
enforcement practices.
More specifically, H.R. 275 would require U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection (CBP) to publicly report sensitive national security
information every month, giving bad actors real-time updates on
DHS operations. This includes requiring the Secretary of Homeland
Security to publish not only the number of special interest aliens
(SIAs) encountered every month by DHS, but also their nationali-
ties or countries of last habitual residence and where they at-
tempted to cross the border.
It is also important to note that the term ‘‘special interest alien’’
does not indicate that there is specific derogatory information
about any given individual. Instead, the SIA designation indicates
that an individual’s travel patterns suggest a need for further in-
vestigation.1 According to public reporting, an internal Border Pa-
trol document states that migrants could be deemed SIAs solely
based on their country of origin.2 If such reporting is accurate, pub-
licly reporting the countries of migrants receiving additional
screening every month via the SIA designation would be a boon to
transnational criminal organizations. Criminal organizations could
use this information to adjust their operations to attempt to evade
detection, including helping bad actors determine when it is in
their interest to destroy identification documents and lie about
their origins. This would make American communities less safe.
Furthermore, DHS considers specific, identifying information
about SIAs to be law-enforcement sensitive information. According
to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘‘law enforce-
ment sensitive (LES) refers to unclassified information originated
by agencies with law enforcement missions that may be used in
criminal prosecution and requires protection against unauthorized
disclosure to protect sources and methods, investigative activity,
evidence, or the integrity of pretrial investigative reports.’’3 Identi-
fying information about SIAs is considered LES because the term
is dynamic, and thus releasing specifics about SIA in real-time

could help criminals and terrorists understand who DHS is tar-
geting for additional screening and where this screening is occur-
ring, and then use that information to attempt to avoid the en-
hanced screenings intended to protect public safety.
Finally, DHS is not currently prevented from publishing the in-
formation required by this legislation should the Secretary no
longer deem it a potential threat to do so. In other words, this bill
is totally unnecessary except to overrule the judgment of the De-
partment that publishing such information would make Americans
less safe.
In summary, Committee Democrats support greater transparency
from the Department of Homeland Security, but such efforts must
be done in a manner that also protects public safety. Unfortu-
nately, H.R. 275 does not strike the necessary balance.
