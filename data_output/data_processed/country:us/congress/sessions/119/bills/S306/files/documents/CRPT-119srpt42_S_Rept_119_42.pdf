FIRE READY NATION ACT OF 2025
JULY, 16, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 306]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 306) to establish and maintain a co-
ordinated program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration that improves wildfire, fire weather, fire risk, and
wildfire smoke related forecasting, detection, modeling, observa-
tions, and service delivery, and for other purposes, having consid-
ered the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and
recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 306, the Fire Ready Nation Act of 2025, is to
establish a fire weather services program and a fire weather
testbed within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) to coordinate data collection to improve fire weather
forecasting, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
In 2024, more than 61,000 wildfires burned over 8.8 million acres
in the United States.1 On average, each year, wildfires kill 30 peo-
ple, destroy 2,800 homes, burn more than 7 million acres, and
cause numerous health issues. The annual average cost for dam-

ages and suppression of wildland fire is more than $2 billion.2
Wildfires can occur across the United States; more individual
wildfires occur in the eastern portion of the country, but wildfires
are larger and burn more acreage in the West.3
In February 2024, Texas saw the worst wildfire in the State’s
history, ranked 5th in the history of the United States. The Smoke-
house Creek fire scorched almost 1.1 million acres over 3 weeks,
and two individuals lost their lives.4 In January 2025, California
faced one of its most devastating wildfires. The Palisades Fire in
Los Angeles burned over 23,000 acres. The blaze destroyed large
areas of Pacific Palisades, Topanga, and Malibu, causing manda-
tory evacuations and significant property loss. Estimated damages
from the fire exceeded $35 billion, including over 16,000 struc-
tures.5
Fire weather prediction involves using meteorological param-
eters, such as relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and soil
moisture, to determine whether conditions favor fire growth and
smoke dispersion.6 Drought decreases soil moisture, and large
amounts of dry fuel naturally contribute to the start and spread of
fires. Human causes, such as prescribed burns and cooking fires,
also contribute to the start of fires. Fire Weather Watches and Red
Flag Warnings are issued to the public when dry fuels and weather
conditions support extreme fire danger.7 Smoke from fires can also
contribute to other hazardous conditions such as decreased visi-
bility on roadways, leading to traffic collisions.8 Smoke can travel
thousands of miles from the source fire and worsen air quality for
communities far from wildfires.9 Wildfire smoke contains harmful
pollutants, including particle matter and polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons, and exposure to wildfire smoke is linked to increased risk
of cardiovascular and respiratory health events.10
NOAA forecasts, tracks, and provides on-the-ground support for
wildfires through satellite data, the NOAA Incident Meteorologist
(IMET) program, and computer modeling. High-resolution imagery
and infrared data collected by satellite allow for the detection and
monitoring of fires. Infrared imaging can detect fires at night and
track wildfire movement when smoke obstructs the ground.11 Sat-
ellite data also helps firefighting efforts from the air and enables
better air quality forecasts.12 The National Weather Service IMETs
are deployed to the scenes of wildfire, where they work to support

agencies and first responders on the front lines.13 Weather condi-
tions influence how a fire may start, spread, and move, and IMETs
are critical for reporting this information to keep fire crews safe.
IMETs set up a fully functional portable forecasting office at the
fire scene, where they communicate how current and future weath-
er patterns will impact the intensity and movement of the fire.14
Federal agencies and private entities use computer modeling to
predict fire formation, intensity, movement, and smoke. However,
not every Federal agency performs the same type of modeling or
considers all environmental factors that impact fires. Incorporating
atmospheric information, weather, fuels, soil moisture, smoke, and
other data collected by Department of Commerce and Department
of Interior agencies would greatly improve prediction capabilities
and better inform management practices.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 306 would do the following:
• Establish a comprehensive fire weather services program with-
in NOAA to enhance risk communication and wildfire fore-
casting.
• Create a user-focused digital repository for fire-related tools,
data, and information and set data management and sharing
standards across NOAA.
• Establish a fire weather testbed to develop and operationalize
technologies addressing fire hazards, including uncrewed sys-
tems.
• Coordinate ground-based data collection across Federal agen-
cies to improve fire weather and smoke forecasting efficiency.
• Require GAO studies on NOAA’s fire weather services program
and an evaluation of interagency wildfire bodies, aiming to en-
hance coordination and efficiency.
• Require NOAA to conduct post-fire weather assessments to
identify gaps and improve future forecasts.
• Codify the Incident Meteorologist Service, addressing deploy-
ment compensation and ensuring on-site decision support dur-
ing extreme weather events.

ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 306 would authorize the appropriation of specific amounts for
each fiscal years from 2026 through 2030 for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a fire weath-
er services program to support wildfire forecasting, responsiveness,
and local collaborations.
Under the bill, NOAA would be required to:
• Develop modeling and data systems for fire weather pre-
dictions,
• Maintain a public website to promote the program’s services
and data,
• Award grants to non-federal entities for program development,
• Conduct pilot projects and research on unmanned systems for
fire weather observations,

• Establish an Incident Meteorologist Service within the Na-
tional Weather Service, and
• Report to the Congress on the program’s implementation.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).
TABLE 1.—ESTIMATED INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION UNDER S. 306

Authorization ............................................................................ 0 15 20 27 36 50 148
Estimated Outlays.................................................................... 0 4 12 18 26 35 95
Enacting the bill would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 over the 2025–2035 period.
CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted in 2025 and that the
authorized amounts will be provided in each year. Based on histor-
ical spending patterns, CBO estimates that implementing the bill
would cost $95 million over the 2025–2030 period and $51 million
after 2030.
The bill also would authorize additional premium pay in calendar
year 2025 for Department of Commerce employees involved in
emergency wildfire suppression and whose earnings, including pre-
mium pay, exceed a specified threshold. Under current law, em-
ployees can earn premium pay only to the extent that their com-
bined base and premium pay does not exceed the greater of the
GS–15 maximum or Executive Schedule Level V salary level. Be-
cause the additional pay would apply to work already completed,
that spending is treated as direct spending. Using information from
the Forest Service, CBO estimates that enacting S. 306 would in-
crease direct spending by less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030
period.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Kelly Durand. The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 306, as reported, would create a fire weather services program
and fire weather testbed. These programs would not impose any
new regulatory requirements and therefore would not subject any
individuals or businesses to new regulations. It would impact the
individuals who are included as covered employees under the De-
partments of Commerce, Agriculture, and Interior, and who per-
form the covered services of wildland firefighter, fire management
response official, incident meteorologist, or are on an incident man-
agement team by providing a waiver of limitations on pay for over-
time during calendar year 2025.

Economic Impact
S. 306, as reported, is not expected to have a negative impact on
the Nation’s economy. It would impact the individuals who are in-
cluded as covered employees under the Departments of Commerce,
Agriculture, and Interior and who perform the covered services of
wildland firefighter, fire management response official, incident
meteorologist, or are on an incident management team by pro-
viding a waiver of limitations on pay for overtime during calendar
year 2025. The bill aims to have an overall positive economic im-
pact by reducing the loss of lives and property to wildfires.
Privacy
S. 306, as reported, is not expected to impact the personal pri-
vacy of individuals.
Paperwork
S. 306, as reported, would require a slight increase in paperwork
burdens to Federal agencies. The bill would require the Under Sec-
retary to submit several plans and reports to Congress providing
details on the fire weather services program, incident meteorologist
workforce needs, and national weather service workforce support,
among others. It would also require the Under Secretary to conduct
a yearly post-fire season survey and assessment and make the as-
sessment publicly available. It would direct the newly established
Fire Science and Technology Working Group to submit a strategic
plan to Congress on interagency coordination, research, and devel-
opment. It would also direct the Comptroller General to submit to
Congress four reports regarding the fire weather services program,
interagency bodies’ activities and coordination, and the automated
surface observing system.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

seminate risk communications and wildfire forecasts. Program ac-
tivities would support research, develop smoke and air quality fore-
casts, and provide data and tools for fire response, hazard commu-
nication, and mitigation. The program would be required to ensure
parity of coverage for remote, isolated, and rural communities. To
develop and implement the program, NOAA would be required to
collaborate with relevant enterprises, academic institutions, Fed-
eral agencies, and local partners. It would allow NOAA to support
non-Federal entities under this Act by using existing authorities to
make funds available through grants, contracts, cooperative agree-
ments, and co-location agreements.
Section 4. Fire weather testbed.
This section would establish a fire weather testbed to accelerate
the research and implementation of new capabilities and tech-
nology for fire weather forecasting and support services. It would
also require a research and development program on the use of
uncrewed systems to improve data collection as well as implemen-
tation of pilot projects to test uncrewed systems for fire weather ob-
servations. The fire weather testbed would be required to conduct
additional pilot projects that include elements such as products
that detect fire from satellites. It would require annual reports to
Congress on the NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Re-
search projects that are closest to operationalization to describe re-
search that has transitioned into operations, including research at
the fire weather testbed.
Section 5. Data management and technology modernization.
This section would require that data which NOAA has the legal
right to distribute be open access. It would also require NOAA to
collaborate with Federal and non-Federal partners to promote
interoperability, usability, and accessibility of data as well as to le-
verage emerging technologies and commercial partnerships for
proper data management.
It would require that other Federal agencies consult the Under
Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (Under Sec-
retary) on development of impact-based decision support services
(e.g., forecasts and risk communication) and associated and related
technologies for fire-related activities as well as on systems to fore-
cast and model wildfire smoke.
This section would direct the Under Secretary to develop and
maintain a comprehensive, centralized, and publicly accessible fire
weather database to improve understanding and historical analysis
of wildfire and fire weather science and forecasts and to support
the archiving and preservation of wildfire and fire weather data.
The Under Secretary would be required to acquire high-perform-
ance computing resources and capacity to support data storage, re-
search, and operational capabilities.
Section 6. Surveys and assessments.
This section would require NOAA to conduct a yearly post-fire

assessment would be publicly available in a digital format. This
section would allow the Under Secretary to conduct surveys and as-
sessments of individual wildfire events. It would also require the
Under Secretary to brief Congress annually on the previous fire
season, the outlook for the following year’s fire season, and fire
weather forecasts.
This section would require the Under Secretary to collaborate
with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and
the Secretary of Defense to complete an assessment of the United
States automated surface observing system and the resources, per-
sonnel, and activities needed to maximize its functionality. The
Under Secretary would be required to implement a plan to address
findings of this assessment, and report to Congress on the assess-
ment and plan.
Section 7. Incident Meteorologist Service.
This section would codify the existing Incident Meteorologist
Service within the National Weather Service. The Incident Mete-
orologist Service would provide on-site decision support services
during extreme weather events and support seasonal planning and
pre-fire mitigation activities by emergency response agencies and
local stakeholders. The Under Secretary would provide resources
and training to support the emotional and mental health of employ-
ees who respond to high-impact and extreme fire weather events.
Section 8. Emergency response activities.
This section would define the terms ‘‘basic pay’’, ‘‘covered em-
ployee’’, ‘‘covered services’’, ‘‘premium pay’’, ‘‘relevant congressional
committees’’, and ‘‘Secretary concerned’’. This section would allow
Federal firefighters and IMETS to receive overtime compensation
when working on wildfire events and waive any premium pay or
overtime limitations for emergency response personnel and incident
meteorologists during long deployments for calendar year 2025.
This section would require the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary
of Agriculture, and Secretary of the Interior with the Office of Man-
agement and Budget and Office of Personnel Management to joint-
ly develop and implement a plan to ensure sufficient wildland fire-
fighters, fire management response officials, regional fire directors,
deputy regional fire directors, fire management officers, incident
meteorologists, or members of incident management teams are
available each fiscal year starting in fiscal year 2026.

States to submit to Congress the following reports:
• A report on the Fire Weather Services Program;
• A report on interagency bodies for wildfire forecasting, preven-
tion, planning, and management;
• A report on interagency coordination related to wildfires; and
• A report on the automated surface observing system.
Section 13. Cooperation and coordination.
This section would direct cooperation and coordination between
Federal agencies in carrying out this Act. It would authorize NOAA
to develop agreements with other Federal agencies and non-Federal
entities to improve fire weather services. This section would re-
quire that NOAA establish and submit to Congress an annual proc-
ess for coordinating with non-Federal partners to improve fire
weather services.
It would also authorize the Under Secretary to develop collabo-
rative relationships and agreements with foreign partners to ad-
dress transboundary issues pertaining to wildfires, fire weather,
smoke, air quality, and other hazards as appropriate. It also would
require the Under Secretary to consult with the Department of
State and other Federal partners as the Under Secretary considers
relevant.
