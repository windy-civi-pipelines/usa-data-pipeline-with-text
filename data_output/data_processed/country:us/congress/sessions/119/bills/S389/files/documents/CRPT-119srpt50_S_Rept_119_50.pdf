SETTING CONSUMER STANDARDS FOR LITHIUM-ION
BATTERIES ACT
JULY29, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 389]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 389) to establish consumer stand-
ards for lithium-ion batteries, having considered the same, reports
favorably thereon with an amendment and recommends that the
bill (as amended) do pass.1
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 389 is to protect consumers from the risk of
fires due to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries by requiring the
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to issue a consumer
product safety standard for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used
in micromobility devices, such as electric bicycles and scooters.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Lithium-ion batteries are used in various consumer devices, in-
cluding electric scooters and bicycles.2 As the number of electric bi-
cycles and scooters have increased, the number of lithium-ion bat-
1At the markup, S. 389 was ordered to be reported without amendment, but post-markup,
a technical amendment required the bill to be reported favorably with an amendment.

teries in circulation has increased. Lithium-ion batteries were
fitted to 75 percent of electric scooters in 2023.3
Defective lithium-ion batteries, which often do not meet recog-
nized industry safety standards, can overheat, catch fire, or ex-
plode.4 For example, in New York City, batteries caused over 250
fires in 2023, posing a safety risk not only to owners of the battery-
powered products, but anyone in close proximity.5 Since 2021, lith-
ium-ion battery fires have caused over 300 injuries and 29 deaths,
as well as damage to many structures.6 Fires caused by lithium-
ion batteries are especially difficult for fire departments to manage
because the batteries can quickly burst into flames.7 Their spread
is accelerated by the flammable and toxic gases they release, in-
cluding carbon monoxide and hydrogen fluoride.8 Fire departments
across the United States have conducted education campaigns
about batteries as an attempt to prevent and minimize the hazards
of lithium-ion battery fires.9
UL Solutions has established voluntary standards for lithium-ion
battery manufacturing; however, lower-cost imported devices—par-
ticularly from China—may not meet these standards.10 Less expen-
sive imported lithium-ion batteries that do not meet the UL stand-
ards typically are the cause of fires due to their lack of quality con-
trol in manufacturing.11
If manufactured safely according to UL standards, lithium-ion
batteries have a very low rate of failure.12 However, without a
standard, it can be difficult for consumers to ascertain the dif-
ference between poorly manufactured batteries that do not meet in-
dustry standards and safely manufactured batteries that do.13 Re-
quiring all lithium-ion batteries for micromobility devices—even
those imported into the United States—to meet CPSC-adopted
safety standards would ensure that all lithium-ion batteries avail-
able for consumer purchase meet a baseline level of safety.
This bill would require the CPSC to adopt three UL standards
for lithium-ion batteries as consumer product safety standards for

rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in micromobility devices,
such as electric scooters or bikes, in order to protect against fires.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 389 would do the following:
• Require the CPSC to adopt ANSI/CAN/UL 2271 (standard
for batteries for use in light electric vehicle application); ANSI/
CAN/UL 2849 (standard for safety for electrical systems for
ebikes); and ANSI/CAN/UL 2272 (standard for electrical sys-
tems for personal e-mobility devices) as consumer product safe-
ty standards for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in
micromobility devices, such as electric bikes and scooters.
• Require the CPSC to adopt ANSI/CAN/UL revisions unless
the CPSC determines that such revisions do not improve the
safety of the consumer product covered by the standard.
• Require the CPSC to submit a report to the Senate Com-
merce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee regarding fires, explosions, and other hazards relating
to lithium-ion batteries used in micromobility devices.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, was introduced on February 4, 2025, by Senator Gilli-
brand (for herself and Senators Blackburn, Fischer, and Schumer)
and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation of the Senate. On March 12, 2025, the Committee
met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 389
to be reported favorably without amendment. After the markup,
the bill had a technical amendment which required S. 389 to be re-
ported favorably with an amendment.
118th Congress
S. 1008, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, was introduced by Senator Gillibrand (for herself and
Senator Schumer) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On July 31,
2024, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice
vote, ordered S. 1008 to be reported favorably without amendment.
Senators Blackburn, Braun, and Tester became additional cospon-
sors.
H.R. 1797, a House companion bill, was introduced on March 24,
2023, by Representative Torres (for himself and Representatives
Garbarino, Clarke of NY, Ryan, Bowman, D’Esposito, Espaillat,
and Goldman) and was referred to the Committee on Energy and
Commerce of the House of Representatives. One Delegate and 14
Representatives became additional cosponsors. On December 6,
2023, that Committee met in open Executive Session, and H.R.
1797 was ordered to be reported, as amended, by a recorded vote
of 42–0. On May 15, 2024, the House passed H.R. 1797 under sus-
pension of the rules by a vote of 378–34.

Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On March 12, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
14 bills. This document provides estimates for 3 of those bills. One
bill, S. 414, was reported on June 24, 2205.
S. 289 would ban the sale of certain products covered by the Con-
sumer Product Safety Act and S. 389 would require the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to adopt voluntary safety
standards for lithium-ion batteries. S. 414 would require digital ad-
vertising platforms to report annually to the Federal Trade Com-
mission (FTC).
Estimated Federal cost: The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 370 (commerce and housing credit) and 550
(health).
Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that each bill
will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2025 and that the esti-
mated amounts will be available each year. The cost estimate does
not include any effects of interactions among the bills. If all three
bills were combined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the
effects could be different from the sum of the separate estimates,
although CBO expects that any differences would be small.
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, would ban the sale
of products containing 10 percent or more by weight of sodium ni-
trite that are covered under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The
legislation would not affect the sale or use of commercial or indus-
trial products not ordinarily intended for consumer use or con-
sumption.
Using information from the Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion, CBO estimates that implementing S. 289 would cost $2 mil-
lion over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated funds.

S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission
within 180 days of enactment, to adopt certain voluntary safety
standards—specifically ANSI/CAN/UL 2271, 2849, and 2272—con-
cerning rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric bicycles,
scooters, and other micromobility devices. The bill also would re-
quire the CPSC to determine the applicable scope of covered con-
sumer products and to monitor and evaluate future revisions to the
voluntary standards and report to the Congress within five years
of enactment.
Using information from the CPSC, CBO estimates that imple-
menting S. 389 would cost $8 million over the 2025–2030 period;
any related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, would require
certain digital advertising platforms to report annually to the Fed-
eral Trade Commission about advertising on their platforms for
certain mental health services, including information on the num-
ber, percent, and dollar value of such advertisements. Platforms
that would be affected by the bill include social media platforms,
public facing websites, online services, and mobile applications
with more than 100 million unique monthly users. The bill also
would require the FTC to report annually to the Congress summa-
rizing that data. CBO estimates that enacting S. 414 would cost
less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any related spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. None of the
bills would affect direct spending or revenues; thus, pay-as-you-go
procedures do not apply.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting S. 289, S. 389 and S. 414 would not increase
net direct spending or deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: All three bills would impose private-sector mandates
as defined in in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).
None of the bills would impose intergovernmental mandates.
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, would impose a pri-
vate-sector mandate as defined in UMRA by banning the sale of
consumer products containing 10 percent or more of sodium nitrite
by weight. The prohibition would not apply to industrial uses or to
food preservation. Because there is only a small market for con-
sumer products containing that much sodium nitrite and some
states already have curtailed the sale of products containing so-
dium nitrite, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would
not exceed the private-sector threshold established in UMRA ($206
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in
UMRA by requiring manufacturers of electric mobility devices, in-
cluding bicycles and scooters, to comply with a prospective Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission safety standard related to the
risk of fire in lithium-ion batteries. Based on voluntary compliance
with the specified standard by domestic manufacturers and current

state and local laws requiring compliance, CBO estimates that the
cost of the mandate would not exceed the annual private-sector
threshold established in UMRA ($206 million in 2025, adjusted an-
nually for inflation).
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, would require
certain digital advertising platforms to report to the FTC on their
public service advertisements for mental and behavioral health.
That requirement would impose a private-sector mandate as de-
fined by UMRA. CBO estimates the cost of the mandate would be
small and not exceed the threshold established in UMRA ($206
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation) because the man-
dated entities generally already possess or collect the information
required to be reported under the bill.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Cyrus Ekland (for the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission); Johnny Willing (for the Fed-
eral Trade Commission). Mandates: Andrew Laughlin (for the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission); Rachel Austin (for the Federal
Trade Commission).
Estimate reviewed by: Sean Dunbar, Chief, Low-Income Health
Programs and Prescription Drugs Cost Estimates Unit; Justin
Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Housing, and Education Cost Estimates
Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates
Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 389 requires the CPSC to promulgate a final consumer prod-
uct standard. It also requires manufacturers of micromobility prod-
ucts and lithium-ion batteries to adhere to these standards. There-
fore, the number of persons covered by this Act is approximately
equal to affected staff at the CPSC and producers of lithium-ion
batteries and micromobility devices.
Economic Impact
It is expected that this legislation will have some economic im-
pact. While it is possible that a safety standard could increase the
cost of batteries for some users of micromobility products, the risk
of fires will decrease, saving costs for consumers and cities. In New
York City alone, there were 268 fires in 2023.16
Privacy
S. 389 would not have a significant impact on the privacy rights
of individuals.

Paperwork
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work burdens for private individuals or businesses resulting from
the passage of this legislation. S. 389 would require the CPSC to
report to Congress regarding fires, explosions, and other hazards
relating to lithium-ion batteries used in micromobility products.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the Act may be cited as the ‘‘Set-
ting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act’’.
Section 2. Consumer product safety standard for certain batteries
This section would require the CPSC to promulgate a rulemaking
to adopt the following UL standards as mandatory safety standards
no later than 180 days after enactment to protect against the risk
of fires caused by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in micro-
mobility devices: (1) ANSI/CAN/UL 2271 (standard for batteries for
use in light electric vehicle applications); (2) ANSI/CAN/UL 2849
(standard for safety for electrical systems for ebikes); and (3) ANSI/
CAN/UL 2272 (standard for electrical systems for personal e-mobil-
ity devices).
This section would also require the CPSC to limit the application
of such mandatory standards adopted to consumer products as de-
fined by the Consumer Product Safety Act.
Further, this section would provide that in the event the stand-
ards adopted by the CPSC are revised, the organization that made
the revision must notify the CPSC. It would further provide that
the CPSC must then adopt the revision within 90 days of receiving
the notice unless it finds that the revision does not improve the
safety of the consumer product.
This section would clarify that any revisions to the standards
adopted by the CPSC are to be considered mandatory standards.
Finally, this section would require, no later than 5 years after
enactment, the CPSC to submit a report to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives
regarding fires, explosions, and other hazards relating to lithium-
ion batteries used in micromobility products. The report must note,
if known, the make and model of the lithium-ion battery that re-
sulted in the hazards, whether it complied with the standards in
this Act, and the manufacturer and country of manufacture.
