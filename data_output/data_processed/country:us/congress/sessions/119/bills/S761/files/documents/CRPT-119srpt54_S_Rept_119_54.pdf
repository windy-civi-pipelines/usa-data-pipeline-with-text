TRUTH AND HEALING COMMISSION ON INDIAN
BOARDING SCHOOL POLICIES ACT OF 2025
JULY31, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Ms. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Indian Affairs,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 761]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill
(S. 761) to establish the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian
Boarding School Policies in the United States, and for other pur-
poses, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with-
out amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE
To establish a Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Board-
ing School Policies (Commission) in the United States within the
legislative branch to formally investigate, document, and report on
the impacts and ongoing effects of Indian Boarding Schools Policies
on Native peoples; to develop recommendations for federal action
based on the findings of the Commission; and to promote healing
for the survivors, descendants, and communities affected by Indian
Boarding Schools.
BACKGROUND
Before European contact, Native peoples maintained unique edu-
cational systems rooted in community and designed to meet the
needs of their environments and cultures.1 The arrival of Euro-
peans to North America and the Pacific Islands ushered in an era
of attempted assimilation of Native peoples into European-Amer-

ican ways of life.2 Systemic attempts to eliminate Native lan-
guages, beliefs, and cultures, and end resistance to colonization,
began as early as the 17th and 18th centuries, with the founding
of some of the country’s oldest educational institutions.34
Assimilationist practices and policies through compelled edu-
cation were not limited to formal institutions. For example, in the
1780s, Russian fur trading companies in Alaska took Native boys
hostage, sent them to training schools, and forced them into ser-
vitude as navigators, interpreters, and seamen.5 In other cases,
training schools were founded by religious institutions and later
funded by the federal government. In 1878, Presbyterian mission-
aries established a day school in Sitka, Alaska, at a former military
barracks. The Sheldon Jackson School, so called after its founder,
sought to ‘‘house and educate . . . ‘with the intent to encourage
Native Americans to adopt Euro-American culture.’’’6 Jackson was
later named as the Department of the Interior’s first General Agent
of Education in Alaska in 1885, and in this position, created ‘‘con-
tract schools’’ in which the federal government contracted with reli-
gious missionary associations to establish schools in remote villages
across Alaska.7 Whether carried out in formal educational settings
or in day, industrial, training, contract, or other schools, the forced
‘‘education’’ of Native children has a long history in the United
States that implicates a number of institutions, including the fed-
eral government, all with the same mission: ‘‘kill the Indian in him,
and save the man.’’8
FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR FORCED ASSIMILATION THROUGH EDUCATION
OF NATIVE CHILDREN
By the early 1800s, the United States began a campaign of forced
assimilation under the guise of educating Native youth, formalizing
the practice after the War of 1812. In 1819, Congress passed the
Indian Civilization Fund Act to provide for federal oversight of the
education of Native peoples and to establish an annual ‘‘civilization

fund’’ of $10,000 per year for the purposes of converting them to
European ways of living, speaking, and acting.9 Most of these
funds were provided to churches and their mission schools;10 in
Hawai‘i, missionaries from the United States established day
schools and boarding schools primarily aimed at ‘‘civilizing’’ and
converting Native Hawaiians to Christianity.11 Over time, the fed-
eral government centralized administration of Indian educational
efforts under the Commission of Indian Affairs within the Depart-
ment of the Interior (DOI), the successor in jurisdiction to the De-
partment of War.12 By 1838, the federal government operated 16
manual training schools with approximately 800 Native students,
and 87 boarding schools with approximately 2,900 Native stu-
dents.13 The policies of these schools were rooted in a belief that
Native peoples were ‘‘barbarous and heathen . . . [and] ‘wedded to
savage habits, customs, and prejudices’’’ which could be ‘‘cured’’
through manual training and labor.14
Accordingly, in 1879, the federal government opened one of the
first off-reservation Indian boarding schools, the Carlisle Indian In-
dustrial School (Carlisle School), in an abandoned U.S. Army bar-
racks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.15 General Richard Henry Pratt, an
Army officer and founder of the Carlisle School, established a
‘‘rapid coercive assimilation’’ approach that became the model for
the federal Indian boarding school system, and required ‘‘severe
[military] discipline . . . to separate a child from his reservation
and family, strip him of tribal lore and mores, force the complete
abandonment of his native language, and prepare him in such a
way that he would never return to his people.’’16 General Pratt’s
approach at the Carlisle School was rooted in his experience with
American Indians held as prisoners of war at the Hampton Normal
and Agricultural Institute (Hampton School),17 which is regarded
as the nation’s first residential experiment in educating American
Indians as a means of preparing them for citizenship.18 The Hamp-
ton School’s founder, General Samuel C. Armstrong, was influenced
by his parents and other missionaries in Hawai‘i who were in-
volved in the education of Native Hawaiian children. Believing that

‘‘the Polynesian, like the Negro, suffered from a ‘deficiency of char-
acter,’’’19
General Armstrong modeled the Hampton School after the Hilo
Boys’ Boarding School in Hawai‘i, a missionary-run boarding school
established to primarily convert Native Hawaiians to Christianity
and, ultimately, ‘‘civilize’’ them through manual labor and train-
ing.20 The Hampton School continued as a boarding school for
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians until
1923.21
As mission-run boarding schools expanded their reach through-
out the country and to the Hawai‘i territory, in 1891 Congress au-
thorized the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to promulgate regula-
tions ‘‘to secure the attendance’’ of Indian children at such
schools.22 These regulations applied to all Indian children between
the ages of eight and eighteen (whether living on or off-reserva-
tion), permitted the use of law enforcement to compel attendance,
and authorized the withholding of clothes, rations, and other annu-
ities from non-compliant parents or guardians.23 Some Indians,
such as the Hopis in Arizona, opposed the forced education of their
children to the point that they were labeled ‘‘hostiles,’’ arrested,
and jailed at Alcatraz Island in California for nearly a year.24 The
overarching federal goal of compelled schooling was to reduce the
cost of fighting with Indian Tribes and, ultimately, dispossess them
of their homelands through the complete elimination of their lan-
guages, cultures, religions, and social bonds.25
Once at the schools, Native children were subject to systematic
violence, including corporal and psychological punishment such as
shaving heads to remove traditional hairstyles; confinement; flog-
ging and whipping for speaking a Native language or engaging in
other prohibited conduct; handcuffing; having older children punish
younger ones; sexual abuse; neglect; and malnourishment.26 In
some cases, children would be ‘‘lent’’ to nearby communities or ad-
jacent states to work as servants and farm laborers, in what were
commonly known as ‘‘outing programs.’’27 Placement at these
schools led to disease, death, and the fraying of Native languages,

cultural and religious practices, and social life;28 the physical and
psychological effects of these experiences created lasting intergen-
erational trauma for survivors and their families.29
Compounding such cruelty, official school policies (or in some
cases, simple geography) kept children and their parents and fami-
lies apart. In an 1886 report to the Secretary of the Interior, Indian
School Superintendent John B. Riley wrote, ‘‘[i]f it be admitted that
education affords the true solution to the Indian problem, then it
must be admitted that the boarding school is the very key to the
situation.’’30 Riley went on to say, ‘‘[o]nly by complete isolation of
the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfac-
torily educated . . . .’’31 Such techniques were also used by mis-
sion-run schools. For example, in 1887, an Alaska Native mother
sought a writ of habeas corpus to free her child from a government-
funded Presbyterian Boarding School in Sitka, Alaska. While the
judge allowed limited visitation, he required the child to stay at the
school, writing, ‘‘It is the experience of those who have been en-
gaged in these Indian schools that, to make them effectual as dis-
seminators of civilization, Indian children should, at a tender and
impressionable age, be entirely withdrawn from the camp, and
placed under the control of these schools. [Allowing parents to take
their children home] would render all efforts of both the govern-
ment and missions to civilize them abortive.’’32
According to DOI’s Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Re-
port Volume II, as of July 2024, the federal government supported
or operated at least 41733 Indian boarding schools between 1819
and 1969, across 37 states or then-territories.34 The total number
of Native children who attended these schools is unknown, but
many did not survive and their remains never returned home. The
Department of the Interior concluded that, based on available
records, 973 Indian child deaths were documented across the fed-
eral Indian boarding school system between 1819–1969, but ac-
knowledged that that number is much greater due to incomplete

FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO INDIAN EDUCATION37
The Problem of Indian Administration (Meriam Report)—1928
On June 12, 1926, Secretary of the Interior Huber Work commis-
sioned the Institute for Government Research, later renamed the
Brookings Institute, to conduct a comprehensive survey of Indian
affairs in the United States.38 The survey, named the ‘‘Meriam Re-
port’’ after its author, focused on a number of areas, including in-
dustrial, social, and medical activities, property rights, economic
conditions, and education of Indian peoples. The Meriam Report
compared these activities as carried out within the DOI’s Office of
Indian Services to similar programs implemented by other federal
agencies.
Generally, the Meriam Report exposed Interior’s ineffective and
inadequate oversight of Indian affairs, finding that ‘‘an over-
whelming majority of the Indians are poor, even extremely poor
. . .’’ and suffer from a ‘‘vicious circle of poverty. . . .’’39 On Indian
education, and boarding schools specifically, the Meriam Report
concluded that ‘‘the provisions for the care of the Indian children
in boarding schools are grossly inadequate,’’ and that ‘‘even at the
best schools these sources do not fully meet the requirements for
the health and development of the children. At the worst schools,
the situation is serious in the extreme.’’40 It specified four general
deficiencies in Indian education at the time: inappropriate peda-
gogy;41 lack of funds;42 lack of personnel;43 and lack of qualified
personnel.44 These findings provided a foundation for the passage
of the Johnson O’Malley Act45 and the Indian Self Determination
and Education Assistance Act of 1975, which expressed Congres-
sional intent to return Tribal control of, and expand self-determina-
tion in, the education of Native children with federal funds.46
Indian Education: A National Tragedy—A National Challenge
(Kennedy Report)—1969
In 1967, the United States Senate established the Special Sub-
committee on Indian Education within the Committee on Labor
and Public Welfare, and specifically authorized it to examine, in-

ate, respectively, conducted investigations into the state of Indian education in the United

the education of Indian children and related issues.47 For over two
years, the Subcommittee held hearings, conducted document-based
research, and traveled throughout Indian Country. Its final report,
known as the Kennedy Report, contained 60 recommendations and
concluded that Indian education was a failure and a ‘‘national trag-
edy.’’ The Kennedy Report led to enactment of the Indian Edu-
cation Act of 1972, landmark legislation that established the U.S.
Department of Education’s Office of Indian Education and the Na-
tional Advisory Council on Indian Education.48
EXECUTIVE ACTIONS REGARDING INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS
Department of the Interior Federal Indian Boarding School Initia-
tive
On June 22, 2021, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland di-
rected DOI, under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary—In-
dian Affairs, to investigate and prepare a report detailing the im-
pacts of the federal Indian Boarding School Policies that operated
between 1819 and 1969.49 The first volume of the investigative re-
port, released on May 11, 2022, documents and affirms that the
United States targeted American Indian, Alaska Native, and Na-
tive Hawaiian children as part of its assimilation and territorial
dispossession efforts.50 It presents evidence that the Federal Indian
Boarding School system engaged in systematic, militarized, and
identity-altering practices51 to culturally assimilate American In-
dian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children as a ‘‘cost sav-
ing’’ method to decrease the likelihood of war with Native nations
and ultimately dispossess them of their lands.52 In light of such
evidence, the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs recommended
inter alia that the DOI ‘‘renounce forced assimilation of Indian
Tribes, Alaska Native Villages, and the Native Hawaiian Commu-
nity as a legitimate policy objective,’’ as well as produce a second
report, with additional investigation that includes a full accounting
of federal support for the federal Indian Boarding School system.53
In 2023, Secretary Haaland and Assistant Secretary Newland con-
ducted a 12-stop ‘‘Road to Healing’’ listening tour in ten states to
acknowledge and address the historical trauma caused by federal
Indian Boarding Schools. Throughout the tour, survivors and de-
scendants shared personal accounts and testimonies of abuse, ne-
glect and cultural suppression. The U.S. Department of the Interior
released the second and final volume of its Federal Indian Board-
ing School Investigative Report on July 17, 2024. This final report
updated the number of federal Indian Boarding Schools to 417 in-
stitutions across 37 states or then-territories; documented at least

the operation of federal Indian Boarding School system and related
federal assimilation policies.54 The final report also provided rec-
ommendations to the federal government, which included calling
for an official apology.55 On October 25, 2024, President Biden
issued a formal apology for the U.S. government’s role in operating
Indian boarding schools, acknowledging the profound harm in-
flicted on Native communities over a 150-year period that stripped
Native children of their languages and cultures.56
TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION ACTIVITIES IN NORTH AMERICA
UNITED STATES
National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition
The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coali-
tion (NABS) was formed in 2011 to develop a national strategy to
raise public awareness of federal Indian Boarding School policies
and support healing for survivors, their families, and commu-
nities.57 Comprised of over 1,200 Native and non-Native members
and organizations, NABS conducts historic and contemporary re-
search and engages in public education and advocacy.
Notably, NABS maintains a first of its kind ‘‘National Indian
Boarding School Digital Archive’’ platform of digitized records and
collections documenting information related to Indian Boarding
Schools, as well as an interactive map showing the locations of
each of the 526 Indian Boarding Schools identified to date.58 NABS
also collaborates with organizations, including Canada’s National
Centre for Truth and Reconciliation and the National Indian Edu-
cation Association, to develop culturally-based curriculum for edu-
cators, and works with the American Indian College Fund to pro-
vide scholarships to descendants of former Indian Boarding School
students. And, through a grant from the DOI, NABS is building a
record of survivor testimony through an oral history project to doc-
ument the experiences of boarding school survivors and promote
healing.59

these policies, and to promote healing for survivors, families, and
communities that were affected.61
Maine-Wabanaki Truth and Reconciliation Commission
In 2012, the Wabanaki Confederacy62 and Maine Governor Paul
LePage signed a mandate establishing the first Tribal-State Truth
and Reconciliation Commission: the Maine-Wabanaki Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (MWTRC).63 The MWTRC’s purpose
was to address the high rates at which Indian children were being
removed from Indian homes and placed in foster care following en-
actment of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978.64 Between Feb-
ruary 2013 and June 2015, the MWTRC engaged in a truth-seeking
process by interviewing over 150 people and traveling to numerous
villages and communities to receive testimony. In June 2015, the
MWTRC published its final report, which included sixteen findings
and fourteen recommendations for future action.65
Alaska Native Heritage Center: Lach’qu Sukdu Research Program
In 2021, the Alaska Native Heritage Center (ANHC) created an
Indigenous-led research program, Lach’qu Sukdu (‘‘True Story’’ in
the Dena’ina language), to investigate the Alaska’s Indian boarding
schools and institutions, among other goals. Such research includes
identifying the scope of the system, location of schools and children
buried on these sites, and identification of children who were part
of the system. To date, Lach’qu Sukdu has identified over 100 sites
of former Indian boarding schools or institutions in Alaska.
ANHC’s Lach’qu Sukdu provides a place for Alaska Native peo-
ple to share information concerning assimilative boarding schools
in Alaska, increases access to information and education, supports
Alaska Native culture and heritage, and promotes healing through
the recognition of the history and impacts of assimilative boarding
schools. Lach’qu Sukdu is partnering with ecclesial institutions,
providing access to Alaska Native community members, and
leveraging research and curatorial staff to catalogue primary

Through these inputs and activities, Lach’qu Sukdu will promote
accurate representations of the Alaska Native experience of Fed-

tween Alaska Native communities and assimilative institutions.66
First Alaskans Institute—Alaska Truth, Racial Healing and Trans-
formation Movement
Starting in 2017, the First Alaskans Institute, in partnership
with Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation: Alaska, developed
a relational platform for transformation, including a network of ac-
countability partners to support efforts related to Indigenous lan-
guage education, transformation of public education, and the ad-
vancement of policies that center Alaska Native stewardship and
protect Alaska Native ways of being.67
The Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation: Alaska move-
ment incorporates the knowledge and vision of Alaska Native heal-
ers to foster healing and connectedness for thriving communities.68
In connection with this movement, the First Alaskans Institute
trained media outlets on racial equity, invited them to be account-
ability partners, and developed a ‘‘How We Heal Toolkit’’ to guide
healing and reconciliation processes.69 The toolkit is based on ad-
vice from traditional healers about how to prepare for truth telling
gatherings, including preparation of the gathering place, resources,
and participants; how to support participants as they go through
the truth telling process; and how to incorporate ancestral wisdom,
cultures, and traditions.
California Truth & Healing Council
In 2019, the State of California established the California Truth
& Healing Council to witness, record, and examine existing docu-
mentation of, and receive California Native American narratives
on, the historical relationship between California Native Americans
and the State, and to clarify the historical record of that relation-
ship in the spirit of truth and healing.70 The Council is led and
convened by the Governor’s Tribal Affairs Secretary—a position
currently held by an enrolled member of a California Tribe71—and
is governed by a Council of Tribal leaders representing Central,
Eastern, Northern, and Southern California.72
By 2025, the Council will submit a final written report of find-
ings that will reflect a holistic understanding of the historical rela-
tionship between California Native Americans and the State, may

Federal Reconciliation Efforts with the Native Hawaiian Commu-
nity
In 1993, on the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the King-
dom of Hawai‘i, the United States formally apologized and com-
mitted to a process of reconciliation with Native Hawaiians by ac-
knowledging its actions to usurp their sovereignty over land and
natural resources and their right to self-determination through the
overthrow and eventual annexation by the United States.74 A Joint
Resolution of Congress75 recognized that the overthrow resulted in
the suppression of Native Hawaiians’ ‘‘inherent sovereignty’’ and
deprived them of their ‘‘rights to self-determination’’ and that
‘‘long-range economic and social changes in Hawai‘i over the nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries have been devastating to the
population and to the health and well-being of the Hawaiian peo-
ple.’’76 It further recognized that ‘‘the Native Hawaiian people are
determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future genera-
tions their ancestral territory and their cultural identity in accord-
ance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, prac-
tices, language, and social institutions.’’77 In light of these findings,
Congress ‘‘express[ed] its commitment to acknowledge the ramifica-
tions of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai‘i, in order to pro-
vide a proper foundation for reconciliation between the United
States and the Native Hawaiian people.’’78
Accordingly, following a series of hearings and meetings with the
Native Hawaiian community in 1999, the DOI and Department of
Justice issued ‘‘From Mauka to Makai: The River of Justice Must
Flow Freely,’’ a report on the reconciliation process between the
federal government and Native Hawaiians. The report concluded
that ‘‘the past history of the United States-Native Hawaiian rela-
tions reveals many instances in which the United States actions
were less than honorable. Native Hawaiians continue to suffer the
effects of these actions, for which our Nation continues to have
moral responsibility,’’ and recommended that, ‘‘[f]or justice to be
served, past wrongs suffered by the Native Hawaiian people should
be addressed . . . through . . . efforts to promote the welfare of
the Native Hawaiian people, respect their rights, and address the
wrongs that their community has suffered . . . to ensure true rec-
onciliation.’’79

CANADA
Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission of
Canada
Like the United States, Canada has a centuries-long history of
boarding or ‘‘residential’’ schools that were established as part of a
larger policy of termination and assimilation of Native or First Na-
tions peoples.8081 Between at least the 1830s and the late 1990s,
Canadian residential schools directly affected approximately
150,000 children.
Following a series of class action lawsuits filed by residential
school survivors against the Canadian federal government, the Ca-
nadian federal government agreed to negotiate a settlement.82 The
Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement included a man-
date to create the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC), which had several goals to advance reconciliation through
community education, hearings, and policy actions.83
Between 2008 to 2015, the TRC received testimony from more
than 6,500 witnesses, including many survivors of residential
schools, hosted seven large national events to engage the Canadian
public in a process of education, conducted 238 days of local hear-
ings in 77 communities, and produced a six-volume report pro-
viding a historical overview of Canadian residential schools and
their legacy, as well as recommending a path to reconciliation with
94 action items.84
NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Indian Boarding Schools were part of a federally-sanctioned pol-
icy of forced assimilation, focused on erasing Native cultures, reli-
gions, languages and identities in the United States. The traumatic
effects of Indian Boarding School policies and practices on Native
communities are still felt by survivors, their descendants, and their
communities to the present day.85 While the Native American Lan-
guages Act of 1991 found that the United States initiated ‘‘acts of
suppression and extermination of Native American languages and
cultures,’’86 Congress has not fully acknowledged the U.S. govern-
ment’s role and responsibility for these past policies or formally es-

tablished a structured Native-led process for Native and non-Na-
tive communities to examine and heal from such policies.87
Further, while some non-profit organizations,88 religious institu-
tions,89 and the DOI have conducted investigations into the im-
pacts of Indian Boarding School policies, and some religious institu-
tions are beginning to acknowledge their role in carrying out these
policies and offering actions they can take to address those
harms,90 the federal government has yet to take comprehensive,
concerted action commensurate with the harms inflicted by its own
policies. Current public and private efforts to address this issue
cannot, by themselves, fully address the history or consequences of
federal Indian Boarding School policies without Congressional ac-
knowledgment and support.91 S. 761 provides for a thorough, na-
tionwide process warranted by the breadth and severity of the fed-
eral Indian Boarding School legacy.
SUMMARY
S. 761 reflects extensive bipartisan review, analysis, and debate
in three key areas related to the Commission and its advisory bod-
ies: (1) structure, (2) establishment, and (3) operation.
Structure and Timeline
S. 761 establishes a five-member Truth and Healing Commission
on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States, a 19-mem-
ber Native American Truth and Healing Advisory Committee, a 20-
member Federal and Religious Truth and Healing Advisory Com-
mittee, and a 15-member Survivors Truth and Healing Sub-
committee, with certain members of the Commission and Survivors
Subcommittee cross-appointed to leadership positions on the dif-
ferent advisory bodies (See Figure 1).

S. 761 limits the Commission’s investigation authority to six (6)
years and requires it to complete and publish a Final Report before
the end of that period. The bill also establishes a timeline for key
milestones for the work of the Commission and its various advisory
bodies. (See Figure 2).

working with existing Tribal advisory committees, as well as advo-
cates, religious institutions, and federal agencies regarding the
range of offices, entities, and individuals that would be necessary
for the Commission to efficiently and successfully exercise its du-
ties and responsibilities.92
Establishment
S. 761 requires candidates for all positions on the Commission,
the Survivors Truth and Healing Subcommittee, and the Native
American Truth and Healing Advisory Committee, to be nominated
by Native entities and peoples, and establishes a bipartisan and bi-
cameral Congressional process for appointing Commissioners.
Nominees to serve on the Commission shall represent significant
expertise in: (1) research; (2) Indigenous human rights; (3) Tribal
courts, restorative justice, and federal agencies; (4); trauma in-
formed care; or (5) cultural knowledge. The bill also establishes
deadlines for nominations and appointments, as well as publication
of an interim and final report to include related agency responses.
Membership and appointment to the Federal and Religious Truth
and Healing Advisory Committee shall be made pursuant to section
211(b) of S. 761.
Operation
S. 761 addresses the operation of the Commission and its advi-
sory bodies in four key areas—coordination, costs, investigation,
and healing.
Coordination
The Commission must coordinate with and consider the needs of
various stakeholders, including boarding school survivors and de-
scendants, Native communities, relevant organizations, and federal
agencies. The legislation facilitates such coordination through the
appointment of non-voting designees from the Advisory Committees
and Subcommittee to the Commission, and cross-appointment of
certain Commissioners and members of the Survivors Sub-
committee to leadership positions in various advisory committees
(See Figure 1).
In addition, the Commission may coordinate with federal entities
by requesting detailees, contracting with public agencies, utilizing
the Government Services Administration, exercising Buy Indian
Act authority, and engaging with various federal archiving and cu-
ratorial facilities. It may also utilize resources provided by Native
communities, individuals, churches, and other private organiza-
tions; and it may accept voluntary services from a range of sources,
including universities and law schools.
Costs
S. 761 authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 per fiscal year,
to remain available until expended, for the Commission to carry
out its work for six years, and permits the Commission to supple-

ment its funding through fundraising and donations from the pri-
vate and charitable sectors. The Committee developed this funding
framework through careful consideration of the costs associated
with past and contemporary examples of similar commissions, such
as the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the DOI’s
Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, and the California Truth
& Healing Council in California, among others. The Committee
also considered the broad scope of the Commission’s anticipated du-
ties, including public and private meetings with potentially tens of
thousands of individuals from all 50 states,93 directing research ac-
tivities involving over one hundred million pages of documents,94
and providing trauma-informed care to participants at convening.
Investigation
Obtaining information is core to the Commission’s investigatory
function and its duty to deliver written findings and recommenda-
tions to Congress. The Committee learned through extensive feed-
back from Tribal stakeholders and religious organizations that for
the Commission to accomplish the purposes of this Act and make
accurate recommendations, it must have tools and qualified staff to
properly collect, organize, and preserve information and items ob-
tained from witnesses, federal agencies, religious institutions, or
through other means while following federal law and regulations.95
To that end, the Commission is authorized to carry out domestic
and international archival research and may enter into contracts or
agreements with public agencies, private organizations, or individ-
uals as well as accept voluntary services from a range of sources,
including universities and law schools to locate, review, and ana-
lyze information related to Indian Boarding School policies. Al-
though S. 761 does not provide the Commission with subpoena au-
thority, it will have the assistance of the Federal and Religious
Truth and Healing Advisory Committee to help it obtain ‘‘all rel-
evant information’’ to the investigation the Commission is charged
with conducting.
Healing
The Commission fulfills its responsibility to promote healing in
three primary ways. First, the commission, itself, is a formal ac-
knowledgement of the widespread and long-term harm caused by
federal Indian Boarding School policies which is a foundational
step in healing for survivors, their descendants and Native commu-

of testimony from over 6,000 individuals to address 139 boarding schools. Given the 526 known
boarding schools in the United States, the Commission is expected to receive approximately four
times the amount of testimony.s
94U.S. DEP’TOFTHEINTERIOR, FEDERALINDIANBOARDINGSCHOOLINITIATIVEINVESTIGATIVE

Records Repository alone, not accounting for the additional eight million pages believed to be
within the current and former boarding schools’ possession, custody, or control.
95For example, delayed information resulted in the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Com-
mission’s final report inaccurately citing a total of 6,000 child deaths at Canadian Residential
Schools, when, almost 10 years later, and because of untimely obtained information, the number
is better understood to be between 10,000 and 25,000. Additionally, the discovery of 215 children
buried in a mass grave in Kamloops, Canada was made after the conclusion of the Canadian

EXECUTIVE TESTIMONY AND COMMUNICATIONS
Testimony provided by the Department of the Interior at the
June 22, 2022, hearing on S. 2907, similar legislation introduced in
the 117th Congress follows:
STATEMENT OF DEB HAALAND
SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE IN-
TERIOR BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AF-
FAIRS
Hello and good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair-
man Murkowski, and members of the Committee. My
name is Deb Haaland, and I serve as the Secretary of the
Interior. It is an honor and privilege for me to be here with
you today to represent the Department of the Interior (De-
partment) and our tens of thousands of dedicated profes-
sionals. It is deeply meaningful for me to speak to you
from the ancestral homelands of the Anacostan and
Piscataway people. Thank you for the opportunity to
present the Department’s testimony at this important
oversight hearing on the Federal Indian Boarding School
Initiative and S. 2907, a bill to establish the Truth and
Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in
the United States.
The Biden-Harris administration is determined to make
a lasting positive difference in response to the trauma that
these policies have caused, not just in the past but for cur-
rent generations. I would also like to thank Senator War-
ren and the Co-chairs of the Congressional Native Amer-
ican Caucus, Representatives Sharice Davids and Tom
Cole, for prioritizing legislation to address the federal In-
dian boarding school policies for the first time in United
States history and find solutions to further shed light on
its ongoing impacts on Native American and Native Ha-
waiian people.
Starting in 1819, and lasting for over a century and a
half, the federal government, including the Department of
the Interior, forcibly removed and assimilated tens of thou-

sands of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Ha-
waiian children from tribal communities across the United
States. Many children who entered the boarding schools
were involuntarily removed from their communities and
never returned home. This intentional targeting and re-
moval of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Ha-
waiian children to achieve the goal of forced assimilation
of Native people was both traumatic and violent.
The consequences of federal Indian boarding school poli-
cies—including the intergenerational trauma caused by
forced family separation and cultural eradication—were in-
flicted on generations of children as young as 4 years old
and are heartbreaking and undeniable. As the head of the
Department of the Interior and as the first Native Amer-
ican cabinet secretary, I am in a unique position to ad-
dress the lasting impacts of these policies. I now have di-
rect oversight over the very Department that operated and
oversaw the implementation of the federal Indian boarding
school system.
Like all Native people, I am a product of these horrific
assimilation era policies, as my grandparents were re-
moved from their families to federal Indian boarding
schools when they were only 8 years old and forced to live
away from their parents, culture, and Pueblos until they
were 13 years old. My family’s story is similar to many In-
digenous families’ stories in this country which is why, on
June 22, 2021, I announced the Federal Indian Boarding
School Initiative, a comprehensive effort to address the
troubled legacy of federal Indian boarding school policies.
On that same date, through a memorandum, I directed the
Assistant Secretary —Indian Affairs to lead the first-ever
departmental investigation into the federal Indian board-
ing school system.
I am incredibly proud of the work that Assistant Sec-
retary Newland and his entire team did on the first vol-
ume of this report. I particularly want to acknowledge the
staff at the Bureau of Trust Funds Administration, which
is managing the document collection, review, and records
management of this Initiative. The vast majority of the
work being released today was done by Indigenous staff in
this department who worked through their own trauma
and pain.
The Department released Volume 1 of the investigative
report on May 11, 2022. This report lays the groundwork
for the continued efforts of the Department to address the
intergenerational trauma created by historical federal pol-
icy. It marks the first time in over two hundred years,
since the Indian boarding school policies were imple-
mented, that the United States has formally reviewed or
acknowledged the extensive scope and breadth of these
policies. The Department welcomes Congress’ and this
Committee’s engagement in this important and continuing
effort.
The Department’s investigation focuses on the historical
Indian boarding school system, which was implemented to

further cultural assimilation and removal policies. The De-
partment fully recognizes that unlike the federal Indian
boarding school system we are investigating, contemporary
Native residential schools are vital to advancing modern,
culturally sensitive education.
Some key highlights of Volume 1 of the Department’s in-
vestigation of our federal records include evidence that the
United States targeted American Indian, Alaska Native,
and Native Hawaiian children through forced removal to
Indian boarding schools in furtherance of territorial dis-
possession of Indigenous lands in the United States. The
initial investigation shows that, between 1819 and 1969,
the federal Indian boarding school system consisted of 408
federal Indian boarding schools across 37 states or then-
territories, including 21 schools in Alaska and 7 schools in
Hawai‘i.103
Additionally, the Department’s initial investigation re-
sults show that approximately 50 percent of federal Indian
boarding schools may have received support or involve-
ment from a religious institution or organization, including
funding,104 infrastructure, and personnel. Further, the fed-
eral government at times paid religious institutions and
organizations for Native children to enter federal Indian
boarding schools that these institutions and organizations
operated.
Another important finding published in Volume 1 identi-
fies approximately 53 different schools that contain
marked or unmarked burial sites. While this report lays
the groundwork for the efforts of the Department to ad-
dress the full scope of the federal Indian boarding school
policies and the intergenerational trauma endured by In-
digenous peoples in this country, the Department is mov-
ing forward to develop Volume 2 to further expand on
these preliminary report findings. As the investigation con-
tinues, we expect the number of identified burial sites to
increase, along with the potential expansion or more defi-
nite numbers of identified Indian boarding school sites,
children, and operating dates of facilities.
As we add to the list of burial sites, the Department,
working with relevant sister federal agencies, will expand
our collaborative work, including increasing Tribal commu-
nities’ access to mental health resources. These healing ac-
tions will help strengthen Native communities in a man-
ner that I hope will be pursuant to each of the various tra-
ditional and religious protocols and beliefs. This effort may
include disinterment, repatriation, documentation, and me-
morial efforts, where appropriate, in consultation with In-
dian Tribes, Alaska Native Villages, and the Native Ha-
waiian Community.
103Some individual federal Indian boarding schools accounted for multiple sites. The 408 fed-
eral Indian boarding schools includes 431 separate sites.
104As the U.S. Senate has recognized, funds from the 1819 Civilization Fund ‘‘were appor-
tioned among those societies and individuals—usually missionary organizations—that had been
prominent in the effort to ‘civilize’ the Indians.’’

The Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative con-
stitutes the first time the federal government has reviewed
the scope of these policies. This is an important step for in-
tergenerational healing from the ongoing effects these poli-
cies caused, and we will take an all-of-government ap-
proach. I believe that our obligations to Native commu-
nities mean that federal policies should fully support and
revitalize Native health care, education, Native languages,
and cultural practices that prior federal Indian policies,
like those supporting Indian boarding schools, sought to
destroy. We can heal from the harm and violence caused
by Indian assimilation by effecting government wide poli-
cies of revitalization for the Indigenous people of our coun-
try.
I recently announced that we will embark on the ‘‘Road
to Healing,’’ a tour throughout the nation to hear directly
from survivors of federal Indian boarding schools and their
descendants about their experiences. A necessary part of
this journey will be to connect survivors and their families
with mental health support, and to create a permanent
collection of oral histories. We know this won’t be easy, but
it is a history that we must learn from if we are to heal
from this tragic era in our country.
As part of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative,
I look forward to continuing our work alongside sister fed-
eral agencies that administer the sites of former Indian
boarding schools or possess or control records pertaining to
the federal Indian boarding school system and those that
currently provide medical and mental health services for
Native communities. I am confident that, together, we can
support the individuals and communities that have been
shaped by detrimental federal Indian boarding school poli-
cies.
I am proud of the work the Department is accomplishing
to confront its role in these assimilation policies through
education and am deeply grateful to Congress for its sup-
port as well. In particular, the Department appreciates the
$7 million in funding provided for this work in Fiscal Year
2022, and we look forward to working with Congress on
our Fiscal Year 2023 request of an additional $7 million.
These funds are crucial in order for this work to be thor-
ough and effective, in particular the labor-intensive work
of gathering and examining records and identifying and
characterizing various sites.
This funding will enable the Department to help expand
existing school profiles following Volume 1 of the report,
including detailing the number of children that attended
federal Indian boarding schools; identifying marked and
unmarked burial sites; identifying interred children, where
possible; and detailing the amount of federal support for
the system including support to non-federal entities.

S. 2907—A Bill to Establish the Truth and Healing Com-
mission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the
United States
I am grateful for the Committee’s leadership in also con-
sidering S. 2907 as part of this hearing. This legislation,
which I led with my colleagues when I served in the U.S.
House of Representatives, would establish a Truth and
Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in
the United States. The Commission would be required to
investigate the impacts and ongoing effects of the Indian
Boarding School Policies where Native children were forc-
ibly removed from their homes. The Commission would be
directed to develop recommendations on: (1) how to protect
unmarked graves and accompanying land protections; (2)
support repatriation and identify the Tribal Nations from
which children were taken; and (3) to prevent the contin-
ued removal of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Na-
tive Hawaiian children from their families and Native
communities under modern-day assimilation practices car-
ried out by State social service departments, foster care
agencies, and adoption services.
The Administration strongly supports this legislation,
especially the development of national survivor resources
to address intergenerational trauma, and the inclusion of
the Commission’s formal investigation and documentation
practices. In addition to our support, we would welcome an
opportunity to work with the Committee, especially on ac-
cess to records pertaining to the federal Indian boarding
school system under the control of non-federal entities as
set forth in the legislation to supplement the Department’s
Initiative.
Conclusion
Some of the most influential decisions by the Depart-
ment on the lives of American Indian, Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian children involve those related to federal
Indian boarding schools. That is part of America’s story
that we must tell. While we cannot change that history, I
believe that our nation will benefit from a full under-
standing of the truth of what took place and a focus on
healing the wounds of the past. I am grateful for your
work to help address the atrocities that Indian boarding
school survivors and families have endured for decades.
Thank you again for your focus on the Federal Indian
Boarding School Initiative and consideration of S. 2907. I
am confident that, together, we can start to help Tribal
communities to heal and strengthen Indian Country and
the Native Hawaiian Community now and for future gen-
erations.
