Merit Personnel Act of 1978 (sec. 1–617.08, D.C. Official Code), as amended by sec-
tion 116(b) of the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of

SUMMARY AND PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
H.R. 2096 amends the D.C. Government Comprehensive Merit
Personnel Act of 1978 to repeal two amendments recently made by
the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of
2022 (D.C. Law 24–345), including the ability of the Metro Police
Department (MPD) officer union to bargain on matters of officer
discipline, removal of a strict timeline under which such discipline
must be carried out for alleged wrongdoing, and the creation of a
public website announcing the schedule of adverse action hearings
for officers.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 2096 would overturn certain provisions in the Comprehen-
sive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022, which
was passed by the D.C. Council on January 4, 2023. In the 118th
Congress, in response to the Comprehensive Policing and Justice
Reform Amendment Act of 2022, the Congress voted in a bipartisan
fashion to pass H.J. Res. 42, a resolution of disapproval of the
Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act. H.J.
Res. 42 was then vetoed by President Biden. Additionally, in the
118th Congress, a bill identical to H.R. 2096 was passed out of the
Committee on Oversight and Accountability by a vote of 22–19.
Local D.C. residents are aware of this and have held community
meetings to discuss crime, particularly carjackings.1 Crime is also
occurring right outside of Federal government buildings.2 On
March 21, 2025, a D.C. violence interrupter (a group of individuals
serving as alternatives to traditional police charged with curbing
crime in the District) was himself arrested for first degree murder
in a D.C. shooting—an occurrence that calls into serious question
the viability of local government alternatives to traditional polic-

ing.3 It is clear that the District of Columbia needs more police offi-
cers on the streets. D.C.’s businesses recognize the seriousness of
the rising crime and have responded by either closing their doors
or relocating to safer regions. In 2024, the District of Columbia saw
the highest number of restaurant closings in its history.4
Meanwhile, the D.C. Council has chosen to attack their own po-
lice force, singling out the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)
as the only major police union with restrictions on it its ability to
bargain on disciplinary matters. H.R. 2096 would restore D.C. po-
lice officers’ collective bargaining rights by restoring their ability to
negotiate matters pertaining to officer discipline through the collec-
tive bargaining process. Next, it would restore the requirement for
claims against MPD members or civilian employees of MPD be
timely, as prolonged investigations can represent its own form of
additional punishment to officers. Finally, it would remove the re-
quirement for D.C. to publicly disclose the time and location of offi-
cers’ adverse actions hearings.
D.C. cannot afford to lose any more officers while combatting ris-
ing crime and keeping D.C. residents safe. It is the Committee’s po-
sition that these policies must be reinstated in D.C. Code in order
to preserve the MPD’s ability to recruit and retain officers.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
The short title is the ‘‘Protecting Our Nation’s Capital Emer-
gency Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Restoration of equitable and fair treatment of law en-
forcement personnel of District of Columbia
Subsection (a) restores the D.C. law enforcement officers’ right to
collectively bargain on matters pertaining to discipline. Subsection
(b) restores the requirement for timely disciplinary actions regard-
ing claims against members or civilian employees of MPD. The sub-
section also removes the requirement for a public website to pro-
vide the time and place for adverse action hearings against officers.

MINORITY VIEWS
Committee Democrats strongly oppose H.R. 2096, which would
repeal provisions of a law duly enacted by the District of Columbia
(D.C.), because we strongly support local D.C. self-government.
DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY IN D.C.
The principles of no taxation without representation and consent
of the governed helped launch the American Revolution and are en-
shrined in the Declaration of Independence. Yet, D.C. residents,
who pay all federal taxes, have no voting representation in Con-
gress, and Congress has plenary authority over D.C.1
The Majority claims Congress has a constitutional duty to legis-
late on local D.C. matters. That is false, and Republicans choose to
legislate on local D.C. matters when they think they can score po-
litical points.
Despite giving Congress plenary authority over D.C., the Fram-
ers expected Congress to establish a local government for D.C.2 In-
deed, Congress has established various forms of local government
for D.C. since 1802.3 The Supreme Court has held that ‘‘there is
no constitutional barrier to the delegation by Congress to the Dis-
trict of Columbia of full legislative power.’’4
In 1973, Congress passed the D.C. Home Rule Act, which estab-
lished an elected chief executive (the D.C. Mayor) and an elected
legislature (the D.C. Council) for D.C.5 The purpose of the D.C.
Home Rule Act is to, among other things, ‘‘grant to the inhabitants
of the District of Columbia powers of local self-government’’ and
‘‘relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon essentially local
District matters.’’6 H.R. 2096 contravenes the purpose of the D.C.
Home Rule Act. Both D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C.
Council oppose H.R. 2096.7
POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY
The merits of H.R. 2096 are beside the point, because we support
D.C. home rule, but we will address them nonetheless. Police offi-
cers are entrusted with extraordinary authority to protect public
1U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17.

safety. The vast majority of police officers exercise that authority
honorably and bravely. However, there must be accountability and
transparency for instances in which police officers violate their
oath of office.
Following the devastating murder of George Floyd, D.C. enacted
the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of
2022 (CPJRAA), which, in pertinent part, made it easier for the po-
lice department to discipline police officers for violating their oath
of office. H.R. 2096 would repeal police officer discipline provisions
in the CPJRAA.
H.R. 2096, as introduced, includes a purpose section. According
to the introduced version of H.R. 2096, the purpose of the bill is
‘‘to combat the rise in violent crime in our Nation’s Capital by
eliminating policies which place law enforcement personnel of the
District of Columbia at risk and discourage them from serving, en-
suring that such personnel will be treated equitably and fairly and
the recruitment and retention of such personnel shall be in-
creased.’’ We are not surprised that H.R. 2096, as ordered to be re-
ported, does not include that purpose section, since it is inaccurate.
Violent crime is not rising in D.C. In 2025, violent crime in D.C.
is down 22%, compared to the same period in 2024.8 In 2024, vio-
lent crime in D.C. was the lowest in over 30 years.9
The D.C. police department is not alone in having difficulty re-
cruiting and retaining police officers. Police departments across the
country are having difficulty with recruitment and retention, and
this difficulty predates the police accountability and transparency
legislation enacted across the country in the aftermath of the mur-
der of George Floyd.10 A survey conducted in 2019 found that ‘‘the
challenge of recruiting law enforcement is widespread and affects
agencies of all types, sizes, and locations across the United
States.’’11 That survey also found that ‘‘the difficulty in recruiting
law enforcement officers and employees is not due to one particular
cause. Rather, multiple social, political, and economic forces are all
simultaneously at play.’’12
The actual purpose of H.R. 2096 is to make it harder for the po-
lice department to discipline police officers who violate their oath
of office. Before the CPJRAA, the police department had been
forced to rehire a significant number of police officers it had fired
for crimes and official misconduct.13 D.C. also had to provide mil-
lions of dollars in back pay to police officers it was forced to rehire,

and D.C. paid millions of dollars to resolve claims alleging police
officer misconduct.14
H.R. 2096 would repeal four police officer discipline provisions in
the CPJRAA.
First, H.R. 2096 would repeal a provision that removed police of-
ficer discipline from collective bargaining. Several states, including
states represented by Republican Members of the Committee, pro-
hibit collective bargaining by police officers.15 The CPJRAA main-
tained the right of police officers to collectively bargain, except over
discipline, and maintains the civil service protections and due proc-
ess rights of police officers.
Collective bargaining by police officers has been widely criticized
for protecting police officers from discipline for crimes and official
misconduct. A Republican staff report for the Joint Economic Com-
mittee said that ‘‘[c]ollective bargaining plays a significant role in
shielding police officers from the consequences of their mis-
conduct.’’16 A law review article conducted an empirical examina-
tion of police union contracts, concluding, ‘‘This [a]rticle’s findings
are consistent with the hypothesis that police union contracts
sometimes establish problematic internal disciplinary procedures
that serve as barriers to accountability.’’17
Second, H.R. 2096 would reinstate a 90-day statute of limitations
on the police department to commence discipline. The CPJRAA re-
pealed that provision because 90 days was not enough time in some
cases to commence discipline. Adjudicators had overturned dis-
cipline in some cases because the police department had exceeded
90 days to commence discipline, and there is no statute of limita-
tions for commencing discipline against most other D.C. govern-
ment employees.18 The home state of Rep. Andrew Garbarino, the
sponsor of H.R. 2096, has an 18-month statute of limitations to
commence discipline against police officers.19
Third, H.R. 2096 would repeal a provision that gave the police
chief the authority to increase the discipline proposed by a police
trial board, which consists of police officers. Before the CPJRAA,
the police chief could only impose or reduce the proposed discipline
or order a new trial. The CPJRAA increased the discipline power
of the police chief and reduced the discipline power of the police
trial board, which may be more inclined to protect their fellow po-
lice officers from discipline.20

Finally, H.R. 2096 would repeal a provision that required the po-
lice department to publish on a public website a schedule of police
officer discipline hearings, which are open to the public.
CONCLUSION
We strongly oppose H.R. 2096 and any other effort to undermine
the will of D.C. residents and their locally elected representatives.
Instead of interfering in local D.C. matters, Congress should grant
D.C.’s statehood petition.
STEPHEN F. LYNCH,
Acting Ranking Member.
