amounts in Public Law 119–4, the Full-Year Continuing Appropria-
tions and Extensions Act, 2025.
MULTI-AGENCY DIRECTIVES
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.—The Committee is
concerned about the crisis of missing, trafficked, and murdered in-
digenous women that has plagued Native communities. Native
American women face high rates of violence and the lack of data
on the number of women and girls who go missing or murdered
further complicates the Nation’s ability to address this crisis. The
bill includes both funding and directives under the Bureau of In-
(4)
5
dian Affairs and the Indian Health Service in order to improve the
Federal response to this epidemic.
Budgetary Treatment of Contract Support Costs and 105(l) Tribal
Leases.—Due to findings in the Supreme Court decisions (see Sala-
zar v. Ramah (132 S. Ct. 2181 (2012)) and Maniilaq Ass’n v.
Burwell in both 2014 (72 F. Supp. 3d 227 (D.D.C. 2014)) and 2016
(70 F. Supp. 3d 243 (D.D.C. 2016))), payments for contract support
costs and 105(l) leases appear to create a type of budgetary entitle-
ment that is typically not funded through discretionary appropria-
tions. For contract support costs, the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act [ISDEAA] of 1975 requires the gov-
ernment to enter into contracts and leases with any willing Tribe
and requires that the government pay a Tribe’s costs. Section 105(l)
of the ISDEAA requires the Secretary, at the request of a Tribe,
to enter into a lease with the Tribe for a building used to provide
services under the ISDEAA. Reclassification of these costs from a
discretionary appropriation to a mandatory appropriated entitle-
ment has been under discussion since the Supreme Court issued its
decision in 2012.
Deferred Maintenance.—The Committee has made a concerted ef-
fort in recent years to address the backlog maintenance needs on
our public lands and in Bureau of Indian Education Schools
through the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration
Fund [Fund], as authorized in The Great American Outdoors Act
(Public Law 116–152) [GAOA] The Fund’s authorization expired in
fiscal year 2025. The Committee notes that the Interior Appropria-
tions Bill alone is not sufficient to meet the construction needs of
BIE schools and public land infrastructure. The Committee looks
forward to the prompt reauthorization of the Fund to continue to
address the deferred maintenance backlog needs on our public
lands and in Bureau of Indian Education schools.
The Committee is concerned that the Department has delayed
the disbursement of funds for Legacy Restoration Fund projects on
the fiscal year 2025 list. The Committee urges the disbursement of
these funds in a timely manner.
Disaster Recovery Needs.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the other agencies funded in this bill to
continue quarterly reporting requirements for their component bu-
reaus, regions, offices, and programs, as appropriate, to maintain
up-to-date comprehensive information for funding needs related to
disaster recovery, which shall be delivered to the Committee within
30 days of a quarter closing and shall also be updated and provided
at other points in time when the Committee requests such an up-
date.
Land Grants, Acequias and Community Ditches.—The Secre-
taries of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Ag-
riculture are urged to recognize the traditional use of State-recog-
nized community land grants, acequias, and community ditches in
the American Southwest during the land use planning process. The
Department of the Interior and the Forest Service shall, in accord-
ance with applicable law, consider and, as appropriate, provide for
within land management plans the traditional-historic uses by an
acequias or land grant mercedes recognized by the State of New
Mexico.
6
Training, Hiring, and Public Lands Education in Alaska.—The
directive in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
116–94 regarding hiring and conducting annual Alaska National
Interest Lands Conservation Act training by the Department of the
Interior and the Forest Service is continued. The Committee also
recognizes the importance of Alaska Public Land Information Cen-
ters as partners and tools to educate the public regarding Alaska’s
unique public lands and encourages the agencies to look for oppor-
tunities to strengthen these critical partnerships.
Transparency of Information.—Federal agencies funded under
this act shall clearly state within the text, audio, or video used for
advertising or educational purposes, including emails or Internet
postings, that the communication is printed, published, or produced
and disseminated at U.S. taxpayer expense. The funds used by a
Federal agency to carry out this requirement shall be derived from
amounts made available to the agency for advertising or other com-
munications regarding the programs and activities of the agency.
Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.—All reports, correspond-
ence, and reprogramming requests from the agencies to the Com-
mittee shall be provided electronically, in addition to any that are
required to be delivered in physical formats.
Quarterly Report on Reporting Requirements.—Within 90 days of
enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, the Committee di-
rects the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agri-
culture, and the Environmental Protection Agency to each provide
a quarterly report to the Committee outlining the status of the re-
porting requirements outlined within this report.
Beavers and Aquatic Habitat.—The Committee notes that bea-
vers are an important native species across North America, and are
a well-known ecosystem engineer with the ability to create new
wetlands and improve habitats for a wide array of other species.
Federal land managers are encouraged to work with state wildlife
managers on beaver conservation, to make planning decisions that
recognize beavers’ environmental and ecological benefits, and to
identify locations where restoration of their habitat may be most
beneficial.
Valles Caldera National Preserve.—The Committee is concerned
about the presence of illegal trespass cattle from the Santa Fe Na-
tional Forest on the Valles Caldera National Preserve in violation
of the Preserve’s authorizing statute and National Park Service
policy. The Committee appreciates the Forest Service and the Na-
tional Park Service establishing a formal written agreement on
funding, fence maintenance responsibilities, cattle incursion re-
sponse, law enforcement efforts, and a pilot program to test the use
of virtual fencing to keep cattle excluded from the Preserve. The
Committee directs the Services to jointly brief the Committee on
the plan to fund the long-term maintenance of the fence after its
construction, within 90 days of enactment of this act.
Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act.—The Committee
continues to direct the Department of the Interior and the Forest
Service to annually post on a centralized agency website the list of
Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act [FLREA] (Public Law
108–447) projects and activities performed in each fiscal year,
which should include a project or activity title, description, location,
7
and amount obligated, beginning with fiscal year 2024 as prac-
ticable. The Committee awaits a report from each land manage-
ment agency that is unable to complete this directive. Such report
shall detail the specific steps the agency plans to take to secure the
capabilities needed to provide proper transparency on the spending
of FLREA funds.
Workforce Housing on Public Lands.—Across the country, the
rise in short-term vacation rentals, particularly at popular travel
destinations has further decreased the availability and affordability
of housing in communities near national parks and other Federal
lands. This has created a crisis in public lands staffing access to
adequate housing facilities is a key component of attracting and re-
taining a qualified workforce. For example, the Committee under-
stands that seasonal employees are often forced to turn down per-
manent employment because they would lose the temporary hous-
ing provided to some seasonal employees. The Department of the
Interior and the Forest Service are directed to continue to prioritize
expanding housing availability and to work with the Committee to
ensure it understands what resources are needed to achieve this.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act, the Department of the In-
terior and the Forest Service shall each provide briefings to the
Committee detailing current housing needs and ongoing impacts.
Further, within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department
of the Interior and the Forest Service shall each provide the Com-
mittee with a housing needs assessment for employees who live
both in government quarters and in the local community, including
what Federal funding and potential legislative changes would help
Federal employees find and pay for adequate housing.
Technological Innovation in Land Management.—To enhance the
capabilities of Federal agencies responsible for wildfire manage-
ment, including the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest
Service, the Committee encourages these agencies to explore inno-
vative private-public partnerships capable of large data collection
through beyond-line-of-sight, unmanned aerial platforms, coupled
with the use of artificial intelligence [AI] in predicting and miti-
gating wildfire hazards. The Committee recognizes the potential of
AI-driven technologies to improve predictive modeling, risk assess-
ment, and resource allocation for wildfire prevention and response,
thus strengthening wildfire management strategies. The Com-
mittee directs the agencies to report within 180 days of the enact-
ment of this act on their progress in exploring and implementing
such partnerships.
Federal Trust, Federal Obligations, and Treaty Responsibilities.—
The Committee reminds agencies funded by this act of their obliga-
tion to uphold the Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to
Tribes and Federal obligations to the Native Hawaiian Community.
This includes upholding treaty and reserved rights, and any other
rights and obligations under Federal law; supporting self-deter-
mination efforts by Native communities; fulfilling obligations under
Presidential Memoranda and Executive Orders; and conducting
early and robust government-to-government consultation with
Tribes, and meaningful outreach and engagement with Native Ha-
waiians.
8
Consultation with Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corpora-
tions.—The Committee stresses the importance of all Federal agen-
cies conducting meaningful consultation with Tribes, as directed
under Executive Order 13175, with regard to Federal programs and
actions and notes that Public Law 108–199 at section 161, and
Public Law 108–447 at section 518 require that all Federal agen-
cies must consult with Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of
1971 [ANCSA] Corporations on the same basis as Indian Tribes
under Executive Order 13175. Accordingly, the Committee reminds
all Federal agencies of the law with respect to consultation and ex-
pects that all Federal agencies will meaningfully consult with In-
dian Tribes and ANCSA corporations on the same basis.
Streamlining Tribal Water Funding.—The Committee directs the
Department, in coordination with the Indian Health Service, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal agencies to,
within existing authorities, take steps to streamline and better co-
ordinate Federal Tribal drinking water and sanitation incentives
and programs with the goal of simplifying administrative burdens
for Tribal governments or organizations to design, finance, and
build necessary water infrastructure. The Committee directs the
Department, in coordination with IHS and EPA, to report to the
Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this act on policy recommendations to address any statu-
tory barriers and identify additional authorities necessary to fur-
ther this goal.
Wildlife Connectivity.—The Committee commends the Depart-
ment of the Interior for continuing to implement Secretarial Order
3362, which has proven to be effective at bolstering big game mi-
grations and improving habitat connectivity. In future budget re-
quests, the Department shall clearly identify and describe funding
requested for programs established to implement the Secretarial
Order.
Estimating Fixed Costs.—The Committee directs all agencies
funded in this act to include in future budget justifications an esti-
mate of the ‘‘fixed costs’’ needs for the budget year. Such costs rep-
resent non-programmatic, obligatory costs that cannot be changed
or avoided and are not associated with programmatic increases. For
the purposes of this estimate, the Committee directs that the com-
ponents of ‘‘fixed costs’’ include: (1) change in number of paid days;
(2) estimates of proposed cost-of-living adjustments, change in
number of paid days, and benefits increases for current year FTE
levels; (3) change in employer share of retirement programs for cur-
rent year staffing levels; (4) estimates of costs due for workers com-
pensation payments; (5) estimates of change in unemployment com-
pensation; (6) estimates of changes in rent payable to the General
Services Administration [GSA], Federal, and Non-Federal sources
for office and non-office space, including security estimates from
the Federal Protective Service, mandatory office relocations, and
base operations and maintenance increases resulting from move-
ment out of GSA or direct-leased space; (7) estimated costs for serv-
ices charged centrally by the Department/Agency that are manda-
tory and non-severable; and (8) estimated costs associated with
utilities for facilities. Note that these costs do not include pro-
grammatic contract increases. Budget submissions must include a
9
description of the assumptions reflected in each category of the
fixed cost estimates.
Barriers to Critical Mineral Development.—The Department of
the Interior, in conjunction with the Department of Energy, is di-
rected to complete a study on actions it can take to increase the
domestic supply of critical minerals and other minerals that are
projected to experience increased price and demand in the next 20
years. They are to specifically examine the barriers to producing,
processing, recycling, stockpiling, and identifying critical minerals
alternatives or substitutes, including possible obstacles for securing
financing. The report should include steps the Departments can
take to assist critical mineral projects in overcoming these barriers.
The report should also examine whether there is a need to create
a critical mineral reserve and the feasibility of undertaking such an
effort. Additionally, the report should develop a description of a
preferred location for developing, processing, recycling, and stock-
piling critical minerals. Finally, the report should also provide a
list of critical minerals and our dependence on imports for each, as
well as examine domestic sources and potential domestic sources.
Wildland Fire Consolidation.—The Committee is aware of the
administration’s proposal to consolidate the wildfire functions
across the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior.
While nothing in this bill provides the funding or authority nec-
essary for the administration to execute this consolidation, the
Committee is interested in understanding more about the adminis-
tration’s proposal to create a more effective and efficient wildland
fire workforce. No later than 120 days after enactment, the Com-
mittee directs the Forest Service, in consultation with the Depart-
ment of the Interior, to provide a report to the Committee on a cur-
rent capacity and needs study for wildland fire personnel and as-
sets across the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior.
Additionally, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act, the
Committee directs the Forest Service to provide the Committee
with a briefing on how they would plan to consolidate wildland fire
programs to achieve the most efficient and effective use of wildland
fire offices, coordinating bodies, programs, budgets, procurement
processes, and research programs with the Department of the Inte-
rior. Within 90 days of the enactment of this act, the Forest Service
is directed to brief the committee on the anticipated costs to imple-
ment the Executive Order entitled, ‘‘Empowering Commonsense
Wildfire Prevention and Response’’, signed on June 12, 2025.
Staffing.—The Committee is greatly concerned with the actions
taken regarding staffing across the Department of the Interior and
the other agencies funded in this bill. The staff are the lifeblood of
the Department and these agencies and the uninformed manner in
which staffing reductions have been imposed in the name of effi-
ciency is anything but efficient. The Committee expects the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the other agencies funded in this bill to
maintain the requisite staffing levels to ensure that operations are
not deleteriously affected or have a negative impact on the eco-
nomic output and support to States, localities, and tribes.
Agency Budget Staff.—The Committee notes the value of having
a full set of budget staff maintained at specific agencies in addition
to having department-level budget office staff and therefore directs
10
each agency funded by this act to maintain its own separate budget
office at the agency level. The Committee notes that section 447 of
the bill restricts transfers of funds among accounts with the effect
of moving personnel and affirm that agency budget staff is covered
within that provision.
Execution of Energy Projects.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to utilize resources in order to conduct decisions, actions, con-
sultations, and other undertakings related to renewable energy
projects in a timely manner so as to avoid unnecessary project
delays and cost increases so that the United States can ensure per-
mitting reliability to industry, maximize energy production, and
bring down Americans’ energy costs.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
The Committee includes congressionally directed spending as de-
fined in section 5(a) of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate. In the interest of providing full disclosure of funding provided
in the bill, all projects are listed in a table accompanying this re-
port.
The vast majority of congressionally directed spending projects
funded in the bill support the improvement of drinking water and
wastewater infrastructure in the United States. The Committee
has confirmed that each funded water infrastructure project is eli-
gible for funding under the State Revolving Funds, the Indian
Health Service sanitation deficiency system, or is otherwise cer-
tified as eligible.
The bill also funds a number of historic preservation projects,
each of which the Committee has confirmed is listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Land-
mark pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C.
470 et seq.). Other funded projects support on-the-ground conserva-
tion activities, capital improvement and maintenance on public
lands, and forest resiliency and wildfire risk reduction efforts
which will further the missions of longstanding programs funded
within the bill.
LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND
With enactment of GAOA, Congress provided a permanent ap-
propriation of $900,000,000 per year from the Land and Water
Conservation Fund [LWCF]. Along with other mandatory appro-
priations, LWCF programs are subject to a 5.7 percent sequestra-
tion, with those sequestered amounts becoming available in the
subsequent fiscal year. GAOA also mandated that account alloca-
tions and detailed project information be proposed by the adminis-
tration through the President’s budget submission, and that such
allocations, following review by the Committees on Appropriations,
may be modified through an alternate allocation.
The Reauthorization of LWCF in Section 3001 of the John D.
Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (Public
Law 116–9) required that funding for Federal purchases and for
the suite of grant programs providing financial assistance to States
each constitute at least 40 percent of total funds available each fis-
cal year from all sources, annually. That total includes
11
$900,000,000 in mandatory appropriations provided under GAOA,
as well as deposits to LWCF under Public Law 109–432. These de-
posits amounted to $117,875,000 in fiscal year 2025 and are also
projected at $117,875,000 in fiscal year 2026. Accordingly, the
Committee has taken the full amounts available for LWCF expend-
itures into account in determining its allocations and expects that
future budget submissions will clearly delineate all revenues cred-
ited to LWCF and will adhere to statutory requirements in the pro-
posed allocation to Federal and State programs.
The Committee rejects the budget proposal to allow funding for
deferred maintenance on Federal lands as an eligible use of the
Land and Water Conservation Fund. Since its inception over sixty
years ago, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been the
mechanism to safeguard and preserve for future generations the
natural, cultural, and historical treasures of the American land-
scape. While maintaining the built environment that facilitates the
management and recreation opportunities on these lands is a ne-
cessity, there are other funding avenues for deferred maintenance,
including through a reauthorized Legacy Restoration Fund. LWCF
is the only source available for saving places that will otherwise be
lost forever, including significant inholdings essential to ensure
cost-efficient management of existing public lands, improve access
for sportsmen and families, conserve habitat for game and non-
game species, protect iconic scenery in national parks and forests,
safeguard community water supplies, and provide other basic pub-
lic land benefits. The intent and uses of LWCF have been codified
and reaffirmed by both the Dingell Act of 2019 and the GAOA of

Section 2:
2020.
The Committees recognizes and appreciates the Forest Service’s
submission of the statutorily required Federal land acquisition
project list and the supplemental land acquisition project list. How-
ever, the Committee notes the absence of the fiscal year 2026 De-
partment of the Interior statutorily-required Federal land acquisi-
tion list for the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife
Service, and the National Park Service. The Committee reminds
the Department of the Interior of its statutory requirement in both
Public Law 116–152 and the general provision outlined in this act
in reference to submission of the Federal land acquisition project
list. The Committee looks forward to the Department of the Inte-
rior correcting this critical deficiency expeditiously and following
statute in forthcoming fiscal years.
Therefore, due to the absence of the Department of the Interior
statutorily required Federal land acquisition list, a detailed table
accompanying this report shows the LWCF allocation for fiscal year
2026 by agency, account, activity, and project, including the list of
specific Federal land acquisition projects for the Forest Service and
the Forest Legacy Program projects. The Committee will reassess
the Interior bureau allocations prior to enactment of this act and
as a full slate of land acquisition lists are provided.
Appraisals.—The Committee appreciates the commitment by the
Department and the Forest Service to meet congressional direction
to ameliorate concerns about delays and other process issues re-
lated to the appraisal function. Concerns persist, however, regard-
ing process inconsistencies across regions, the need for public
12
transparency regarding policies and manuals associated with ap-
praisal review, and other issues related to valuation. The Com-
mittee expects detailed regular reports related to the process and
policy changes being implemented, as well as the pilot program for
returning some functions to the Fish and Wildlife Service and Na-
tional Park Service, and will revisit this issue and funding for ap-
praisal services prior to enactment of a final fiscal year 2026 bill.
Fish and Wildlife Service.—The Service is expected to provide
outreach to all units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, in-
cluding Clarks River, Don Edwards, Green River, Loxahatchee, and
Okefenokee, to ensure these refuges are accessing all available
funding tools, including recreational access and inholdings. The
Service is strongly encouraged to continue due diligence work on
the accumulating backlog of parcels available at Clarks River and
Green River National Wildlife Refuges and is directed to brief the
Committee on such efforts within 90 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee directs the Service to consider habitat conservation
plan land acquisition applications that enhance efforts to establish
State research forests through the Cooperative Endangered Species
Conservation Fund program. The Committee supports future con-
servation easement acquisition in the Mascoma River Division of
the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge and land ac-
quisition at Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge by the Service.
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee encour-
ages the Service to acquire lands within the Okefenokee National
Wildlife Refuge’s boundaries, which will expand hunting, fishing,
and recreation access and help reduce fire risk in the Refuge and
nearby communities.
National Park Service.—The Committee supports future land ac-
quisition for the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park by the
Service.
Big Cypress National Preserve and Florida Panther National
Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee is aware of the ecological and cul-
tural significance of the Big Cypress National Preserve and Florida
Panther National Wildlife Refuge and of the potential damage to
these public lands should the owners of the subsurface rights en-
gage in oil, gas, or mineral exploration or extraction. The Com-
mittee also is aware of the time-sensitive opportunity for the De-
partment of the Interior to acquire the subsurface rights to these
lands, thereby ensuring permanent protection for these areas. The
Committee urges the Department to prioritize and expedite the re-
view of due diligence and the decision-making process with respect
to this opportunity, and directs the Appraisal and Valuation Serv-
ices Office to report to the Committee on its decision no later than
180 days after enactment of this act.
LWCF State Conservation Grants.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of providing Federal funds from the Land and
Water Conservation Fund under the Great American Outdoors Act
to States, the District of Columbia and insular areas in a timely
manner to avoid any undue impacts on staffing and outdoor recre-
ation projects at the State and local level. Therefore, the National
Park Service shall release application guidance and expected allo-
cations to States, the District of Columbia and insular areas not
later than 60 days after enactment of this act. The Committee is
13
concerned with the reduction of mission-critical staff for the Na-
tional Park Service and directs the office to achieve staffing levels
that will allow it to provide robust technical assistance, timely
grant decisions and oversight of State and Local Assistance pro-
grams under the Great American Outdoors Act.
Forest Legacy Program.—For over 30 years, the Forest Service
and States have worked together through this program to protect
privately owned forest lands through conservation easements and
land purchases, all while not adding to the Federal estate. The
Committee appreciates the Forest Service’s successful implementa-
tion of this program and its efforts to ensure that States fully un-
derstand the tools available under the current statute and regula-
tion, including management agreements that can contribute to the
program’s continued success.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
Reprogramming guidelines for the agencies funded in this bill
were codified in Division D of Public Law 116–94 and further de-
scribed in the accompanying explanatory statement. These guide-
lines are repeated here for emphasis and reference, and are contin-
ued in this bill as a Title IV general provision.
The following are the procedures governing reprogramming ac-
tions for programs and activities funded in the Department of the
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
The agencies funded by this act are reminded that no reprogram-
ming shall be implemented without the advance approval of the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in accordance
with the procedures included in this act. The agencies funded in
this act are reminded that these reprogramming guidelines are in
effect, and must be complied with, until such time as the Commit-
tees modify them through bill or report language.
Definitions.—‘‘Reprogramming,’’ as defined in these procedures,
includes the reallocation of funds from one budget activity, budget
line-item, or program area to another within any appropriation
funded in this act. In cases where either the House or Senate Com-
mittee on Appropriations report displays an allocation of an appro-
priation below that level, the more detailed level shall be the basis
for reprogramming.
For construction, land acquisition, and forest legacy accounts, a
reprogramming constitutes the reallocation of funds, including un-
obligated balances, from one construction, land acquisition, or for-
est legacy project to another such project.
A reprogramming shall also consist of any significant departure
from the program described in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes all proposed reorganizations or other workforce ac-
tions detailed below which affect a total of 10 staff members or 10
percent of the staffing of an affected program or office, whichever
is less, even without a change in funding. Any change to the orga-
nization table presented in the budget justification shall also be
subject to this requirement.
Agencies are reminded that these longstanding General Guide-
lines for Reprogramming require agencies funded by this act to
submit reorganization proposals for the Committees’ review prior to
their implementation. It is noted that such reprogramming guide-
14
lines apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce restructure, re-
shaping, transfer of functions, or bureau-wide downsizing and in-
clude closures, consolidations, and relocations of offices, facilities,
and laboratories. In addition, no agency shall implement any part
of a reorganization that modifies regional or State boundaries for
agencies or bureaus that were in effect as of the date of enactment
of this act unless approved consistent with the General Guidelines
for Reprogramming procedures specified herein. Any such re-
programming request submitted to the Committees on Appropria-
tions shall include a description of anticipated benefits, including
anticipated efficiencies and cost-savings, as well as a description of
anticipated personnel impacts and funding changes anticipated to
implement the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only when an unfore-
seen situation arises, and then only if postponement of the
project or the activity until the next appropriation year would
result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be deferred through
reprogramming, shall not later be accomplished by means of
further reprogramming, but instead, funds should again be
sought for the deferred project or activity through the regular
appropriations process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situations, reprogramming
should not be employed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by Congress, or to de-
crease allocations specifically increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval will be con-
sidered as expeditiously as possible, and the Committees re-
mind the agencies that in order to process reprogramming re-
quests, adequate and timely information must be provided.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogramming must be submitted
to the Committees in writing prior to implementation if it exceeds
$1,000,000 annually or results in an increase or decrease of more
than 10 percent annually in affected programs or projects, which-
ever amount is less, with the following exceptions:
(a) With regard to the Tribal priority allocations of the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs [BIA] and Bureau of Indian Education
[BIE], there is no restriction on reprogrammings among these
programs. However, the Bureaus shall report on all
reprogrammings made during a given fiscal year no later than
60 days after the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, the Committees do not require
reprogramming requests associated with the States and Tribes
Partnership Grants or up to a cumulative total of $5,000,000
from carryover balances among the individual program areas
delineated in the Environmental Programs and Management
account, with no more than $1,000,000 coming from any indi-
vidual program area. No funds, however, shall be reallocated
from individual Geographic Programs.
(c) With regard to the National Park Service, the Commit-
tees do not require reprogramming requests associated with
the park base within the Park Management activity in the Op-
15
eration of the National Park System Account. The Service is
required to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations on spending trends for the park base within 60 days
of enactment of this act.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in these procedures shall
refer to any charges, reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget ac-
tivity or budget line item for costs associated with general agency
administrative costs, overhead costs, working capital expenses, or
contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against any program,
budget activity, subactivity, budget line item, or project funded
by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act unless such assessment and the basis therefore are
presented to the Committees in the budget justifications and
are subsequently approved by the Committees. The expla-
nation for any assessment in the budget justification shall
show the amount of the assessment, the activities assessed,
and the purpose of the funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assessments, as such esti-
mates were presented in annual budget justifications, shall be
submitted through the reprogramming process and shall be
subject to the same dollar and reporting criteria as any other
reprogramming.
(c) Each agency or bureau which utilizes assessments shall
submit an annual report to the Committees, which provides de-
tails on the use of all funds assessed from any other budget ac-
tivity, line item, subactivity, or project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or assessments be
used to finance projects and activities disapproved or limited
by Congress or to finance programs or activities that could be
foreseen and included in the normal budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget should not be ini-
tiated before enactment of the bill without notification to, and
the approval of, the Committees. restriction applies to all such
actions regardless of whether a formal reprogramming of funds
is required to begin the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings between budget activi-
ties, budget line-items, program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this recommendation, including those below the
monetary thresholds established above, shall be reported to the
Committees within 60 days of the end of each quarter and shall in-
clude cumulative totals for each budget activity or budget line item,
or construction, land acquisition, or forest legacy project.
Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest Legacy.—Lands shall
not be acquired for more than the approved appraised value, as ad-
dressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–646, unless such acqui-
sitions are submitted to the Committees on Appropriations for ap-
proval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, wherein the estimated value
of the Federal lands to be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000
shall not be consummated until the Committees have had 30 days
in which to examine the proposed exchange. In addition, the Com-
mittees shall be provided advance notification of exchanges valued
between $500,000 and $1,000,000.
16
Budget Structure.—The budget activity or line item structure for
any agency appropriation account shall not be altered without ad-
vance approval of the Committees.

TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
LAND AND WATER RESOURCES
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT
The Bureau of Land Management [Bureau or BLM] manages
more than 245 million acres of public lands, primarily in 11 West-
ern States and Alaska. The Bureau also has responsibility for 700
million acres of federally owned subsurface mineral estate. The Bu-
reau is mandated to administer these lands for multiple uses, in-
cluding recreation, wildlife habitat, mineral and energy production,
timber harvesting, and rangeland grazing, while managing natural,
cultural, and historical resources.
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,260,462,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,256,992,000
The Committee recommends $1,256,992,000 for Management of
Lands and Resources. The detailed allocation of funding by pro-
gram and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Program directives and specific funding requirements are
noted in the following narrative.
Wild Horse and Burro Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $141,972,000 for wild horse and burro activities.
It is clear that the landscape cannot support the populations in
excess of the appropriate management level [AML], and that the
Bureau should scale up targeted removals in the most heavily eco-
logically impacted areas with a goal of achieving a sustainable herd
population below AML through a humane and sustainable multi-
pronged approach of fertility control, targeted removals, off-range
holding, and adoptions, in accordance with current law and animal
welfare protocols. With the funds provided, the Bureau must ad-
dress the fact that the cost for housing horses in off-range facilities
is reducing the availability of resources to care for and manage on-
range populations, or to conduct gathers for fertility control treat-
ment or removal. Not later than 30 days after enactment of this
act, the Bureau is directed to restart quarterly briefings for the
Committee on the state of the program and shall include informa-
tion on the number of off-range holding contracts offered, including
renewals, the number of applicants for such contracts, and the
number of awarded contracts, information on the cost of contract
adjustments for change orders, and how the Bureau is working to
reduce the costs of off-range holdings.
Land Management Priorities.—The Committee recommends
$3,246,000 for congressionally directed spending in this program. A
(17)
18
detailed list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending’’ table accompanying this report.
Wildlife Habitat Management.—The Committee recommends no
less than $34,000,000 for threatened and endangered species activi-
ties. The Committee appreciates the Bureau’s work on its 5-year
strategic plan and looks forward to an action plan that includes
priorities identified through science-based criteria.
Sage-Grouse.—The Committee recommends no less than
$71,000,000 for sage-grouse conservation activities within Wildlife
Habitat Management. Greater sage-grouse conservation funding is
set apart because the Committee expects that these funds will re-
sult in increased capacity and expertise in ecological restoration,
continued implementation of the National Seed Strategy, and re-
duction of invasive plants through monitoring, early detection, and
targeted removal, specific to habitat improvements for sage-grouse.
Increasing the success of restoring sagebrush plant communities,
particularly after burned events, is critical to conserving the broad-
er sagebrush ecosystem. The Bureau is expected to use the mul-
tiple existing and relevant strategies for sagebrush restoration to
increase the success of projects that restore burned, degraded, or
otherwise unhealthy habitat. Further, the Committee expects the
Bureau to only use these funds for native, genetically-appropriate
plant species in revegetation and restoration activities in sage-
grouse habitat.
Plant Conservation Activities.—The bill provides no less than
$20,600,000 for plant conservation and restoration. The Committee
expects the Bureau to continue the research agenda identified in
the Seed Strategy, support the interagency Native Plant Materials
Development program, the Seeds of Success program, the Plant
Conservation Alliance, regional native plant materials development
programs, and related activities.
Energy and Minerals.—The Committee recommends no less than
$18,500,000 for legacy well remediation to maintain program ca-
pacity and continue progress toward cleanup of the next cluster of
legacy wells in need of remediation.
Alaska Conveyance.—The Committee recommends $32,662,000
for Alaska conveyance. The Committee recognizes the importance
of the Bureau of Land Management Alaska Native Vietnam-era
Veterans Allotment Program and the Committee recommends an
additional $1,008,000 in funding to be used for this program. Fur-
ther, the Committee recognizes the challenges associated with im-
plementation of the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Allotment
Program and includes a 5-year program extension to allow the Bu-
reau sufficient time to locate and assist all eligible veterans and
their decedents.
17(b) Program.—The Committee supports the Bureau’s efforts to
enter into agreements with Alaska Native entities to administer
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] 17(b) easements
and directs the Bureau to make funds available to implement these
agreements. To that end, the Committee recommends $1,500,000 to
be available to the Bureau to provide funding to Alaska Native en-
tities with which it has entered into 17(b) easement agreements
given the importance of having safe, public access to public lands
or major waterways. Of the funds provided, the Committee directs
19
that no more than 5 percent be available to the Bureau for admin-
istrative expenses. The Bureau is directed to provide a briefing
within 60 days of enactment of this act on these efforts.
Resource Management Planning.—The Committee recommends
$65,000,000, including up to $10,000,000 for sage grouse and sage-
brush restoration planning.
National Conservation Lands.—The Committee recommends
$59,135,000 for National Conservation Lands, including
$11,000,000 for National Scenic and Historic Trails. National Con-
servation Lands conserve the Nation’s heritage and this funding
will allow increased inventory, monitoring, and protection of cul-
tural resources; enhance proper management of all resources; and
provide a quality visitor experience through recreational access.
Furthermore, this funding ensures that units in the National Con-
servation Lands system are adequately staffed with land managers,
law enforcement officers, and cultural resources experts.
Conservation Status Ranking.—The Committee provides
$2,000,000 to support efforts to update conservation status ranks
for species of conservation concern in the Pacific Northwest using
transparent and standardized tools through cooperative agree-
ments with institutions of higher learning in the region.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance related to activities funded in this account.
Western Oregon.—The Committee appreciates the Bureau’s work
with the State of Oregon to renew the Western Oregon Operating
Plan and directs the Bureau to continue to fully participate in the
unified wildfire protection system and to cooperate to maintain the
level of fire protection for western Oregon forestlands and commu-
nities through the full term of the agreement to 2029. The Bureau
is directed to aggressively target hazardous fuels treatments and
report annually on the amount spent, as well as the scope of haz-
ardous fuels management required across BLM-managed lands, in-
cluding Oregon and California Grant Lands.
Renewable Energy.—The Bureau is directed to hire and train
dedicated geothermal personnel and to develop training materials,
and standard operating procedures to provide technical support to
district offices, in order to ensure the timely review of geothermal
energy projects on Federal lands.
Metallurgical Coal.—The Bureau is directed to brief the Com-
mittee regarding barriers to finalizing pending lease applications
for metallurgical coal within 60 days of enactment of this act.
Availability of Data.—The Committee is aware of the Bureau’s
work to address recommendations from the Government Account-
ability Office regarding the management of key data systems used
to oversee development on Federal lands. The Committee supports
these ongoing efforts and expects the Bureau to continue make
progress towards closing the recommendations in GA0–21–209 to
ensure the timely reporting of data made available to the public on
a consistent and predictable basis.
Rio Puerco Watershed.—The Committee reiterates its support for
the Rio Puerco Watershed Program and encourages the Bureau to
continue its financial support.
Aquifer Recharge.—The Committee continues to direct the Bu-
reau to work with the State of Idaho to provide appropriate access
20
for recharge projects. The Bureau is directed to brief the Com-
mittee within 90 days of enactment of this act on its use of authori-
ties provided by section 1105 of Public Law 116–260, which allow
the Bureau to use existing easements and rights of ways to move
and percolate water for aquifer recharge without further permis-
sions or additional requirements.
Tribal Contracting.—The Bureau is encouraged to utilize con-
tracts with Indian Tribes pursuant to the Indian Self-Determina-
tion and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93–638) to enable
greater collaboration and co-stewardship of public land and natural
resources with Indian Tribes.
Range Management.—The Bureau is directed, to the greatest ex-
tent practicable, to make vacant grazing allotments available to a
holder of a grazing permit or lease when lands covered by the hold-
er of the permit or lease are unusable because of drought or wild-
fire.
Grazing Allotments.—The Bureau must prioritize management of
active allotments impacting riparian areas, that are not meeting
land health standards, or do not have current assessments and re-
duce the backlog of active grazing permits that require analysis
and new management decisions under the National Environmental
Policy Act.
Signage for Wilderness Areas.—The Committee directs the Bu-
reau to ensure that the public is adequately informed regarding the
lands protected as well as routes that are open or closed with prop-
erly posted and maintained signage for the areas protected by Pub-
lic Law 116–9.
Caja del Rio, New Mexico.—The Committee is concerned about
documented acts of desecration of sacred sites and illegal dumping
at the Caja del Rio. The Bureau is directed conduct government-
to-government consultation with Tribal governments and engage
with other stakeholders to address these issues and provide a sta-
tus update to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this
act.
Consultation.—The Committee encourages the Secretary to en-
gage, as directed, in additional meaningful, consultations with fed-
erally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
Corporations affected by the Final Rule titled ‘‘Special Areas With-
in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska’’. The Committee ex-
pects improved consultation with Alaska Natives on the North
Slope of Alaska, on this rule and other major actions by the Inte-
rior Department that impact their economy, well-being, and ances-
tral lands. The Committee directs the Secretary to conduct mean-
ingful consultations with Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations and
other Tribal entities in the North Slope region and do everything
in their power to ensure that those Alaska Native views are under-
stood and reflected in decisions on the implementation of the rule
and all other decisions made by the Department.
Soda Ash.—In accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act and the
Non-Energy Leasing minerals rule, the Bureau set a 10-year, in-
dustry-wide royalty rate of 2 percent on January 1, 2021, for all ex-
isting and future Federal soda ash and sodium bicarbonate leases.
The Committee encourages the Bureau to work with soda ash pro-
ducers to assist them in reducing royalty rates and directs the Bu-
21
reau to take the necessary steps to reduce the Federal royalty rate
for soda ash as appropriate.
Ambler Access Project.—The Committee notes that section
201(4)(b) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
[ANILCA] of 1980 requires the Secretary to permit access for sur-
face transportation purposes from the Ambler Mining District to
the Alaska Pipeline Haul Road in accordance with the provisions
of the act and expects the Department to follow the law.
North Anchorage Land Agreement.—The Committee recognizes
that the North Anchorage Land Agreement of March 15, 1982, as
amended, and authorized as a matter of Federal law by section
1425 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of
December 2, 1980 (Public Law 96–487), was intended to address
long-standing land entitlement issues in and surrounding the Mu-
nicipality of Anchorage and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The
continued importance of Fort Richardson for our Nation’s defense
has made it impossible for Eklutna Inc., to realize the agreed-upon
benefits set out within the North Anchorage Land Agreement and
remaining entitlement of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
of December 18, 1971 (Public Law 92–203). Of the amounts appro-
priated, up to $500,000 shall be made available in fiscal year 2026
for the Appraisal and Valuation Services Office, or a contracted
federally qualified appraiser, to complete a land appraisal and mar-
ket analysis within 90 days of the date of enactment of this act for
the remaining lands designated for conveyance to Eklutna Inc.
through the North Anchorage Land Agreement and Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act. The appropriation shall first fully fund the
cost of the surface appraisal and then, if adequate funds remain,
the cost of a subsurface appraisal. In order to provide an accurate
and balanced appraisal to inform a future equal value land-ex-
change, the AVSO shall appraise the North Anchorage Land Agree-
ment military lands as if uncontaminated by military use.
Good Samaritan Remediation.—The Committee notes the impor-
tance of Public Law 118–155 in addressing the remediation of
abandoned hardrock mines as well as meeting our Nation’s mineral
needs. The Bureau is directed to use all available authorities pro-
vided under Public Law 118–155 and to brief the Committee on
any permit applications that were considered to be denied pursuant
to section 4(m)(2)(B) of that act.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee encourages the
Bureau to consider applications for virtual fencing technologies for
cattle in improving rangeland management and directs the Bureau,
within 90 days of enactment of this act, to submit a report on the
potential rangeland improvements, benefits to wildlife habitat, and
cost savings resulting from the use of virtual fencing technologies
on Federal grazing allotments.
Critical Minerals Supply Chains and Reliability.—The Com-
mittee reminds the Bureau that Public Law 117–58 Section 40206
requires a joint effort with the Forest Service to submit a report
to Congress which includes regulatory and legislative proposals to
improve timeliness of permitting activities and the development
and publication of a performance metric for evaluating the progress
made in expediting permitting activities. In addition to these re-
ports, the Committee directs the Bureau to provide a briefing with-
22
in 90 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, on its
status for satisfying section 40206 of Public Law 117–58.
OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $115,521,000

The Committee recommends $115,521,000 for Oregon and Cali-
fornia Grant Lands. The detailed allocation of funding by activity
is included in the table accompanying this report.
The Bureau is directed to aggressively target hazardous fuels
treatments and report annually on the amount spent, as well as
the scope of hazardous fuels management required across Oregon
and California Grant Lands; and to regularly report timber sale ac-
complishments for sales that have been sold and awarded rather
than merely offered for sale. The Bureau is expected to report these
activities in a manner consistent with the Forest Service and only
count awarded volume. The Committee appreciates the Bureau’s
commitment to treating Sudden Oak Death syndrome and provides
funding adequate to continue these activities.

FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS
U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [Service] is the principal Fed-
eral agency responsible for conserving, protecting, and enhancing
fish, wildlife, plants, andtheir habitats. The Service manages more
than 150 million acres in the National Wildlife Refuge System,
which encompasses 568 national wildlife refuges, thousands of
small wetlands, and other special management areas and Marine
National Monuments. It also operates 72 national fish hatcheries,
65 fish and wildlife management offices, and 80 ecological services
field stations. The agency enforces Federal wildlife laws, admin-
isters the Endangered Species Act [ESA] (Public Law 93–205),
manages migratory bird populations, restores nationally significant
fisheries, conserves and restores wildlife habitat such as wetlands,
and helps foreign governments with their conservation efforts. It
also oversees the Federal Assistance program, which distributes
hundreds of millions of dollars in excise taxes on fishing and hunt-
ing equipment to State fish and wildlife agencies.

(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,475,353,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,462,934,000
The Committee recommends $1,462,934,000 for Resource Man-
agement. All programs and subactivities included are continued at
enacted levels unless otherwise specified below or in the table. The
detailed allocation of funding by program and activity is included
in the table accompanying this report. Program directives and spe-
cific funding requirements are noted in the following narrative.
Ecological Services.—The Committee recommends $283,998,000
for Ecological Services activities. Within the Ecological Services
program, funding is recommended as follows:
Listing.—The Committee recommends $21,120,000 for endan-
gered species listing activities. The Service is directed to brief the
Committee on its work plan for this funding as it relates to petition
activities, listing of foreign species, and critical habitat designa-
tions.
Planning and Consultation.—The Committee recommends
$116,191,000 for planning and consultation. Included in the rec-
ommendation is $4,000,000 for Gulf Coast Restoration activities.

that, due to climate change, now face imminent extinction from
non-native mosquitoes that carry avian malaria and other patho-
gens lethal to these birds; $2,300,000 for the Prescott Grant pro-
gram; and $1,000,000 for the wolf-livestock demonstration pro-
gram. The recommendation includes $10,500,000 for Recovery
Challenge matching grants. Recovery Challenge grants are to be
used to implement high priority recovery actions as prescribed in
recovery plans to recover federally listed species. Actions should in-
clude, but are not limited to, genetically-sound breeding, rearing,
and reintroduction programs. Project partners must provide con-
tributions at least 50 percent of the project cost, with the remain-
ing funding coming from Recovery Challenge funds. Partner con-
tribution calculations may include in-kind services. Unless an af-
fected State is a partner on the project, no funds may be awarded
to a project until the project partners have consulted with such
State. Further, the Committee directs the Service to conduct a com-
petitive solicitation and provide the funding to the awardees within
365 days of enactment of this act.
Additional Ecological Services guidance is provided below.
Traditional Knowledge.—The Service manages lands and natural
resources of great importance to Indian Tribes, and the Committee
appreciates the acknowledgment of the benefits of traditional eco-
logical knowledge by the Service in past policy statements and
guidance in managing these lands and resources. However, the
Committee is concerned the Service has not fully incorporated tra-
ditional Tribal knowledge in its planning processes and its imple-
mentation of the Endangered Species Act [ESA], and would like to
see added importance given to the application of this knowledge.
When appropriate, the Committee expects the Service to make
every effort to incorporate traditional knowledge in its planning de-
cisions, including in ESA decisions. The Committee also expects the
Service to engage in additional outreach to Tribal governments in
circumstances where traditional knowledge may provide valuable
information for species like the northern sea otter.
Endangered Species Act Consultations.—The Committee con-
tinues to be concerned regarding the timing of processing of Endan-
gered Species Act Section 7 consultation requests, including in
West Virginia, North Dakota, and elsewhere. While the Committee
recognizes the Service is working to clear the backlog, the Service
is directed to report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment
of this act on the existing backlog, including the number of out-
standing requests and relevant staff per State. The Committee is
concerned about current staffing levels at the Service and their
ability to prioritize. The Committee also directs the Service to di-
rect additional staff and other resources to States with the most
significant backlogs in order to reduce the response times for these
25
consultations. Additionally, the Committee notes that a provision to
provide transfer authority of unobligated Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58) funding to the Service and the
National Marine Fisheries Service to expedite these reviews was
enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law
118–42) as requested. The Committee continues to support this
provision.
Native Watershed Forests.—Watershed forests provide the impor-
tant ecological service of recharging aquifers and other under-
ground water resources in addition to having carbon sequestration
benefits, an important component to addressing climate change.
Such forests may also provide critical habitat for endangered en-
demic species uniquely evolved for the ecosystems they create. In
such cases, active management becomes a cost effective way to sup-
port multiple conservation goals. The Committee urges the Service
to support State and local management of native watershed forests.
Candidate Conservation.—The Committee recommends
$14,538,000 for Candidate Conservation efforts to facilitate vol-
untary conservation efforts for at-risk species under consideration
for listing under the ESA, specifically by developing landscape level
partnerships with private landowners, States, Tribes, and agencies
on Candidate Conservation Agreements to promote a collaborative
approach for conservation planning.
Collaboration Between Federal Agencies and Private Forest Own-
ers.—The Committee recognizes that many at-risk species inhabit
private lands and that the Service must consider non-regulatory
and voluntary collaborative conservation efforts with private land-
owners to accomplish its mission. The Service is directed to con-
tinue to utilize its grant and other programs to pursue collabo-
rative species conservation with private landowners to the max-
imum extent practicable, specifically for the Northern Long-Eared
Bat and the Wood Turtle. Overall, these ongoing collaborative ef-
forts through programs such as the Wildlife Conservation Initiative
will play a vital role in conserving at-risk and listed species, allow
for cooperation, and ultimately help achieve important wildlife con-
servation outcomes. Private landowners interested in habitat con-
servation are important partners and their efforts should be en-
couraged by improving access to a fuller range of conservation re-
sources that exist across the Federal Government and other enti-
ties. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Service to support
non-profit organizations with expertise and experience in working
with private landowners to provide greater access to information
and resources in their local area related to the conservation of wild-
life habitat on private lands.
State Research Forests.—The Committee directs the Service to
support cooperative research, monitoring, and recovery efforts for
the protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species,
such as the spotted owl and marbled murrelet, on state research
forests and to report to the Committee within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on progress and future plans for such forests in-
cluding the Elliott State Research Forest.
Jaguar Habitat Connectivity Research and Restoration.—The
Committee encourages the Service to prioritize research and res-
toration of jaguar habitat and connectivity in the U.S.-Mexico bor-
26
derlands. Prioritization should include, but not be limited to, the
following actions within the Borderlands Secondary Area: mapping
of potential trans-border linkages and identification and mitigation
of impediments in these corridors, assessing the level of protection
in current and potential jaguar range, maintaining and increasing
important corridors and administration of protected areas, devel-
oping methodologies for jaguar habitat restoration, and identifying
prioritized lands for habitat restoration.
Biobanking.—The Committee is aware that the Service, through
its regional offices, is exploring the use of biobanking, which is the
preservation of genetic material, including tissues, living cell lines
and gametes, as a tool to preserve the genetic diversity of species
in order to enhance recovery efforts. The Committee encourages the
Service to expand upon these efforts including incorporating sam-
ple collection for biobanking into the recovery planning process.
Western Monarch Butterfly.—The Committee is particularly con-
cerned over the rapid decline in western monarch butterfly popu-
lations and urges the Service to continue to act expeditiously to
make a final determination on ESA protections for the western
monarch. Further, the Service is directed to utilize Service-man-
aged lands to the maximum extent practicable to serve as habitat
corridors for migrating monarchs, in particular the western mon-
arch. The Committee recognizes the Service provides resources for
monarchs and other pollinators across multiple accounts, and the
Committee recommends not less than $8,000,000 for the western
monarch butterfly and other pollinators within National Wildlife
Refuge System, Inventory and Monitoring and including an addi-
tional $1,000,000 within Science Support. The Service is encour-
aged to work alongside Federal agencies, State, Tribal, and non-
governmental organizations on a comprehensive strategy to in-
crease habitat and monitoring of critical pollinator species. The
Service is expected to continue to work with the National Fish and
Wildlife Foundation [NFWF] to expand and leverage monarch re-
covery efforts.
Florida Grasshopper Sparrow.—The Committee directs the Serv-
ice to continue to support at the enacted level. Furthermore, the
Committee is encouraged by the success of the Service’s captive
breeding program as managed by its conservation partners and
notes that augmenting the wild population with captive bred re-
leases as early as this year will mark an important new phase in
the species’ recovery. The Committee notes that the disease and
health studies necessary to understand and combat captive bred
sparrow mortality may have important benefits to the recovery of
other endangered birds including the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow.
Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow.—The Committee encourages the
Service to support the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow Captive Breed-
ing and Release Pilot Program. The Committee recognizes the need
to restore wild populations of the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow as
a method to improve water management flexibility in the Ever-
glades system, which has been affected by regulatory requirements
associated with the Endangered Species Act and has had impacts
on the ecology and wildlife of Water Conservation Area 3A and the
reservation of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Further-
more, the Committee is encouraged by the success of the Service’s
27
captive breeding programs as managed by its conservation partners
and notes that augmenting the wild population with captive bred
releases as early as this year will mark an important new phase
in the species’ recovery.
Red Knot Recovery Program.—The Committee supports the ef-
forts of the Service’s Red Knot Recovery program. Funding rec-
ommended for these activities should be used to improve horseshoe
crab egg density surveys, safeguarding the red knot’s food supplies,
filling data gaps, and addressing new threats as they emerge.
Native Handicrafts.—The Committee reiterates that the Service’s
2016 elephant ivory regulation does not apply to Alaska Native
handicrafts made from walrus ivory and mammoth ivory. However,
the Committee is concerned that the Federal prohibitions on the
sale and trade of elephant ivory have negatively impacted the Alas-
ka Native arts economy. The Committee appreciates the Service’s
efforts on this matter to date. The Committee expects the Service
to continue its efforts to promote this distinction and directs the
Service to develop a plan for greater outreach on this matter.
Habitat Conservation.—The Committee recommends $69,820,000
for Habitat Conservation programs. The Partners for Fish and
Wildlife Program is recommended at $57,820,000. Within the rec-
ommended funds for Partners, $3,200,000 is for Nutria Eradication
activities, $643,000 for Environmental Data Quality and Access,
$3,285,000 for Washington Regional Fisheries Enhancement
Groups, an increase of $2,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, and $6,132,000 for Klamath Habitat Restoration, an increase
of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year enacted level.
The Committee recommends $12,000,000 for the Coastal Pro-
gram, which includes Ecosystem Restoration, Hood Canal Salmon
Enhancement, and Long Live the Kings.
National Wildlife Refuge System.—The Committee recommends
$525,555,000 for the National Wildlife Refuge System.
Within the recommended amount for the National Wildlife Ref-
uge System, $254,735,000 is for wildlife and habitat management.
Further, $17,925,000 is recommended for invasive species, with the
$300,000 included for European green crab efforts with more direc-
tion detailed below. The Committee notes an emphasis on invasive
species Strike Teams to focus on high priority invasive species
problems before they cause irreparable harm to the environment.
The Committee recommends $500,000 to help improve water effi-
ciency at the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge in order to main-
tain, improve, and replace and upgrade refuge infrastructure per
the direction included in the accompanying statement in the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260). The rec-
ommendation also includes $2,500,000 for the Marine National
Monuments, and $3,000,000 for nutria eradication.
The Committee recommends $76,000,000 for Refuge Visitor Serv-
ices. The Committee recommends $2,500,000 for Youth and Careers
in Nature, including $500,000 for the Arctic Youth Ambassadors
program, and $7,000,000 for the Urban Wildlife Conservation Pro-
gram within Refuge Visitor Services.
Urban Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge.—The Com-
mittee directs the Services’ Urban Wildlife Conservation Program
to continue partnerships with organizations that provide expertise
28
in Indigenous traditional ecological and cultural knowledge, capac-
ity building, employee training, and development and evaluation of
training methodologies provided by such organizations in western
States.
The Committee recommends $146,520,000 for refuge mainte-
nance.
The Committee recommends $45,500,000 for refuge law enforce-
ment.
Refuge Management Plans.—The recommendation includes
$2,800,000 for Refuge Planning. The Committee is concerned that
a number of refuge management plans have not been updated for
many years, and directs the Service to prioritize updating manage-
ment plans to improve the management of the oldest refuges.
Trapping in National Wildlife Refuges.—The Committee under-
stands that the Service makes efforts to provide information to the
public regarding acceptable trapping practices on refuge lands. The
Service is directed to improve efforts to inform the public about ac-
ceptable trapping practices and collect data on trapping activities
in refuges, and to share those efforts and outcomes with the Com-
mittee.
European Green Crab.—The Committee recognizes invasive Eu-
ropean green crab is becoming an increasing problem and rec-
ommends $300,000 for European green crab eradication efforts at
affected National Wildlife Refuges. Further, the Service and its
partners are directed to jointly brief the Committee no later than
90 days after enactment on this act on their collective efforts to ad-
dress European green crab.
Additional National Wildlife Refuge System funding guidance is
provided below.
Klamath Restoration.—The Service is directed to consider addi-
tional activities that could be undertaken to recover endangered
and threatened species, restore habitat, and improve the health of
the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges with the funds pro-
vided in fiscal year 2026 and during the fiscal year 2027 budget
formulation. The Service is also encouraged to continue to coordi-
nate with the Bureau of Reclamation where appropriate and con-
sult with Tribes.
Additional National Refuge System guidance is provided below.
Staffing of the National Wildlife Refuge System.—Over the past
decade, the Refuge System’s full-time equivalent [FTE] staffing has
decreased while the Refuge System has continued to grow. The
Committee is concerned with the current level of FTEs within the
Refuge System. Further, within 60 days of enactment of this act,
and monthly thereafter, the Department and the Service are di-
rected to brief the Committee on Refuge System operations, to in-
clude staffing levels by refuge, visitor data by refuge, and other
data necessary to convince the Committee that operations have not
been and will not be deleteriously affected in an effort to make the
Refuge System operate more efficiently.
Further, the Committee directs the Service to submit, no later
than 90 days after the enactment of this act, a report detailing by
month: (1) how many permanent, probationary, and temporary po-
sitions were terminated during Fiscal Year 2025 and in which ref-
uge units or complexes they served, their titles, and whether they
29
were permanent, probationary, or temporary staff; (2) how many
permanent, probationary, and temporary positions remain filled
and in which refuge units or complexes they serve, their titles, and
whether they are permanent, probationary, or temporary staff; and
(3) which Refuge System units or complexes have two or fewer
staffers, what the filled positions at those refuges are, and if those
staff are permanent, probationary or temporary.
Within the funding recommended for National Wildlife Refuge
System, the Committee encourages the Service to prioritize hiring
and retention of FTEs particularly to fill longstanding vacancies in
the refuge system such as at the Northern Maine Wildlife Refuge
Complex and Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge
Complex.
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee encour-
ages the Service to contribute funding aligned with commitments
established in the 2018 license agreement with the South Florida
Water Management District towards the management of invasive
plant infestations, including Old World Climbing Fern, which
threaten the value of this resource, ongoing Everglades restoration
efforts, the provision of critical wildlife habitat, and the enjoyment
of the public.
Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex.—The
Committee supports the Service’s collaboration with non-Federal
partners to develop and implement the Blackwater 2100 ‘‘A Strat-
egy for Salt Marsh Persistence in an Era of Climate Change.’’ The
plan seeks to restore and protect 800–1,000 acres of marsh, which
is one-fifth of tidal marsh losses since the 1930’s, using thin layer
placement, living shorelines, invasive species control, research, and
other management strategies to enhance climate change resiliency
and protect communities.
John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee sup-
ports the salt marsh restoration work in the John H. Chafee Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge to enhance salt marsh resiliency with native
plantings and through improved drainage and tidal flushing. Fur-
thermore, the Committee directs the Service to prioritize these on-
going efforts.
Community Safety.—The Committee is aware of significant con-
cerns among residents in Kaktovik, Alaska, related to the Service’s
program for polar bear viewing. While tourism has increased sig-
nificantly in recent years, the Committee has received reports of
bears becoming less fearful of humans as a result of tourism, lead-
ing to more human encounters with bears within the village. In ad-
dition, tourism has reportedly made it more difficult for local resi-
dents to travel to and from Kaktovik, given the limited availability
of air service. The Committee instructs the Service to review its
program for polar bear tourism, consult and incorporate the views
of Kaktovik residents in its decisions related to the program, and
explore cooperative management of the Beaufort polar bear popu-
lation with Native peoples in the village.
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee di-
rects the Service to continue to follow the directive from previous
fiscal years that prohibits a caribou hunt on Kagalaska Island and
efforts to remove cattle on Chirikof and Wosnesenski Islands in the
State of Alaska.
30
Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee is aware that
the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge has identified 2,500 acres of
forested habitat impacted by spruce bark beetles, currently ready
for treatment, several acres of which are adjacent to existing roads,
facilities, campgrounds, trails and other high use recreation sites.
In an effort to protect the refuge and surrounding communities, the
Committee encourages the Service to treat the 2,500 high priority
acres ready for treatment within the funds provided. These treat-
ments would meet multiple objectives by removing beetle-killed
trees and reducing risk to the public, employees and infrastructure,
while reducing accumulations of hazardous fuels.
Good Neighbor Agreements.—The Committee notes that forest
ecosystems in the National Wildlife Refuge System are susceptible
to elevated wildfire risk, drought, and insect and disease infesta-
tion much like forestland under the administrative jurisdiction of
other Federal land management agencies. The Committee recog-
nizes that the environmental stewardship of national wildlife ref-
uges and adjacent non-Federal lands would benefit if the Service
offered cross-boundary fuels reduction projects to neighboring
State, local, and Tribal governments similar to those issued by the
Bureau of Land Management and the USDA Forest Service under
Good Neighbor Agreements [GNA]. Thus, the recommendation in-
cludes the authority for this work in section 442.
Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Service to update commitments and funding
contributions established in its 2016 agreement with neighboring
landowners for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife,
and their habitats at Palmyra Atoll. The Committee supports con-
tinuing these efforts, particularly the management of invasive spe-
cies, climate change threats, ongoing native forest restoration ef-
forts, the provision of critical wildlife habitat, and the benefit of the
public.
Conservation and Enforcement.—The Committee recommends
$173,132,000 for Conservation and Enforcement.
The recommendation includes $3,500,000 for the Service’s work
with the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to combat trafficking of
counterfeit arts and crafts, and to conduct criminal investigations
of alleged violations of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (Public Law
101–644). Further, the Service is directed to provide the Committee
a briefing on this work not later than 90 days following enactment
of this act.
ePermits Operations.—The Committee does not support the cre-
ation of a new subactivity by transferring funding to the Inter-
national Affairs program at this time.
Big Cats Public Safety Act Enforcement.—The Committee is
aware of the Service’s additional responsibilities pursuant to the
enactment of Public Law 117–243. The Committee would like to en-
sure that the Service has adequate resources to implement and en-
force this act. The Committee encourages the Service to collaborate
with United States Department of Agriculture and the Department
of Justice and reminds the Service of the directive to report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on staffing, im-
plementation, enforcement status, and additional funding needs re-
lated to Public Law 117–243.
31
Wildlife Trafficking.—The Service plays a critical role in the on-
going effort to combat the global crisis of wildlife poaching and traf-
ficking, which escalates the risk of animal-to-human disease trans-
mission and human-wildlife conflict and is driven by demand for
high-value illegal wildlife products, facilitated by sophisticated
criminal networks profiting from this multi-billion dollar black
market industry. Poaching of rhinoceros, pangolin, loris, and ele-
phants has reached unprecedented levels, and illegal trade is un-
dermining the conservation of scores of other species. The Com-
mittee continues to support government-wide efforts to combat
wildlife trafficking. The Committee maintains resources that will
support the Service in continuing to strengthen its forensic capa-
bilities to disrupt smuggling networks; improve collaboration with
other Federal, State, local, and foreign governments; and promote
international wildlife conservation. The Committee remains con-
cerned about the global health risk from wildlife to human disease
transmission, particularly in light of recent national health emer-
gencies.
International Affairs.—The Committee recommends $28,593,000
for International Affairs. Long-term success for conserving wildlife
and wild places relies on building the capacity in countries for
managing their own protected areas and species, including among
Indigenous Peoples and communities. Within the amount rec-
ommended, the Committee encourages the Service to support
projects that foster partnerships with universities or other institu-
tions that are educating the current and next generations of con-
servationists.
Migratory Bird Management.—The Committee recommends
$52,680,000 for migratory bird management, which includes
$29,868,000 for Conservation and Monitoring, $16,821,000 for the
North American Waterfowl Management Plan activities, and
$591,000 for the Federal Duck Stamp Program.
Incidental Take for Migratory Birds.—The Committee is con-
cerned with the decline of North American bird species, including
the 1,093 species of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Trea-
ty Act [MBTA] that are experiencing population decreases due to
a variety of threats. The Committee supports the Service’s work to
establish an incidental take authorization program within the per-
mitting program for the MBTA.
Pacific Flyway.—The Committee is concerned about avian bio-
diversity and habitat in the Pacific Flyway. Several species within
the flyway are experiencing severe declines and small populations
and are at risk of extirpation, particularly at the critical stop over
points. The Committee supports science-based research and deci-
sion-making on habitat requirements, regional movements, and
population connectivity that will guide management and conserva-
tion of these species and their habitats in the Pacific Flyway.
Theodore Roosevelt National Wildlife Refuge Complex.—The Mat-
hews Brake and Yazoo National Wildlife Refuges within the Com-
plex were established to provide habitat for wintering waterfowl
and resident wildlife. The Committee is concerned these important
refuges no longer meet their intended purpose due to lack of ade-
quate management and invasive aquatic plants, such as water hya-
cinth. Within available funds, the Committee directs the Service to
32
implement measures to restore enhance, and better manage habi-
tat for waterfowl and wildlife on the refuges, and urges the Service
to partner with local landowners and nonprofit conservation orga-
nizations to meet this objective.
Habitat Improvements for Nesting Migratory Waterfowl.—The
Committee is concerned with the declining production of breeding
ducks. The Committee emphasizes that outdoor recreation contrib-
utes billions to the U.S. economy annually, and that participation
is closely linked to opportunity, and opportunity is linked to robust
populations. Research has recently show that hen houses and other
nesting habitat improvements in areas of high breeding duck den-
sities can yield significant gains in nest success and other vital
rates. Therefore, the Committee directs the Service to report to the
Committee no later than 180 days of enactment of this act on the
efforts the Service is implementing to partner with non-profit con-
servation organizations to support the construction and installation
of hen houses and the development of breeding habitat in the Prai-
rie Pothole Region and the Pacific Flyway.
Fish and Aquatic Conservation.—The Committee recommends
$220,310,000 for Fish and Aquatic Conservation. The Committee
encourages the Service to include adequate support for mitigation
activities at National Fish Hatcheries in future budget submis-
sions. Additionally, funds are maintained for the improvements to
aquatic habitat through the removal of locks and dams. The rec-
ommendation includes $4,750,000 for Klamath Restoration, an in-
crease of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level, and in-
cludes $10,750,000 for Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement ac-
tivities, an increase of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level. Further, $5,000,000 is recommended for implementation of
the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The Service is directed to work in co-
operation with State fish and game agencies. This includes funding
for anadromous salmonids for implementation of the Yukon River
Salmon Agreement.
National Fish Habitat Program.—The Committee understands
that the Service has worked to reduce administrative costs in the
National Fish Habitat program and encourages the Service to seek
to reduce these costs further to make additional funding available
to projects recommended and submitted by the National Fish Habi-
tat Board for approval by the Secretary.
National Fish Hatchery System Operations.—The Committee rec-
ommends $73,603,000 for National Fish Hatchery System Oper-
ations. The Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership is rec-
ommended at $1,200,000. Funding in the amount of $8,000,000 is
recommended for the Warm Springs Fish Health Center [FHC]
which provides disease diagnosis, biosecurity and disease manage-
ment, disease treatment and prevention, fish health inspection
services for Federal, State, and Tribal hatcheries responsible for
production of salmonids and warm water species for recovery, res-
toration, and recreational fisheries, and inspections and certifi-
cations for the National Triploid Grass Carp Program. Additional
funding is recommended to develop environmental DNA tools to
forecast and detect aquatic invasive species, aquatic nuisance spe-
cies, aquatic pathogens, and rare species for Federal, State, and
Tribal hatcheries.
33
Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Restoration Infrastructure Im-
provements.—The salmon and steelhead hatcheries, adult fish
traps, and juvenile release facilities along the lower Snake River
and in the Columbia River Basin are facing immediate and signifi-
cant infrastructure improvement needs due to aging critical infra-
structure including pipelines, generators, and rearing units. While
this is not the responsibility of the Service alone, the Committee
believes the water development agencies should be contributing
more to protect threatened and endangered species. Multiple part-
ners are necessary to fully address mitigation activities in the
basin, therefore the Committee directs the Service to continue dia-
logue with the multiple partners involved to come to a viable solu-
tion in fiscal year 2026. In the meantime, the Committee directs
the Service to assist States and Tribes with accelerating critical
capital and maintenance projects to improve salmon and steelhead
facilities on the lower Snake River and Columbia River basin, and
the Committee recommends $6,000,000 within National Fish
Hatchery Operations for these efforts.
6PPD.—The Committee is concerned with the impact of 6p-phen-
ylene-diameine (6PPD] and its transformant, 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-
q), on aquatic ecosystems. Stormwater runoff containing 6PPD-q
has already been linked to mass die-offs of endangered and threat-
ened fish species across the Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay
watersheds. The Committee supports the Service’s work to better
understand the impacts of 6PPD and 6PPD-q on aquatic species in
freshwater environments. The Committee directs the Service to
continue coordinating across Federal and State agencies on 6PPD
research and management and to continue to work across agencies
on robust government-to-government consultation with impacted
Tribes. The Service is directed to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee within 90 days of enactment of this act on its 6PPD-related
activities, including the Service’s current strategy, an overview of
research work completed to date, a plan for addressing potential
data gaps, recommendations for future research activities, and po-
tential funding sources.
Maintenance and Equipment.—The Committee recommends
$20,119,000 for maintenance and equipment expenses related to
the National Fish Hatchery System. A portion of the funding rec-
ommended for National Fish Hatchery Maintenance and Equip-
ment shall be allocated to hatcheries where partner agencies fund
mitigation work.
Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation.—The Committee rec-
ommends $126,588,000 for aquatic habitat and species conserva-
tion. Within aquatic habitat and species conservation, funding is
recommendation as follows:
—Habitat Assessment and Restoration.—The Committee rec-
ommends $47,832,000 for habitat assessment and restoration
activities. Funding is recommended in the amount of
$11,500,000 for activities associated with the Delaware River
Basin Conservation Act (Public Law 114–322). The Service is
encouraged to support the Delaware River Basin Restoration
Program’s existing, successful practice of allowing cash or in-
kind contributions of services or materials to be used for the
non-Department of the Interior share of the cost of a project
34
funded under the grant program. The recommendation also in-
cludes $15,000,000 for fish passage improvements. Within the
recommended funding, the recommendation includes an addi-
tional $1,000,000 for the Service to comply with the instruc-
tions and requirements in the explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023, regarding implementation of the Fisheries Restora-
tion and Irrigation Mitigation Act [FRIMA] (Public Law 106–
502).
—Population Assessment and Cooperative Management.—
The Committee recommends $26,613,000 for population assess-
ment and cooperative management activities. Great Lakes Fish
and Wildlife Restoration Grants are recommended at
$3,000,000. The program supports critical work to restore
Great Lakes fisheries and inform management decisions
through sound science. This includes the Great Lakes Mass
Marking Program, which is essential to assessing hatchery
production and supporting a robust fishery. Within funds rec-
ommended, the Service is encouraged to support these impor-
tant efforts. The recommendation includes $818,000 for the
Lake Champlain sea lamprey program.
The Committee remains concerned by the decline of Amer-
ican shad in coastal rivers and encourages the Service to col-
laborate with academic research institutions to research, mon-
itor, conserve, and restore other anadromous fish, in close col-
laboration with State, Tribal, and local governments.
The Committee directs the Service to continue working with
public and private partners on fish passage and monitoring
technologies, including initiatives related to fish identification
and monitoring, and others, to improve conservation outcomes.
The Committee directs the Service to submit to the committees
a report outlining how existing funding may be used to im-
prove fish population sustainment or recovery.
—Aquatic Invasive Species.—The Committee recommends
$52,143,000 for aquatic invasive species activities, an increase
of $3,500,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Within
these funds, $5,038,000 is recommended to implement section
5(d)(2) of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (Public Law 106–
506). The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for research on
hydrilla, eel, and milfoil invasive grasses.
Lake Tahoe Lahontan Cutthroat Recovery Program.—For over 25
years, the Tahoe Basin Restoration work has been a collaborative
effort, this partnership manifested into the Lake Tahoe Environ-
mental Improvement Program [EIP] in 1997 and was reauthorized
in the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act in 2016. The Committee sup-
ports these collaborative efforts that leverage Federal dollars and
support regional economies while at the same restoring habitats,
improving tributaries, and removing invasive species. The Service
is directed to report to the Committee within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on how this ongoing work is going to support the
recovery of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout as authorized in section
5(4), of Public Law 106–506.
Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission.—The Committee
recommends $700,000 for the Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon
35
Compact, as authorized in Public Law 98–138, for research, moni-
toring, conservation, and habitat restoration work related to this
high-priority watershed. The Committee directs that the Secretary
undertake a special resource study of the National significance of,
and the suitability and feasibility of carrying out a basin-scale,
nonregulatory program of conservation, stewardship, and enhance-
ment of habitat for fish and wildlife in Connecticut River basin.
Non-Intrusive Zebra Mussel Elimination.—The Committee rec-
ommends $3,500,000 for zebra mussel eradication. The Committee
is aware of the environmental and economic threat posed by
invasive quagga and zebra mussels.
Invasive Carp.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
work conducted by the Service to combat the serious threat of
invasive carp and recommends $28,000,000 for invasive carp activi-
ties, an increase of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
Overall, this funding is aimed at protecting and enhancing activi-
ties in the Great Lakes to prevent invasive carp from entering and
establishing in the Great Lakes. Funding recommended should also
be used to control invasive carp in the Mississippi River and its
Sub-basins, including the Upper Mississippi River Sub-basin; Mis-
souri River Sub-basin; Arkansas-Red-White River Sub-basin; Lower
Mississippi River Sub-basin; Tennessee Cumberland Sub-basin;
and Ohio River Sub-basin, including in Kentucky Lake, Lake Bar-
kley, and the Ohio River. The Service should consider the utility
of creating a dedicated funding source to increase the intensity and
geographic scope of efforts to prevent entry into the Great Lakes
and control in areas where invasive carp are currently located. The
Service is directed to continue to work with those States with exist-
ing cooperative agreements, including non-profits, to develop and
implement innovative solutions to reduce invasive carp popu-
lations.
The Committee encourages the Service to focus on invasive spe-
cies removal as it relates to the eradication efforts for invasive
Carp. While the Committee recognizes the importance of studying
and understanding invasive carp patterns, the Service is encour-
aged to take action on a strategy that increases the focus on bio-
mass removal.
Additionally, $3,334,000 is recommended for implementation of
State Aquatic Nuisance Species management plans to help control
the spread of invasive carp, an increase of $500,000 to the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level.
Invasive Species Competitive Grants.—The Committee is aware
that work is ongoing in several regions to address the threats
posed by aquatic invasive species and directs the Service to con-
tinue to make available competitive grant funding for projects to
eliminate these destructive, non-native species. Further, the Com-
mittee directs the Service to expeditiously award these grants.
Prioritization of Combatting Invasive Plant and Animal Spe-
cies.—Invasive plant and animal species are a pervasive problem
affecting communities across the Nation. Invasives, such as the
carp, European Green Crab, nutria, quagga and zebra mussels, em-
erald ash borer, Eurasian milfoil, elodea, and the Hemlock Woolly
Adelgid threaten our natural resources and wreak havoc on the
communities and industries that rely upon them. Preventing
36
invasive species from gaining a foothold in our communities and
suppressing established species is of utmost importance. The Com-
mittee makes several increases to programs designed to combat
invasive species before and after they become a problem. The Com-
mittee encourages the Service to support research, monitoring,
mitigation, and outreach efforts in all regions.
Quagga Mussel.—The Committee recognizes the potential threat
of invasive quagga mussels in the Pacific Northwest and directs the
Service to brief the Committee no later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this act on detection, control and prevention efforts of
Quagga Mussel in the Columbia River Basin as well as coordina-
tion on these efforts with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
their Watercraft Inspection Program.
Science Support.—The Committee recommends $32,793,000 for
Science Support
Science Partnerships.—The Committee recommends $24,031,000
for Science Partnerships. Of which, an increase of $1,000,000 is
recommended for continued work for monarch conservation activi-
ties through the Center for Pollinator Conservation.
Chesapeake WILD Grant Program.—The recommendation for
Science Partnerships includes $8,000,000 for the Chesapeake
WILD grant program.
Service Science.—The Committee recommends $8,762,000 for the
Service Science programs. Within Service Science, $3,500,000 is
recommended for White-Nose Syndrome research.
The Committee recognizes that snow machines are used for ac-
cess and for subsistence purposes in the winter over frozen water-
ways in rural Alaskan communities and directs the Service to brief
the Committee within 90 days of enacted regarding the Service’s
policy for snow machine access over waterways that are frozen in
the winter in National Wildlife Refuge areas within Alaska.
Stewardship Priorities.—The Committee recommends
$19,115,000 in congressionally directed spending for stewardship
projects to further conservation goals. Further detail on these
projects is provided in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending’’ accompanying this report.
General Operations.—The Committee recommends $138,211,000
for General Operations, including $41,275,000 for Servicewide Bill
Paying; $24,657,000 for Central Office Operations; and $36,983,000
for Management and Administration. The recommendation includes
$5,500,000 for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and rec-
ommends $26,500,000 for the National Conservation Training Cen-
ter. Continued funding is recommended for the Native Coordination
Office at the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The bill continues several administrative provisions from pre-
vious fiscal years.
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
Since the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, the Na-
tional Park System has grown to encompass 433 sites spanning
more than 85 million acres in all 50 States, the District of Colum-
bia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The
National Park Service [Service], created in 1916, is charged with
preserving these sites ‘‘unimpaired for the enjoyment of future gen-
erations.’’ The Service and its employees also contribute to the pro-
tection of other historical, cultural, and recreational resources
through a variety of grant and technical assistance programs. More
than 330 million people visit National Park units each year.
Since the enactment of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public
Law 116–152) [GAOA], the Service has had an unprecedented op-
portunity to make investments into addressing backlog mainte-
nance of critical park infrastructure. The Legacy Restoration Fund,
as authorized in GAOA, expired in fiscal year 2025. The Committee
looks forward to the prompt reauthorization of the Legacy Restora-
tion Fund to continue to address the deferred maintenance backlog
needs on our public lands and further invest in our National treas-
ures.
The Committee recommends a total of $3,270,057,000 for the Na-
tional Park Service.
OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,894,424,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,869,424,000
The Committee recommends $2,869,424,000 for the operation of
the National Park System.
The recommendation provides funding for base operations, spe-
cifically for the purpose of maintaining operations and access to
Service units and sites. Offsets are taken from non-base project ac-
counts.
Additional program changes are in the table that accompanies
the Committee report.
Resource Stewardship.—The Committee recommends
$398,820,000 for resource stewardship. Within the Resource Stew-
ardship program, $2,000,000 is provided to address active forest
management at national parks, $6,500,000 is provided to address
quagga and zebra mussels, $800,000 is provided for Cave and
Karst Ecosystem Research, and $400,000 is provided to fund Alas-
ka subsistence activities. Funding for the partnership wild and sce-
nic river program is provided $5,648,000.
Visitor Services.—The Committee recommends $279,535,000 for
visitor services. The recommendation includes funding for the Na-
tional Capital Performing Arts program at the enacted level. The
recommendation also includes no less than $2,400,000 for efforts to
expand recreational fishing, camping, and instruction focusing on
introductory recreation experiences in parks throughout the year in
40
a variety of recreational activities such as paddling, climbing, hik-
ing, cycling, snowshoeing, and surfing. The recommendation pro-
vides the enacted level for funding volunteers in parks programs,
interpretation and education programs, and youth partnership pro-
grams. The recommendation also provides not less than the en-
acted level for the Indian Youth Service Corps.
Park Protection.—The Committee recommends $430,176,000 for
park protection. Within the amounts provided, the Committee rec-
ommends $950,000 for veterans’ fire corps.
Mount Rushmore National Memorial Law Enforcement.—The
Committee is concerned about law enforcement staffing levels at
Mount Rushmore National Memorial and notes the need for addi-
tional full-time law enforcement officers to enhance visitor safety,
protect the monument, and effectively manage increased visitation.
The Committee encourages the National Park Service to prioritize
funding for these additional law enforcement positions within
available resources. The Committee also requests that the Service
provide a briefing to the Committee about law enforcement staffing
needs within 90 days.
Facility Operations and Maintenance.—The Committee rec-
ommends $914,164,000 for facility operations and maintenance.
The Committee recognizes the importance of investing in maintain-
ing park infrastructure and preventing future backlogs and there-
fore recommends $188,184,000 for cyclic maintenance, equal to the
enacted level, and $110,980,000 for repair and rehabilitation
projects.
Park Support.—The Committee recommends $651,517,000 for
park support. The Committee recommends $15,000,000 in match-
ing program funds for the National Park Foundation within the
Operation of the National Park System.
Cumberland Island National Seashore.—The Committee urges
the Service to prioritize staffing at Cumberland Island National
Seashore so that the Service can continue to maintain facilities,
law enforcement capacity, and natural and cultural resources.
External Administrative Costs.—The Committee recommends
$195,212,000 for external administrative costs, and encourages the
National Park Service to consistently and effectively recoup all po-
tential reimbursements. The funding level reflects the Service’s in-
tention to expand the use of these recoupments and will not have
any impact on Service operations.
NPS Staffing.—While national parks generate billions of dollars
of economic output annually for the U.S. economy that helps boost
States, localities, and tribes, visiting a national park is often a
‘‘bucket list’’ adventure or a once in a lifetime opportunity for some.
The Committee is concerned about actions that could potentially
lessen Americans’ ability to visit parks or have a safe experience
while visiting parks, and that otherwise could depreciate the value
of time spent exploring some of America’s great natural wonders.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act, and monthly thereafter,
the Department and the Service are directed to brief the Com-
mittee on park operations, to include staffing levels by park, visitor
data by park, and other data necessary to convince the Committee
that operations and natural and cultural resource protection have
41
not been and will not be deleteriously affected in an effort to make
parks operate more efficiently.
Adaptive Recreation Equipment.—The Committee supports the
Service’s work in expanding accessible options for outdoor recre-
ation, including through partnerships with external organizations
to ensure that adaptive recreation equipment is available for use
by visitors with disabilities. The Committee encourages the Service
to prioritize ways to provide more opportunities for more visitors
to explore more areas of the outdoors.
Appalachian National Scenic Trail.—The Appalachian National
Scenic Trail is a 2,190-mile linear park stretching through 14
States and 88 counties, more than any other unit of the National
Park System. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail draws visitors
from all over the United States and the world, bolstering the econ-
omy of the communities along the trail. The Committee is aware
that the Trail is experiencing increased visitation and encourages
the Service to include sufficient resources in future budget requests
to meet its expanded visitor services, law enforcement, compliance,
and land acquisition requirements.
Beaver Conservation.—The Committee encourages the Service to
prioritize restoration of current and historic riparian areas in ways
that support beaver populations, use infrastructure that is beaver
friendly, allow for beavers to construct dams and otherwise influ-
ence water flow in lieu of hard infrastructure where appropriate,
and is mindful of the ways in which beavers can influence a land-
scape.
Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.—The Service is
directed to prioritize activities that will advance development of the
Park, including the acquisition of key sites as outlined in the law
and restoration of historic sites. The Committee believes the acqui-
sition of Slater Mill’s historic dam will contribute positively to the
cultural, natural, and recreational resource base of the Park. The
Service shall brief the Committee on its plan to fulfill this directive
within 60 days of enactment of this act.
Chesapeake Bay Office.—The National Park Service Chesapeake
Bay office carries out activities and responsibilities related to ex-
panding public access to the Bay and serves as the lead agency on
several multi-State and Federal goals as a part of the 2014 Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed Agreement. The Committee supports oper-
ational funding for the Chesapeake Bay Office in order to meet the
goals established by the Bay Watershed Agreement.
Chilkoot Trail.—The Service is expected to continue to keep the
Committee apprised of administrative barriers to completing the
full length of the Chilkoot Trail in Klondike Gold Rush National
Historical Park and efforts to restore full public access to this trail
along the U.S.-Canada Border.
Dark Skies and Natural Sounds Data.—The Committee directs
the National Park Service to maintain and properly store Dark
Skies and Natural Sounds Data, which is used to support every na-
tional park in the country to minimize light and noise pollution
both for the visitor experience and impacts on wildlife. If the Serv-
ice is unable to continue this critical work, the Committee directs
the National Park Service to transfer the Dark Skies and Natural
Sounds Data to another Federal agency.
42
Denali.—The Committee recognizes the mountain located at 6
63°04’12N, by 151°00’18W, in the State of Alaska, as Denali and
includes a provision in the bill that prohibits the use of funds for
the purposes of naming the mountain anything other than Denali.
Director’s Order 21.—The Committee expects the Service to con-
tinue to implement Director’s Order 21.
National Lakeshores.—The Committee appreciates the Service’s
allocation of partial funding for improving trails in freshwater Na-
tional Lakeshores, including for ADA accessibility. The Committee
encourages the Service to, dependent on available funding,
prioritize completing funding for the project once the full cost is
known and construction documents are complete. The Service is di-
rected to keep the Committee updated on developments related to
this project.
New Philadelphia National Historic Site.—The Committee di-
rects the Service to ensure that park operations begin in a reason-
able timeframe and to keep the Committee apprised of develop-
ments related to the site.
Newly-Designated National Scenic Trails.—The Committee notes
the designation of three new national scenic trails as units of the
park system, including the Ice Age, the New England, and the
North Country National Scenic Trails. The Committee notes that
the Service has incorporated ongoing funding for these newly des-
ignated trails into the Service’s base operations budget and directs
the Service to ensure that commensurate access to resources is pro-
vided to them.
Roosevelt-Campobello International Park Commission.—Funding
for the Roosevelt Campobello International Park is provided as re-
quested. The Service is directed to continue to follow the direction
contained in the statement of managers accompanying the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114–113) concerning
the submission of future budget requests for the Roosevelt-Campo-
bello International Park.
Springfield Race Riot.—The Committee directs the National Park
Service to work with the community to complete the Foundation
Document for the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National Monument.
The Committee also directs NPS to keep the Committee informed
on the progress being made at the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Na-
tional Monument with quarterly reports beginning 90 days after
enactment.
Theodore Roosevelt National Park.—The Committee notes the
Service’s decision to terminate the Livestock Plan Environmental
Assessment and appreciates the decision to continue maintaining a
genetically diverse herd of horses in the park commensurate with
the historic herds during the period when President Theodore Roo-
sevelt was a rancher in the area. The Committee supports the long-
term genetic viability of the herd and directs the Service to com-
plete a full Population Viability Analysis [PVA] of the herd and
brief the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.—The Committee en-
courages the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park
Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to work with the Theo-
dore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation to support loans of
historic, educational, artistic, natural and other museum collec-
43
tions, particularly those not on display to the public. The loans
should be consistent with existing law and policy, including such
terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary for the
preservation and exhibition of such collections.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $89,593,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 91,596,000
The Committee recommends $91,596,000 for national recreation
and preservation programs.
Natural Programs.—The Committee recommends $18,579,000 for
natural programs.
Cultural Programs.—The Committee recommends $39,327,000
for cultural programs. The Committee recognizes the importance of
supporting Native culture and arts development, which contributes
to maintaining the cultural diversity of the Nation and the cultural
survival of the regional indigenous populations. The Committee is
concerned with the reduction of mission-critical staff for Cultural
Programs at the Service and encourages the office to achieve staff-
ing levels that will allow it to provide robust technical assistance
and oversight for cultural program activities.
Funding is also recommended for grants to nonprofit organiza-
tions or institutions for the purpose of supporting programs for Na-
tive Hawaiian or Alaska Native culture and arts development at a
total program level of $2,750,000. Native American Graves Protec-
tion and Repatriation Act (Public Law 101–601) grants are pro-
vided $3,407,000, grants to preserve and interpret Japanese Amer-
ican Confinement Sites as authorized by the Norman K. Mineta
Japanese American Confinement Education Act are provided
$4,655,000, grants administration is provided $3,597,000, and other
cultural programs are funded at the enacted level.
9/11 Memorial Competitive Grant Program.—The Committee
recommends $4,000,000 for the competitive grant program author-
ized by the 9/11 Memorial Act (Public Law 115–413).
Heritage Partnership Programs.—The Committee recommends
$30,985,000 for heritage partnership programs. This level of fund-
ing provides $29,919,500 for grants to national heritage areas and
$1,065,000 to administer the program. The Committee rec-
44
ommendation increases funding to reflect newly designated herit-
age areas; and merges funding for the existing Blackstone River
Valley National Heritage Corridor into the program at the prior
funding level within the Heritage Partnership Program.
Each National Heritage Area has been designated by Congress in
law for its unique and nationally significant qualities and re-
sources. The Committee reminds the Service of the critical impor-
tance of providing Federal funds under the National Heritage Area
Act to National Heritage Areas in a timely manner to avoid any
undue impacts on the operations and activities of National Herit-
age Areas.
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
Grants.—The Committee recommends $3,407,000 for Native Amer-
ican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act grants. The Com-
mittee finds that the Service must work to maximize the impact of
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
[NAGPRA] grants to expedite and assist federally recognized
Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, museums, institutions
of higher education, and other affected entities in achieving compli-
ance with the implementing regulations that went into effect on
January 12, 2024 (43 CFR 10). The Committee notes that more
than 400 museums nationwide are now working under a tight
timeline to meet existing requirements to update inventories under
the new rule and that annual compliance estimates are in at least
the tens of millions of dollars. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to consider raising the ceiling on the maximum NAGPRA
grant amount to support expeditious disposition of the maximum
number of human remains and funerary, sacred, and patrimonial
objects.
Not later than 30 days after enactment of this act, and monthly
thereafter, the National Park Service shall provide a detailed re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate detailing any and all funding allo-
cated, committed, transferred, reprogrammed, or otherwise shifted
or set aside for the planning or procurement of statues or other ac-
tivities as described in Executive Order 13934 (85 Fed. Reg. 41165;
relating to building and rebuilding monuments to American he-
roes), Executive Order 13978 (86 Fed. Reg. 6809; relating to build-
ing the National Garden of American Heroes), and Executive Order
14189 (90 Fed. Reg. 8849; relating to celebrating America’s birth-
day), including the accounts, agencies, or offices originally holding
such funds, the authorities cited for allocating, committing, trans-
ferring, reprogramming, or otherwise shifting or setting aside such
funding, the accounts, agencies, or offices currently managing such
funds, and any obligations and expenditures made of such funds.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $168,900,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 168,246,000
The Committee recommends $168,246,000 for the Historic Pres-
ervation Fund [HPF]. Program changes are in the comprehensive
table that accompanies the Committee report.
The Committee recommendation provides $62,150,000 for grants-
in-aid to States and territories and $23,750,000 for grants-in-aid to
Tribes to reflect an increase in Tribal Historic Preservation Officers
[THPO] and to maintain fiscal year 2024 enacted funding for each
existing THPO. The recommendation also provides $11,000,000 for
preservation grants for Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities; $5,000,000 for History of Equal Rights grants; and
$1,250,000 in grants for underrepresented communities. The Com-
mittee also reminds the Service of the critical importance of pro-
viding Federal funds under HPF to States and Tribes in a timely
manner to avoid any undue impacts on State Historic Preservation
Officers and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers that could slow
survey, evaluation, and nomination processes for the National Reg-
ister and create unnecessary delays for infrastructure and other
projects by hindering the Section 106 process under the National
Historic Preservation Act. Therefore, the Service is directed by 120
days after enactment of this act to award the funds under HPF.
The Committee is concerned with the reduction of mission-crit-
ical staff for cultural programs at the Service and encourages the
fund to achieve staffing levels that will allow it to provide robust
technical assistance and oversight for cultural program activities.
African American Civil Rights Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommends $24,000,000 for African American Civil Rights grants.
The program documents, interprets, and preserves sites and stories
related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights as
citizens.
Save America’s Treasures.—The Save America’s Treasures pro-
gram is provided $25,500,000. The Committee supports this pro-
gram because of its important role in providing preservation and
conservation assistance to nationally significant historical prop-
erties and collections.
Historic Preservation Fund Projects.—The Committee rec-
ommends $15,596,000 in congressionally directed spending for his-
47
toric preservation projects, each of which the Committee has con-
firmed is listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a
National Historic Landmark pursuant to the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.).
CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $172,255,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 140,791,000
The Committee recommends $140,791,000 for construction re-
quirements for the National park system. As noted previously, the
Committee looks forward to the prompt reauthorization of the Leg-
acy Restoration Fund to continue to address the deferred mainte-
nance backlog needs on our public lands.
Within the funds provided in this bill, $55,520,000 is provided for
line item construction and maintenance. Requests for reprogram-
ming will be considered pursuant to the guidelines in the front of
this report.
The Committee has not received the detailed budget justification
for the National Park Service for fiscal year 2026, which the Com-
mittee expects will follow longstanding practice to include a project
and funding list along with detailed project data sheets for line
item construction projects that will be ready for construction and
recommended for fiscal year 2026 funding.
When the Committee receives this updated list, the Committee
intends to specify each line item construction project in a final, full-
year funding bill, consistent with longstanding practice.
The Committee recommends a total of $3,848,000 in funding for
emergency and unscheduled projects within base funding. These
funds support the Service in responding after facilities and re-
sources are damaged or destroyed in emergencies.
Denali National Park Road.—The Committee recognizes the
Service is continuing to make progress on restoring access to
Kantishna following the Pretty Rocks landslide damage and appre-
ciates that the Service continues to ensure the project has the re-
sources necessary to ensure completion without delay. This in-
cludes planning and resource allocation to address road damage
and deferred maintenance along the transportation corridor from
milepost 43 to milepost 92. The Service is encouraged to perform
preliminary surveys of this road area and to develop a plan to
promptly address road maintenance needs upon completion of the
bridge at Polychrome Pass.
Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.—The Committee supports
the ongoing efforts to develop the Fort Vancouver National Historic
Site for long-term usage. The building and grounds restoration pro-
vides the benefits of preserving a historic site, providing leased
space for the use of Federal and other entities, and improving the
Site for the enjoyment of the public. Further, the Committee notes
that Tribes have had a strong presence in this area since time im-
memorial. The Service is reminded of their responsibility to give
consideration to Tribal proposals, recommendations, and knowledge
that affect management decisions on a Tribe’s former homelands.
The Service is directed to consult with any Tribes within 20 miles
of Fort Vancouver and incorporate feedback during the production
of any Traditional Use Studies. Further, the Committee directs the
48
Service to evaluate co-stewardship of the Fort Vancouver National
Historic Site with any Tribes located within 20 miles. Within 90
days after the enactment of this act, the Service shall provide a re-
port to the Committee on Tribal consultation efforts, progress made
towards rehabilitation, and specific, actionable plans for the next
phase of rehabilitation and expanded use at the site.
Hurricane Ridge Day Lodge.—The Committee recognizes the im-
mense historical and recreational loss of the Hurricane Ridge Day
Lodge due to a fire in 2023. The lodge welcomed 300,000 visitors
every year and provided important facilities for Olympic National
Park staff. The Committee notes that emergency funding has been
provided to rebuild the lodge, including temporary facilities to
maintain visitor and staff safety during construction due to harsh
conditions at the site and high volume of visitors. The Service’s
prior estimate for the project was approximately $80,000,000. The
Committee urges the Service to prioritize reconstruction of this
center and directs the Service to engage with impacted commu-
nities on the Olympic Peninsula, provide robust outreach to those
communities, and continue keeping the Committee informed of con-
struction timelines.
CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $12,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 12,000,000
The Committee recommendation does not include new appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2026; however, a total of $12,000,000 is made
available from unobligated balances for fiscal year 2026 operations.
ENERGY AND MINERALS
U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Established in 1879, the U.S. Geological Survey [the Survey]
serves as the Earth and natural science research bureau for the
Department of the Interior and isthe only integrated natural re-
sources research bureau in the Federal Government. The Survey
conducts research, monitoring, and assessments to contribute to
understanding America’s lands, water, and biological resources. Its
research and data products support the Department’s resource and
land management needs and also provide the water, biological, en-
ergy, and mineral resources information needed by other Federal,
State, Tribal, and local government agencies to guide planning,
management, and regulatory programs. Scientists, technicians, and
support staff of the Survey are located in nearly 400 offices in
every State and in several foreign countries throughout the world.
The Survey leverages its resources and expertise in partnership
with more than 2,000 agencies of Federal, State, local, and Tribal
governments; the academic community; nongovernmental organiza-
tions; and the private sector.
SURVEYS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,450,197,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,485,354,000
49
The Committee recommends $1,485,354,000 for the U.S. Geologi-
cal Survey Program changes, instruction, and details follow below
and in the table accompanying this report.
Ecosystems.—The Committee recommends $307,947,000 for Eco-
systems. Program elements of this mission area follow below.
Environmental Health Program.—The Committee recommends
$30,543,000 to the Environmental Health Program. The bill con-
tinues funding for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS] re-
search at no less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Com-
mittee commends the Survey for its support of research to under-
stand the impact of PFAS contamination, accumulation and expo-
sure in the ecosystems of the Ceded Territories of the Great Lakes
Region and recommends $1,000,000 to support existing research
into regulated contaminants present in Tribal lands and ceded ter-
ritories, as well as traditionally grown and consumed plants and
animals, in response to finalized water quality standards.
6PPD.—The Committee is concerned with the impact that 6p-
phenylene-diameine [6PPD] and its transformant, 6PPD-quinone
[6PPD-q], are having on aquatic ecosystems. Stormwater runoff
containing 6PPD-q has been linked to mass die-offs of endangered
and threatened salmon across the Puget Sound and San Francisco
Bay areas. The Committee supports the Survey’s research on the
fate and transport of tire-wear particles, along with how 6PPD and
6PPD-q impact aquatic species in both marine and freshwater envi-
ronments. The Committee directs the Survey to continue coordi-
nating across Federal and State agencies on shared priorities, and
to engage in robust government-to-government consultation with
impacted Tribes. The Survey is directed to provide a report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on 6PPD-related
activities, including the Survey’s current strategy, an overview of
research work completed to date, a plan for addressing potential
data gaps, recommendations for future research activities, and po-
tential funding sources.
Plastics.—The Survey is urged to emphasize plastics research, in-
cluding microplastics and nanoplastics research, in its environ-
mental health strategic vision. The Committee encourages the Sur-
vey to review current plastic science gaps and to brief the Com-
mittee within 45 days after release of the review.
Species Management Research Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $62,348,000 for the Species Management Research Pro-
gram. The Committee is aware of long-term hydrological and eco-
logical challenges associated with saline lakes in the Great Basin
States and encourages the Survey to address related science needs
in tandem with the Integrated Water Availability Assessment for
saline lakes that is provided for under the Water Resources mis-
sion area. The Committee directs the Survey to respond to the ur-
gent needs of critically endangered Hawaiian forest birds which
face threats from non-native mosquitoes that carry avian malaria
and other pathogens lethal to these birds. Further, the Committee
encourages cooperative research with the Atlantic, Gulf, Pacific,
and Great Lakes interstate/international fishery commissions to
address state and Department of the Interior science priorities, in-
cluding climate considerations that emphasize actionable science in
support of fisheries management. The Committee directs the De-
50
partment to prioritize projects that include a combination of state,
commission, and Survey scientists. These funds shall supplement
not supplant current funding for Survey Science Centers.
Land Management Research Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $52,000,000 for the Land Management Research Pro-
gram. The Committee is aware of the work the Survey is per-
forming in critical landscapes, such as the Arctic, Puget Sound,
California Bay Delta, Everglades, Great Lakes, Columbia River,
and the Chesapeake Bay, and expects this work to continue.
Biological Threats and Invasive Species Research Program.—The
Committee recommends $49,470,000 for the Biological Threats and
Invasive Species Research Program.
The Committee recommends $11,000,000 to address Invasive
Carp issues in the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi River Basin.
In order to effectively control the spread of Invasive Carp, the Com-
mittee expects all six sub-basins of the Mississippi River Basin will
be included in funding opportunities.
The Committee remains concerned by the rapid and growing in-
vasion of European green crab around the country, including in the
Pacific Northwest, and provides $800,000 for invasive European
green crab research. Further, the Survey and its Federal partners
are directed to jointly brief the Committee no later than 90 days
after enactment of this act on their collective efforts to address Eu-
ropean green crab.
The bill continues the direction contained in Senate Report 118–
83 regarding chronic wasting disease [CWD] and provides
$9,970,000, to research the predominant pathways and mecha-
nisms of the transmission of chronic wasting disease in wild, cap-
tive, and farmed populations of cervids in North America. In car-
rying out this and other research, USGS may consult, partner, or
contract with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
State and Federal public and private entities, and any chronic
wasting disease task forces and working groups. In particular, the
Committee encourages research and investment into carcass dis-
posal methods to mitigate the spread of chronic wasting disease
and recommends that the relevant agencies work in consultation
with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, and the States to develop and provide rec-
ommendations for carcass disposal methods which are compliant
with relevant Federal clean air and water and solid waste regula-
tions. The Committee also encourages USGS to work in partner-
ship with the Fish and Wildlife Service to aid state wildlife agen-
cies in the application of existing human dimensions research to
the management and prevention of chronic wasting disease.
The Committee notes the grave ecological threats and public nui-
sance posed by many invasive species and directs the Survey to
prioritize research, detection, and response efforts on invasive spe-
cies with extremely high impacts on natural resources, native wild-
life populations, and public access and enjoyment, including Bur-
mese Pythons in the Florida Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp,
as well as Lionfish in the Gulf of America, Caribbean, and South
Atlantic waters.
Climate Adaptation Science Center and Land Change Science
Program.—The Committee recommends $81,780,000 for the Cli-
51
mate Adaptation Science Center and Land Change Science Pro-
gram. Of this amount, $62,115,000 is provided for National and Re-
gional Climate Adaptation Science Centers activities and
$19,665,000 is provided for Land Change Science activities.
Cooperative Research Units Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $31,806,000 for the Cooperative Research Units Program.
The Committee notes that Cooperative Research Units [CRUs]
have served as a cooperative network with Interior partners to im-
prove and increase youth involvement and graduate education in
science and resources management. Of the funds provided,
$1,600,000 shall be used to establish two new CRUs at a land-
grant or sea-grant institution within States that do not have a Fish
or Wildlife CRU. Priority should be given to funding a CRU that
can serve the diverse array of terrestrial ecosystems that encom-
pass those located within the Tennessee River Basin, from the Ap-
palachian Mountains to the Mississippi Delta, and the Chesapeake
Bay.
Great Lakes Science Center.—The Committee supports the Great
Lakes Science Center’s collaboration with the broader Great Lakes
Partnership to implement priority science. These resources will en-
sure delivery of information needed for Great Lakes management
decisions. The Committee expects this work to continue at the fis-
cal year 2024 enacted level.
Energy and Minerals Resources.—The Committee recommends
$110,594,000 for Energy and Mineral Resources. The Committee
recommends $69,729,000 for the Mineral Resources Program.
Geothermal Resources.—The Committee recommends $6,000,000
for a State-by-State assessment to quantify prospective geothermal
resources. The assessment should quantify prospective geothermal
resources nationwide, including resources that could be used for en-
hanced geothermal systems, deep closed-loop systems, and systems
that harness heat from temperatures at which water becomes
supercritical, and at varying depths, including depths of at least 9
kilometers, consistent with current law. The Committee remains
concerned over the lack of geothermal data available and progress
by the Survey for acquiring geothermal resource data in Alaska
and Hawaii. The Committee recommends an additional $2,500,000,
which shall be available for geothermal assessments and data col-
lection and modeling for geothermal resources located in Alaska
and Hawaii.
Earth MRI.—The Committee recommends $10,848,000 for the
Earth Mapping Resources Initiative [Earth MRI] in support of a
prioritized nationwide program of topographic, geologic, and geo-
physical mapping to enhance understanding of the Nation’s min-
eral resource potential to better manage the supply of critical min-
erals. The Committee continues the direction contained in Senate
Report 118–83. The Committee urges the Survey, when developing
critical mineral maps, to consider other sensitive resources such as
sacred Tribal sites, sensitive watersheds, critical habitat, and other
areas with special designations, and prioritize mapping in those
areas that do not conflict with other previously identified sensitive
resources. The Committee expects critical mineral mapping efforts
in Alaska to continue, pursuant to the budget request, at no less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level and directs the Survey to
52
brief the Committee on such efforts within 90 days of enactment
of this act.
Energy Resources.—The Committee recommends $40,865,000 for
the Energy Resources Program. The Committee recommends a
comprehensive geologic mapping and study on lithium resources
and recovery in an area of the U.S. with a large concentration of
lithium resources and where there is infrastructure to develop the
commercial manufacturing ecosystem.
Tribal Engagement on Energy Development on Tribal Lands.—
The Committee recognizes the importance of an energy strategy
that includes potential energy development on Tribal lands for im-
proving the domestic mineral supply chain to further national en-
ergy capabilities. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department
of the Interior to engage with Tribal communities on activities that
assess the comprehensive resource potential and impacts of devel-
opment on Tribal Lands, including lands owned by an Alaska Na-
tive Corporation, in Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota,
New Mexico, Montana, Colorado, Alaska, and Arizona.
Mineral Resources.—The Committee directs the Survey to explore
the inclusion of items on the Department of Energy [DOE] Critical
Materials list and the Department of Defense [DOD] Critical and
Strategical Materials list on the Survey’s Critical Mineral List.
Further, the Committee directs the Survey to provide a report to
the Committee not later than 120 days after the enactment of this
act that discusses the methodologies used to determine which new
critical minerals shall be added and a plan to collaborate with DOE
and DOD on future updates.
Natural Hazards.—The Committee recommends $209,439,000 for
Natural Hazards. Program elements of this mission area follow
below.
Earthquake Hazards Program.—The Committee recommends
$100,201,000 for the Earthquake Hazards Program. The Com-
mittee recommends no less than $36,850,000, which is $6,800,000
above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level, for the continued develop-
ment, operations, and maintenance of the ShakeAlert earthquake
early warning [EEW] system as well as the timely processing of
station permits and License to Operate applications. The Com-
mittee supports continued efforts to complete and operate the EEW
system on the West Coast and of the funds provided, the Com-
mittee recommends that no less than $4,000,000 be used to begin
the expansion of the ShakeAlert Earthquake Early Warning sys-
tem to Alaska, following the details in the recent Phase 1 Technical
Implementation Plan. The Committees direct the Survey to work
with States to secure any additional funding necessary. Further,
the Committee notes that the Survey has provided a 50-state Na-
tional Seismic Hazard Map and encourages the Survey to explore
the possibility of aligning future updates for States and territories
into one unified and comprehensive model.
The Committee provides $3,450,000 for Subduction Zone Science,
supporting implementation of the Survey’s Subduction Zone science
plan, which would improve the understanding of risks posed to vul-
nerable communities in subduction zone environments, including
near the Cascadia subduction zone, and deliver scientific informa-
tion and tools for disaster risk reduction. The Committee supports
53
the Survey’s ongoing efforts to develop novel techniques and tech-
nologies to efficiently and accurately monitor seafloor faults. The
Committee supports the historic partnership on earthquake re-
search between the National Science Foundation [NSF] and the
Survey. With NSF’s Subduction Zone Earthquake Center, the Com-
mittee encourages the Survey to continue its support of the current
center.
The Committee continues funding at no less than the fiscal year
2024 enacted level for regional networks that acquired USArray
stations from the National Science Foundation for operations and
maintenance as these networks work to incorporate and use all
Earthscope data. The Committee recommends funding of at least
the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for operations and maintenance
of regional networks, including earthquake early warning. The
Committee recommends $2,160,000 for National Seismic Hazard
Model Improvements and Updates.
Volcano Hazards Program.—The Committee recommends
$38,500,000 for the Volcano Hazards Program. The Survey is com-
pleting the two prerequisite steps to National Volcano Early Warn-
ing and Monitoring System [NVEWS] upgrades and is encouraged
to accelerate the pace of these activities where possible. The Com-
mittee recommends $19,349,000 for NVEWS. The Committee fur-
ther recommends the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for Volcanic
Hazards Assessments. The Committee remains concerned that sys-
tems and equipment used to monitor, detect, and warn the public
of volcanic hazards, including volcano-related earthquakes and
lahars on high-threat volcanoes, are outdated and inadequate. The
recommended funding supports efforts to repair, upgrade, and ex-
pand systems and equipment that monitor, detect, and provide
early warning of volcanic hazards with a focus on high-threat vol-
canoes.
Landslide Hazards Program.—The Committee directs the Survey
to fund the Landslide Hazards Program at no less than
$16,685,000 which includes funding at the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level for the Cooperative Landslide Hazards and Assessment Com-
petitive Grant Program. Within funds provided, $1,000,000 is for
deployment, operation, and maintenance of detection and moni-
toring systems in high-risk areas, including Southeast Alaska. In
light of the increasing frequency of catastrophic wildfires, the Com-
mittee encourages the Survey to prioritize efforts to predict and re-
duce the risk of post-wildfire landslides. The Committee directs the
Survey to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to complete its landslides data for Alaska on its Risk Index Maps.
The Committee also directs the Survey to continue to collaborate
with the Interagency Landslide Working Group in Southeast Alas-
ka as well as Alaska State and local governments to assess land-
slide potential and hazards. Within the provided funds, no less
than $1,500,000 shall be used for collaborating with local and re-
gional entities in Alaska, particularly areas with heightened risk
like those communities in Prince William Sound and Southeast
Alaska, and to deploy, operate, and maintain landslide detection
and monitoring systems in high-risk areas. The Committee also di-
rects the Survey to collaborate with local and Indigenous people
and entities to support and maintain landslide monitoring systems
54
and to collaborate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration and State and local governments to assess landslide
potential and hazards.
Further, the Committee directs the Survey to provide informa-
tion to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act re-
garding the cost of creating an Interagency Landslide Observing
System with participants from Federal, State, Tribal, and munic-
ipal entities for the purpose of creating a cohesive landslide moni-
toring system in areas where emerging landslide hazards pose
threats to communities.
Geomagnetism Program.—The Committee recommends
$5,198,000 for the Geomagnetism Program. The Committee rec-
ommends at least the fiscal year 2024 enacted level to advance the
collection of magnetotelluric observations of the Earth’s naturally
occurring electric and magnetic fields in U.S. regions.
Coastal Hazards Program.—The Committee recommends
$41,855,000 for the Coastal Hazards Program to support coastal re-
silience, risk reduction, and blue carbon across a diverse landscape
of communities. Of the funding recommended, the Committee rec-
ommends $2,500,000 for supporting deep sea mapping and charac-
terization of critical mineral resources in Outer Continental Shelf
areas in the Pacific.
Water Resources.—The Committee recommends $291,802,000 for
Water Resources. Program elements of this mission area follow
below.
Water Availability and Use Science Program.—The Committee
recommends $68,296,000 for the Water Availability and Use
Science Program. The recommendation includes the fiscal year
2024 enacted levels for integrated water prediction to continue to
utilize the best available technology to develop advanced modeling
tools, state-of-the-art forecasts, and decision support systems and
to incorporate these capabilities into daily water operations.
The Committee recommends an additional $2,000,000 within
Water Availability and Use Science program to pursue cooperative
research agreements with land grant universities for water man-
agement and mineral recovery in arid and semi-arid regions of the
country impacted by very high levels of brine water.
The Committee recommends $2,000,000 to support an Integrated
Water Availability Assessment [IWAA] in the Mississippi Alluvial
Plain [MAP]. The MAP IWAA will focus on delivery of a ground-
water model-based decision support system to support water sus-
tainability decision-making and a basin-wide model and monitoring
program for irrigation water-use.
The Committee recommends $1,750,000 to the Survey for the re-
gional Integrated Water Availability Assessment study program to
expand the assessment and monitoring of the hydrology of saline
lakes in the Great Basin and the migratory birds and other wildlife
dependent on those habitats.
The Committee continues $1,000,000 in funding for the U.S.-
Mexico transboundary aquifer project.
The Committee encourages cooperation with western state water
resource agencies facing challenges with long-term water sustain-
ability as a result of increasing drought conditions. The Committee
directs the Survey to dedicate resources to enhance cooperation
55
with western state water resource agencies through respective
State Water Science Centers which possess local and regional
water science expertise that is urgently needed to help Western
States adapt to a changing climate.
The Committee understands the importance of the Ogallala Aq-
uifer and the declines in water levels seen in recent measurements.
The Survey is directed to develop recommendations to establish a
consortium of state water resource management agencies to im-
prove and coordinate study on the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides
drinking water to over two million people in the United States. By
coordinating across States and with the Survey’s Water Resources
Mission Area, researchers will be able to pool research expertise
and resources to more effectively understand and manage hydro-
logic changes in the aquifer to ensure the future availability of
water in the region.
No less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level is provided for Co-
operative Matching Funds.
National Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program.—
The Committee recommends $112,006,000 for the National Ground-
water and Streamflow Information Program. The Survey is encour-
aged to work with research organizations and the power industry
to identify and address critical information gaps to better prepare
for adverse stream conditions that can threaten reliable generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity.
The recommendation includes $29,500,000 to continue with the
Next Generation Water Observing System [NGWOS], and the Com-
mittee recommends no less than fiscal year 2024 enacted levels to
work with universities and other partners to develop innovative
water resource sensor technologies that are scalable to regional and
national monitoring network operations. The Committee rec-
ommends continued support of streamgages along the Ohio River
at the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Committee continues to
support projects to ensure the highest priority advancements in
water monitoring systems are being addressed and continues the
direction contained in Senate Report 118–83.
The Committee recommends $3,870,000 to support and maintain
operational capacity of existing streamgages and water quality and
ecological assessments on certain transboundary rivers, including
those at risk from mining pollution originating in Canada, includ-
ing in the Kootenai watershed. This includes at least $120,000 for
the streamgage on the Unuk River; and fiscal year 2024 enacted
levels for expanded water quality monitoring and analysis efforts
in the Kootenai watershed to support interagency efforts to evalu-
ate and reduce transboundary pollution through the installation of
new streamgages, expanded analyses, and related activities. The
Committee directs the Survey to continue to expand its streamgage
monitoring of transboundary watersheds and to work with the En-
vironmental Protection Agency to ensure the relevant equipment is
deployed to the Kootenai watershed to support the Agency’s work
to evaluate and reduce transboundary pollution. The Committee
continues the direction that the Survey enter into a formal partner-
ship with local Tribes and other Federal agencies as necessary in
the area to develop a water quality strategy for the transboundary
rivers.
56
The Committee recognizes the ongoing monitoring of critical
water budget components in the Klamath Basin to provide the in-
formation needed to assess controls of inflow to Upper Klamath
Lake from surface water and groundwater, improve snowmelt pre-
diction, and forecast impacts of drought and other drivers on water
availability for both human and ecological uses and the Committee
recommends $3,000,000 to continue this expanded work.
Hydrological Science Talent Pipeline.—The Committee believes
that robust participation with universities in the hydrologic
sciences is essential to building a talent pipeline as well as building
capacity to support future hydrological research and operational ef-
forts. To support this, the bill maintains the fiscal year 2024 en-
acted level within the Water Availability and Use Science Program
and the National Groundwater and Streamflow Information Pro-
gram to pursue such cooperative research agreements, including
considering universities in Western States facing groundwater
management challenges to build capacity and expertise in ground-
water hydrologic sciences and locations where the Survey has pend-
ing hydrological facilities as well as where there are other Federal
operational hydrologic resources.
National Water Quality Program.—The Committee recommends
$96,000,000 for the National Water Quality Program.
Water Resources Research Act Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $15,500,000 for the Water Resources Research Act (Pub-
lic Law 88–379) Program.
Special Initiatives.—The Committee recommends $750,000 in
congressionally directed spending for Special Initiatives projects. A
detailed list of projects is included in the table titled ‘‘Congression-
ally Directed Spending’’ accompanying this report.
Core Science Systems.—The Committee recommends
$279,721,000 for Core Science Systems. The recommendation in-
cludes $117,071,000 for the National Land Imaging Program, of
which $95,334,000 is for satellite operations; $26,500,000 for the
Science Synthesis, Analysis, and Research Program; $43,500,000
for the National Cooperative Geological Mapping Program; and
$92,650,000 for the National Geospatial Program.
The National Geospatial Program Three-Dimension Elevation
Program [3DEP] is maintained at the fiscal year 2024 enacted
funding level. The Committee appreciates the progress made on
3DEP to allow for the integration of current elevation and hydrog-
raphy data and expects this progress to continue. The Committee
recommends no less than $10,000,000 for the Alaska mapping and
map modernization initiative, which includes modernizing Alaskan
hydrography datasets. The National Geospatial Program will con-
tinue its role in advancing the goals, objectives, and approaches col-
laboratively developed as part of the AMEC Alaska Coastal Map-
ping Strategy, to include collection and distribution of topography
and orthoimagery in coastal areas. In addition, the Committee pro-
vides an additional $3,000,000 to support simulated space-based
LIDAR datasets. This technology facilitates modernizing
foundational mapping, disaster response, and natural resources in
Alaska, Florida, and Nevada.
National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Pro-
gram.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the National
57
Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program to preserve
critical data, improve the accessibility of geoscientific data, and
provide financial and technical support to State Geological Surveys,
along with the importance of making progress on the preservation
and archival of the substantial backlog of Federal and State geo-
logic samples.
The Committee recognizes the importance of the Remote Sensing
State Grants Program in providing technology, expertise and ac-
tionable data and analysis from satellites to address critical issues
spanning from health to security to agriculture to transportation to
emerging hazard threats and their potential impacts and to make
much-needed technological advances while also engaging students
to become the high-tech workforce of tomorrow throughout the
country. Therefore, the Committee recommends $1,500,000 above
the enacted level for remote sensing State grants.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Ad-
ministrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
to maintain the current superspectral three-satellite constellation
architecture, with a launch target by the end of 2031, to ensure un-
interrupted continuity of the Landsat data record.
Science Support.—The Committee recommends $105,000,000 for
Science Support. The recommendation includes $81,500,000 for the
Administration and Management Program, including $2,667,000
for the scientific partnerships with Tribes and Support for the En-
terprise Science initiative, consistent with the enacted level. The
recommendation includes $23,500,000 for the Information Services
Program.
Facilities.—The Committee recommends $180,101,000 for Facili-
ties. The recommendation includes $105,261,000 for rental pay-
ments and operations and maintenance and $74,840,000 for de-
ferred maintenance and capital improvement.

BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [Bureau or BOEM] is
responsible for resource evaluation, environmental review, leasing
activities, and lease management for the Nation’s offshore energy
and minerals resources.
OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $211,162,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 200,057,000
The Committee recommends $200,057,000 for Ocean Energy
Management. This amount will be partially offset with the collec-
tion of offsetting rental receipts and cost recovery fees totaling
$58,000,000. The detailed allocation of funding by program and ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report. Program
directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the fol-
lowing narrative.
Renewable Energy.—The Committee expects the Bureau to con-
tinue its legally required responsibilities in the administration of
the Renewable Energy Program. As the Bureau refines the offshore
wind permitting process, in order to facilitate responsible develop-
ment, it must include steps to understand existing ocean uses by
consulting early and often with the commercial fishing industry
and other stakeholders.
Offshore waters also contain cultural and natural resources of
significance and value to Tribal communities. The Committee ap-
preciates the Department’s commitment to Tribal co-stewardship
and expects the Bureau to work on effective engagement, incor-
porating Indigenous knowledge and Tribal input into decision-mak-
ing processes, and assisting Tribes to build capacity for active par-
ticipation in all stages of project development.
Due to the need for coordination and collaboration on regional re-
search and monitoring of the impacts to marine wildlife and habi-
tats, the Committee expects the Bureau to continue to work with
the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative as appropriate to sup-
port the priorities stated in the science plan, including a passive
acoustic monitoring network. Further, the Bureau should pursue
opportunities to expand public-private partnerships to leverage the
59
resources, expertise, and capacity in the private sector to provide
additional scientific data.
Conventional Energy.—The Committee expects the Bureau to ad-
vance the National OCS Program in an expeditious manner by
completing the sales of the 10th Program (Lease Sales 262, 263,
and 264) and developing the 11th program.
Carbon Sequestration.—The Committee strongly urges the Bu-
reau to publish the proposed rule on carbon, capture, and seques-
tration required by Public Law 117–58 by the end of calendar year
2025 and to provide a briefing to the Senate Committees on Appro-
priations and Energy and Natural Resources on the Bureau’s
progress toward meeting that deadline within 60 days of enactment
of this act and every 60 days thereafter until it is published.
Marine Minerals.—The Committee recognizes the strategic im-
portance of developing domestic sources of critical minerals and ex-
pects the Bureau to continue mineral assessments and activities.
The Committee further encourages the Bureau to facilitate timely
lease sales for critical minerals within the U.S. Outer Continental
Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zones, including in the Gulf of Amer-
ica Region and the Pacific. As part of this, the Bureau is expected
to explore potential mineral resources in deep water and imple-
ment new technologies in ocean exploration and sampling proc-
esses. The Bureau is further encouraged to maintain its partner-
ships with academia to characterize the environment of potential
marine mineral resources, utilizing universities and research insti-
tutions with expertise in deepwater exploration to evaluate mineral
deposits using technologies that minimize disturbance to the sea-
bed ecosystem.
BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT
The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement [Bureau
or BSEE] is responsible for regulating and enforcing safety, envi-
ronmental, and conservation compliance during the development of
the Nation’s ocean energy and mineral resources on the Outer Con-
tinental Shelf, and oil spill research.
OFFSHORE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $205,330,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 206,330,000
The Committee recommends $206,330,000 for Offshore Safety
and Environmental Enforcement. This amount will be partially off-
set with the collection of offsetting rental receipts, cost recovery
fees, and inspection fees, totaling $65,000,000. The detailed alloca-
tion of funding by program and activity is included in the table ac-
companying this report.
Offshore Decommissioning.—The Committee provides $3,880,000
for the Bureau to continue work to plug and abandon orphan infra-
structure, including orphan wells, platforms, and pipelines. The
Committee is providing these funds to provide the Bureau with a
foundation to allow it to be most efficient and consistent in con-
tracting this work, however, expects that once current identified
decommissioning needs are provided for, the line item for decom-
missioning activities will be discontinued.
60
New and Emerging Technology.—The Committee encourages the
Bureau to review and consider new and emerging technology, in-
cluding alternative procedures or non-hydraulically operated equip-
ment as appropriate, given the best available science and while en-
suring that risks are properly identified and mitigated. The Bureau
is further urged to implement a performance standard for Blow
Out Prevention Technology designed to sever and seal a well under
all conditions to significantly decrease the potential for loss of well
control and resulting oil spills.
OIL SPILL RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,099,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,099,000
The Committee recommends $15,099,000 for oil spill research.
OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement
[OSMRE] was established in 1977 to oversee and carry out the re-
quirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
(Public Law 95–87) in concert with States and Indian Tribes.
OSMRE’s primary objectives are to ensure coal mining activities
are conducted in a manner that protects citizens and the environ-
ment during mining, ensure the land is properly reclaimed, and
mitigate effects of past mining by reclaiming historic coal aban-
doned mine land [AML]. OSMRE addresses its mission through
grants to States and Tribes to carry out their own regulatory and
reclamation programs and the administration of OSMRE’s regu-
latory and reclamation programs. The Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 (Public Law 109–432) re-
vised the mine reclamation fee distribution mechanism beginning
in fiscal year 2008. State and Tribal reclamation grants are now
provided under mandatory appropriations instead of through this
bill.
REGULATION AND TECHNOLOGY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $116,186,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 111,538,000
The Committee recommends $111,538,000 for Regulation and
Technology. The detailed allocation of funding by activity is in-
cluded in the table accompanying this report. The recommendation
includes $59,904,000 for State and Tribal regulatory grants. The
Committee encourages the Office to assess the solvency of bond
pools and sureties to ensure that resources for coal mine reclama-
tion will be available in the event of multiple claims occurring over
a limited timeframe.
ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $162,546,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 162,546,000
The Committee recommends $162,546,000 for the Abandoned
Mine Reclamation Fund. Of the funds recommended, $32,546,000
shall be derived from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and
61
$130,000,000 shall be derived from the General Fund. The detailed
allocation of funding by activity is included in the table accom-
panying this report.
State and Tribal Economic Revitalization Grants.—The Com-
mittee recommends a total of $130,000,000 for the Abandoned Mine
Land Economic Revitalization [AMLER] grants to States and feder-
ally recognized Indian Tribes for the reclamation of abandoned
mine land in conjunction with economic and community develop-
ment and reuse goals. Program changes were made in fiscal year
2024 to expedite funding to recipients, but the Committee remains
concerned that these changes will not result in expedited project
completion. The Office is directed to brief the Committee within 90
days of enactment of this act on implementing GAO’s recommenda-
tions detailed in GAO–24–106680 and specifically, meeting States’
goals for project review.
For fiscal year 2026, $86,000,000 shall be divided equally be-
tween the three Appalachian States with the largest unfunded
needs for the reclamation of Priority 1 and Priority 2 sites as delin-
eated in the AML Inventory System; and $33,000,000 shall be di-
vided equally between the next three Appalachian States with the
largest unfunded needs for the reclamation of Priority 1 and Pri-
ority 2 sites as delineated in the AML Inventory System; and
$11,000,000 shall be for grants to federally recognized Indian
Tribes.
INDIAN AFFAIRS
BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
The Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] was founded in 1824 to up-
hold a government-to-government relationship between the Federal
Government and Tribal entities. The Federal Government retains
trust responsibility for individual Indians and Tribes as a result of
formal treaties and agreements with Native Americans.
The Bureau provides services directly or through contracts,
grants, or compacts to a population of nearly 2 million American
Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of 574 federally rec-
ognized Indian Tribes in the lower 48 States and Alaska. Programs
administered by the BIA and Tribes include an education system
for almost 45,000 elementary and secondary students; 33 Tribal
colleges, universities, and post-secondary schools; social services;
natural resource management on 56 million acres of trust land;
economic development; law enforcement; administration of Tribal
courts; implementation of land and water claim settlements; re-
placement and repair of schools; repair and maintenance of roads
and bridges; and repair of structural deficiencies on high-hazard
dams.
OPERATION OF INDIAN PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,897,709,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,918,712,000
The Committee recommends $1,918,712,000 for the Operation of
Indian Programs account. All programs and subactivities included
62
are continued at enacted levels, except requested fixed costs and in-
ternal transfers, or unless otherwise specified below or reflected in
the table accompanying this report. Any additional increases are
general program increases unless otherwise specified.
Bureau of Indian Affairs Reductions in Force [RIF] Oversight and
Service Transition Plan.—The Committee directs the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs to submit, no later than 90 days after enactment of
this act, a report detailing: (1) the number and location of facilities
with operations to carry out statutorily required functions of the
BIA as of January 19, 2025; (2) the number of facilities of the BIA
as of the date of enactment of this act; (3) a detailed description
of what comment or input BIA reviewed from Federal clients it
served in the area or region prior to the field office closure; (4) a
detailed summary for transitioning the statutorily required func-
tions of a facility that is no longer in service as of the date of enact-
ment of this act; (5) metrics for measuring performance of statu-
torily required functions at a program, project, or activity level
disaggregated by region; (6) the number of FTEs hired to perform
statutorily required functions hired under Schedule C or the Sched-
ule Policy/Career since January 20, 2025; (7) the number of FTEs
assigned to perform each statutorily required functions for Federal
clients, buildings, and other assets located in the State of Arizona
and elsewhere as of January 19, 2025; (8) the number of FTEs as-
signed to perform each statutorily required functions for Federal
clients, buildings, and other assets located in the State of Arizona
and elsewhere as of the date of enactment of this act; (9) a detailed
description of any delays or disruptions in services that have oc-
curred as of January 20, 2025, for Federal clients, buildings, and
other assets located in the State of Arizona and elsewhere; and (10)
a detailed description of what actions or procedures the BIA has
implemented to monitor any impact to service delivery or to ad-
dress service concerns from Federal clients in areas or regions
where the BIA has closed a facility.
Tribal Government.—The Committee recommends $398,987,000
for Tribal government programs. The recommendation supports
$7,002,000 for Small Tribes supplement.
The Committee has heard concerns from more recently federally
recognized Tribes about equitable distribution of Consolidated Trib-
al Government Program Funds. Many of these Tribes have smaller
populations and land bases but have significant lingering needs in
establishing certain Tribal government operations. The Committee
encourages the Bureau to continue to provide technical assistance
to the maximum extent practicable to these more recently federally
recognized Tribes on how best to leverage funding through existing
programs.
The Committee believes additional transparency is warranted on
the methodology and data the Bureau uses each year to calculate
and distribute the Small Tribe Supplement to over 300 Tribes in
New York, California, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, Michigan,
Nevada, Alaska, and elsewhere with limited resources for the oper-
ation of their Tribal governments. The Committee directs the Bu-
reau to prepare a report no later than 60 days after enactment of
this act for the current and the previous two fiscal years that lists
the Tribes who qualify for the Small Tribe Supplement, identifies
63
and explains the methodology used to calculate each Tribe’s rev-
enue to determine eligibility for the Small Tribe Supplement (list-
ing the programs that are counted against the cap), and a chart
showing how those calculations were made for each eligible Tribe
each year. The Committee expects the Bureau to post this data on-
line for at least 60 days to enable Tribes to review it and propose
corrections before funds are distributed to ensure correct data is
being used. The Committee further directs the agency to notify it
30 days before adopting or finalizing any changes to the current
formula, which has been in place serving small and needy Tribes
around the country for over 25 years.
Road Maintenance.—The Committee recommends $39,190,000
for road maintenance.
The Committee continues funding at fiscal year 2024 levels for
school bus roads. The Committee directs the Bureau to report back
within 60 days of enactment of this act on funds provided to imple-
ment the NATIVE Act within road maintenance that have not been
utilized for roads, along with a strategy outlining how to meet the
increased demand to address tourism needs across Indian Country.
Human Services.—The Committee recommends $163,747,000 for
Human Services programs, accounting for internal transfers.
Tiwahe.—The Committee expects funding to existing Tiwahe
pilot programs to continue in the same amounts to the same recipi-
ents, including funding to support women and children’s shelters.
Finally, the Committee received the Federal and Tribal reports on
the Tiwahe Initiative, which include recommendations on future
action and expansion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is directed to
submit a plan on how to expand the program to all Tribes incre-
mentally along with a strategy on how to consider existing pilot
programs during any expansion and be consistent with the final re-
port and available funding.
Social Services/Children and Families.—Within Human Serv-
ices, the Committee recommends $52,954,000 for Social Services to
support Indian Child Family Violence Prevention activities to fill
the gaps in Tribal child welfare services-specifically child protection
and child abuse treatment, the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA],
to support ICWA grants to assist American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives to assert their sovereignty under ICWA, and to protect the
rights of children in State welfare and judicial systems. The Com-
mittee expects the Bureau to continue to work with Tribes through
Tribal consultation in the delivery of services to children and fami-
lies within Indian Country.
The Committee also acknowledges the discrepancy of Alaska Na-
tive and American Indian children that are disproportionately rep-
resented in foster care systems and Tribes are the only entity in
Children in Need of Assistance [CINA] cases not provided an attor-
ney by the state. The Committee notes funds included shall be used
to meet the ICWA’s mandate and attorney assistance in CINA
cases.
Within available funds, the Committee encourages BIA to
produce a plan to share information on the recommendations in-
cluded in the Native Children Commission’s report with Indian
Country and other stakeholders.
64
Housing Improvement Program.—The Committee recommends
$11,939,000 for the Housing Program.
Trust-Natural Resources Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $326,608,000 for Trust and Natural Resources programs.
It is the Committee’s understanding that the Bureau has entered
into cooperative agreements with Ahtna Inter-Tribal Resource
Commission and the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fisheries Com-
mission, and has initiated similar agreements with other organiza-
tions. Therefore, it is the Committee’s expectation that within the
funding provided, pilot projects and programs for Alaska subsist-
ence will continue. The Bureau will report to the Committee within
60 days of enactment of this act on a distribution plan for these
funds.
Within funds for Natural Resources, the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level is provided to support the Indian Youth Service Corps.
Rights Protection Implementation.—The Committee recommends
$51,459,000 for Rights Protection Implementation. Within the
funding provided for Rights Protection Implementation, an addi-
tional $500,000 is provided in a general program increase to benefit
the off-reservation hunting, fishing, and gathering rights supported
by this program, an additional $759,000 is provided for Columbia
River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites construction in ac-
cordance with the assessment conducted under Public Law 116–99,
and an additional $1,000,000 is to aid in the implementation of the
U.S. Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty.
The Committee continues support for the Bureau’s partnership
with local Tribes and the U.S. Geological Survey to help develop a
water quality strategy for transboundary rivers.
The Committee supports those Tribal communities who must
meet treaty obligations and directs the Bureau to report to the
Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act outlining miti-
gation strategies under this subactivity that could help these com-
munities meet their treaty obligations.
Tribal Management/Development Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $18,544,000 for the Tribal Management/Development
Program.
Endangered Species.—The Committee recommends $5,993,000
for Endangered Species.
Tribal Community Resilience.—The Committee recommends
$34,291,000 for Tribal Community Resilience. The provided fund-
ing includes funding for relocation grants, for which all Tribes shall
be eligible. The Committee is concerned about the amount of frozen
grant funding and reminds BIA of the critical importance of pro-
viding Federal funds under TCR in a timely manner to avoid any
negative impacts on Tribes, and directs BIA to release previously
appropriated funding expeditiously. Within 30 days of enactment of
this act, and monthly thereafter, BIA is directed to provide the
Committee a status update on all current TCR frozen grants, in-
cluding the reason(s) why funding has not yet been awarded, who
is responsible for approving the unfreezing, how long they have
been frozen, when it is expected that there will be a final decision
on the funding, and when the funding will be distributed.
The Committee reminds the Bureau that the Denali Commission
was designated as the lead coordinating agency for Alaska Native
65
village relocation in 2015, and the Commission has been leading
the efforts since then. The Committee recommends the Bureau
work closely with the Commission in order to avoid duplication of
work and to take advantage of the Commission’s expertise in the
area when considering relocation grants.
Integrated Resource Information Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $2,954,000 for Integrated Resource Information Program.
Agriculture and Range Program.—The Committee recommends
$41,438,000 for the Agriculture and Range Program. This includes
$14,291,000 for Invasive Species and $27,147,000 for the Agri-
culture Program [TPA]. The program increase for invasive species
is provided to address the spread of invasive European Green Crab,
with further direction explained below. Additionally, the Com-
mittee directs the BIA to provide information on the historic geo-
graphic distribution of funds provided by the Agriculture and
Range program.
European Green Crab.—The Committee remains concerned by
the rapid and growing invasion of European green crab around the
country, including in the Pacific Northwest. This crab species preys
on native vegetation, which is important habitat for endangered
salmon and other species that are critical to uphold Tribal treaty
rights and Puget Sound recovery. The Committee provides
$2,000,000 to address the spread of invasive European Green Crab
in the Puget Sound region. The Committee directs the Bureau to
coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to ensure a com-
prehensive Federal approach to addressing the threat posed by Eu-
ropean green crab, mitigate harm, and protect native crab and
other shellfish populations. Further, the Bureau and its Federal
partners are directed to jointly brief the Committee no later than
90 days after enactment of this act on their collective efforts to ad-
dress European Green Crab.
Tribal Forestry.—The Committee recommends $62,887,000 for
Tribal Forestry. Of these funds, $28,259,000 is provided for For-
estry Projects and $34,628,000 for base funding.
The Department of the Interior is expected to promote and ex-
pand the use of agreements with Indian Tribes to protect Indian
trust resources from catastrophic wildfire, insect and disease infes-
tation, or other threats from adjacent Federal lands, as authorized
by law. The Committee reminds the Bureau of the directive to co-
ordinate with the Office of Wildland Fire to submit a report de-
scribing how the Department determines the use of wildfire sup-
pression and rehabilitation resources and prioritizes Indian forest
land. The Committee notes that many Tribal communities are at
a heightened risk of wildfire due to funding constraints and a fire
detection deficit. In order to address the heightened fire risks, the
Committee directs the Bureau to take special consideration of pre-
fire detection technologies to protect the public, property, vital in-
frastructure, cultural resources, and natural resources, and adopt
strategies for their implementation across Tribal lands. The Com-
mittee also reminds the Bureau of the directive in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022
(Public Law 117–103) to provide a report within 1 year summa-
rizing the fire detection deficits across Tribal lands and their ef-
66
forts to prioritize early detection strategies and fire mitigation as
part of the Natural Resources Management Program, and looks for-
ward to that report.
Water Resources.—The Committee recommends $18,005,000,
which includes $8,269,000 for Water Resources [TPA], and
$9,736,000 for Water Management, Planning and Pre-development.
Fish, Wildlife and Parks.—The Committee recommends
$23,751,000 for Fish, Wildlife and Parks programs, which includes
$10,783,000 for Wildlife and Parks [TPA] and $12,968,000 for Fish,
Wildlife, and Parks Projects to support the operation and mainte-
nance of fish hatcheries.
Energy and Minerals.—The Committee recommends $30,814,000
for Energy and Minerals.
Resource Management Program Oversight.—The Committee rec-
ommends $8,218,000 for Resource Management Program Over-
sight.
Trust-Real Estate Services.—The Committee recommends
$170,387,000 for trust-real estate services programs. The Com-
mittee directs no less than the enacted program level of $450,000
for the certification of historical places and cultural sites, including
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] (Public Law 92–
203) sites.
Probate.—The Committee is concerned about the length of time
it takes for BIA to probate Tribal citizens’ assets and the adminis-
trative burden associated with the process. Within 60 days of en-
actment of this act, BIA is directed to provide a report indicating
how many FTEs the BIA would need nationally to reduce the pro-
bate backlog to less than 2 years in each region; the resources BIA
would need to ensure technical assistance to ensure proper training
and capacity for self-governance providers handling probate pack-
ages; and the average amount of time it takes for Interior to com-
plete the probate process for eligible States and what, if any, oppor-
tunities exist to improve timeliness and comply with regulatory
deadlines.
To help reduce the probate backlog and help process lands
records, rights of way, and other real estate functions, the Com-
mittee recommends $16,886,000 for Trust-Real Estate Services
Oversight, of which $3,501,000 is provided to Central Oversight
and $13,385,000 to Regional Oversight, additionally, $18,140,000 is
provided for Probate [TPA].
Gila River Trust Accounting.—The Committee has been made
aware of funding issues related to the implementation of the Gila
River Indian Community Federal Rights-of-Way, Easements and
Boundary Clarification Act (Public Law 115–350). To carry out the
functions outlined in the law, the Committee recommends an addi-
tional $500,000 to complete the work related to surveys which is
holding up development.
Real Estate Services.—The committee is concerned with the po-
tential loss of economic opportunity in Tribal communities. This
means a potential reduction in key Tribal programs and social
services. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department
will provide to the committee the current backlog of realty applica-
tions pending for Rights of Way and leasing at the Department,
and a plan to address the backlog.
67
The Committee directs the Bureau, in coordination with the
Osage Agency, to provide a report within 120 days that details the
process of an owner, current or potential lessee, current or future
developer, Tribal owner, or head right owner would follow to obtain
trust records upon request, including the average amount of time
needed by the Bureau to respond to this request. The report shall
detail step by step instructions of how an entity or individual
would procure these records and what is required of the entity or
individual to get that access.
Public Safety and Justice.—The Committee recommends
$558,812,000 for Public Safety and Justice programs.
Criminal Investigations and Police Services.—The Committee rec-
ommends $274,152,000 for Criminal Investigations and Police
Services to support officers and investigators on the ground per-
forming crucial public safety services on a 24/7 basis in Indian
Country.
For funds dispersed for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to address the
impacts of the McGirt v. Oklahoma decision, the Bureau, in coordi-
nation with the Oklahoma Tribal recipients for McGirt related pub-
lic safety and justice funding, is required, to the maximum extent
practicable, to report on the number and specific types of convic-
tions in their respective court systems. Additionally, the report is
required to include barriers to collecting this data from Tribes and
any statutory updates needed to best accomplish conviction report-
ing under these funds. The Bureau is expected to deliver a report
to the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee recognizes the critical need for increased law en-
forcement resources in Tribal communities, including those in Pub-
lic Law 280 (PL 280) States. Despite the jurisdictional limitations
imposed by PL 280, the safety and well-being of Tribal commu-
nities remain a top concern. To address the challenges these com-
munities face, the Committee directs the BIA to conduct com-
prehensive Tribal consultation with Tribes in PL 280 States, aim-
ing to explore the available flexibilities that would enable these
Tribes to utilize their existing and future resources more effectively
for law enforcement purposes, given the importance of ensuring
Tribes have the flexibility and resources to improve public safety
within their communities. The consultation should specifically con-
sider the potential for Tribes to use their Tribal Priority Allocations
[TPA] for law enforcement needs, among other possible avenues.
The Committee directs the BIA to report to the Committee within
180 days of the enactment of this act on the outcomes of the con-
sultation and any recommended actions to support Tribal law en-
forcement in PL 280 States.
The Committee remains concerned about the theft, looting, and
trafficking of sacred objects and items of cultural patrimony, and
notes the importance of enforcing the Native American Graves Pro-
tection and Repatriation Act [NAGPRA], or other related laws. The
Committee recommends continued funding for these activities,
equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
The Committee also expects the recidivism initiative adminis-
tered through the Tiwahe initiative to be continued. Within the
amounts provided, the Committee supports enacted funding levels
for implementation of the Violence Against Women Act [VAWA]
68
(Public Law 103–322) for both training and VAWA-specific Tribal
court needs.
International Drug Trafficking.—The Committee is deeply con-
cerned about the growing presence of international drug trafficking
organizations in Indian Country, despite the efforts of Tribal law
enforcement. These organizations are contributing to violent crime
and drug trafficking and exacerbating the crisis of missing and
murdered Indigenous women. The Committee directs the BIA to
develop a comprehensive plan to address these issues. This plan
should be created in close cooperation with relevant Tribal, Fed-
eral, State, and local agencies, and through thorough consultation
with Tribal governments and surrounding communities. The goal is
to create a coordinated and effective response to the threats posed
by these organizations. Furthermore, the Committee directs the
BIA to provide a briefing to the Committee within 90 days of the
enactment of this act. This briefing should cover the progress made
in developing this plan, the policies that have been established, and
the steps that will be taken to combat the influence of these organi-
zations in Indian Country.
Detention/Corrections.—The Committee recommends
$136,879,000 for detention and corrections. The Committee re-
mains concerned with the welfare of inmates in custody at BIA and
Tribal jails across Indian Country and directs the BIA to provide
regular updates on fulfilling recommendations from the Depart-
ment’s Office of Inspector General related to training, coordination,
and standardized protocols to maintain accountability and over-
sight over BIA and Tribal jails.
Pre-Conviction Detention.—The Committee is concerned about
the practice of sending individuals to out-of-state detention facili-
ties in other BIA regions for pre-conviction detention, particularly
prevalent in the Rocky Mountain Region. This practice is costly
and results in the separation of individuals who have not been con-
victed of a crime from their communities, causing undue hardship
for both the detainees and their families. Thus, the Committee di-
rects the BIA to explore and consider alternatives to this practice.
The BIA should prioritize solutions that keep individuals closer to
their communities, reduce costs, and maintain the integrity of the
pre-conviction process. The Committee expects the BIA to engage
with Tribal governments and local stakeholders to identify viable
alternatives and to provide a briefing within 90 days of enactment
of this act on the progress of these efforts.
Nevada Detention Contracts.—The Committee is concerned about
the potential loss of detention services for Tribes in Nevada. The
Committee notes that detention services are essential to ensure
public safety, therefore directs the Bureau to provide a briefing no
later than 90 days of enactment of this act on how the Bureau in-
tends to work with the Tribes in Nevada on a path forward.
Law Enforcement Special Initiatives.—The Committee rec-
ommends $27,847,000 for law enforcement special initiatives,
which includes an additional $250,000 with an emphasis on ad-
dressing the crisis of missing, trafficked, and murdered indigenous
people, especially women. Native American women continue to face
high rates of violence, and the Committee notes that a lack of data
on the number of women and girls who go missing or murdered
69
further complicates the ability to address this crisis. Increases are
provided to help better address the crisis by identifying gaps in in-
formation sharing and data collection, and more dedicated re-
sources to resolve cold cases. Funding is maintained to perform
background check investigations to help with the hiring process.
Additional funding is included for cold-case offices and for deten-
tion and corrections staff. Within 90 days of enactment of this act,
the Bureau shall brief the Committee on the status of law enforce-
ment vacancies in each Bureau region, as well as the number of
law enforcement checks pending as of the date of enactment. At the
same time as the annual budget request, the Bureau shall provide
detail on how funding provided in fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year
2026 is being used to expedite these investigations.
Further, to assist Tribal and Federal law enforcement agencies
in finding missing persons, the Secretary shall make funding avail-
able through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Serv-
ices, for software platforms that assist the agencies in finding miss-
ing persons. Such contributory software platforms may combine
law enforcement public records data, analytics, geospatial mapping,
and cellular network forensics.
Tribal Justice Support.—The Committee recommends
$34,836,000 for Tribal Justice Support. The Committee remains
concerned about Tribal courts’ needs as identified in the Indian
Law and Order Commission’s November 2013 report, which notes
Federal investment in Tribal justice for Public Law 83–280 States
has been more limited than elsewhere in Indian Country. The
Committee expects the Bureau to continue to work with Indian
Tribes and Tribal organizations to consider options that promote,
design, or pilot Tribal court systems for Tribal communities subject
to full or partial State jurisdiction under Public Law 83–280.
The Committee notes that a number of States with large Indian
populations have no law enforcement presence in Tribal commu-
nities and Alaska Native Villages despite high crime rates; how-
ever, these Tribes are not eligible for certain Native public safety
and justice funding simply because they are located in Public Law
280 States. The Bureau is reminded that it is directed to conduct
Tribal consultation on the budgetary needs of Tribal law enforce-
ment, including wellness courts and other essential judicial needs
for the Tribes in these States, and report back to the Committees
on the available Federal funding, within the Department of the In-
terior or elsewhere, for these Tribes or outlining the barriers to the
development of such funding.
Victim/Witness Assistance Program.—The Committee is con-
cerned with the high declination rates of criminal cases in Indian
Country by Federal law enforcement and encourages the Bureau of
Indian Affairs/Witness Assistance Program to help advocate for
families and survivors by bringing forward information and wit-
nesses that could be used by Federal law enforcement in active
missing person cases, homicides, and other investigations.
In addition to these resources, the bill also includes funding to
focus on retention and advanced training needs. The Committee re-
mains fully supportive of the Indian Police Academy in Artesia,
New Mexico, and expects the Bureau to continue to support the
Academy in its role as the central justice services training location
70
for law enforcement training for entry-level law enforcement offi-
cers, agents, and corrections officers. The Committee recommends
$5,663,000 for the Indian Police Academy. The bill includes an ad-
ditional $500,000 to operate advanced training activities in the
Great Plains region that focuses on training for detectives,
forensics, and other advanced training, per the accompanying
statement in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public
Law 116–260).
The Committee is aware that Indian reservations have violent
crime rates that are more than two and a half times higher than
the National average. The Committee recognizes the need to ad-
dress crime and violence in Indian Country and is concerned by the
high vacancy rate among Bureau law enforcement personnel. The
Committee notes that the vacancy and turnover rate is especially
high in the Great Plains Region, which contains nearly three quar-
ters of all corrections officer vacancies, 68 percent of all special
agent vacancies, and over half of all Bureau of Indian Affairs police
officer vacancies. The Committee directs the Bureau, working with
other Federal partners, to report back to the Committee within 1
year of enactment of this act on the training needs for Bureau law
enforcement and Tribal law enforcement by location, with a com-
prehensive plan on how to recruit, train, and fill the vacancies, in-
cluding whether hiring and retention is hindered by delayed hiring
processes and delayed background checks. As part of this report,
the Committee expects the Bureau to work with the Indian Police
Academy to clearly identify what funding mechanisms are author-
ized that may be used for the recruitment, training, and facility
needs, as well as what type of partnerships, including Federal,
State, and Tribal, could be utilized to address and fill these needs.
Further, because of the ongoing public safety issues facing Tribal
nations, the Committee supports the Bureau’s innovative new ef-
forts to help with law enforcement recruitment and retention like
the pay parity effort which began in fiscal year 2024, but more ac-
tion is necessary to support Tribes and Tribal safety. Therefore, the
Committee directs the Bureau to expedite the hiring process, in-
cluding background checks, and training. The Committee also di-
rects the Bureau to work closely with Tribal leaders on this issue
to ensure the Bureau has the resources necessary to meet this
higher level of service.
The Committee understands the funding provided in previous fis-
cal years for opioid addiction was not used solely for this purpose,
but instead was used to hire additional drug enforcement officers
to assist with all drug-related issues on Tribal lands. The Com-
mittee acknowledges that each community may have its own
unique drug-related issues apart from opioids and continues this
funding without the designation for opioid addiction.
Community and Economic Development.—The Committee rec-
ommends $31,046,000 for community and economic development
programs. The Committee recommends an increase of $500,000 to
the enacted funding levels to carry out the provisions of the NA-
TIVE Act (Public Law 114–221) to support strategic planning and
capacity-building for Tribes, and for grants, studies, and tourism
projects for Tribes and eligible Native Hawaiian Organizations,
with further direction explained below.
71
NATIVE Act Implementation.—The Committee notes that the
NATIVE Act, Public Law 114–221, requires an annual report out-
lining actions taken, policies formulated, and management plans
and tourism initiatives formulated to include American Indians
and Alaska Natives [AI/AN], Tribal organizations, and Native Ha-
waiian organizations. Additionally, the NATIVE Act requires a co-
leadership role to integrate Federal tourism assets within the Fed-
eral Government to strengthen and develop Native American tour-
ism, yet both of these requirements have not been met. Therefore
the Committee directs the Bureau to produce and submit the re-
quired report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of
this act. Further, the NATIVE Act requires the Bureau and the De-
partment of Commerce to enter into a Memorandum of Under-
standing [MOU] with a qualified Native-led non-profit organization
with an established record of managing a national program pro-
viding outreach, training, and support specific to Native American
communities in the development, growth, and enhancement of cul-
tural tourism. The Committee further directs the Bureau to keep
the Committee informed on how the Bureau intends to implement
the MOU in future years once the report is released.
The Committee supports and recommends funding for the Bu-
reau’s job training efforts, and support for business incubators in
Indian Country, in accordance with the budget request.
The Committee understands the importance of preserving native
languages for all Tribal communities. The Committee previously
appropriated funds to the Bureau of Indian Education to build ca-
pacity for language immersion programs or to create new pro-
grams; however, those States that have federally recognized Tribes
without Bureau-funded schools have been prevented from partici-
pating in this program, even though eligibility for these grants has
included potential applicants beyond the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation school system. The Committee recommends no less than en-
acted funding under this subactivity for language immersion
grants. The Committee expects that eligibility will include any pri-
vate nonprofit or Tribal organization in those States without Bu-
reau-funded schools that are interested in further enhancing or cre-
ating native language immersion programs.
Executive Direction and Administrative Services.—The Com-
mittee recommends $260,634,000 for Executive Direction and Ad-
ministrative Services.
Special Initiatives.—The Committee recommends $8,491,000 in
congressionally directed spending for Special Initiatives. A detailed
list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spend-
ing’’ table accompanying this report.

INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,000,000
The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for Indian Land Consoli-
dation. This account is to reduce land fractionation and increase
Tribal majority ownership of lands to provide more control over
land management, use, and protection. The Committee is con-
cerned that the Bureau did not include administrative expense esti-
mates in the budget request and expects the Bureau to do so in fu-
ture budget justifications. Further, the Committee expects that
each fiscal year the Bureau will provide metrics, including the
number of fractionated interests purchased and acreage consoli-
dated.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $356,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 350,000,000
The Committee recommends $350,000,000 for Contract Support
Costs. The Committee continues language establishing an indefi-
nite appropriation for contract support costs estimated to be
$350,000,000 for fiscal year 2026. By retaining an indefinite appro-
priation for this account, additional funds may be provided by the
Bureau if its budget estimate proves to be lower than necessary to
meet the legal obligation to pay the full amount due to Tribes. The
Committee believes fully funding these costs will ensure that
Tribes have the necessary resources they need to deliver program
services efficiently and effectively.
PAYMENTS FOR TRIBAL LEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $69,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 53,000,000
The Committee recommends $53,000,000 for Payments for Tribal
Leases. The Committee recommends establishing a separate appro-
priation account for payments for Tribal leases estimated to be
$53,000,000 for fiscal year 2026. Section 105(l) of the Indian Self
Determination Education Assistance Act provides that Tribes and
Tribal organizations carrying out Federal functions under a self-de-
termination contract or self-governance compact may enter into a
lease agreement with the Department of the Interior or Indian
Health Service for the facilities used to carry out these functions.
CONSTRUCTION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $133,780,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 136,280,000
The Committee recommends $136,280,000 for Construction Pro-
grams. All programs and subactivities included are continued at
enacted levels unless otherwise specified below or reflected in the
table accompanying this report. Internal transfers within the ac-
counts are reflected below and in the table.
73
Public Safety and Justice Construction.—The Committee rec-
ommends $48,291,000 for public safety and justice construction.
The Committee recommends $33,500,000 for the Facilities Replace-
ment and Construction Program; $3,500,000 for Employee Housing;
$6,620,000 for Facilities Improvement and Repair; $171,000 for
Fire Safety Coordination; and $2,000,000 for Fire Protection.
The Committee is concerned with the continuous dilapidated con-
ditions of public safety and justice facilities and understands the
demand for public safety and construction funding remains high
and the backlog to replace public safety facilities has grown expo-
nentially. The Committee is aware there are many condemned fa-
cilities across the country including the Hopi, White Mountain
Apache, Warm Springs, and San Carlos Apache detention and jus-
tice facilities and directs the Bureau to keep the Committee ap-
prised on the progress to replace these facilities.
The Committee expects the Bureau to distribute funds provided
in this act to expeditiously complete construction of adult detention
center projects that were previously awarded. Remaining amounts
should be considered available for all public safety and justice fa-
cilities, consistent with previous direction. Direction is provided for
the Bureau to: (1) produce a plan on how to spend unobligated pub-
lic safety and justice balances on facilities in poor condition; and
(2) provide the plan to the Committee within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act.
Additionally, the Bureau is directed to provide information to the
Committee on any gaps in facilities resources associated with the
growing demand for advanced law enforcement training.
Tribal communities, including Alaska Native communities, don’t
have sufficient public safety facilities to hold individuals until they
can be transported to appropriate corrections facilities. The Bureau
is reminded of the directive in fiscal year 2024 to provide a report
indicating whether existing programs available can address this
need, or whether additional authorities and programs are nec-
essary to provide funding to address this need.
The Committee supports the Bureau’s efforts to recruit, train and
retain its Tribal law enforcement personnel. The Committee is
aware that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking to enhance its
advanced training center and increase advanced training of stu-
dents throughout the Great Plains and Northern Regions. Of the
additional funding provided under Public Safety and Justice Con-
struction, funding may be used for planning and design stage and
construction including required due diligence studies, to construct
facilities—to include administrative space, classrooms, and storage
areas—necessary to meet the growing demand for Tribal law en-
forcement advanced training as needed.
Resources Management Construction.—The Committee rec-
ommends $65,694,000. This funding includes: $24,519,000 for irri-
gation projects, of which not less than $2,987,000 is for the Navajo
Indian Irrigation Project and $10,000,000 is for projects authorized
by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation [WIIN]
Act (Public Law 114–322); $36,730,000 for dam projects; $1,016,000
for survey and design; $2,758,000 for engineering and supervision;
and $671,000 for Federal power compliance. The Committee ex-
pects the funds designated for WIIN Act (Public Law 114–322) ac-
74
tivities will be deposited into the Indian Irrigation Fund to fund
those projects authorized by Public Law 114–322.
The Committee continues the previous fiscal year funding for
dam safety. However, the Committee is concerned that an un-
known number of dams on reservations have not received a hazard
classification, and the current review process is behind schedule,
resulting in delays for comprehensive reviews. The Committee
strongly encourages the Bureau to begin dam safety work expedi-
tiously and report back to the Committee on the best way to effec-
tively quantify the potential pool of dams on reservations in need
of a review and/or classification.
Other Program Construction.—The Committee recommends
$22,295,000. This includes $2,419,000 for telecommunications re-
pair and $9,497,000 for construction program management, which
includes funding for the Fort Peck water system as well as funding
for facilities improvement and repair.
Ft. Peck Water System.—The Committee directs the Bureau to
prioritize and allocate the necessary funding to support the contin-
ued operations and maintenance of the Ft. Peck Water System in
Montana. The Bureau is to ensure that this funding is sufficient
to maintain the system’s functionality and reliability, thereby en-
suring the continued delivery of safe and clean drinking water to
the communities it serves. The Bureau is directed to keep the Com-
mittee informed of any challenges to maintain operations and
maintenance and steps taken to address them.
San Carlos Irrigation Project.—The Committee is aware of chal-
lenges with the ability of the San Carlos Irrigation Project’s power
system to purchase power when there are fluctuations in market
conditions. The Bureau should keep the Committee updated re-
garding challenges of the project to purchase power.
INDIAN LAND AND WATER CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS
PAYMENTS TO INDIANS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $976,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 976,000
The Committee recommends $976,000 for the Indian Land and
Water Claim Settlements account.
INDIAN GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,329,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,329,000
The Committee recommends $13,329,000 for the Indian Guaran-
teed Loan account. The Committee directs the Office of Indian Eco-
nomic Development to report on its efforts to restart the use of the
Interest Subsidy at this critical time. The Committee understands
that Interest Subsidy is not as critical when interest rates are low,
but conversely it is very critical when interest rates are high. The
report should document how planned uses of the interest subsidy
impacts the program if defaults increase and how Interest Subsidy
can mitigate those defaults.
75
BUREAU OF INDIAN EDUCATION
OPERATION OF INDIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,131,617,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,131,617,000
The Committee recommends $1,131,617,000 for the Operation of
Indian Education Programs. The detailed allocation of funding by
program and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Internal transfers within the accounts are reflected below and
in the table.
The Committee fully supports broadening access to Native lan-
guage and culture programs, which have been linked to higher aca-
demic achievement for Native youth. The Committee expects the
Individual Student Equalization Program [ISEP] to continue to en-
hance access to Native language and culture programs in Bureau-
funded schools and directs the Bureau to report within 60 days of
enactment of this act on how previous funding provided has been
and can continue to be used to support these programs.
Within the funds provided for education program enhancements,
continued funding is provided for native language immersion
grants with the understanding that the recipients of these grants
are Bureau-funded schools. The Bureau is expected to report within
60 days of enactment of this act regarding the status of fiscal year
2025 funds and the planned distribution of funds in this act.
The Committee remains concerned about the distribution meth-
odology of the Johnson O’Malley [JOM] assistance grants and is
aware that Congress enacted the Johnson O’Malley Modernization
Act (Public Law 115–404) in 2018. In addition to requesting a re-
port detailing the Bureau’s compliance with the act, the Committee
once again requests that the Department include estimates of nec-
essary appropriations levels to provide per pupil funding levels
equal to the fiscal year 2018 level per pupil levels for all newly re-
ported eligible students.
Interagency coordination must be improved for the multiplicity of
programs that affect the well-being of Native children. In addition
to education, these include healthcare, mental and behavioral
healthcare, social service, child welfare, and juvenile justice pro-
grams. The Committee encourages the Bureau to work with other
relevant Federal, State, local, and Tribal organizations to begin the
process of identifying ways to make programs more effective in
serving Native children. In addition, the Committee directs the De-
partments of Education and Interior to develop a cooperative agree-
ment to work together to improve the quality of education opportu-
nities offered to Indian youth and to ensure there is no overlap in
services between the Departments.
Haskell Indian Nations Campus.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities
[TCUs] to address persistent educational disparities in Native
American communities. The Committee directs the Bureau to sub-
mit a report to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate
within 240 days of enactment of this act providing a detailed ac-
count of infrastructure and safety improvements made at Haskell
76
Indian Nations University using Interior funding, and identify re-
maining gaps in campus facilities, safety, and educational program-
ming that must be addressed to meet institutional needs.
The Committee directs the Bureau to strengthen coordination
and establish regular lines of communication with the Haskell In-
dian Nations University Board of Regents. The Board, as a Tribally
elected body, plays a critical role in institutional governance, rep-
resentation, and advocacy. Improved collaboration will enhance
transparency, promote accountability, and support the long-term
success and operational stability of the university.
The Committee directs the Bureau to submit a report to the
Committee on Appropriations of the Senate within 90 days of en-
actment of this act evaluating the potential benefits and implica-
tions of transferring governance authority for Haskell Indian Na-
tions University to its Tribally elected Board of Regents. The report
shall assess how such a transfer would support Tribal self-deter-
mination, institutional accountability, and improved student out-
comes. It should also provide recommendations on necessary steps,
timelines, and statutory changes needed to implement the transi-
tion.
The Committee directs the Department of the Interior, in coordi-
nation with the Bureau of Indian Education [BIE] to submit a re-
port to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate within 30
days of enactment of this act detailing current policies and proce-
dures for conducting background checks on all Department employ-
ees assigned to BIE schools and programs. The report shall include:
(1) the frequency and standards for background checks; (2) proto-
cols for addressing findings of concern; (3) the date of the most re-
cent background check for each category of employee; and (4) any
gaps or delays in implementation across the Department’s edu-
cational institutions.
The Committee notes that the Bureau is required to compensate
teachers and counselors at a pay rate that is consistent with the
Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Prac-
tices Act, as provided by 25 U.S.C. 201. The Committee directs the
Bureau to clearly display funding amounts required to comply with
Department of Defense Education Activity (Public Law 86–91, as
amended) pay rates as part of future budget justifications and en-
courages the Bureau to include sufficient funding in its budget re-
quest to fully fund these requirements.
Further, the Committee directs the Bureau to provide an anal-
ysis of ISEP funds beginning in fiscal year 2026 in the annual
budget request that details: The Bureau’s pay rate for teacher and
counselor salaries; the Department of Defense [DOD] pay rate for
teacher and counselor salaries; the amount of funding provided for
teacher and counselor pay parity in annual budget requests and ac-
tually provided with available funds; the amount of annual funding
spent on Bureau-funded schools non-salary expenses (including stu-
dent services, safety, programming, and other standard operations);
the impact that any shortfall of ISEP funds for required pay in-
creases had on school services and programming (if any); and a
complete accounting of any amounts Bureau-funded schools may
not have received because fixed costs increases that align with
77
DOD teacher and counselor pay parity requirements were not in-
cluded in annual budget requests.
FERS Eligibility for Employees at BIE Tribally Controlled
Schools.—The Committee is concerned about the inequity created
by the loss of Federal Employees Retirement System [FERS] bene-
fits for teachers and staff when Tribes exercise their self-deter-
mination right to operate BIE-funded schools under Public Law
100–297 grants or Public Law 93–638 contracts. The loss of these
benefits is a major impediment to the recruitment and retention of
teachers and staff, as these Tribally Controlled Schools often bear
the hardship of recruiting, hiring, and training teachers and staff
only to lose them shortly thereafter to other schools offering better
pay and benefits. Any policy denying Federal benefits to employees
carrying out a Federal trust responsibility is incompatible with the
Federal policy of self-determination. Congress recognized this in-
compatibility and barrier to recruitment and retention in 2020
when it extended the Federal Employee Health Benefits [FEHB]
program to teachers and staff of Tribally Controlled Schools. Thus,
the Committee directs the Bureau to analyze the extent of the
problem and the systems, processes, and authorizations necessary
to extend FERS benefits to teachers and staff employed by these
schools; develop an associated plan, timeline, and budget; and re-
port back to the Committee with a proposal no later than 180 days
after the date of enactment of this act.
The Committee directs the Bureau to work with the Indian
Health Service as appropriate to continue integrating school-based
preventative health services, such as dental, mental, and behav-
ioral care, into elementary schools in order to improve health out-
comes of Tribal students.
EDUCATION CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $234,725,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 234,725,000
The Committee recommends $234,725,000 for Education Con-
struction. Funding amounts support a level of $152,401,000 for re-
placement schools; $19,648,000 for replacement facilities;
$3,880,000 for employee housing repair; and $41,296,000 for facility
improvement and repair.
The Committee recognizes that many Tribal colleges have signifi-
cant unfunded needs and directs the Bureau to work with Tribal
leaders and other stakeholders to develop a consistent methodology
for determining Tribal colleges operating and maintenance needs to
inform future budget requests. The Committee included directives
under the Bureau of Indian Education-Operation of Indian Edu-
cation Programs in previous years directing the Bureau to develop
a methodology regarding the operating and infrastructure needs for
Tribal colleges, but the Bureau has not yet complied and submitted
a methodology. The Committee again directs the Bureau to conduct
an assessment of Tribal colleges facility needs and develop a dis-
tribution methodology to address these needs. The Committee also
directs the Bureau to report back within 60 days of enactment of
this act on how it conducts student counts at Tribal colleges and
how funding is provided to address facilities operation, mainte-
nance, and construction needs.
78
The Committee expects that the discretionary funding for the fa-
cility improvement and repair program will continue to be used to
address deficiencies identified by annual school safety inspections.
The Committee remains concerned about the deferred maintenance
projects at schools and directs the Bureau to submit the allocation
plan as required by Public Law 115–31. The Committee is encour-
aged to learn that BIA and BIE continue to work together to en-
sure annual safety inspections are completed for all BIE school fa-
cilities. However, the Committee is concerned that, as noted by
GAO in report GAO–16–313, BIA and BIE have not developed con-
crete tracking and capacity-building systems to ensure safety
issues flagged by these inspections are addressed in a timely man-
ner. Furthermore, the Committee is concerned by reports from
Tribally-operated BIE schools that BIE does not provide timely ac-
cess to or training about the Facilities Improvement and Repair
Program and other available emergency maintenance funding. The
Committee reminds the Bureau that it has yet to comply with the
reporting requirements for school safety inspections included in
Senate Report 116–123, and that this report should be delivered
within 30 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee understands that many schools are in need of re-
pair, improvement, and upgrades to be in good condition. The Com-
mittee stands ready to work with the administration and Tribes to
develop a comprehensive strategy that provides safe, functional,
and accessible facilities for schools. The Committee reminds the
Bureau of the previous requirement to report back on the progress
the Bureau has made towards implementing a long-term facilities
plan similar to the Department of Defense process in 2009, as en-
couraged in the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public
Law 114–113.
BUREAU OF TRUST FUND ADMINISTRATION
Congress has designated the Secretary of the Interior as the
trustee delegate with responsibility for approximately 55 million
surface acres of land, 57 million acres of subsurface mineral inter-
ests, and management of approximately $8.2 billion held in trust
by the Federal Government on behalf of American Indians, Alaska
Natives, and federally recognized Indian Tribes. The Bureau of
Trust Fund Administration [BTFA] is assigned trust management
of these assets includes conserving, maintaining, accounting, in-
vesting, disbursing, and reporting to individual Indians and feder-
ally recognized Tribes and Tribal organizations on asset trans-
actions generated from sales, leasing and other commercial activi-
ties on these lands.
FEDERAL TRUST PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $100,009,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 100,009,000
The Committee recommends $100,009,000 for the Federal Trust
Programs account. The recommendation includes $1,459,000 for ex-
ecutive direction.
79
Individual Indian Money Accounts.—The Committee has con-
cerns with the timely distribution and management of proceeds
held in Individual Indian Money accounts at the Bureau of Trust
Funds Administration. Delays in disbursement and accounting im-
pact the financial health of Tribal members who reside in commu-
nities with a lack of economic opportunity, and fail to uphold the
Department’s trust asset management responsibilities on behalf of
tribes. The Committee encourages the Department to respond to
IIM withdraw requests in as expedited a time as possible.
DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $147,418,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 127,418,000
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$127,418,000 for the Office of the Secretary account. The bill con-
tinues the direction from previous fiscal years to maintain the Of-
fice of Native Hawaiian Relations within the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget.
Leadership and Administration.—The Committee recommends
$90,969,000 for the leadership and administration activity. This cut
reflects the Committee’s frustration with the Department’s unwill-
ingness to provide timely responses to requests for information;
failure to proactively engage the Committee on decisions related to
appropriated resources; and to take draconian steps that are likely
to decrease efficiencies rather than increase them. The Department
is strongly encouraged to take more seriously its relationship with
the Committee. Without tangible steps in that direction, the Com-
mittee will consider changes to the appropriations structure that
will enable the Committee to take targeted cuts within this ac-
count.
Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony [STOP] Act.—The STOP
Act fills a key void in preventing the export and trafficking of Trib-
al cultural heritage items in the international market and facili-
tating their repatriation to their respective Tribal communities.
The Committee recommends $500,000 for the Department to begin
implementation of this important mission. Further, timely imple-
mentation of the export certification system established by the
Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony Act (Public Law 117–258) is
necessary to prevent the illegal export of protected Tribal sacred
objects to foreign markets. The Department is directed to complete
its STOP Act regulations expeditiously and brief the Committee
within 60 days of enactment of this act on its plan to implement
the export certification system required by the STOP Act.
Subsistence Activities.—The Committee believes marine mammal
subsistence harvest management and enforcement decisions should
be, to the extent practicable, led by Alaska Native Organizations
at the local level, with Federal agencies working in partnership
with Alaska Native Organizations. The Committee expects the
Service to finalize a co-management agreement with the Alaska
Nannut Co-Management Council [ANCC], and in the interim, to
80
work closely with ANCC on enforcement actions that may arise in
relation to subsistence uses of polar bears. The Service is directed
to provide funding to Alaska Native Organizations with which it
co-manages marine mammals at no less than fiscal year 2021 lev-
els. The Service is reminded of the report due to the Committee on
the Service’s efforts to work collaboratively with other Federal
agencies on activities related to marine mammal subsistence har-
vests and directs this report to be submitted no later than 30 days
after the enactment of this act, if still outstanding at the time of
enactment of this act.
Management Services.—The Committee recommends $36,499,000
for the management services activity.
Indian and Arts and Crafts Board [IACB].—The recommendation
includes not less than $1,806,000 for the IACB to support activities
related to enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. The Com-
mittee supports the work of the IACB to promote the economic de-
velopment of Native Americans through the expansion of the In-
dian arts and crafts market and combatting illegal sales and traf-
ficking of indigenous artwork through IACB’s administration and
enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act.
Indian Youth Service Corps.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to continue progress on standing up the Indian Youth
Service Corps. Across the Department, the Committee continues to
provide ongoing funding to support youth through the Indian Youth
Service Corps and directs the Department to work in partnership
with land management agencies to identify additional capacity for
the program.
Plum Island.—The Committee directs the Department to provide
a briefing to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act
regarding processes and potential resources needed to complete a
transfer for permanent conservation of Plum Island, including
management of and partnerships with State, Federal, and Tribal
entities, and potential costs for managing the island.
Native Hawaiian Community Resilience Program.—The Com-
mittee has made a concerted effort to support community-led adap-
tation projects, habitat restoration, and coastal management, in-
cluding on Native Hawaiian homelands thus, the Committee sup-
ports the continuation of the Kapapahuliau grants. The Committee
urges the Secretary to consider this program during the 2027 budg-
et formulation and work with Congress on a permanent solution.
Lastly, the Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing
to the Committee and the Committee on Indian Affairs no later
than 90 days upon enactment of this act on how to build on these
efforts.
INSULAR AFFAIRS
The Office of Insular Affairs [OIA] was established on August 4,
1995, through Secretarial Order No. 3191, which also abolished the
former Office of Territorial and International Affairs. OIA has ad-
ministrative responsibility for coordinating Federal policy in the
territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands [CNMI], as
well as oversight of Federal programs and funds in the freely asso-
81
ciated States of the Federated States of Micronesia [FSM], the Re-
public of the Marshall Islands [RMI], and the Republic of Palau.
The Compacts of Free Association recognize each Freely Associ-
ated State as a sovereign State with the capacity to conduct foreign
affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact. The Compacts
place full responsibility for defense with the United States. The
Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assist-
ance, principally through the Department of the Interior. The Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–42, Division G,
Title II, §201, the ‘‘Compact of Free Association Amendments Act
of 2024,’’ approved new economic assistance packages for the Freely
Associated States through 2043.
ASSISTANCE TO TERRITORIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $120,107,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 120,367,000
The Committee recommends $120,367,000 for assistance to terri-
tories. Funding levels for each subactivity can be found in the table
accompanying this report.
The Committee recognizes that the Office of Insular Affairs’ most
impactful spending is through projects to improve education, drink-
ing water, sanitation, health, safety, transportation, reliability of
power, availability of technology, including through fiber optics,
and economic opportunity and sustainability. The Committee di-
rects these funds to be awarded accordingly and timely. Addition-
ally, OIA is directed to continue to award non-competitive technical
assistance funds to support investments in civic education pro-
grams for Insular Area students. If the Department does not make
the aforementioned awards in a timely manner, the Committee will
consider adding statutory requirements.
The Committee understands that investing in OIA plays a crit-
ical role in furthering and protecting U.S. national security, and
supports the OIA and its efforts to combat the People’s Republic of
China’s efforts to weaken U.S. leadership. The Committee is con-
cerned by the lack of OIA representatives stationed in some of the
Freely Associated States and U.S. territories within OIA’s jurisdic-
tion. The Committee recommends an additional $1,760,000 to sup-
port OIA personnel in each jurisdiction under its purview as well
as corresponding desk officers.
Brown Tree Snake.—The Committee recognizes the damage
caused by the invasive Brown Tree Snake [BTS] on Guam and the
significant threat of its spread to other Pacific island areas, includ-
ing the State of Hawaii and other Insular communities. The Com-
mittee supports the ongoing efforts of OIA to prevent the spreading
of the BTS from Guam and encourages OIA to continue to
prioritize this work in the future. Further, the Committee directs
OIA to work in close coordination with other Federal and local
partners to leverage resources to the maximum extent practicable.
The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for these efforts, an in-
crease of $500,000 over fiscal year 2024 enacted levels, and directs
OIA to provide a briefing to the Committee within 180 days of en-
actment on the progress being made on the eradication efforts.
The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for increased support to
the territories for investments in infrastructure. Mandatory fund-
82
ing for the Capital Improvement Project program has not been in-
creased or adjusted for inflation since the program’s current au-
thorization in 1996, and significant increases in construction and
labor costs continue to erode at the impact of the program on infra-
structure needs in the territories. This additional discretionary
funding will provide additional grant funding to the territories as
they continue to address critical needs for infrastructure improve-
ment.
Funding for Energizing Insular Communities is provided equal to
the request.
COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,463,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 813,000
The Committee recommends $813,000 for Compact of Free Asso-
ciation programs.
OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $97,950,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 97,950,000
The Committee recommends $97,950,000 for the Office of the So-
licitor.
Freedom of Information Act [FOIA].—The Committee appreciates
the efforts made by the Office of the Solicitor to increase the proc-
essing capacity of the Department’s FOIA program and reduce the
Department’s FOIA request backlog. The Committee directs the
Department to include in future budget justifications an exhibit on
staffing levels and metrics showing the status of the FOIA request
backlog.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $67,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 67,000,000
The Committee recommends $67,000,000 for the Office of Inspec-
tor General.
DEPARTMENT-WIDE PROGRAMS
WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Department’s Wildland Fire Management account funds the
Office of Wildland Fire and fire prevention, readiness, suppression,
and rehabilitation activities performed by the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
and National Park Service.
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,147,171,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,148,171,000
83
The Committee recommends $1,148,171,000 for wildland fire
management. Program directives and specific funding requirements
are noted in the following narrative.
Fire Operations.—The Committee recommends $909,721,000 for
Wildfire Preparedness and Suppression. This amount includes
$526,064,000 for preparedness and $383,657,000 for fire suppres-
sion operations.
The Department is urged to implement technology moderniza-
tions outlined in section 1114 of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conserva-
tion, Management, and Recreation Act (Public Law 116–9). These
upgrades will improve firefighter and public safety and enhance ef-
fective and cost-efficient wildfire response, through expanded use of
uncrewed aircraft systems and better incident support, such as re-
mote location tracking, smoke projections, safe operations in de-
graded visual environments, and wildfire decision support.
The Department is encouraged to increase adoption of decision
support tools such as Potential Operational Delineations [PODs],
Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessments [QWRA], and scenario in-
vestment tools for increased work on joint cross boundary planning
with State, local, and Tribal governments.
Other Operations.—The Committee recommends $238,450,000 for
other wildland fire management operations. This includes
$214,450,000 for fuels management, $10,000,000 for burned area
rehabilitation, $10,000,000 for fire facilities, and $4,000,000 for
joint fire science. Within fire facilities, no less than $4,000,000 is
provided for the Department’s firefighter housing improvement ini-
tiative.
The Department is directed to prioritize collaboratively-developed
wildfire risk reduction efforts in high-risk firesheds with frag-
mented ownership of Federal, State, and private forest lands, sus-
ceptibility to wildfire and concentration of homes. The Department
is further directed to brief the Committee within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act on the proposed distribution of hazardous fuels
funding to its component bureaus, the allocation methodology, and
how it takes into account areas with special designations, such as
the Oregon and California Grant Lands.
WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS RESERVE FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $360,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 370,000,000
The Committee recommends $370,000,000 for the Department of
the Interior Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund for fis-
cal year 2026.
CENTRAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,661,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 9,661,000
The Committee recommends $9,661,000 for the Central Haz-
ardous Materials Fund.
84
ENERGY COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,800,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,800,000
The Committee recommends $4,800,000 for the Energy Commu-
nity Revitalization Program. The detailed allocation of funding by
activity is included in the table accompanying this report.
The Committee continues to expect this program to be used to
implement section 40704 of Public Law 117–58 and directs the De-
partment to finalize guidance for State and Tribal grants and
memoranda of understanding with other Federal agencies, includ-
ing the Forest Service and Environmental Protection Agency, to
implement the program as authorized. The bill also provides fund-
ing for these activities on Federal lands within the Department’s
individual land management bureaus and the Forest Service.
NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND RESTORATION
NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,715,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,715,000
The Committee recommends $7,715,000 for the Natural Resource
Damage Assessment Fund.
WORKING CAPITAL FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $107,710,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 107,710,000
The Committee recommends $107,710,000 for the Working Cap-
ital Fund.
OFFICE OF NATURAL RESOURCES REVENUE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $167,937,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 167,937,000
The Committee recommends $167,937,000 for the Office of Nat-
ural Resources Revenue [ONRR].
The Committee directs the Department to distribute revenues
from operations in the Gulf of America Region in a manner con-
sistent with Public Law 109–432. The Committee clarifies that the
disbursement of funds under Public Law 109–432, as revenue shar-
ing amounts, are not to be treated as an award or grant by the
United States. It is the intent of the Committee that the single
audit requirements under 2 CFR 200 do not apply for revenues dis-
bursed under Public Law 109–432.
85

TITLE II
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Environmental Protection Agency [EPA or Agency] was cre-
ated through Executive Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, de-
signed to consolidate certain Federal Government environmental
activities into a single agency. The plan was submitted by the
President to the Congress on July 8, 1970, and the EPA was estab-
lished as an independent agency in the executive branch on Decem-
ber 2, 1970, by consolidating 15 components from five departments
and independent agencies.
A description of EPA’s pollution control programs by media fol-
lows:
Air.—The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101–
549) authorize a national program of air pollution research, regula-
tion, prevention, and enforcement activities.
Water Quality.—The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Public
Law 92–500), as amended, provides the framework for protection of
the Nation’s surface waters. The law recognizes that it is the pri-
mary responsibility of the States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate
water pollution. The States determine the desired uses for their
waters, set standards, identify current uses and, where uses are
being impaired or threatened, develop plans for the protection or
restoration of the designated use. They implement the plans
through control programs such as permitting and enforcement, con-
struction of municipal waste water treatment works, and nonpoint
source control practices. The act also regulates discharge of dredge
or fill material into waters of the United States, including wet-
lands.
Drinking Water.—The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 (Public
Law 93–523), as amended in 1996, charges EPA with the responsi-
bility of implementing a program to assure that the Nation’s public
drinking water supplies are free of contamination that may pose a
human health risk and to protect and prevent the endangerment
of ground water resources which serve as drinking water supplies.
Hazardous Waste.—The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
of 1976 [RCRA] (Public Law 94–580) mandated EPA to develop a
regulatory program to protect human health and the environment
from improper hazardous waste disposal practices. The RCRA Pro-
gram manages hazardous wastes from generation through disposal.
EPA’s responsibilities and authorities to manage hazardous
waste were greatly expanded under the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98–616). Not only did the
regulated universe of wastes and facilities dealing with hazardous
waste increase significantly, but past mismanagement practices, in
(87)
88
particular prior releases at inactive hazardous and solid waste
management units, were to be identified and corrective action
taken. The 1984 amendments also authorized a regulatory and im-
plementation program directed to owners and operators of under-
ground storage tanks.
The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act of
2012 (Public Law 112–195) amended subtitle C of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act (Public Law 89–272) to establish an electronic means
of tracking wastes subject to RCRA regulation.
Pesticides.—The objective of the pesticide program is to protect
the public health and the environment from unreasonable risks
while permitting the use of necessary pest control approaches. This
objective is pursued by EPA under the Food Quality Protection Act
(Public Law 104–170); the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (Public Law 61–152); the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Public Law 75–717); and the Pesticide Registration
Improvement Extension Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–117) through
three principal means: (1) review of existing and new pesticide
products; (2) enforcement of pesticide use rules; and (3) research
and development to reinforce the ability to evaluate the risks and
benefits of pesticides.
Radiation.—The radiation program’s major emphasis is to mini-
mize the exposure of persons to ionizing radiation, whether from
naturally occurring sources, medical or industrial applications, nu-
clear power sources, or weapons development.
Toxic Substances.—The Toxic Substances Control Act (Public
Law 94–469) established a program to stimulate the development
of adequate data on the effects of chemical substances on health
and the environment and instituted control action for those chemi-
cals which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment. The original statute was amended by the Frank R.
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act of 2016 (Pub-
lic Law 114–182). The act’s coverage affects thousands of chemicals
currently in commerce and all new chemicals.
Multimedia.—Multimedia activities are designed to support pro-
grams where the problems, tools, and results are cross media and
must be integrated to affect results. This integrated program en-
compasses EPA’s research, enforcement, and abatement activities.
Superfund.—The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Com-
pensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–510) estab-
lished a national program to protect public health and the environ-
ment from the threats posed by inactive hazardous waste sites and
uncontrolled spills of hazardous substances. The original statute
was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–499). Under these authorities, EPA
manages a hazardous waste site clean-up program that includes
emergency response and long-term remediation.
Brownfields.—The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–510), as
amended by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields
Revitalization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107–118), established a na-
tional program to assess, clean up, and provide support to States,
Tribes, local communities, and other stakeholders to work together
to develop Brownfields.
89
Leaking Underground Storage Tanks.—The Leaking Under-
ground Storage Tank [LUST] Program addresses petroleum re-
leases from federally regulated underground storage tanks. It was
created in 1986 when Congress amended subtitle I of the Solid
Waste Disposal Act (Public Law 89–272). EPA implements the
LUST response program primarily through cooperative agreements
with the States. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act (Public Law 109–
58) expanded eligible uses of the Trust Fund to include certain leak
prevention activities.
Inland Oil Spill.—The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Pub-
lic Law 80–845), as amended by section 4202 of the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–380), established a national program
to help prepare for, and respond to, any oil spill affecting the in-
land waters of the United States.
PROGRAMMATIC GUIDANCE
The Committee recommends $8,641,650,000 for the Agency.
Workforce.—EPA staff include scientists, engineers, analysts,
community coordinators, and program managers who help protect
public health and the environment in communities across the coun-
try. EPA permanent staff numbers remain well below historic lev-
els despite the growing workload to support clean air, clean water,
and a stable climate. The Committee expects the Agency to submit
as part of its operating plan, staffing targets by National Program
Management area, in line with the Agency’s enacted appropriation.
The Committee expects the Agency to continue to develop work-
force and staffing plans. Further, not later than 45 days after the
end of each quarter, the Agency shall submit data on the number
of full time equivalent employees employed by the Agency in the
same format as the fiscal year 2020 employment target data was
submitted.
PFAS and Contaminants of Emerging Concern.—The Committee
remains concerned regarding PFAS and its effects on our commu-
nities and supports the Agency’s previous actions on PFAS, includ-
ing issuing its first-ever drinking water standard, designating two
substances as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act [CERCLA], and updat-
ing interim guidance on the destruction and disposal of PFAS-con-
taining materials. In April 2025, the Administrator announced
major Agency actions on PFAS. The Committee is still awaiting a
briefing on this updated PFAS plan. Immediately following the en-
actment of this act, the Agency is directed to brief the Committee
on the Agency’s actions and provide the Committee with a spend
plan that details funding at the program project level for fiscal year

Section 3:
2026.
Congressional Budget Justification.—The Agency is directed to
continue to include the information requested in House Report
112–331 and any proposals to change State allocation formulas
that affect the distribution of appropriated funds in future budget
justifications.
Reprogramming.—As a result of incorporating the Agency table
by reference, the reprogramming guidelines no longer apply.
Combination of Separate Fiscal Year Grant Funding.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges instances in which the Agency combined sepa-
90
rate fiscal year grant appropriations and put out a multi-year Re-
quest for Application and directs the Agency to brief the Committee
before publishing a multi-year Request for Application of grant
funding.
Changes to Grant Formulas or Allocations.—The Agency is di-
rected to brief the Committee before making changes to grant fund-
ing allocations or formula changes.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund.—The Committee believes that a
nonrecurring expenses fund [NEF] is an important tool for a De-
partment or Agency to have. However, access to such an account
requires confidence in a Department or Agency that it will spend
the funds within the parameters set forth for the NEF by Congress.
To date, EPA has not demonstrated that it is willing to be trans-
parent with the Committee on how its spending money appro-
priated by Congress. As such, the recommendation does not sup-
port establishing a NEF for EPA. However, the Committee will
consider providing EPA with the requested in a future fiscal year
if EPA shows that it is willing to be transparent, responsive, and
forthcoming with how it spends appropriated dollars.
Grant Terminations.—The Committee urges the EPA to uphold
grant obligations made to local governments and nonprofit organi-
zations that are working to improve access to healthcare in rural
areas while ensuring appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars.
OFFICE OF THE ADMINISTRATOR
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $183,830,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 107,883,000
The Committee recommends $107,883,000 for the Office of the
Administrator, including $63,760,000 for the Immediate Office of
the Administrator and $44,123,000 for the Office of the Chief Fi-
nancial Officer. The Committee has moved $183,830,000 out of the
Environmental Programs and Management that were otherwise
spent on operations of the Office of the Administrator and the Of-
fice of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure there is transparency
in funding required to support those Offices. The Committee is
frustrated with how EPA has decided to not have a working rela-
tionship with the Committee and to disregard Congressional direc-
tives related to staffing and funding. The Committee will consider
targeted increases to funding for the Offices if the Offices can dem-
onstrate that it takes its relationship with the Committee seri-
ously.
The Committee directs EPA to expeditiously brief the Committee
on the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed reorganization
on July 17, 2025, related to the Office of the Administrator. Once
the Committee has received the briefing and efficient corresponding
information, the Committee will reevaluate the funding levels and
structure for the Office of the Administrator and the Chief Finan-
cial Officer, among others, provided in this act.
The following table summarizes the Committees’ recommenda-
tion for the Immediate Office of the Administrator.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $756,073,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 742,595,000
The Committee recommends $742,595,000 for Science and Tech-
nology. The recommendation includes an additional $30,343,000 for
this account from Hazardous Substance Superfund to fund ongoing
research activities authorized by the Comprehensive Environ-
mental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public
Law 96–510), as amended. The detailed allocation of funding by
program and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Program directives and specific funding requirements are
noted in the following narrative.
Office of Research and Development.—The Committee notes that
EPA has a long and proud tradition of being one of the world’s
leading environmental and human health research organizations.
The Office of Research and Development [ORD] conducts cutting-
edge research to better understand and mitigate harm to humans
and the environment from contamination from natural and human-
made disasters, radiation exposure, wildfire smoke emissions,
chemical releases, drinking water contamination, chemicals in ev-
eryday products, and other threats. For example ORD’s
foundational research on PFAS chemicals exposed profound risks to
human health and spurred bipartisan funding to address the im-
pacts of PFAS on drinking water, bans on certain PFAS chemicals,
and further research.
The Committee is appalled that the Agency has announced the
imminent closure of ORD, which would result in the further loss
of biologists, chemists, engineers, ecologists, and other expert sci-
entists numbering in the thousands and the closure of world-class
laboratories and research centers. The Agency has touted savings
of $748,800,000 in direct Federal spending, but fails to acknowl-
edge the immeasurable risk to our health and environment that
would come from undermining EPA’s ability to clean up hazardous
chemicals, respond to disasters, and support states and Tribal Na-
tions with sound, actionable science. The Committee notes that the
Agency did not include a proposal to close ORD in the fiscal year
2026 budget request nor amended the budget request to that end
nor did the Agency submit the reorganization to the Committee as
92
required by the reprogramming guidance pursuant to section 422
of Public Law 118–42 and continued under the terms and condi-
tions of Public Law 119–4.’’ The Committee directs the Agency to
immediately halt all actions related to the closure, reduction, reor-
ganization, or other similar such changes to ORD and the EPA sci-
entific workforce and instead, if the administration continues to
wish to pursue this change, include any such changes within the
President’s budget request for fiscal year 2027 as a proposal for the
Committee to make a decision on in a final funding bill for that
year.
Clean Air.—The Committee recommends $138,624,000. The Com-
mittee supports the Agency’s efforts to modernize its monitoring,
analytic, and testing capabilities.
The Committee notes the Agency’s Science Advisory Board pan-
el’s review of the Clean Air Allowance Trading Program, urges the
networks to keep active at their fiscal 2021 levels, and recommends
$4,260,000 to modernize the Clean Air Status and Trends Network
[CASTNet]. The Committee directs the Agency to provide a report
within 180 days of enactment of this act on current and future
plans for the Clean Air Status and Trends Network and the Na-
tional Trends Network as well as funding requirements.
Within available funding, the Committee encourages increased
emphasis for the Federal Vehicle and Fuels Standards and Certifi-
cation line and encourages resources be allocated to vehicle re-
search and development and enforcement, including testing capa-
bilities of the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory.
Electric Pathway.—The Committee notes the Agency still has not
implemented the electricity program under the Renewable Fuel
Standard [RFS], despite past direction from this Committee. The
Committee directs the Agency to finalize the eRINS program with-
in 90 days of enactment of this act and to process all electric path-
way feedstock petitions prior to issuing the final 2026 Renewable
Volume Obligation rule. The Committee expects that the eRIN pro-
gram will be implemented with all eligible feedstocks, particularly
those that support agriculture activity, minimize wildfire risk, and
reduce methane emissions.
Homeland Security.—The Committee recommends $33,957,000.
The Committee urges the Agency to prioritize activities related to
the cybersecurity of the Nation’s water systems. The Committee is
concerned by public reports of cyberattacks on water systems
across the world and recommends additional funding for the Agen-
cy to prevent cyber threats in coordination with other Federal
agencies and partners.
The Committee supports the Agency’s Pesticide Licensing Pro-
gram and encourages the Agency to continue ensuring the program
is implemented appropriately, efficiently, and as Congress in-
tended. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Agency to con-
sider pesticide usage data, existing conservation practice data, real
world studies on the impact of spray drift and surface water, and
sub-county level species range maps when conducting Endangered
Species Act [ESA] assessments of pesticides, among other appro-
priate information. Additionally, the Committee encourages the
Agency to coordinate with and seek input from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture and impacted stakeholders when considering
93
mitigation actions related to impacts of pesticides on listed species
and their designated critical habitat before publishing an interim
decision or interim decision.
Research: Air, Climate, and Energy.—The Committee rec-
ommends $94,080,000. The Committee supports EPA’s efforts to
advance climate research. The Committee encourages the Agency
to prioritize research into improving air pollution monitoring capa-
bilities and methodologies. Within available funds, the Committee
continues funding for the study under the heading ‘‘Partnership
Research’’ contained in the explanatory statement accompanying
Public Law 115–141.
Research: Chemical Safety and Sustainability.—The Committee
recommends $124,496,000.
Research: Safe and Sustainable Water Resources.—The Com-
mittee recommends $109,270,000 for the Safe and Sustainable
Water Resources Program. Of the funds recommended, $5,000,000
shall be allocated for grants under Section 2007 of Public Law 115–

Section 4:
270.
Research: National Priorities.—The Committee recommends
$19,530,000 for Research: National Priorities, of which $6,222,000
is for extramural research grants, independent of the Science to
Achieve Results [STAR] grant program, to fund high-priority water
quality and availability research by not-for-profit organizations
that often partner with the Agency. Because these grants are inde-
pendent of the STAR grant program, the Agency should strive to
award grants in as large an amount as is possible to achieve the
most scientifically significant research. Funds shall be awarded
competitively with priority given to partners proposing research of
national scope and who provide a 25-percent match. The Agency is
directed to allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of enactment
of this act. The Committee supports the Agency’s efforts to
prioritize new Federal research that will help farmers, ranchers,
and rural communities manage PFAS impacts in agricultural set-
tings and communities and includes $7,000,000 to continue that
work. The Agency is directed to work with the Department of Agri-
culture to invest in agronomic research to better understand PFAS
uptake into plants and animals to help reduce PFAS exposure in
our food supply and promote farm viability.
The Committee recommends $6,278,000 for Congressionally Di-
rected Spending grants. Further detail on these projects is located
in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending’’ accom-
panying this report.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee has provided the fol-
lowing additional guidance with respect to funding provided under
this account.
Science to Achieve Results [STAR] Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommends funds to continue the STAR program and directs the
Agency to distribute grants consistent with fiscal year 2024. The
Committee urges that funding for Children’s Environmental Health
and Disease Prevention be continued. The Committee supports the
efforts of the Agency to focus this funding on research related to
early life stage, including prenatal, vulnerabilities to environ-
mental stressors. The Committee remains interested in the feasi-
bility of reestablishing the Graduate Fellowship program and of im-
94
plementing a mechanism to allow for submission of unsolicited,
principal investigator-initiated proposals to STAR in order to cap-
ture innovative research ideas that may exist outside of the Agency
and that advance its mission. The Agency is directed to brief the
Committee on the program within 60 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee looks forward to receiving the briefing directed in
the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 116–260.
Wildfire Smoke Research.—The Committee notes with concern
the adverse health effects that smoke from wildland fire has on im-
pacted communities. The Committee is aware of and supports ef-
forts by EPA to develop best-practices, community-based interven-
tions, and communication strategies for affected communities in-
cluding for underserved or under-monitored communities. The
Committee encourages the Agency to expand its efforts to identify
methods to reduce smoke exposure during wildfire episodes and im-
prove wildfire smoke monitoring and prediction.
Plastics.—The Committee continues the directive contained in
Senate Report 118–83.
Landfill Emissions Research.—The Committee encourages the
Agency to prioritize efforts to refine greenhouse gas and air pollut-
ant measurement. In particular, municipal solid waste landfills
continue to be a significant source of greenhouse gas and haz-
ardous air pollutant emissions. The Committee directs that at least
enacted levels be used by the Office of Research and Development
to support research to frequently monitor and quantify emissions
of methane and hazardous air pollutants from landfills using the
most effective technologies, including infrared spectroscopy from
satellites, as appropriate and, during the times the emissions are
measured, measurement of any quantity of methane captured by
the landfill gas collection system. The Committee notes the Agen-
cy’s Unified Agenda seeking to reexamine its air quality standards
for municipal solid waste landfills.
Harmful Algal Blooms.—The Committee recognizes the increas-
ing challenges many communities face from harmful algal blooms
[HABs] in freshwater and coastal ecosystems. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to fund research grants that help promote sci-
entific progress towards preventing and controlling HABs in fresh-
water and coastal ecosystems, including research to: (1) determine
the effectiveness of existing nutrient prevention and treatment
technologies; (2) evaluate the scale-up of emerging nutrient treat-
ment technologies and develop new technologies; and (3) develop
best management practices to help both rural and urban commu-
nities reduce nutrients in their watersheds. Within the Safe and
Sustainable Water Research Program, the Committee encourages
EPA to prioritize funding for research on how to better understand
and address HABs, support States in their efforts to prevent and
manage HABs, and research the health issues related to aero-
solized exposure to water contaminated with HABs. Further, the
Committee notes the Agency’s research to improve the under-
standing of discrete and diffuse sources of nutrient pollution that
contribute directly to HABs as well as research to better under-
stand the variety of nutrients that can contribute to HABs.
Research Vessels.—The Committee notes the Lake Explorer II
vessel is close to being condemned and encourages current funding
95
be used to ensure continuity of the Agency’s water quality and bio-
logical monitoring of the Great Lakes, including by replacing the
vessel.
PFAS.—The Committee continues its support for PFAS research
at enacted levels and supports the research priorities outlined in
the PFAS Framework to Prevent Unsafe New PFAS from Entering
the Market.

The Committee recommends $2,869,076,000 for Environmental
Programs and Management.. The detailed allocation of funding by
program and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Program directives and specific funding requirements are
noted in the following narrative.
The Committee recommendation includes a new appropriations
account which includes funding recommendations for the Imme-
diate Office of the Administrator and the Office of the Chief Finan-
cial Officer. Of which, funding for these two offices previously came
from programs within the Environmental Programs and Manage-
ment appropriations account, totaling $183,830,000 for fiscal year

Section 5:
2025. For fiscal year 2026, this funding has been moved from the
Environmental Programs and Management appropriations account
and into the Office of the Administrator appropriations account.
Clean Air.—The Committee recommends $299,000,000 for Clean
Air. These resources will support efforts to address harmful air pol-
lutants including greenhouse gases that are contributing to climate
change. The resources recommended include funding for the phase
down of the use of hydrofluorocarbons. The Committee appreciates
the Agency’s work to implement this phase down and recognizes
more resources are necessary to make grants under the authority
provided in 42 U.S.C. 7676(h)(5). The Committee requests a brief-
ing within 120 days of enactment of this act on these efforts.
The Committee recognizes the value of and continues to support
the Energy Star program and recommends $36,000,000 for Energy
Star, equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Therefore, the
Agency is directed to report to the Committee not later than 30
days after the enactment of this act on the future of Energy Star
at the Agency.
The Committee encourages the Agency in partnership with other
Federal agencies to study and incorporate capabilities for observa-
tional methane and greenhouse gas monitoring and information
96
systems that will integrate data from a variety of observational
sources. The goal of such a system should be to make data more
accessible and usable to Federal, State, Tribal, and local govern-
ments, researchers, the public, and other users and to inform the
Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory.
The Committee directs the Agency to submit a report within 180
days of enactment of this act on how it will work with local, State,
and Federal stakeholders, especially where Federal sources are a
significant source of nonattainment, to reduce criteria pollutants.
Where appropriate, the Committee encourages the Agency to solicit
information from the public on ideas for achieving emissions reduc-
tions which could include incentive programs.
The Committee commends EPA for its efforts through the
AirNow Fire and Smoke Map to better forecast and communicate
the impact of wildfire smoke on communities. The Committee is
concerned that air quality monitors are not currently distributed
equitably across impacted communities. The Committee encourages
EPA to expand its support for wildfire smoke monitoring, including
improving instrumentation, technical assistance, and outreach,
using the resources provided in this bill with a focus on tradition-
ally underserved or under-monitored communities. The rec-
ommendation continues funding for wildfire smoke-related activi-
ties.
The Committee remains very concerned over the Agency’s wood
stove certification and testing program. The Committee notes the
Inspector General’s report finding significant shortcomings in the
program leading to little health benefits at significant public cost.
The bill maintains the enacted level for the Agency’s wood stove
certification and testing standards work. The Agency is directed to
use the base funding to increase its staffing and other required ef-
forts to support the wood stove certification and testing program.
The Agency is further directed to brief the Committee within 60
days of enactment of this act on improvements the Agency plans
to make to the program and how it will better communicate with
State and local stakeholders.
Compliance.—The Committee recommends $97,795,000 for Com-
pliance. The Committee supports the Agency’s efforts to modernize
its compliance information systems to reduce duplication of effort
and improve their utility for the public, States, Territories, Tribes,
and other stakeholders, as well as efforts to accelerate EPA’s devel-
opment and adoption of Smart Tools for Field Inspectors. The Com-
mittee urges the Agency to facilitate ample opportunities for stake-
holder input into the development of these efforts.
Enforcement.—The Committee recommends $284,931,000.
The Committee funds EPA’s Civil Enforcement activities and en-
courages the Agency to focus its enforcement resources on the most
serious environmental violations, including through National En-
forcement and Compliance Initiatives [NECIs] that seek to improve
air quality, provide for clean and safe water, and ensure chemical
safety. The Committee also notes the potential of addressing PFAS
contamination in the future NECIs and considering voluntary Sup-
plemental Environmental Projects [SEPs] as appropriate.
Environmental Protection: National Priorities.—The Committee
recommends $30,700,000 for competitive grants for qualified non-
97
profit organizations to provide technical assistance for improved
water quality or safe drinking water, adequate waste water to
small systems, or individual private well owners. The Agency shall
provide $26,000,000 for Grassroots Rural and Small Community
Water Systems Assistance Act (Public Law 114–98), for activities
specified under section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42
U.S.C. 300j–1(e)(8)). The Agency is directed to provide funding to
the most qualified and experienced non-profit organizations in pro-
viding technical assistance to small water systems and to issue the
grant awards on an annual basis.
The Agency is also directed to provide $3,450,000 for grants to
qualified not-for-profit organizations for technical assistance for in-
dividual private well owners, with priority given to organizations
that currently provide technical and educational assistance to indi-
vidual private well owners. The Agency is directed to provide, on
a national and multi-State regional basis, $1,250,000 for grants to
qualified organizations for the sole purpose of providing on-site
training and technical assistance for wastewater systems. The
Agency shall require each grantee to provide a minimum 10 per-
cent match, including in-kind contributions. The Agency is directed
to allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this
act. Additionally, the Agency must consult with the Committee be-
fore making multi-year awards.
Geographic Programs.—The Committee recommends
$684,726,000 for Geographic Programs.
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.—The Committee recommends
$368,000,000 for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. A long-
term goal of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative [GLRI] articu-
lated in the GLRI Action Plan calls for land use, recreation, and
economic activities that are managed to ensure that nearshore
aquatic, wetland, and upland habitats will sustain the health and
function of natural communities. The Committee is aware that
metropolitan planning organizations in the region are working on
site-specific land-use and economic development projects with local
communities bordering the Great Lakes that can help advance this
effort. The Agency is encouraged to work with these groups to ad-
vance this long-term goal as they allocate funding under the GLRI.
The Committee encourages Agency funds for Great Lakes projects
to be made available for projects in the historic Great Lakes Basin,
which includes the Chicago River Watershed. Further, the Com-
mittee notes the need to address contaminated sediment and urges
the Agency to seek a non-Federal in-kind resources for the Chicago
River Watershed.
The Committee encourages the Agency to work with the other
members of the Great Lakes Interagency Taskforce and implement
projects benefiting historically underserved communities.
The Committee is encouraged by the Agency’s commitment to ac-
celerate the clean-up of Areas of Concern. The Committee notes
that there is currently no community representation standard for
Areas of Concern Public Advisory Councils, which are the entities
charged with increasing public awareness, representing public pri-
orities, and ensuring project implementation. The Committee urges
the Agency to brief the Committee on how communities most im-
pacted by Areas of Concern are represented in decision-making
98
processes, steps to enhance community engagement and local ca-
pacity building, and the Agency’s plan for engaging the Great
Lakes community in the development of Action Plan IV. Finally,
the Committee recommends the GLRI Distinct Tribal Program be
funded at 5 percent of the annually appropriated GLRI funding
level.
Chesapeake Bay.—The Committee recommends $92,000,000 for
the Chesapeake Bay program. From the total amount provided, at
least $10,000,000 is recommended for nutrient and sediment re-
moval grants, at least $10,000,000 is recommended for small water-
shed grants to control polluted runoff from urban, suburban and
agricultural lands, and at least $8,000,000 is recommended for
State-based implementation in the most effective basins.
Puget Sound.—The Committee recommends $57,000,000, an in-
crease of $3,000,000 to fiscal year 2024 enacted levels, for the
Puget Sound program and continues the direction contained in the
explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–42.
South Florida.—The Committee recommends $8,500,000 for the
South Florida program. Within the funds provided, the Committee
recommends at least $2,000,000 to monitor coral health in South
Florida; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality and seagrass moni-
toring in the Caloosahatchee Estuary and Indian River Lagoon, es-
pecially with respect to assessing the impact of Lake Okeechobee
discharges and harmful algal blooms; and $1,150,000 to enhance
water quality and seagrass monitoring in Florida Bay and Biscayne
Bay, especially with respect to assessing the impact of Everglades
Restoration projects and harmful algal blooms.
Long Island Sound.—The Committee recommends $40,002,000
for the Long Island Sound program. The Committee directs the
Agency to follow the directives contained in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 118–42.
Gulf of Mexico.—The Committee recommends $25,524,000 for the
Gulf of Mexico Geographic Program. The Committee notes that hy-
poxia continues to be a growing cause for concern. The Committee
directs the Agency to coordinate with the Department of Agri-
culture, the Gulf States, and other State, local, and private part-
ners to leverage greater resources toward conservation projects on
working-lands within the Gulf Region and Mississippi River Basin.
The Agency is directed to distribute funds in the same manner as
fiscal year 2024.
Lake Champlain.—The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for
the Lake Champlain program. These funds shall be allocated
through the Lake Champlain Basin Program, other than con-
tinuing the enacted levels to support significant, impactful projects
identified in the State implementation plan that will make measur-
able progress towards meeting the phosphorus reduction targets of
the EPA’s 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for
Lake Champlain.
Lake Pontchartrain.—The Committee recommends $2,200,000 for
the Lake Pontchartrain program. The Lake Pontchartrain Restora-
tion Program has been administered through the active participa-
tion of stakeholders within the sixteen-parish basin since the pro-
gram’s inception and the Committee expects local stakeholder con-
99
sensus to continue to play an integral role in the approval of rec-
ommended projects.
Northwest Forest.—The Committee continues to support the
Northwest Forest Program at not less than the fiscal year 2021
funding level.
Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Program.—
The Committee appreciates the ongoing research to combat aquatic
nuisance species transported by commercial shipping and ballast
water operations in order to implement the Great Lakes and Lake
Champlain Invasive Species Program as authorized by the Vessel
Incident Discharge Act (Public Law 115–282). The Committee di-
rects the Agency to use funds from the appropriate Geographic Pro-
gram to build on these implementation efforts to reduce the risk of
introduction of invasive species into the Great Lakes and Lake
Champlain. The Agency is directed to brief the Committee on the
details of these funding amounts with 90 days of enactment of this
act.
Indoor Air and Radiation.—The Committee recommends
$26,852,000 for Indoor Air and Radiation. The Committee encour-
ages the Agency to continue indoor air efforts in order to address
wildfire smoke, extreme heat, and other indoor air quality hazards.
The Committee recognizes the importance of safe and healthy
learning environments which includes access to clean indoor air.
The Committee supports the Agency’s Indoor Air Quality Tools for
Schools program and the ongoing grant programs to improve indoor
environmental quality in schools. Within available funds, the Com-
mittee supports technical assistance and science-based resources on
implementing source reduction strategies, sustainable ventilation,
filtration and other indoor air quality improvements for healthy
school environments.
Information Exchange/Outreach.—The Committee recommends
$77,893,000 for Information Exchange/Outreach. Tribal capacity
building is recommended at not less than $14,414,000. Environ-
mental Education is recommended at not less than $9,500,000.
International Programs.—The Committee recommends
$15,177,000. This includes funding for high-priority water and
wastewater treatment facilities along the U.S. Mexico Border to
prevent transboundary pollution, including raw sewage discharges,
harmful chemicals, and large amounts of debris. The Committee
recognizes that cross-border water infrastructure systems and
projects are inadequate for current challenges, including for im-
pacts from transboundary pollution events and security risks. The
Committee directs the Agency to ensure robust funding is directed
to border areas with the highest water and sewage pollution and
projects located near Ports of Entry critical to border security ef-
forts while continuing to ensure projects selected have appropriate
sponsors, funding, and means for sustainable operations. The Com-
mittee requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act
on progress for a sewage pathogen prediction model, expansion of
the South Bay International Water Treatment Plant, and
prioritization of funding for the Border Water Infrastructure Grant
Program.
Pesticide Licensing.—The Committee recommends $115,375,000.
The Committee continues the direction contained in Senate Report
100
118–83. The Committee recommends that the Agency ensure that
any epidemiological study or data considered by the Agency for reg-
ulatory decisionmaking in the pesticide review process meets ap-
propriate data requirements and peer review and consider whether
to update its guidance accordingly.
The Committee recognizes more resources are necessary to up-
date the Framework for Incorporating Human Epidemiologic and
Incident Data in Risk Assessments for Pesticides. The Committee
directs the Agency to continue to update and refine its draft
Rodenticide Strategy to include stakeholder input on the feasibility
of mitigation measures, measurable feedback on their effectiveness
at minimizing exposure to nontarget wildlife, and to listed species
and their habitat. Finally, the Committee notes the Agency’s re-
view of neonicotinoid insecticides on birds, insects, and the environ-
ment in addition to the tests regularly undertaken as part of pes-
ticide registration.
The Committee is concerned by the timeliness and pace of oper-
ations at the Office of Pesticide Programs [OPP] and notes the stat-
utory requirements in the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act
of 2022, in particular on the independent third-party assessment
(FIFRA section 33(c)(3)(C)) and extension of decision review time
periods (FIFRA section 33(f)(5)(A)), are not being met. Such delays
and uncertainty deter potential applicants and fundamentally un-
dercut the program’s impact. Therefore, within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee directs EPA to report back to the
Committee of EPA’s receipt of the third party audit final report in-
cluding how the Agency will ensure there are adequate personnel
levels to meet statutory obligations and identifying areas where
staffing is necessary to reduce backlog. The Committee expects
OPP to prioritize resources to meet statutory deadlines and re-
quirements in a transparent manner.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (Public Law 94–580).—
The recommendation includes $120,650,000. The Committee appre-
ciates EPA’s work to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic
and other waste in waterways and oceans.
Of funds recommended under the Resource Conservation and Re-
covery Act program area, $9,000,000 is for implementation of a
Federal permit program for coal combustion residuals in non-
participating States, as authorized under section 4005(d)(2)(B) of
the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(2)(B)), or to pro-
vide technical assistance to States establishing their own permit-
ting program under section 4005(d) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act
(42 U.S.C. 6945(d)).
Alaska Contaminated Sites.—The Committee recognizes the in-
justice done to Alaska Natives when, in return for settling their ab-
original rights to land under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act, the Federal Government conveyed to them thousands of con-
taminated sites which to-date largely remain contaminated because
of Federal inaction. This enduring environmental injustice poses a
significant threat to human health and the environment, including
to drinking water sources, homes, schools, and more. The Com-
mittee recommends $21,000,000 for the inventory, verification, as-
sessment, and remediation of these contaminated sites, as well as
related community outreach and involvement. The Committee rec-
101
ognizes that neither the State of Alaska nor the Agency are respon-
sible for the contamination. The Committee continues to thank the
Agency for its leadership on this longstanding environmental injus-
tice.
Toxics Risk Review and Prevention.—The Committee rec-
ommends $112,953,000 for Toxics Risk Review and Prevention ac-
tivities. The Committee reminds the Agency that the Lautenberg
Act established a shared responsibility for the taxpayer and indus-
try to contribute their share to support the TSCA program. The
Committee notes recent actions related to changes to the fee
amounts, the Agency’s total costs for administering TSCA, exemp-
tions, and modifications to requirements and timeframes, and di-
rects the Agency to provide a briefing within 60 days of enactment
of this act and a report to the Committee within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act outlining implementation of these changes.
The Committee supports the Safer Choice program and directs
that the program be funded at no less than the enacted level and
operated consistent with prior years. Given the significant impact
lead exposure has on children and their development, the Com-
mittee encourages EPA to prioritize its efforts to protect the public
from lead hazards, including working with other agencies and de-
partments to advance progress in addressing lead hazards in
homes with children and in schools.
The Committee understands the Agency’s Office of Pollution Pre-
vention and Toxics technology systems are in need of significant
modernization and notes the infusion of funds from recent con-
tinuing resolutions for these purposes. Of the funds recommended,
the Committee encourages the Agency to begin the stabilization
and modernization of relevant systems.
The Committee notes that the Agency has recently finalized a
Risk Evaluation Framework rule regarding the use of personal pro-
tective equipment. The Agency is directed to brief the Committee
about how stakeholder feedback is being considered by the Agency
within 180 days of enactment of this act.
6PPD-quinone.—The Committee continues to be concerned with
the impact that 6p-phenylene-diameine [6PPD] and its
transformant, 6PPD-quinone [6PPD-q], are having on aquatic eco-
systems. The Committee supports the Agency’s work on the recent
testing method, its efforts to evaluate and implement stormwater
management tools, and its research of safe alternatives to 6PPD.
The Committee directs the Agency to continue coordinating across
Federal and State agencies on shared priorities and to engage in
robust government-to-government consultation with impacted
Tribes. The Agency is directed to provide a report to the Committee
within 90 days of enactment of this act on 6PPD-related activities,
including the Agency’s current strategy, alternatives and storm
water management solutions, a plan for addressing potential data
gaps, recommendations for future research activities, and potential
funding sources.
Further, Congress has provided the Agency with robust tools to
address the harms caused by toxic chemicals. The Committee notes
the requirements under the Lautenberg Act for chemical sub-
stances that present an unreasonable risk to the environment, is
encouraged by the Agency’s recent decision relating to a petition re-
102
garding 6PPD, and reminds the Agency of their obligations to up-
hold Tribal treaty rights.
New Chemical Submissions.—The Committee directs the Agency
to develop and then implement an improvement plan to the New
Chemicals program with the goal of improving the timeframe for
new chemical reviews to be completed and determinations made
given the 90-day statutory deadline. The Agency is directed to sub-
mit and brief the Committee on the plan within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act. Further, the Agency is directed to enhance com-
munication, improve the transparency of the process, and commu-
nicate status of submissions with new chemicals submitters. EPA
is encouraged to accommodate pre-consultation meetings prior to
submission and improve transparency for submitters of the status
of their submissions in the review process. The Agency is directed
to brief the Committee within 120 days of enactment of this act on
these efforts.
Tiered Testing.—The Committee encourages the Agency to con-
duct an objective analysis of all relevant, reliable, and reasonably
available existing information before requiring additional testing to
fill information needs for risk-based decision-making for both new
and existing chemicals. Further, the Committee directs the Agency
to employ a tiered testing and assessment framework to address
data needs, in accordance with the law.
Ensure Clean Water: National Estuary Program/Coastal Water-
ways and Wetlands.—The Committee recommends $60,884,000, of
which the Committee recommends $850,000 per estuary for each of
the 28 national estuaries in the National Estuary Program [NEP]
authorized by section 320 of the Clean Water Act (Public Law 92–
500). The Committee also recommends at least $2,500,000 in com-
petitive grants under the NEP.
National Estuary Program.—The Committee supports the Na-
tional Estuary Program [NEP] and believes that estuaries provide
critical ecosystem services that protect human health and public
safety. These include water filtration, flood control, habitat en-
hancement and restoration, shoreline stabilization, erosion preven-
tion, and the protection of coastal communities during hurricanes
and storms. The Committee recognizes that many industries rely
on healthy estuaries, and the Committee has provided funding to
ensure the protection of these critical ecosystems.

Meat and Poultry Products Effluent Guidelines.—The Committee
notes concerns of the Agency’s analysis of costs and feasibility in
the proposed rule published on January 23, 2024. The Agency is di-
rected to report to the Committees on the economic analyses under-
lying each option in the proposed rule within 30 days of enactment
of this act.
Ensure Safe Water.—The Committee recommends $117,000,000.
The Committee recommends funding via the State and Tribal As-
sistance Grant account to support monitoring for unregulated con-
taminants under section 1445(a)(2)(C) of the Safe Drinking Water
Act and urges the Agency to proceed expeditiously to implement
this program. The Agency is directed to brief the Committee on the
Agency’s implementation plan within 180 days of the enactment of
this act. The Committee appreciates the completion of the 2024
Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey Assessment and rec-
ognizes the assessment results in a substantial increase in drink-
ing water infrastructure need since the sixth assessment.
The Committee is concerned about the availability of safe drink-
ing water curing national emergencies and natural disasters. The
Committee directs the Agency to collaborate with State govern-
ments on the development of a standardized pre-approval process
consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements for use of
mobile water treatment systems that demonstrate defined capabili-
ties for up to 180 days. The Agency is further directed to report to
the Committees, within 120 days of enactment of this act, a report
outlining coordination efforts and actions taken.
The Committee is concerned by the long processing time for Un-
derground Injection Control Class VI well applications and the
small number of final decisions approved by the Agency. The Com-
mittee urges greater priority be given to these permits within the
Agency, including reviewing State applications for primacy.
The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for the Agency’s contin-
ued work within the Underground Injection Control [UIC] program
related to Class VI wells for geologic sequestration to help develop
104
expertise and capacity at the Agency and process primacy applica-
tions.
In addition, the Committee recommends $1,200,000 to support
Class VI regulator education and training programs in conjunction
with States, or other eligible entities such as an association of
States.
The Agency is directed to provide an update to the Committee on
the program direction regarding Underground Injection Control
Wells contained in Senate Report 118–83.
Ensure Clean Water.—The Committee recommends $242,292,000.
The Committee recommends not less than the enacted level for the
WaterSense program and maintains previous program direction.
The Committee supports the Agency’s ongoing activities related
to integrated planning, which will be increasingly necessary as
States and communities work to meet their myriad clean water ob-
ligations while keeping rates affordable for water ratepayers. The
Committee recommends up to $2,000,000 for integrated planning
activities consistent with section 402(s) of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342(s)).
The Committee continues to appreciate EPA’s work to advance
water recycling through the National Water Reuse Action Plan.
The Committee directs the Water Reuse Interagency Working
Group to analyze the public benefit of a Federal investment tax in-
centive that will encourage and leverage private investment in
water reuse and recycling infrastructure.
The Committee notes the Agency’s consideration of effluent limit
guidelines and biosolids regulations with respect to PFAS chemi-
cals. Within available funds, the Committee encourages the Agen-
cy, through full-time equivalents [FTEs] and extramural funding,
to expeditiously collect data and take action to better protect com-
munities impacted by discharges of PFAS.
Urban Waters.—The Committee recommends $1,500,000 for the
Urban Waters program.
Drinking Water Quality.—The Committee directs the Agency to
provide a briefing not later than 60 days following the enactment
of this act on resources available for the Agency to assist States
and counties with a high prevalence of violations of drinking water
regulations, such as Wyoming County and McDowell County in
southern West Virginia.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance with respect to funding provided under this ac-
count.
Community Air Quality Monitoring.—As part of the Agency’s en-
hanced air quality monitoring effort, the Committee urges the
Agency to prioritize air quality monitoring systems that yield fre-
quently repeated measurements of pollutants, cumulative impacts
approaches, and identify hotspots or areas of persistent elevated
levels of pollutants localized to and caused by the characteristics of
a specific geographic location. The Committee expects the Agency
to utilize this information to provide regularly updated data to
overburdened and marginalized communities and for public aware-
ness, enforcement purposes where applicable, and other activities.
Transboundary Watersheds.—The Committee directs the Agency
to continue and expand its work coordinating with Federal, State,
105
local, and Tribal agencies to monitor and reduce transboundary
mining pollution in the Kootenai watershed and other U.S.-British
Columbia transboundary watersheds. The Committee notes that
U.S. and Canada have provided a joint reference to the Inter-
national Joint Commission for the development of an action plan
to reduce and mitigate transboundary water pollution. The Com-
mittee supports efforts to compliment the Commission’s work. The
Committee recommends $2,000,000 for such monitoring, manage-
ment, and interagency activities in U.S.-British Columbia trans-
boundary watersheds. The Committee directs the Agency to allo-
cate these funds in its fiscal year 2025 operating plan to the appro-
priate program project area for carrying out these activities. The
Committee reminds the Agency of the direction in the explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 117–103 to brief the Com-
mittee within 90 days on the Agency’s progress to document base-
line conditions and mining-related impacts, and any additional
staff or resources needed for this project.
Small Refinery Relief.—The Committee recognizes that the Re-
newable Fuels Standard [RFS] under Clean Air Act section
211(o)(9) provides that EPA may exempt small refineries from com-
pliance with the RFS in certain circumstances and that a small re-
finery ‘‘may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension
of the exemption for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-
ship.’’
Pre-Commercial Thinning.—The Committee recognizes that pre-
commercial thinning from non-Federal forestland that is not eco-
logically sensitive forestland can qualify as renewable biomass for
purposes of the RFS under the provisions detailed in 40 CFR

Section 6:
80.1401. The Committee directs the Agency to support other Fed-
eral agencies leading efforts to enhance markets for low-grade and
low-value wood. The Agency is further directed to brief the Com-
mittee on these efforts within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Ethylene Oxide.—The Committee notes previous Agency action
on ethylene oxide emissions and encourages continued collaboration
with stakeholders.
Asbestos.—As the Agency continues to find the risks associated
with exposure to asbestos unreasonable, the Committee encourages
the Agency to expeditiously finalize safeguards, including to ad-
dress gaps in risk evaluations that protect communities from fur-
ther exposure.
Output-Based Regulations.—The Committee encourages EPA to
inform States of applicable tools, such as output-based regulations,
that will encourage fuel efficiency as an air pollution prevention
measure and assist States in meeting environmental and energy
goals.
Further, the Committee requests additional information about
the state of manufacturing decarbonization. The Committee re-
quests a briefing within 120 days regarding the regulatory barriers
and costs, potential for reducing emissions emitted throughout
manufacturing processes permitting, and waste utilization opportu-
nities.
Chemical Reviews.—The Committee continues the direction con-
tained in Senate Report 118–83.
106
Children and Other Sensitive Populations.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of improving the internal and exterior envi-
ronments at K–12 schools. In order to ensure the Administration
is providing the most comprehensive information regarding oppor-
tunities for assistance to schools, the Committee requires the Agen-
cy to work with the Departments of Energy and Education, includ-
ing to update the requirements and report required by the Energy
Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–260). In executing this, the Committee
recommends new and existing opportunities for schools to improve
their environments for students, reduce emissions, and eliminate
frequently-littered plastic sources.
Northwest Area Contingency Plan Critical Energy Infrastructure
Hub Resiliency Study.—The Committee is concerned by the poten-
tial environmental impacts from oil spills in the Columbia River
Basin as a result of a potential seismic event. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to update the Area Contingency Plan and to
collaborate with institutions of higher education and State, local,
and Tribal governments to work with the community to develop
earthquake resilient plans in urban areas and recommends
$1,000,000 within Ensure Clean Water program project area for
this purpose.
Electric Arc Furnace Steel Slag.—The Committee notes the Agen-
cy’s efforts to evaluate EAF steel slag and encourages the Agency
to be consistent, where appropriate, with regulations governing
blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace, and open hearth furnace slag.
Prescribed Burns.—The Committee recognizes that prescribed
burns have proven to be an effective and necessary tool to combat
catastrophic wildfires and notes the implementation tools to sup-
port communities consistent with enacted law. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to develop additional tools for reducing the re-
sources required to pursue exceptional events documentation for
prescribed burns.

$3,279,776,000 for Infrastructure Assistance. The Committee is
aware that the Agency requires a certified operator in order to re-
lease funds for certain water and sanitation funding; however,
some communities do not have a community system for either, or
access to a certified operator. Therefore, the Committee directs the
Agency to work with the Indian Health Service and those commu-
nities that lack water and sanitation systems, as well as a certified
operator, to prevent the potential loss of funding and develop a
training plan for operator certification.
State Revolving Funds.—The Committee recommends
$2,764,962,000 for State Revolving Funds [SRFs] to support drink-
ing and clean water infrastructure. These funds provide support for
critical investments in water infrastructure in communities across
the country.
Infrastructure Projects.—From within funds recommended for
capitalization grants for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund
and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, the Committee rec-
ommends $349,668,000 from the Clean Water SRF and
$247,569,000 from the Drinking Water SRF be for Congressionally
Directed Spending grants for the construction of drinking water,
waste-water, and storm-water infrastructure and for water quality
protection. Each project shall provide not less than 20 percent
matching funds from non-Federal sources, unless approved for a
waiver. Applicable Federal requirements that would apply to a
Clean Water State Revolving Fund or Drinking Water State Re-
volving Fund project grant recipient shall apply to a grantee receiv-
ing a congressionally directed spending grant under this section.
The Committee notes that the following funding sources are to be
treated as non-Federal funds and can be used to meet the non-Fed-
eral matching fund requirement: U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Community Development Block Grant Pro-
gram; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development Pro-
gram; and Appalachian Regional Commission grants. Funding
made available to jurisdictions through the American Rescue Plan
act of 2021 (Public Law 117–2) is considered Federal funds and
may not be applied towards the non-Federal cost share require-
ment. With approval from the project recipient, the Administrator
may provide funding by grant or cooperative agreement to States
to administer any Congressional Directed Spending projects being
co-funded by the State SRF program or to support administration
of other Congressional Directed Spending projects. A detailed list
of projects is located in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending’’ accompanying this report.
The Committee recommends a total of $597,237,000 in funding
for 291 drinking water and clean water Congressionally Directed
Spending projects.
The Committee remains concerned that EPA does not have suffi-
cient resources necessary to expeditiously implement this program
and fully support recipients as they address applicable Federal
grant requirements. Accordingly, the Committee recommends
$19,000,000 in new funding for salaries, expenses, and administra-
tion for Congressionally Directed Spending provided in previous fis-
cal years and in this act. Further, the Committee appreciates the
110
Agency’s engagement with the Committee regarding additional, po-
tential solutions to help resolve the Agency’s significant backlog of
Congressionally Directed Spending projects and directs the Agency
to identify and commence regulatory actions and other administra-
tive actions that will help obligate funding more quickly, including
to adopt state environmental reviews. Further, the Committee di-
rects the Agency to report to the Committees within 30 days of en-
actment of this act on the status of each Congressionally Directed
Spending project provided through each fiscal year since Public
Law 117–103. The Committee reminds the Agency of previous com-
mitments to seriously engage with the Committee on finding long-
term solutions to the growing backlog of CDS projects.
Cost Share Waivers for Watershed Scale Benefits.—The Com-
mittee is concerned that the Agency has limited cost share waiver
criteria for community grants within the State Revolving Funds to
direct financial benefit in areas where projects provide clear indi-
rect benefits to eligible communities and encourages EPA to reex-
amine waiver eligibility for community grant projects, such as im-
proved water quality, conserved water, and drought resiliency.
1944 Water Treaty.—The Committee recommends the Agency to
coordinate with NADBank, the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
and the U.S. Department of the Interior to produce a comprehen-
sive report to improve the water storage and systems of the region
affected by the 1944 water treaty. The Agency is directed to work
with NADBank to consult with relevant constituents from the
State of Texas, Rio Grande Valley agriculture, appropriate Texas
water agencies, and the IBWC as necessary, to compile a report.
The Committee directs the Agency to report to the Committee with-
in 1 year of enactment of this act. Further, the Committee directs
the Agency to work with NADBank to re-establish the Water Infra-
structure fund as authorized to provide concessional financing for
water infrastructure to areas affected by the 1944 water treaty and
to address the need for water security. The Committee recommends
the Agency to work with NADBank to prioritize projects for water
infrastructure that will address water security in areas with a se-
vere need in the United States.
Diesel Emission Reduction Act Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommends $60,000,000 to continue a grant program to reduce diesel
emissions, including through electrification, as authorized by sec-
tion 793 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–58).
Targeted Airshed Grants.—The Committee recommends
$68,800,000, an increase of $1,000,000 to fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, for Targeted Airshed Grants. These grants shall be distrib-
uted on a competitive basis to nonattainment areas that EPA de-
termines are ranked as the top five most polluted areas relative to
annual ozone or particulate matter 2.5 standards, as well as the
top five areas based on the 24-hour particulate matter 2.5 standard
where the design values exceed the 35 mg/m3 standard. To deter-
mine these areas, the Agency shall use the most recent design val-
ues calculated from validated air quality data. The Committee
notes that these funds are available for emission reduction activi-
ties deemed necessary for compliance with national ambient air
quality standards and included in a State Implementation Plan
submitted to EPA. The Committee reminds the Agency of the re-
111
port request contained in Senate Report 118–83 and seeks updates
with how more recent funds were allocated. EPA shall provide a re-
port to the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this act that
includes a table showing how fiscal year 2024 and 2025 funds were
allocated. The table shall also include grant recipients and metrics
for anticipated or actual results.
Reducing Lead in Drinking Water.—The Committee encourages
these funds to be prioritized and distributed to assist the commu-
nities most burdened by lead service lines in meeting the Adminis-
tration’s 10-year goal as outlined in the Lead Pipe and Paint Plan.
Sewer Overflow Control Grants.—The Committee recommends
$39,000,000 to continue a grant program to control and treat sewer
overflows and stormwater, as authorized in section 4106 of Public
Law 115–270.
Wildfire Smoke Preparedness.—The Committee recommends
$8,500,000, an increase of $1,500,000 to fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, for wildfire smoke preparedness grants. These grants shall be
distributed on a competitive basis to States, federally recognized
Tribes, public pre-schools, local educational agencies as defined in
20 U.S.C. 7801(30), and non-profit organizations, for assessment,
prevention, control, or abatement of wildland fire smoke hazards in
community buildings, including schools as defined in 20 U.S.C.
3610(6), and related activities, and that serve disadvantaged com-
munities or vulnerable populations. The Federal share of the costs
of such activities shall not exceed 90 percent except that the Ad-
ministrator may waive such cost share requirement in the case of
facilities located in economically distressed communities. A max-
imum of 25 percent of grant funding under this paragraph during
this fiscal year may go to recipients in any one State. Further, the
Committee encourages the Agency to expand its efforts to select re-
cipients that research and identify methods to reduce smoke expo-
sure during wildland fire episodes, in addition to current eligibility
categories, and improve wildfire smoke data collection, monitoring,
prediction and community preparedness.
Technical Assistance for Wastewater Treatment Works.—The
Agency is directed to allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of
enactment of this act.
State & Tribal Assistance Grants—Other.—The Committee rec-
ommends $20,364,000 for Congressionally Directed Spending
grants. Further detail on these projects is located in the table titled
‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending’’ accompanying this report.
Stormwater Centers of Excellence.—The Committee supports ad-
dressing the unique challenges posed by managing stormwater and
runoff in different regions of the country, including impacts on
varying ecosystems. The Committee notes the importance of ad-
vancing stormwater management technologies and techniques to
protect endangered aquatic species. The Committee recommends
$2,000,000 for the Agency’s Centers of Excellence for the
Stormwater Infrastructure Technology Program.
Categorical Grants.—For Categorical Grants to States, Tribes,
and other environmental partners for the implementation of dele-
gated programs, the Committee recommends $1,106,333,000. The
Committee recommends additional resources to support State and
Tribal capacity to address environmental challenges and protect
112
the public. The Committee believes that it is vital for the Agency
to work collaboratively with State and Tribal partners and support
their work to implement delegated environmental programs.
Categorical Grant: Nonpoint Source (Sec. 319).—The Committee
recommends $174,500,000. The Committee expects the Agency to
examine the allocation formula to ensure that resources are spent
in areas with the most pressing need.
Categorical Grant: Public Water System Supervision.—The Com-
mittee recommends $115,990,000 in Public Water System Super-
vision Grants. Of the funds recommended, $12,000,000 is to further
support States, Territories, and Tribes in addressing PFAS and
other contaminants of emerging concern as they carry out their
Public Water System Supervision programs.
Categorical Grant: State and Local Air Quality Management.—
The recommendation includes $235,922,000 for State and Local Air
Quality Management. The Committee recommends increased re-
sources to help expand the capacity of air pollution control agencies
to implement programs to address greenhouse gas emissions, im-
prove air quality monitoring and outcomes, and reduce dispropor-
tionate exposure to dangerous pollution in communities. The Agen-
cy is directed to allocate funds for this program using the same for-
mula as fiscal year 2015. Should the Agency seek to change the for-
mula, the Agency shall submit a proposal in its fiscal year 2027
budget justification for consideration by the Committee.
Categorical Grant: Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste
Grants.—The Committee recommends $101,500,000 for hazardous
waste financial assistance grants. The bill includes a provision sup-
porting categorical grant funds for the purpose of providing grants
to assist States in the development and implementation of State
programs for the control of coal combustion residuals under section
2301 of the Water and Waste Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–322),
and the Agency is directed to continue funding of not less than
$4,000,000 from the Hazardous Waste Financial Assistance cat-
egorical grants program project for this purpose. The Committee
notes that funds awarded under the authority provided by this act
are not subject to section 3011 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act
(Public Law 89–272).
Additionally, of the funding recommended, $3,500,000 is to sup-
port post-consumer materials management or recycling facilities,
consistent with section 302(a) of the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act (Public
Law 116–224).
Categorical Grant: Tribal General Assistance Program.—The
Committee recommends $72,200,000 for Tribal General Assistance.
Categorical Grant: Wetland Program Development Grant.—The
Committee notes that this program, authorized under section
104(b)(3) of the Clean Water Act, allows for a wide range of activi-
ties, and encourages the Agency to coordinate with States and
Tribes to ensure existing wetlands programs may successfully uti-
lize these funds.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee has provided the fol-
lowing additional guidance with respect to funding provided under
this account.
PFAS.—The Committee supports EPA’s implementation of fund-
ing for PFAS and emerging contaminants under the bipartisan In-
113
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58). Con-
gress provided a total of $10,000,000,000 to address PFAS and
other emerging contaminants through the Drinking Water State
Revolving Fund, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the
Small and Disadvantaged Communities Program that includes a
critical state response to contaminants program. The Committee
encourages EPA to prioritize support to communities including pro-
viding technical assistance, information sessions, grant workshops,
as well as extensive advertising and outreach to ensure States,
Tribes and local entities are aware of and can fully participate in
opportunities to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants
provided by the bipartisan infrastructure law. The bill clarifies
Congressional intent that funding provided in fiscal year 2025, in-
cluding from Public Law 117–58, for grants for addressing contami-
nants under subsections (a) through (j) of section 1459A of the Safe
Drinking Water (42 U.S.C. 300j–19a) may be used by a State to
provide assistance to benefit one or more owners of drinking water
wells that are not public water systems or connected to a public
water system for necessary and appropriate activities related to a
contaminant pursuant to subsection (j) of section 1459A of the Safe
Drinking Water Act. In implementing this funding, the Committee
directs the Agency to encourage States to prioritize beneficiaries
that make less than the average household income for that state.
Use of Iron and Steel.—The recommendation includes language
in title IV general provisions that stipulates requirements for the
use of iron and steel in State Revolving Fund projects, and the rec-
ommendation includes only the following guidance. The Committee
acknowledges that EPA may issue a waiver of said requirements
for de minimis amounts of iron and steel building materials. The
Committee emphasizes that any coating processes that are applied
to the external surface of iron and steel components that otherwise
qualify under the procurement preference shall not render such
products ineligible for the procurement preference regardless of
where the coating processes occur, provided that final assembly of
the products occurs in the United States.
Schools and Clean School Bus Program.—The Committee directs
the Agency to conduct outreach to potential applicants in histori-
cally disadvantaged, underserved, low-income, and rural commu-
nities regarding the availability of resources for the replacement of
existing school buses. The Agency should collaborate with the De-
partments of Energy and Transportation to ensure technical assist-
ance, funding resources, and procedures to ensure that mechanics
and drivers have the training needed, that charging infrastructure
is appropriately installed, and the investment in clean school buses
protects and creates high-quality jobs throughout the domestic sup-
ply chain. Further, the Committee encourages the Agency to con-
tinue to work with the Departments of Energy and Education for
educational institutions to expand the transition to clean energy
and transportation.
Regional Water Commissions.—The Committee continues the di-
rection contained in Senate Report 118–83.
Food Waste.—The Committee encourages the Agency to supple-
ment education through the Recycling Education Outreach pro-
gram for a National Education Campaign on Food Waste Reduction
114
to be carried out in partnership with other stakeholders as detailed
in the Draft National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste
and Recycling Organics. The Committee requests a briefing within
180 days of enactment of this act, including regarding funding for
anaerobic digestion and food waste reduction infrastructure grants
in the Waste Minimization and Recycling Program for the Solid
Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant program.
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $72,274,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 64,510,000
The Committee recommends a total of $64,510,000 for the Water
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program [WIFIA]. The
Committee recommends $7,640,000 to assist with the administra-
tive expenses for the WIFIA program and up to $5,000,000 for the
implementation of the Securing Required Funding for Water Infra-
structure Now Act, as authorized by section 4201 of Public Law
115–270. Greater investment in the replacement of aging infra-
structure will help mitigate nationwide issues the Committee is
tracking related to contaminants such as lead and arsenic, Com-
bined Sewer Overflows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows, and the
pressing need to improve water delivery.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

FOREST SERVICE
The Forest Service [Service], a bureau of the Department of Agri-
culture, manages 193 million acres in 44 States and territories. In
addition, the Service maintains a system of research stations and
experimental forests and ranges throughout the country. The Serv-
ice also provides technical and financial assistance to private land-
owners, States, and communities to help sustain the Nation’s
urban and rural forests.
White Oak.—White Oak occupies 103 million acres in the eastern
U.S. and is critical for wildlife, biodiversity, and forest products.
Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Service is directed to
report to the Committee on efforts, including monitoring and re-
search, the Service is involved in to regenerate white oak in na-
tional forests and on State, Tribal, private, and other non-Federal
lands. Additionally, the Committee recognizes the importance of
seed stock and tree nurseries in efforts to regenerate white oak
populations.
Wildfire Recovery.—The Service is directed to partner with
Tribes to prioritize recovery on lands impacted by wildfire. Within
90 days of date of enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter,
the Service is directed to brief the Committee on these efforts.
21st Century Conservation Service Corps and Job Corps.—The
Service offers workforce development experiences for youth from
rural, suburban, and urban communities through a portfolio of pro-
grams including the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, the
Youth Conservation Corps, and hundreds of Public Lands Corps
and 21st Century Conservation Service Corps partnerships with
non-government organizations. The Committee appreciates the
Service’s continued focus on establishing additional work-based
learning projects that better integrate these programs into agency
operations and creating additional career ladders throughout the
Department of Agriculture for Job Corps graduates. The Com-
mittee directs the Service to continue to expand advanced wildfire
training offerings at Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.

Lake Tahoe Basin.—The Committee directs the Forest Service to
support the implementation of Public Law 106–506, as amended,
and restoration efforts in the greater Lake Tahoe fireshed, at no
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted levels as stipulated in the
tables incorporated by reference for National Forest System and
State, Private, and Tribal Forestry.
FOREST SERVICE OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,150,000,000
Committee Recommendation ................................................................ 1,106,000,000
The Committee recommends $1,106,000,000 for Forest Service
Operations. The detailed allocation of funding by program and ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report.
FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $300,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 308,497,000
The Committee recommends $308,497,000 for Forest and Range-
land Research. Program directives and specific funding require-
ments are noted in the following narrative.
The Forest Service research and development program rep-
resents the premier forest science institution in the world. The
basic and applied research produced by these Federal scientists
and collaborators is integral to improving the health of our forests
and grasslands by addressing threats like climate change, invasive
species and diseases, biodiversity loss, and uncharacteristic fire.
Research and development is also important to the health of rural
economies through the Service’s work to deliver new technologies
and uses for woody biomass. The Committee provides the invest-
ments and directed projects in this bill in anticipation of more in-
novative solutions for sustainable management and biomass utili-
zation to come.
Forest Inventory and Analysis.—The bill provides $32,197,000 for
the Forest Inventory and Analysis [FIA] program, the authoritative
national data source for forests and forest carbon data, which pro-
vides comprehensive data collection, analysis and reporting on for-
est conditions, including urban and community forest environ-
ments, across all forestlands for use by all forest stakeholders.
While Federal and non-Federal teams work to collect the data,
the Committee recognizes the efforts of the Forest Service research
and development staff who are responsible for analyzing and trans-
lating the data into actionable products. The Committee directs the
Service to provide a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this
act detailing the interdependency of FIA and other Research and
Development programs.
To increase data resolution of products based on the FIA plot
network and to develop ways to deal with nonresponse on the FIA
plot network, the Service should work to complete the small area
estimation effort with partners, and continue development, dem-
onstration, and deployment of advanced forest carbon monitoring,
reporting, and verification technologies such as LiDAR,
hyperspectral monitoring, uncrewed aircraft systems, in collabora-
tion with Research and Development and other partners.
117
Research and Development Programs.—The Committee rec-
ommends $60,300,000 for base research activities and $212,000,000
for salaries and expenses.
The Committee supports the current structure consisting of the
five regional research stations, the International Institute of Trop-
ical Forestry, and the Forest Products Laboratory, and directs that
each of the existing facilities and programs be funded at least at
the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Service is reminded that the
benefit to the agency and public should be identified prior to initi-
ating a project and that the research priority should be for projects
requested by or benefitting the agency’s mission first, not those
from external entities. The Committee also expects that funds col-
lected from reimbursable agreements by the research program will
be reinvested at the station level into programs of work, rather
than used to offset salaries and expenses.
The Committee notes that the National Agroforestry Center
should be appropriately staffed to provide technology transfer and
technical assistance delivery to meet increasing producer demand
for agroforestry technical assistance and scale implementation of
agroforestry practices, thus advancing the health, diversity, climate
mitigation and adaptation, and productivity of working lands,
waters, and communities.
Forest Products Laboratory.—The Committee expects the Lab to
continue research to advance wood markets, including research on
the amount of carbon stored annually in harvested wood products,
evaluated by specific wood producing sectors, setting the stage for
the completion of this carbon storage accounting on an annual
basis. The Committee further notes that the Lab should prioritize
wood innovation tech transfer and science deployment while pro-
tecting the taxpayer’s intellectual property, and fill positions that
are necessary for these efforts.
Needle Blight Mitigation.—The Committee recognizes the effect
of non-native insect pests and fungal pathogens on pine forests and
industrial wood plantations, particularly in loblolly pines, across
the southeastern United States and includes $3,000,000 to continue
collaborative research to determine the distribution and movement
of needle pathogens, understand the disease cycle and the environ-
mental factors that drive the emergence and distribution of the
needle pathogens, and determine if the appearance is due to more
aggressive strains of the pathogens and the origins of the patho-
gens.
Experimental Forests in the Northeast.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of experimental forests in the northeastern
United States for assessing the long-term response of eastern white
pine and northern hardwoods to various forest management pre-
scriptions, controlled burning and natural factors, such as insects,
disease, weather events and climate change. The continued collec-
tion of data and sustained research on experimental forests in the
Northeast is essential for predicting future forest conditions to in-
form management on National Forest System lands. This research
is also critical for advising private landowners and the forest indus-
try on how to build resilience into forest stewardship.
The Committee recognizes the importance of filling vacant re-
search and leadership positions with qualified personnel and en-
118
courages the Service to expeditiously fill these vacancies with fund
provided in this act.
Northwest Wildland and Rangeland Fire Science Consortium.—
The Committee continues to recognize the growing economic and
ecological threat wildfires pose to communities in the Northwest.
The Committee provides $1,000,000 to partner with a consortium
of higher education institutions with a demonstrated history of col-
laborating on forest and rangeland wildfire research in the North-
west region to advance the design and implementation of geo-
graphically, ecologically, and culturally relevant science-based
treatments at scale across public, private, and Tribal forests and
rangelands. This program should include all stakeholders, includ-
ing industry partners.
Research Funding Priorities.—The Service is reminded that fund-
ing for the following research initiatives is in addition to funds oth-
erwise provided to individual research stations and therefore is not
to be factored into base allocations for the stations. These items are
further incorporated by reference in the table accompanying this
report.
—$6,000,000 to support the Northeastern States Research Coop-
erative, a collaboration among universities in Maine, New
Hampshire, New York, and Vermont, sponsoring research to
sustain the health of northern forest ecosystems and commu-
nities, develop new forest products and improve forest biodiver-
sity management. Within the available funds, the Cooperative
is directed to continue the work of the Digital Forestry Sys-
tems Research Consortium to advance digital forest manage-
ment systems to increase ecosystem services and operational
efficiency in eastern forests.
—$2,000,000 to support Forest-based Cellulose Nanomaterials re-
search, including material forms, manufacturing processes, and
technology transfer.
—$1,800,000 to support the development of engineering solutions
to enhance Glacier Outburst Monitoring Capacity and Flood
Risk Mitigation within the National Forest System by col-
lecting data using drones, radar, and weather stations to model
future flood scenarios and glacier changes.
—$4,000,000 to support Wildfire and Watersheds cooperative re-
search to advance understandings and innovative solutions to
address wildfire impacts on forested source water, downstream
clean water, and water treatability.
—$3,000,000 to support Wildland Urban Interface Workforce De-
velopment through university-led research and partnerships to
better understand fires in the wildland-urban interface, im-
prove workforce development for wildfire management profes-
sionals, and improve the safety and efficiency of wildland fire-
fighting techniques.
—$1,000,000 to support a Northwest wildland and rangeland fire
science consortium.
—$1,500,000 to support Biomass Commercialization with Forest
Products Laboratory university partnerships, including lumber
standards, mass timber construction, and durability.
—$1,000,000 to support Outbreak Timber Salvage Research re-
lated to drought and needle tip blight and ips beetle outbreaks.
119
—$500,000 to support Pacific Northwest Fish Modeling work to
better understand the upper limit of fish distribution.
—$3,000,000 to support Needle Blight Mitigation collaborative
research.
Joint Fire Science.—The Committee recommends $4,000,000 to
support the Joint Fire Science program. Combined with $4,000,000
in the Department of Interior Wildland Fire Management account,
a total of $8,000,000 is provided for this program. The Committee
expects the program to continue to work with a broad network of
academic researchers to address the range of research needs to bet-
ter address fundamental connections and interactions across all
temporal phases of wildfires and enhance wildfire resilience. The
Committee expects the program to focus on salient issues such as
understanding smoke impacts, identifying drivers of fire costs, ana-
lyzing fire behavior, and quantifying fire’s effects on resources and
communities. The Committee urges the Governing Board to re-
spond to the recommendations included in the Report of the
Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, including
by establishing mechanisms to partner with the National Science
Foundation and the Department of Defense to address scientific in-
novation and technology development related to wildfires, post-fire
monitoring and recovery, and watershed health-related fire re-
search.

The Committee recommends $319,594,000 for State, Private, and
Tribal Forestry. The detailed allocation of funding by program and
activity is included in the table accompanying this report. Program
directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the fol-
lowing narrative. All funding for specific programs, directives, or
congressionally directed spending identified herein is in addition to
funds otherwise provided to States and regions through the for-
mula and competitive grant process and therefore is not to be

Sudden Oak Death.—Since 2001, the Service has been treating
Sudden Oak Death infestations on public lands in Oregon and Cali-
fornia in partnership with the Bureau of Land Management. The
Committee expects the Service to continue these efforts and rec-
ommends $2,000,000 to support Sudden Oak Death treatments and
partnerships with States and private landowners.
Spruce Budworm.—The Committee remains concerned about in-
creased threat levels of spruce budworm on Federal, State, private,
and Tribal forested lands in the Northeastern United States.
Therefore, the Committee provides 42,000,000 for Cooperative
lands forest health management, of which, $10,000,000 shall be
used to support Spruce Budworm Mitigation activities in the East-
ern United States.
Western Bark Beetle.—The Committee remains concerned about
the high rate of tree mortality in National Forests due to insect
and disease outbreaks. In many cases throughout the West, bark
beetle infestation threatens local communities and non-Federal
lands located outside of a National Forest unit. The Committee in-
structs the Service to prioritize the use of funding provided under
the Western Bark Beetle Initiative for projects located on non-Fed-
eral land in cases where state government partners identify a need
related to community wildfire protection.
Cogongrass Management.—Within the funds provided,
$3,000,000, is Cogongrass Management Pilot Program for the For-
est Service to work with Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv-
ice to provide grants to State departments of agriculture and for-
estry commissions in States identified in the final environmental
assessment published in the Federal Register on September 23,
2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 59735), to combat and treat cogongrass through
established cogongrass control programs.
Urban and Community Forestry.—The Committee recognizes the
need to restore and improve urban forests to combat exotic invasive
woody species. The Service should continue regional multi-organi-
zational collaborations to support conservation efforts for effective
urban and community forestry grants.
The Service is further directed to work with the Office of Urban
Agriculture to provide a report outlining a strategy for capitalizing
on Forest Service authorities to use agroforestry to develop green
infrastructure, resilient local food sheds, and workforce develop-
ment, within 180 days of enactment of this act.
State, Private, and Tribal Forestry Performance Measures.—The
Committee recognizes the integral relationship between the Service
and State forestry agencies in delivering the scale and coordination
necessary to meet the Nation’s forestry priorities, including State
and local wildland fire response capacity, wildfire prevention and
mitigation, addressing insects and diseases impacting forested
landscapes, and empowering private forestland owners. The Com-
mittee directs the Service, in coordination with State forestry agen-
cies, to utilize existing data collection platforms in establishing per-
formance measures for State, Private, and Tribal Forestry pro-
grams, and to deliver a performance report to the Committee with-
in 270 days of enactment of this act.
Forest Resource Information and Analysis.—The Committee rec-
ommends $19,594,000 for congressionally directed spending in this
121
program. In order to align with 2022 agency guidance, no match is
required for these projects. A detailed list of projects is included in
the ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending’’ table accompanying this
report.
International Programs and Trade.—The Committee rec-
ommends $20,000,000 for the Forest Service Office of International
Programs. The Committee supports the International Program for
its benefits to American forestry stakeholders. The Committee di-
rects the Office to collaborate with other Department of Agriculture
agencies to continue to promote American wood product exports by
implementing applied research, technical cooperation, financial as-
sistance, marketing initiatives, and other support mechanisms. The
Committee expects that funds collected from reimbursable agree-
ments will be reinvested into programs of work, rather than used
to offset salaries and expenses.
In fiscal year 2023, the Committee included language providing
for the creation of a supporting organization in order to com-
plement and expand the impact of the Office of International Pro-
grams. Now that the Forest Service International Foundation has
been established, the Committee encourages continued cooperative
support and investment by the Forest Service. While the Com-
mittee directs that no match shall be required from the Founda-
tion, the Foundation is expected to prioritize securing external
funding, as appropriate. The Service is directed to brief the Com-
mittee on funding and the state of the partnership within 90 days
of enactment of this act.

NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,863,557,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,866,143,000
The Committee recommends $1,866,143,000 for the National For-
est System. The detailed allocation of funding by program and ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report.
Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness.—The Committee rec-
ommends $47,500,000 for Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness.
These funds are used to maintain recreation sites like camp-
grounds and trails, rehabilitate recreation infrastructure like public
use cabins, improve visitor use, manage special use authorizations,
and protect heritage sites. Within these funds, $2,500,000, is pro-
vided to address trail maintenance needs within National Forests
in States and territories outside of the continental United States.
Within the funds provided, $1,000,000 is included for the Office
of Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Resources-Travel, Tourism
122
and Interpretation Program to support the Native American Tour-
ism and Improving Visitor Experience [NATIVE] Act (Public Law
114–221) Implementation, including to identify and provide tech-
nical assistance, training, and rural development support to Tribes,
Tribal organizations and Native Hawaiian organizations to promote
sustainable native tourism activities. The Committee directs the
Service, in consultation with Indian tribes, Tribal organizations,
and Native Hawaiian organizations, to identify areas where tech-
nical assistance, training, and cultural tourism development sup-
port is needed to implement the NATIVE Act. The Service shall
brief the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act, and
quarterly thereafter, on these efforts. Within the funds provided,
$3,000,000 is available to support National Recreation Areas Infra-
structure and Trails Development and to build the capacity of local
user groups and partnership organizations in National Recreation
Areas administered by the Service and established after 1997. The
Service is encouraged to evaluate how it supports the administra-
tion, cooperative management, and collaboration with the National
Park Service for the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.
Law Enforcement.—The Committee is concerned about the in-
creased financial burden that is being placed on parishes adjacent
to National Forests in the State of Louisiana. The Committee rec-
ommends an additional $86,000 to support cooperative law enforce-
ment agreements.
Grazing Management.—The Committee recommends $6,000,000
for Grazing Management. The Service is directed, to the greatest
extent practicable, to make vacant grazing allotments available to
a holder of a grazing permit or lease when lands covered by the
holder of the permit or lease are unusable because of drought or
wildfire. The Service must prioritize management of active allot-
ments that are not meeting or are inconsistent with current forest
plan standards or do not have current assessments, and reducing
the backlog of active allotments requiring analysis and new man-
agement decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act,
according to the priorities established in the Forest Service Hand-
book. The Service is directed to brief the Committee within 90 days
of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, on its progress
to relieve the backlog of fully processed permits.
Fuels Management.—The Committee recommends $175,450,000
for Hazardous Fuels and fuels management activities. Within the
funds recommended, $30,000,000 is for Wood Innovation Grants;
$15,000,000 is for the Community Wood Energy Program; and
$6,600,000 is recommended for the Southwest Ecological Restora-
tion Institutes. Wood Innovation Grants are an important tool for
creating and expanding markets for low-grade and low-value wood,
providing economic diversity for forest communities and reducing
wildfire risk in the process. The Committee notes that these efforts
can deliver a cost-effective and sustainable path to reduce excessive
hazardous fuels loads, foster long-term forest resilience, and poten-
tially aid in carbon storage. The Service must expand its efforts
that will open the door to new, widespread uses for wood-based
nanotechnology, mass timber and cross-laminated timber, fire-re-
sistant building materials, high-energy efficient wood for energy
production, affordable housing, and other promising products.
123
The Committee recognizes that investing in proactive fuels re-
duction activities has potential to mitigate the even higher costs
that result from wildfire and supports addressing the current back-
log of fuels reduction treatments, including through expanded use
of prescribed fire. Active management under substantial agency
oversight is necessary to maintain past treatments, address addi-
tional areas to reduce wildfire risk and improve wildfire resilience.
The Service is encouraged to continue seeking innovative methods
to promote broader adoption of new technologies and processing
systems to produce value-added wood products that will increase
commercial demand for biomass harvested through hazardous fuels
reduction activities.
Fuels Outcome Metrics.—The Committee is concerned that exist-
ing performance indicators for fuels management are insufficient
and directs the Service to work collaboratively across deputy areas
to define and expand the use of outcome-based performance metrics
that better capture the extent to which forest health is improved
and wildfire risk reduced. The Service shall report to the Com-
mittee on models and decision support tools to improve reporting
within 90 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter.
Fuels Contracts.—The Committee is aware that the Service is
pursuing contracting mechanisms that accelerate hazardous fuels
reduction efforts. The Committee urges the Service to utilize these
contracting mechanisms on project areas across the country, such
as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative, to prioritize forest health
and restoration, including hazardous fuels treatment, in accordance
with the Wildfire Crisis Strategy.
Prescribed Fire Strategy.—The Service is directed to develop a
national strategy for increasing the use of prescribed fire consistent
with the ecological needs of an area and brief the Committee on the
strategy within 270 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly
thereafter on implementation of the strategy.
Vegetation and Watershed Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $30,000,000 for Vegetation and Watershed Management.
The Committee recognizes that wildfire risk mitigation and aquatic
restoration efforts are critical to protecting the quantity and qual-
ity of source water on National Forest System lands that provides
drinking water and agricultural use. The Committee encourages
the Service to conduct additional outreach to water users to utilize
existing vegetation and watershed management funding to dem-
onstrate the value of restoring aquatic ecosystems to build resil-
ience to natural hazards in source watersheds, including through
the Water Source Protection Program.
Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $22,000,000 for Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management.
The Committee expects the Service to maintain no less than
$2,000,000 for threatened and endangered species activities to con-
tribute to significant recovery actions. The Committee expects the
Service to increase its efforts to recover listed plant and animal
species and take actions that will protect sensitive plant and ani-
mal species from requiring listing. The Service is directed to pro-
vide an accounting of how funds are allocated to specific recovery
programs and activities to the Committee in its congressional budg-
et justification.
124
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund.—The Com-
mittee recommends $31,000,000 for Collaborative Forest Landscape
Restoration [CFLR] and continues language allowing additional
projects to be funded with this significant expansion of the pro-
gram. CFLR is an important tool the Service has to facilitate large
scale projects on National Forests that make meaningful progress
for forest and watershed health while also creating jobs with the
generation of commercial timber. These projects come to fruition
through identifying innovative techniques for getting work done,
increasing community support for restoration projects, leveraging
capacity, expanding the scale of restoration, and creating and
maintaining jobs by a diverse set of local stakeholders who are
committed to forest restoration and sustaining rural communities.
Salaries and Expenses.—The Committee recommends
$1,459,352,000 for Salaries and Expenses, including for employees
who carry out functions funded by the Capital Improvement and
Maintenance, Range Betterment Fund, and Management of Na-
tional Forest Lands for Subsistence Uses accounts.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance related to activities funded in this account.
Black Hills National Forest.—The Committee directs the Service
to provide a briefing within 60 days of enactment of this act on his-
toric timber sale program trends in the Black Hills National Forest
and the potential impacts on forest health.
Pisgah National Forest.—The Committee directs the Service to
provide a briefing on management challenges and resulting im-
pacts to the ecosystem related to increased recreational use in the
Wilson Creek Area of the Pisgah National Forest.
Tongass National Forest.—The Service is expected to meet the
targets outlined in the current 2016 Tongass Land and Resource
Management Plan. The Committee continues the direction con-
tained in Senate Report 115–276. The bill provides funding nec-
essary to for the Service’s costs to process rights-of-way applica-
tions.
Alaska Trail Facilities.—The Committee is concerned to hear the
Service may not meet required maintenance needs for Forest Serv-
ice administered trail facilities along the Turnagain Arm corridor
within the Kenai Mountain Heritage Area and which may result in
closing trail facilities along the corridor during their peak usage
months in the summer. The Committee recognizes the Service’s re-
sponsibility to maintain trail facilities within the corridor to sup-
port public access and use of public National Forest lands and is
directed to take the steps necessary to ensure facilities within this
corridor will be operational for use, particularly in peak times of
visitation. Of the funds made available within this act, the Service
is directed to allocate the resources necessary to ensure the Service
provides necessary maintenance and activities to keep Service trail
facilities open and operational during peak visitor months.
Prairie Dog Management.—The Committee remains concerned
about the rapidly increasing levels of prairie dogs in the Dakota
Prairie Grasslands and as well their encroachment and degrada-
tion to adjacent non-Federal lands. The Committee encourages the
Service to promulgate an amendment to the 2018 Prairie Dog Man-
agement Plan which would limit occupied prairie dog habitat to not
125
more than 1.5 percent of the Federal land in any single grazing al-
lotment and ensure prairie dog control activity is conducted within
a one mile buffer between Federal land and State and private land.
Sediment Removal.—The Service shall initiate the development
of necessary guidance to establish a streamlined process to facili-
tate, when feasible, the relocation of noncontaminated, accumu-
lated sediment from behind a dam or impoundment within or adja-
cent to Forest Service lands, where such sediment impairs water
supply or electric power generation, or if left unattended, would
pose a threat to the structural integrity of the dam.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee is aware of the
Service’s interest in the use of virtual fencing to improve grazing
outcomes and riparian area health. The committee supports contin-
ued investment in virtual fencing through the Range Betterment
Fund and directs the Service to provide a report within 90 days of
enactment on rangeland improvements, benefits to wildlife habitat,
and cost savings resulting from the use of virtual fencing tech-
nologies on national forest system lands.
Rural Airstrips.—The Committee believes that rural airstrips
provide important administrative, recreational, and emergency
functions across our public lands and the Committee directs the
Department of Agriculture to assist Federal Land Managers, in-
cluding but not limited to the Bureau of Land Management, United
States Forest Service, and National Park Service, as well as the
Federal Aviation Administration in charting airstrips located on
Federal Lands that are and may be useful for administrative, rec-
reational, and emergency purposes.

The Committee recommends $151,250,000 for Capital Improve-
ment and Maintenance. As in previous years, this amount is offset
with a scoring credit related to the Roads and Trails Fund. Pro-
gram directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the
following narrative. All funding for specific programs, directives, or
congressionally directed spending identified herein is in addition to
funds otherwise provided to stations and regions and therefore is
not to be taken into account when allocating those resources.
126
The Committee recognizes the importance of the Legacy Restora-
tion Fund authorized by the Great American Outdoors Act (Public
Law 116–152), which provided $1,425,000,000 over 5 years to ad-
dressing deferred maintenance. These mandatory funds augment
the appropriations from this account, which continues to be nec-
essary for new construction and to maintain Service infrastructure
so that additional projects are not added to the deferred mainte-
nance backlog.
Facilities.—The Committee recommends $31,400,000 for Facili-
ties, of which at least $4,000,000 is for firefighter housing improve-
ments.
The Committee believes that the Service should be an exemplar
in using mass timber building materials and require the use of
mass timber in the construction, renovation, or repair of its facili-
ties.
Roads.—The Committee recommends $73,000,000 for Roads. The
Service should focus on managing and protecting investments made
to the National Forest Road System, which provides access to resi-
dents, visitors, outfitters, emergency responders, and those in-
volved in restoration, stewardship and commercial activities. This
will reduce accidents, minimize ecological impacts, and provide safe
access to communities and residents as secondary evacuation
routes during emergencies.
Trails.—The Committee recommends $20,000,000 for Trails, of
which no less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level is for trail op-
erations, maintenance, and construction on National Scenic and
Historical Trails. The Committee is aware of the growing need to
sustain and increase the capacity for resilient trail building within
the outdoor recreation community. The Service is encouraged to
collaborate with regional training centers that provide resources for
training trails stewards responsible for the maintenance of trails
for public use and is further encouraged to focus on maintaining
geographical diversity in its partnerships.
Legacy Roads and Trails.—The Committee recommends
$6,000,000 for Legacy Roads and Trails.
The Service is directed to provide an annual report to the Com-
mittee within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, detailing Leg-
acy Roads and Trails Remediation accomplishments, including
miles of roads and trails improved, miles of streams restored, num-
ber of bridges and stream crossings constructed, miles of road de-
commissioned, and number of jobs created.
Construction Projects.—The Committee recommends $20,850,000
for congressionally directed spending in this program. A detailed
list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spend-
ing’’ table accompanying this report.

The Committee recommends $1,099,000. This account provides
for carrying out the Service’s responsibilities for subsistence under
the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law
96–487).
WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,426,111,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,426,111,000
The Committee recommends $2,426,111,000 for wildland fire
management.
Fire Operations.—The Committee recommends $192,000,000 for
preparedness, $1,011,000,000 for suppression operations, and
$1,223,111,000 for salaries and expenses.
The Committee expects that with these resources, the Service
will continue to transform its wildland fire workforce to allow for
increased firefighter pay, create year-round firefighting and fuels
management capacity, supply appropriate levels of personal protec-
tive equipment, and implement technology modernizations outlined
in section 1114 of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Manage-
ment, and Recreation Act (Public Law 116–9) to increase the safety
of firefighters and the public, as well to enhance effective responses
to wildfire.
Procurement Forecasting.—The Service should actively engage
with stakeholders, including industry partners, to leverage their
128
expertise and innovation in developing and implementing new tech-
nology and contract processes for where they can address wildland
fire management priorities, challenges, and opportunities.
Firefighter Housing.—The Committee is concerned that the low
availability, high cost, and/or disrepair of housing provided by Fed-
eral agencies in many areas of the country is a barrier to the re-
cruitment and retention of Federal wildland firefighters. Accord-
ingly, the Service is encouraged to address the housing needs nec-
essary to support a professional firefighting capacity with a pre-
dominantly permanent workforce, including by determining the
maintenance and reconstruction needs for existing housing and
new housing needed in order to recruit and retain firefighters in
areas where it is difficult to find housing.
New Technology Adoption.—Instead of establishing a joint office
for wildfire science technology as proposed in the budget request,
the Committee directs the Service to use existing resources to cre-
ate a strategic plan for adopting new technologies. The Service
should fully utilize the expertise of the Fire Science Laboratory to
develop and deploy new technologies, tools and techniques that will
assist in prediction, detection, monitoring, suppression, and other
capabilities that must be improved to respond to the higher inci-
dence of catastrophic wildfire. This includes remote automated
weather stations, space-based remote sensing data, satellite im-
agery, and integrated acquisition technology services. Further, the
Service is encouraged to work with States and other Federal agen-
cies to evaluate existing contracts and identify opportunities to
allow greater use and coordination of satellite data.
WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS RESERVE FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,390,000,000

2026.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The bill continues or modifies administrative provisions included
in prior year appropriations acts that give direction on the use and
transfer of appropriated funds and further provide for the efficient
operations of the Service.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
The Indian Health Service [IHS] is the agency within the De-
partment of Health and Human Services that has responsibility for
providing Federal health services to approximately 2.6 million
American Indians and Alaska Natives. The provision of health
services to Tribes grew out of the special relationship between the
Federal Government and Indian Tribes that was established in
1787, based on article I, section 8 of the Constitution, and given
129
form and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court de-
cisions, and Executive orders that followed. Most notable among
these is the Snyder Act of 1921 (Public Law 67–85), which provides
the basic authority for most Indian health services provided by the
Federal Government to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.
IHS services are provided directly and through Tribally-con-
tracted and operated programs in over 600 healthcare facilities lo-
cated throughout the United States, primarily in rural and isolated
areas. Healthcare is also purchased from more than 9,000 private
providers annually. The Federal system consists of 28 hospitals, 61
health centers, and 34 health stations. Through Public Law 93–
638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,
Tribes and Tribal organizations compact and contract health pro-
grams to manage 17 hospitals, 249 health centers, and 70 health
stations. In addition, grants to 34 nonprofit urban Indian health or-
ganizations provide a variety of health and referral services.
Access to a good education, safe and reliable housing, clean
drinking water, and access to healthcare are all important for posi-
tive health outcomes and life expectancy. Disparities among these
areas of basic infrastructure have contributed to health disparities
among Native American communities. In order to truly address In-
dian Country’s healthcare needs, more must be done to address the
comprehensive full-scale social determinants of health across the
Federal Government. IHS plays a pivotal role in not only providing
direct care services to Native Americans but through preventative
programs that make a meaningful difference for Native American
health outcomes.
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,987,440,000
Advance Appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 4,684,029,000
Committee recommendation, new appropriations, 2026 .................... 347,111,000
Committee recommendation, total resources available, 2026 ............ 5,069,849,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 4,805,147,000
The Committee recommends $5,069,849,000 in total resources for
fiscal year 2026 for Indian Health Services, an increase of
$82,409,000 to the fiscal year 2025 level. The Committee rec-
ommendation also recommends $4,805,147,000 in advance appro-
priations for the Services account for fiscal year 2027. The fol-
lowing direction relates to the total fiscal year 2026 funding rec-
ommendation. All programs, projects, and activities are maintained
at fiscal year 2025 enacted levels unless otherwise stated.
Recruitment and Retention.—The Committee remains concerned
the IHS is not able to recruit and retain enough clinical staff to
maintain a high quality of care at the Service’s federally operated
facilities and directs the Service to work with the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to expedite creation of market-specific pay scales
to ensure the Service is able to offer competitive recruitment pack-
ages, an issue highlighted in the 2018 GAO report that examined
agency challenges filling provider vacancies (GAO–18–580). The
Committee reminds IHS a report is owed on any regulatory or stat-
utory limitations that prohibit the Service from offering incentives,
such as scheduling flexibility, that the Service believes hurts its re-
cruitment and retention efforts. The Committee is encouraged by
130
the establishment of the Office of Quality that will hopefully im-
prove access to care and availability of service. The Committee di-
rects the Service to establish measurements for tracking the im-
provement of patient health rather than defining increased funding
alone as the metric for measuring improvements.
The Committee is aware of IHS collaboration with the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs and Health Resources and Services Ad-
ministration focused on workforce development and physician resi-
dency placement. The Committee applauds this collaboration and
requests quarterly reports on progress to bring additional coordi-
nated training opportunities to physicians in Tribal communities.
Public Health Workforce.—The Committee recommends that
funds provided for supporting public health workforce across the
agency shall include a distribution among all IHS Service Areas
not just in areas where BIE schools are present.
Protecting Patients from Abuse.—The Committee remains deeply
troubled by past reports of sexual abuse. The Service is directed to
keep the Committee promptly apprised of any investigations into
sexual abuse and provide policy recommendations for Congress to
consider if barriers exist to address issues. Further, the Committee
directs the Service to take immediate action to investigate any
abuse allegations and take appropriate and prompt disciplinary ac-
tions to protect patients from harm.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The Committee recommends
$78,409,000 for staffing of newly opened health facilities within the
Services account. The Committee has a longstanding policy of pro-
viding sufficient staffing funds for all facilities that are expected to
open during the fiscal year. Funds for staffing of new facilities are
limited to facilities funded through the Health Care Facilities Con-
struction Priority System or the Joint Venture Construction Pro-
gram that have opened in fiscal year 2024 or will open in fiscal
year 2025. None of these funds may be allocated to a facility until
such facility has achieved beneficial occupancy status. As initial es-
timates included as part of the annual budget request are refined,
IHS is expected to communicate updated cost estimates to the
Committee.
Hospitals and Health Clinics.—The Committee recommends
$2,658,289,000 for Hospitals and Health Clinics, an increase of
$72,085,000 to the enacted level. The bill maintains funding at fis-
cal year 2025 enacted levels for the Alzheimer’s program and
Produce Prescription Pilot program. The bill also continues funding
at the fiscal year 2025 enacted levels for the domestic violence pre-
vention program, accreditation emergencies, health information
technology, healthy lifestyles in youth project.
Community Health Aide Program Expansion.—The Committee
supports the expansion of the Community Health Aide Program
[CHAP] in lower-48 States and recommends an additional
$3,000,000 for these efforts within the funding provided for Hos-
pitals and Health Clinics. This expansion should not divert funding
from the existing CHAP program in Alaska.
Village Built Clinics [VBC].—The Committee directs IHS to work
collaboratively with impacted Tribes and Tribal organizations to
produce, within 120 days of enactment of this act, the data needed
to accurately calculate the funding for VBC lease funding, includ-
131
ing the number of outstanding VBC facilities, their current funding
levels, and if necessary, any additional amounts needed to fully
fund the eligible operating and ownership costs for all VBC facili-
ties.
Improving Maternal Health.—The Committee remains concerned
with the maternal mortality crisis in the United States, which is
even more acute in Native American communities. American In-
dian and Alaska Native women are two times more likely to die of
pregnancy-related causes than White women, and 93 percent of
pregnancy-related deaths among American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive women are preventable. The Committee recommendation sup-
ports funding for maternal health initiatives and provides an addi-
tional $1,000,000 for these efforts as noted above. The Committee
reminds the IHS of the directive to brief the Committee within 90
days of enactment of this act on its plans for such funds. Further,
the Committee directs IHS to coordinate with the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Ad-
ministration, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to
further enhance its maternal health initiatives, which should in-
clude improved data collection to facilitate an agency-wide effort to
improve outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native women.
Dental Therapy Education Program.—Within the funds provided,
funding is maintained at enacted levels for the dental health ther-
apy education program that currently trains students in Alaska,
Washington, Idaho, and Oregon.
Electronic Health Records.—The Committee is aware there is a
need for a new electronic health record system to improve the over-
all interoperability, efficiency, and security of the Service’s informa-
tion technology system and recommends $190,564,000 for this ef-
fort, equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Further, the Com-
mittee understands many Tribes recently upgraded computer sys-
tems for the new Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] system, and
it is important these systems are compatible. It is the Committee’s
expectation that the Service will be able to use the compiled infor-
mation gathered during this recent effort with VA to inform both
the Service and the Committee on which Tribes use their own sys-
tem and the estimated costs. Finally, the Committee notes that the
Electronic Health Records is excluded from the advance appropria-
tion for fiscal year 2027 as specified in bill language.
Dental Health.—The recommendation includes $259,501,000 for
dental health, an increase of $5,384,000 to the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. The Service is encouraged to coordinate with the Bu-
reau of Indian Education [BIE] to integrate preventive dental care
at schools within the BIE system.
Mental Health.—The recommendation includes $131,308,000 for
mental health programs, an increase of $1,194,000 to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. The bill maintains fiscal year 2025 fund-
ing for the behavioral health integration initiative to better inte-
grate treatment programs for mental health and substance abuse
problems and for the suicide prevention initiative.
Alcohol and Substance Abuse.—The recommendation includes
$267,404,000 for alcohol and substance abuse programs, an in-
crease of $633,000 to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The bill re-
tains funding provided in previous fiscal years for the Generation
132
Indigenous initiative; and for the youth pilot project, two important
programs to prevent substance abuse. The Committee continues
bill language that allocates funding for essential detoxification and
related services provided by the Service’s public and private part-
ners to IHS beneficiaries. The Service shall continue its partner-
ship with Na’Nizhoozhi Center in Gallup, New Mexico, and work
with the Center and other Federal, State, local and Tribal partners
to develop a sustainable model for clinical capacity, as provided by
the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 115–31.
The Committee is concerned that alcohol and opioid use disorders
continue to be some of the most severe public health and safety
problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native [AI/AN] indi-
viduals, families, and communities. To address this problem, the
Committee continues to direct IHS to increase its support for cul-
turally competent preventive, educational, and treatment services
programs and to partner with academic institutions with estab-
lished AI/AN training and health professions programs to research
and promote culturally responsive care. Additionally, the Com-
mittee encourages the Service to employ the full spectrum of medi-
cation assisted treatments [MAT] for alcohol and opioid use dis-
orders, including non-narcotic treatment options that are less sub-
ject to diversion combined with counseling services.
Opioid Grants.—To better combat the opioid epidemic, the rec-
ommendation includes fiscal year 2025 enacted funding to continue
a Special Behavioral Health Pilot Program, as authorized by Public
Law 116–6. The Director of IHS, in coordination with the Assistant
Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, shall award
grants for providing services, provide technical assistance to grant-
ees under this section, and evaluate performance of the program.
Further, the Committee has heard from Tribes that assistance
should not only focus on opioids, and therefore urges IHS to exam-
ine whether grant funds should be made available to address all
types of drug abuse.
Purchased/Referred Care.—The recommendation includes
$996,755,000 for purchased/referred care.
Within the funding provided for Purchased/Referred care, the
Service shall consider providing support for the delivery of
healthcare services for the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee In-
dians of Oklahoma, as requested.
Indian Health Care Improvement Fund.—The recommendation
includes $74,138,000 in funding for the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Fund.
Public Health Nursing.—The recommendation includes
$115,926,000 for public health nursing, an increase of $2,978,000
to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Health Education.—The recommendation includes $24,617,000
for health education, an increase of $135,000 to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
Urban Indian Health.—The recommendation includes
$90,419,000 for the Urban Indian Health program, equal to the en-
acted level. The Committee is committed to improving the health
and well-being of AI/AN living in urban Indian communities. De-
spite the excellent efforts of Urban Indian Organizations, AI/AN
populations continue to be left out of many Federal initiatives.
133
Therefore, the Committee reminds the IHS of the directive to ex-
plore the formation of an interagency working group to identify ex-
isting Federal funding supporting Urban Indian Organizations
[UIOs] and determine where increases are needed, or what pro-
grams should be amended to allow for greater access by UIOs; to
develop a Federal funding strategy to build out and coordinate the
infrastructure necessary to pilot and scale innovative programs
that address the needs and aspirations of urban AI/ANs in a holis-
tic manner; develop a wellness centered framework to inform
health services; and meet quarterly with UIOs to address other rel-
evant issues. In addition to the Indian Health Service, the working
group should consist of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S.
Department of Education, U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, U.S.
Department of Labor, the Small Business Administration, the Eco-
nomic Development Agency, FEMA, the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
and others as identified by UIOs.
Direct Operations.—The bill provides $103,805,000 for Direct Op-
erations, equal to the enacted level.
Continued Directives.—The Committee continues the directions
contained in Public Law 116–260, Consolidated Appropriations Act
2021, regarding the dental health therapist training program and
first-aid kit enhancements.
Indian Health Professions.—The recommendation includes
$80,568,000 for the Indian Health Professions program. The Com-
mittee believes this is a critical program and expects this increase
will allow the Indians into Medicine program to expand to four
sites. Within funds, the recommendation also includes funding for
the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians into Nursing Program,
and American Indians into Psychology Program at no less than the
enacted levels.
The Committee reminds IHS that any grant made under section
112 of Public Law 94–437 to the Quentin N. Burdick American In-
dians Into Nursing Program is not intended to reduce the eligibility
of any other applicants to receive grants under section 112 of the
Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The Committee directs IHS
to report to the Committee not later than 30 days after enactment
of this act on actions taken to ensure that the regional location of
the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into Nursing Program
grant recipient does not disqualify other applicants to receive
grants under section 112 of Amend Indian Health Care Improve-
ment Act.
Study on the Comparative Healthcare Delivery Between the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Indian Health Service
(IHS).—The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to
conduct a study not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
of this act, that at a minimum provides: (1) a comparison of per-
patient funding levels for healthcare services provided by VA and
IHS, including historical funding trends over the past 10 fiscal
years; (2) an analysis of recruitment and retention strategies uti-
lized by VA, including but not limited to hiring flexibilities, pay in-
centives, and workforce development programs, and the extent to
which such strategies could be adapted or extended to IHS; (3) rec-
134
ommendations for legislative or administrative actions that Con-
gress and the Department of Health and Human Services can take
to improve IHS hiring, recruitment, and retention outcomes, in-
formed by VA best practices; (4) identification of statutory or regu-
latory barriers that limit IHS from implementing hiring authorities
or incentives like those available to the VA.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,036,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,819,000,000
The Committee has continued language from fiscal year 2021 es-
tablishing an indefinite appropriation for contract support costs es-
timated to be $1,819,000,000 in fiscal year 2026. By retaining an
indefinite appropriation for this account, additional funds may be
provided by the Agency if its budget estimate proves to be lower
than necessary to meet the legal obligation to pay the full amount
due to Tribes. The Committee believes that fully funding these
costs will ensure Tribes have the resources they need to deliver
program services efficiently and effectively.
PAYMENTS FOR TRIBAL LEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $400,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 366,000,000
The recommendation includes an indefinite appropriation of an
estimated $366,000,000 for the compensation of operating costs as-
sociated with facilities leased or owned by Tribes and Tribal orga-
nizations for carrying out health programs under ISDEAA con-
tracts and compacts as required by 25 U.S.C. 5324(l).
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $506,854,000
Advance appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 510,774,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ........................................................................... 808,806,000
Committee recommendation, new appropriations, 2025 .................... 298,032,000
Committee recommendation, total resources available, 2025 ............ 510,774,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2026.............. 519,500,000
The Committee recommends $808,806,000 in total resources for
fiscal year 2026 for health facilities operations of the IHS. This
amount is $8,726,000 above the enacted level. The Committee rec-
ommendation also provides $510,774,000 in advance appropriations
for the account for fiscal year 2027. All programs, projects, and ac-
tivities are maintained at fiscal year 2025 enacted levels unless
otherwise specified. The following direction relates to fiscal year
2026 funding.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The Committee recommends
$8,726,000 for staffing of newly opened health facilities within the
Facilities account.
Maintenance & Improvement.—The recommendation includes
$170,595,000 for Maintenance and Improvement, equal to the en-
acted level.
Sanitation Facilities Construction.—The recommendation in-
cludes $106,627,000 for Sanitation Facilities Construction activi-
ties, equal to the enacted level. The bill provides $17,039,000 for
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS] projects in this program.
135
A detailed list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Di-
rected Spending’’ table accompanying this report.
Health Care Facilities Construction.—The recommendation in-
cludes $182,679,000 for Health Care Facilities Construction, equal
to the enacted level. Of the funds provided, fiscal year 2025 fund-
ing is maintained for the small ambulatory clinic program.
Equipment.—The recommendation includes $32,598,000 for med-
ical equipment upgrades and replacement, equal to the enacted
level.
Facilities & Environmental Health Support.—The recommenda-
tion includes $316,307,000 for Facilities & Environmental Health
Support, an increase of $8,726,000 above the enacted level. The
health impacts of a lack of sanitation infrastructure remain a pub-
lic health crisis in Indian Country. The Committee is concerned
that delayed decisionmaking is jeopardizing these projects and di-
rects the Service to brief the Committee within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act on the status of discussions with other Federal
partners involved to ensure funding is coordinated and projects are
completed. Within the funds provided for facilities and environ-
mental health support projects, fiscal year 2025 funding is main-
tained for preliminary engineering reports and provides funding for
the certification training that was transferred to this budget line
in fiscal year 2023 as requested.
Housing Quarters.—The Committee believes that funds for hous-
ing quarters is essential to help resolve the widespread housing
shortages, which have contributed to high vacancy rates for med-
ical personnel throughout the system, particularly in rural areas.
These funds have been used in areas with chronic housing short-
ages, such as Alaska and the Great Plains, in order to ameliorate
these problems. The Committee expects a report from the Service
within 60 days of enactment of this act on the distribution of funds.
Health Facilities Requirements in Alaska.—The Committee con-
tinues the directive for the Service to work with appropriate Tribal
organizations and submit a report to the Committees within 1 year
of enactment that includes an assessment of updated facilities
needs in the State of Alaska as well as recommendations for alter-
native financing options which could address the need for addi-
tional healthcare facilities space suitable to meet the current and
future healthcare needs of IHS beneficiaries in the State. Addition-
ally, within 30 days of enactment of this act, the Service is directed
to provide the Committee with a briefing detailing why this direc-
tive has not been previously met, despite inclusion in previous fis-
cal years.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The bill includes an administrative provision that prohibits IHS
from using funds for non-federally recognized tribes.

with relevant Federal, State, and research partners to conduct a
literature review on the health effects of descendants of toxic-ex-
posed service members and veterans. The Committee encourages
the Agency to identify and conduct research to explore the associa-
tion between the health conditions of descendants of service mem-
bers and veterans, and specific military toxic exposures. Within 1
year of enactment of this act, the Agency is encouraged to establish
a publicly available website with information on the activities and
findings of the Agency.
Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of the Pediatric Environmental
Health Specialty Units [PEHSUs] program and its support from
ATSDR in helping to identify environmental risks to the health of
children and reproductive-age adults. The Committee encourages
ATSDR to continue its support for PEHSUs.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Congress established the Smithsonian Institution in 1846 to ad-
minister a large bequest left to the United States by James
Smithson, an English scientist, for the purpose of establishing in
Washington, DC, an institution ‘‘for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.’’ The act establishing the Smithsonian pro-
vided for the administration of the trust, independent of the Gov-
ernment itself, by a Board of Regents and a Secretary, who were
given broad discretion in the use of these funds. The board was to
be composed of both private citizens and members of all three
branches of the Federal Government in order to ensure ‘‘the wise
and faithful use’’ of the Institution’s funds. The trust funds were
permanently loaned to the U.S. Department of the Treasury to be
maintained in a separate account, with the interest from that
money used for the operation of the Institution. Construction of the
Smithsonian Castle was completed in 1855 and collections that the
Government had accepted on behalf of the Institution were moved
into the building. Today, the Smithsonian Institution is the world’s
largest museum and research complex, housing approximately 157
million objects and specimens and receiving an estimated 17 mil-
lion visitors annually.
The Smithsonian Institution’s facilities include 19 museums and
galleries, the National Zoo, and 9 research facilities, most located
in or near Washington, DC, with others in Massachusetts, New
York, Florida, Arizona, Hawaii, and the Republic of Panama.

Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum.—Public Law
116–260, enacted on December 27, 2020, established the Smithso-
nian American Women’s History Museum [SAWHM] within the
Smithsonian Institution. Women have made invaluable contribu-
tions to our country across such diverse fields as government, busi-
ness, medicine, law, literature, sports, entertainment, the arts, and
the military, and the SAWHM will be the first comprehensive mu-
seum anywhere in the United States dedicated to the full story of
women’s history. This comprehensive museum will document the
spectrum of the experiences of women in the United States, rep-
resent a diverse range of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds,
more accurately depict the history of the United States, and add
value to the Smithsonian Institution for the American people.
Funding will support continued activities including: recruitment
and selection of additional personnel, including human resources
activities; formation of planning and coordination teams to develop
exhibitions, public programs, education, research, collections acqui-
sition, technology, and capital fundraising; and developing adminis-
140
trative operations. The Committee looks forward to continuing to
support the development of the SAWHM as detailed plans for
siting, design, construction, operations, and private fundraising be-
come available for review.
National Museum of the American Latino.—Public Law 116–260,
enacted on December 27, 2020, established the National Museum
of the American Latino [NMAL] within the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The mission of the NMAL is to give voice to both the richness
and the challenges of the Latino American experience, to make it
possible for all people to understand the depth, complexity, and
promise of the American experience, and to serve as a national
forum for collaboration and celebration of Latino American history
and culture. The NMAL will be the keystone for people in the
United States and visitors worldwide to learn about Latino con-
tributions to life, art, history, and culture in the United States and
will serve as a gateway for visitors to view Latino exhibitions, col-
lections, and programming at other Smithsonian Institution facili-
ties and museums throughout the United States.
Funding will support continued activities including: recruitment
and selection of additional personnel, including human resources
activities; formation of planning and coordination teams to develop
exhibitions, public programs, education, research, collections acqui-
sition, technology, and capital fundraising; and developing adminis-
trative operations. The Committee looks forward to continuing to
support the development of the NMAL as detailed plans for siting,
design, construction, operations, and private fundraising become
available for review.
Repatriation of Human Remains.—The Committee notes that
since the passage of the National Museum of American Indian Act
(Public Law 101–185) in 1989, the Smithsonian Institution has re-
patriated the remains of approximately 5,000 Indigenous people.
The Committee appreciates the commitment the Smithsonian Insti-
tution has made to repatriation activities, including the establish-
ment of a taskforce to develop a formal policy for handling all
human remains. The Committee directs the Smithsonian to act
with urgency in prioritizing repatriation activities for Indian
Tribes, as governed by the act, and in developing ways to improve
the repatriation policies within Smithsonian Institutions.

sonian Institution as the highest priority.
NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART
The National Gallery of Art was created in 1937 by a joint reso-
lution of Congress accepting Andrew W. Mellon’s gift to the Nation
of his art collection. The generosity of the Mellon family also pro-
vided the funds to construct the Gallery’s two landmark buildings,
the West Building, designed by Alexander Pope and completed in
141
1941, and the East Building, designed by I.M. Pei and completed
in 1978. In 1999, an outdoor sculpture garden was created with
funding from the Cafritz Foundation. Today, these two buildings
and the Sculpture Garden form a museum complex that houses one
of the world’s premier art collections. Since the Gallery’s founding,
Federal funds have been appropriated to ensure the operation,
maintenance, protection, and care of its collection. Private contribu-
tions are used by the Gallery for art acquisition and conservation,
scholarly and scientific research, exhibitions, and educational out-
reach programs.

JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
Originally established in 1958 as the National Cultural Center,
an independently administered bureau of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was des-
ignated as a living memorial to President Kennedy in 1964. The
Kennedy Center building was constructed with a combination of
private contributions, Federal matching funds, and long-term rev-
enue bonds held by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Since
1972, Congress has provided funds for the operations and repair of
the presidential monument, initially through the National Park

NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS
Established in 1965 as an independent agency of the Federal
Government, the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] is the of-
ficial arts organization of the United States Government. As the
largest annual funder of the arts in the United States, the NEA
has helped to create and sustain regional theater, opera, ballet,
symphony orchestras, museums, and other arts organizations that
Americans now enjoy. Since its founding, the National Endowment
for the Arts has awarded more than 120,000 grants that have
brought the arts to Americans in communities both large and
small. The NEA, through its competitive, peer-reviewed grants
process, uses the majority of its annual operating funds to award
grants to nonprofit organizations for arts education, arts outreach,
artistic excellence, and partnership agreements. In addition to
those activities, State and jurisdictional arts agencies are awarded
40 percent of the Endowment’s funds.
GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $207,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 207,000,000
The Committee recommends $207,000,000 for grants and admin-
istration of the National Endowment for the Arts. The NEA is to
be commended for its efforts related to Creative Forces: NEA Mili-
tary Healing Arts Network, to serve the unique needs of patients
and families of military personnel and veterans diagnosed with
Traumatic Brain Injuries and associated psychological health con-
ditions. The Committee supports the NEA’s continued efforts to ex-
pand upon this successful program to embed Creative Arts Thera-
pies at the core of integrative care efforts in clinical settings, ad-
vance collaboration among clinical and community arts providers to
support wellness and reintegration efforts for affected families, and
advance research to improve our understanding of impacts of these
143
interventions in both clinical and community settings. The Com-
mittee also encourages State arts agencies to explore how they can
contribute to expanding arts programs for service members and
their families at the local level. The distribution of funds among
the agency’s various activities is displayed in the table that accom-
panies this report.
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES
The National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] was estab-
lished by the 1965 National Foundation on the Arts and Human-
ities Act (Public Law 89–209) as an independent Federal agency of
the United States Government dedicated to supporting research,
education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.
Today, it is the largest funder of humanities programs in the Na-
tion. NEH’s longstanding tradition of a peer-reviewed competitive
grant process is designed to ensure that the most meritorious
projects are funded. Typically, NEH grants are used to support cul-
tural institutions, such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges,
universities, public television and radio, and individual scholars.
The NEH, through its State-Federal partnership, also provides
grants to State humanities councils in all 50 States and the six ter-
ritories.
GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $207,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 207,000,000
The Committee recommends $207,000,000 for grants and admin-
istration of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Com-
mittee maintains fiscal year 2024 enacted funding at $7,000,000 for
Special Initiatives for the Endowment, including the ‘‘A More Per-
fect Union’’ initiative. The Committee supports the ‘‘We the People’’
initiative which encourages a better understanding of the history
of our country and the democratic principles upon which it was
founded, by supporting grants for the teaching and study of Amer-
ican history. The Committee encourages the NEH to incorporate
and continue the two popular components of the former ‘‘We the
People’’ initiative grant opportunities, the National Digital News-
papers Program, and the Landmarks of American History and Cul-
ture workshops as part of the initiative or with other funds.
The Committee supports the Documenting Endangered Lan-
guages initiative and NEH’s partnership with the National Science
Foundation [NSF] to develop and advance knowledge concerning
endangered human languages, and is especially concerned with the
linguistic threats faced by ethnic and religious minorities in Cen-
tral and East Asia, including the Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Mongo-
lians.
The mission of the NEH is to aid the American People in the ex-
amination of the human condition, to understand our cultural her-
itage, to foster mutual respect for diverse beliefs and cultures, to
develop media and information literacy, and to promote civic en-
gagement. In order to advance racial equity, the Committee directs
that NEH continue to develop an Office of Outreach whose mission
will be to enhance the agency’s efforts on behalf of underserved
144
communities and institutions, such as Tribal Nations, Historically
Black Colleges and Universities [HBCUs], Hispanic Serving Insti-
tutions [HSIs], Tribal Colleges and Universities [TCUs], veterans,
community colleges, and others. The Committee also welcomes the
establishment of a Chief Diversity Officer to serve within the office
of the Chairperson, to oversee efforts to improve diversity, equity,
and inclusion, and to create better access within NEH’s programs,
operations, outreach and communications, human capital, and re-
search and analysis. Further, the Committee encourages NEH to
provide support for projects that illustrate the transformative role
of women in American history, such as Katherine Johnson and
Amelia Earhart, to educate and inspire the next generation of
women leaders and professionals in fields such as aviation, ad-
vanced computer technologies and the STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math) disciplines.
The distribution of funds among the agency’s various activities is
displayed in the table that accompanies this report.
COMMISSION OF FINE ARTS
The Commission of Fine Arts was established in 1910 to fill the
need for a permanent agency whose members would be qualified to
make available to the Government expert opinion on questions of
art and architecture. The Commission’s mission, as design pro-
posals are brought before it, is to safeguard and improve the ap-
pearance and symbolic significance of the city as a capital. The
Commission provides knowledgeable advice on matters pertaining
to architecture, landscape architecture, sculpture, painting, and the
decorative arts to all branches and departments of the Federal and
District of Columbia governments when such matters affect the Na-
tional Capital. The Commission also must approve of the site and
design of all commemorative works and memorials erected in the
District. The Commission advises on the design of circulating and
commemorative coinage and must approve the siting and design for
national memorials, both in the United States and on foreign soil,
in accordance with the American Battle Monuments Act and the
Commemorative Works Act (Public Law 106–214).
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,661,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,661,000
The Committee recommends $3,661,000 for salaries and expenses
of the Commission of Fine Arts.
NATIONAL CAPITAL ARTS AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs program was es-
tablished by Public Law 99–190 to provide grants for general oper-
ating support to District of Columbia nonprofit arts and other cul-
tural organizations. In fiscal year 1988, administrative responsi-
bility for the program was transferred from the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities to the Commission of Fine Arts. Cur-
rently, this program helps support more than 20 nationally re-
nowned organizations in the Nation’s Capital by providing funding
145
for operating expenses, jobs, exhibits, and performances that might
not have been possible otherwise.
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $5,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,000,000
The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for the National Capital
Arts and Cultural Affairs program administered by the Commis-
sion of Fine Arts.
ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89–
665) established the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as
an independent Federal agency. The Council’s mission is to pro-
mote the preservation, enhancement, and productive use of our Na-
tion’s historic resources, and to advise the President and Congress
on national historic preservation policy. It also provides a forum for
discussion of Federal activities, programs, and policies that affect
historic properties. One of the principal responsibilities of the
Council is to implement section 106 of the National Historic Preser-
vation Act (Public Law 89–665), which requires that the Council be
given an opportunity to comment on the impacts of projects or ac-
tions undertaken by other Federal agencies on sites or structures
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,585,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,585,000
The Committee recommends $8,585,000 for the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation. The Council’s responsibility to assist
Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations with the National His-
toric Preservation Act’s Section 106 process, which requires Federal
agencies to consider the effects of their projects on historic prop-
erties, is a critical opportunity for these communities to provide
input about how Federal projects might affect historic, culturally
significant sites.
The Committee notes that recent major Federal investments in
transportation, energy, telecommunications, water, and other infra-
structure have resulted in a sharp increase in Section 106 reviews,
which are required under the National Historic Preservation Act.
As a result, State Historic Preservation Offices [SHPOs], Tribal
Historic Preservation Offices [THPOs], and Indian Tribes have
seen their workloads increase significantly over the past several
years. The Committee recognizes the value of close partnership and
coordination between SHPOs, THPOs, and Tribes, and encourages
increased opportunities for SHPOs, THPOs, and Tribes to share
best practices. The Committee directs the Council to report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act describing, with
examples, the magnitude of the increased workloads and the im-
pacts on SHPOs and THPOs.
NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION
The National Capital Planning Commission [NCPC] was estab-
lished in 1924 as a park planning agency. Two years later, the
agency’s role was expanded to include more comprehensive plan-
ning. The National Capital Planning Act of 1952 (Public Law 592)
146
designated the NCPC as the central planning agency for the Fed-
eral Government in the National Capital Region. Today, major
functions and responsibilities of the NCPC include comprehensive
and coordinated planning for the Nation’s Capital; an annual as-
sessment of all proposed Federal capital improvements in the Na-
tional Capital region; the review of proposed Federal development
projects; and representation of the Federal interest in local and re-
gional planning initiatives.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,750,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,750,000
The Committee recommends $8,750,000 for salaries and expenses
of the National Capital Planning Commission.
UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was created by
Congress in 1980 through Public Law 96–388 with the mandate to
operate and maintain a permanent living memorial museum to the
victims of the Holocaust; provide appropriate ways for the Nation
to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust through the annual
national civic observances known as the Days of Remembrance;
and carry out the recommendations of the President’s Commission
on the Holocaust. The building that houses the museum was con-
structed with private funds and opened to the public in 1993. Since
that time, the museum has attracted four to five times the number
of expected visitors and has been highly successful in its fund-
raising efforts. With private contributions comprising nearly 50
percent of its annual operating budget, the Holocaust Memorial
Museum serves as a model for the public-private partnership.
HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $65,231,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 66,731,000
The Committee recommends $66,731,000 for operations of the
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, an increase of
$1,500,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Committee
continues not less than $2,000,000 for implementation of the Never
Again Education Act (Public Law 116–141) in order to support and
strengthen Holocaust education programs.
Due to the ongoing rise of antisemitism throughout the country,
the Committee believes it is now more important than ever to con-
tinue the education of the atrocities that occurred before, during,
and after the Holocaust. Within 90 days of enactment of this act,
the museum shall brief the Committees on plans to use these funds
for educational programming.
UNITED STATES SEMIQUINCENTENNIAL COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000
147
The Committee recommends $15,000,000 for salaries and ex-
penses of the United States Semiquincentennial Commission. The
Committee looks forward to celebrations commemorating the Na-
tion’s 250th anniversary in 2026 and continues to support the mis-
sion of the Semiquincentennial Commission. The Committee notes
that a total of $64,300,000 has been appropriated for the Commis-
sion since fiscal year 2020. The Committee continues to find that,
like other federally-funded entities, independent Federal oversight
of the Commission is warranted.
America250.—The Committee notes that the ‘‘America250 Play-
book: Our Journey to 2026,’’ approved by the U.S.
Semiquincentennial Commission, states that ‘‘America250 is the
nonpartisan initiative with a mission to celebrate and commemo-
rate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence, the Semiquincentennial [ . . . ]’’ and that
‘‘America250 aims to inspire our fellow Americans to reflect on our
past, strengthen our love of country, and renew our commitment to
the ideals of democracy through programs that educate, engage,
and unite us as a Nation.’’

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests). Following is a list of congressionally directed spending
items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this re-
port along with the name of each Senator who submitted a request
to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item so identified. Neither
the Committee recommendation nor this report contains any lim-
ited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.

MULTI-AGENCY DIRECTIVES
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.—The Committee is
concerned about the crisis of missing, trafficked, and murdered in-
digenous women that has plagued Native communities. Native
American women face high rates of violence and the lack of data
on the number of women and girls who go missing or murdered
further complicates the Nation’s ability to address this crisis. The
bill includes both funding and directives under the Bureau of In-
(4)

5
dian Affairs and the Indian Health Service in order to improve the
Federal response to this epidemic.
Budgetary Treatment of Contract Support Costs and 105(l) Tribal
Leases.—Due to findings in the Supreme Court decisions (see Sala-
zar v. Ramah (132 S. Ct. 2181 (2012)) and Maniilaq Ass’n v.
Burwell in both 2014 (72 F. Supp. 3d 227 (D.D.C. 2014)) and 2016
(70 F. Supp. 3d 243 (D.D.C. 2016))), payments for contract support
costs and 105(l) leases appear to create a type of budgetary entitle-
ment that is typically not funded through discretionary appropria-
tions. For contract support costs, the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act [ISDEAA] of 1975 requires the gov-
ernment to enter into contracts and leases with any willing Tribe
and requires that the government pay a Tribe’s costs. Section 105(l)
of the ISDEAA requires the Secretary, at the request of a Tribe,
to enter into a lease with the Tribe for a building used to provide
services under the ISDEAA. Reclassification of these costs from a
discretionary appropriation to a mandatory appropriated entitle-
ment has been under discussion since the Supreme Court issued its
decision in 2012.
Deferred Maintenance.—The Committee has made a concerted ef-
fort in recent years to address the backlog maintenance needs on
our public lands and in Bureau of Indian Education Schools
through the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration
Fund [Fund], as authorized in The Great American Outdoors Act
(Public Law 116–152) [GAOA] The Fund’s authorization expired in
fiscal year 2025. The Committee notes that the Interior Appropria-
tions Bill alone is not sufficient to meet the construction needs of
BIE schools and public land infrastructure. The Committee looks
forward to the prompt reauthorization of the Fund to continue to
address the deferred maintenance backlog needs on our public
lands and in Bureau of Indian Education schools.
The Committee is concerned that the Department has delayed
the disbursement of funds for Legacy Restoration Fund projects on
the fiscal year 2025 list. The Committee urges the disbursement of
these funds in a timely manner.
Disaster Recovery Needs.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the other agencies funded in this bill to
continue quarterly reporting requirements for their component bu-
reaus, regions, offices, and programs, as appropriate, to maintain
up-to-date comprehensive information for funding needs related to
disaster recovery, which shall be delivered to the Committee within
30 days of a quarter closing and shall also be updated and provided
at other points in time when the Committee requests such an up-
date.
Land Grants, Acequias and Community Ditches.—The Secre-
taries of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Ag-
riculture are urged to recognize the traditional use of State-recog-
nized community land grants, acequias, and community ditches in
the American Southwest during the land use planning process. The
Department of the Interior and the Forest Service shall, in accord-
ance with applicable law, consider and, as appropriate, provide for
within land management plans the traditional-historic uses by an
acequias or land grant mercedes recognized by the State of New
Mexico.

6
Training, Hiring, and Public Lands Education in Alaska.—The
directive in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
116–94 regarding hiring and conducting annual Alaska National
Interest Lands Conservation Act training by the Department of the
Interior and the Forest Service is continued. The Committee also
recognizes the importance of Alaska Public Land Information Cen-
ters as partners and tools to educate the public regarding Alaska’s
unique public lands and encourages the agencies to look for oppor-
tunities to strengthen these critical partnerships.
Transparency of Information.—Federal agencies funded under
this act shall clearly state within the text, audio, or video used for
advertising or educational purposes, including emails or Internet
postings, that the communication is printed, published, or produced
and disseminated at U.S. taxpayer expense. The funds used by a
Federal agency to carry out this requirement shall be derived from
amounts made available to the agency for advertising or other com-
munications regarding the programs and activities of the agency.
Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.—All reports, correspond-
ence, and reprogramming requests from the agencies to the Com-
mittee shall be provided electronically, in addition to any that are
required to be delivered in physical formats.
Quarterly Report on Reporting Requirements.—Within 90 days of
enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, the Committee di-
rects the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agri-
culture, and the Environmental Protection Agency to each provide
a quarterly report to the Committee outlining the status of the re-
porting requirements outlined within this report.
Beavers and Aquatic Habitat.—The Committee notes that bea-
vers are an important native species across North America, and are
a well-known ecosystem engineer with the ability to create new
wetlands and improve habitats for a wide array of other species.
Federal land managers are encouraged to work with state wildlife
managers on beaver conservation, to make planning decisions that
recognize beavers’ environmental and ecological benefits, and to
identify locations where restoration of their habitat may be most
beneficial.
Valles Caldera National Preserve.—The Committee is concerned
about the presence of illegal trespass cattle from the Santa Fe Na-
tional Forest on the Valles Caldera National Preserve in violation
of the Preserve’s authorizing statute and National Park Service
policy. The Committee appreciates the Forest Service and the Na-
tional Park Service establishing a formal written agreement on
funding, fence maintenance responsibilities, cattle incursion re-
sponse, law enforcement efforts, and a pilot program to test the use
of virtual fencing to keep cattle excluded from the Preserve. The
Committee directs the Services to jointly brief the Committee on
the plan to fund the long-term maintenance of the fence after its
construction, within 90 days of enactment of this act.
Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act.—The Committee
continues to direct the Department of the Interior and the Forest
Service to annually post on a centralized agency website the list of
Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act [FLREA] (Public Law
108–447) projects and activities performed in each fiscal year,
which should include a project or activity title, description, location,

7
and amount obligated, beginning with fiscal year 2024 as prac-
ticable. The Committee awaits a report from each land manage-
ment agency that is unable to complete this directive. Such report
shall detail the specific steps the agency plans to take to secure the
capabilities needed to provide proper transparency on the spending
of FLREA funds.
Workforce Housing on Public Lands.—Across the country, the
rise in short-term vacation rentals, particularly at popular travel
destinations has further decreased the availability and affordability
of housing in communities near national parks and other Federal
lands. This has created a crisis in public lands staffing access to
adequate housing facilities is a key component of attracting and re-
taining a qualified workforce. For example, the Committee under-
stands that seasonal employees are often forced to turn down per-
manent employment because they would lose the temporary hous-
ing provided to some seasonal employees. The Department of the
Interior and the Forest Service are directed to continue to prioritize
expanding housing availability and to work with the Committee to
ensure it understands what resources are needed to achieve this.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act, the Department of the In-
terior and the Forest Service shall each provide briefings to the
Committee detailing current housing needs and ongoing impacts.
Further, within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department
of the Interior and the Forest Service shall each provide the Com-
mittee with a housing needs assessment for employees who live
both in government quarters and in the local community, including
what Federal funding and potential legislative changes would help
Federal employees find and pay for adequate housing.
Technological Innovation in Land Management.—To enhance the
capabilities of Federal agencies responsible for wildfire manage-
ment, including the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest
Service, the Committee encourages these agencies to explore inno-
vative private-public partnerships capable of large data collection
through beyond-line-of-sight, unmanned aerial platforms, coupled
with the use of artificial intelligence [AI] in predicting and miti-
gating wildfire hazards. The Committee recognizes the potential of
AI-driven technologies to improve predictive modeling, risk assess-
ment, and resource allocation for wildfire prevention and response,
thus strengthening wildfire management strategies. The Com-
mittee directs the agencies to report within 180 days of the enact-
ment of this act on their progress in exploring and implementing
such partnerships.
Federal Trust, Federal Obligations, and Treaty Responsibilities.—
The Committee reminds agencies funded by this act of their obliga-
tion to uphold the Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to
Tribes and Federal obligations to the Native Hawaiian Community.
This includes upholding treaty and reserved rights, and any other
rights and obligations under Federal law; supporting self-deter-
mination efforts by Native communities; fulfilling obligations under
Presidential Memoranda and Executive Orders; and conducting
early and robust government-to-government consultation with
Tribes, and meaningful outreach and engagement with Native Ha-
waiians.

8
Consultation with Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corpora-
tions.—The Committee stresses the importance of all Federal agen-
cies conducting meaningful consultation with Tribes, as directed
under Executive Order 13175, with regard to Federal programs and
actions and notes that Public Law 108–199 at section 161, and
Public Law 108–447 at section 518 require that all Federal agen-
cies must consult with Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of
1971 [ANCSA] Corporations on the same basis as Indian Tribes
under Executive Order 13175. Accordingly, the Committee reminds
all Federal agencies of the law with respect to consultation and ex-
pects that all Federal agencies will meaningfully consult with In-
dian Tribes and ANCSA corporations on the same basis.
Streamlining Tribal Water Funding.—The Committee directs the
Department, in coordination with the Indian Health Service, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal agencies to,
within existing authorities, take steps to streamline and better co-
ordinate Federal Tribal drinking water and sanitation incentives
and programs with the goal of simplifying administrative burdens
for Tribal governments or organizations to design, finance, and
build necessary water infrastructure. The Committee directs the
Department, in coordination with IHS and EPA, to report to the
Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this act on policy recommendations to address any statu-
tory barriers and identify additional authorities necessary to fur-
ther this goal.
Wildlife Connectivity.—The Committee commends the Depart-
ment of the Interior for continuing to implement Secretarial Order
3362, which has proven to be effective at bolstering big game mi-
grations and improving habitat connectivity. In future budget re-
quests, the Department shall clearly identify and describe funding
requested for programs established to implement the Secretarial
Order.
Estimating Fixed Costs.—The Committee directs all agencies
funded in this act to include in future budget justifications an esti-
mate of the ‘‘fixed costs’’ needs for the budget year. Such costs rep-
resent non-programmatic, obligatory costs that cannot be changed
or avoided and are not associated with programmatic increases. For
the purposes of this estimate, the Committee directs that the com-
ponents of ‘‘fixed costs’’ include: (1) change in number of paid days;
(2) estimates of proposed cost-of-living adjustments, change in
number of paid days, and benefits increases for current year FTE
levels; (3) change in employer share of retirement programs for cur-
rent year staffing levels; (4) estimates of costs due for workers com-
pensation payments; (5) estimates of change in unemployment com-
pensation; (6) estimates of changes in rent payable to the General
Services Administration [GSA], Federal, and Non-Federal sources
for office and non-office space, including security estimates from
the Federal Protective Service, mandatory office relocations, and
base operations and maintenance increases resulting from move-
ment out of GSA or direct-leased space; (7) estimated costs for serv-
ices charged centrally by the Department/Agency that are manda-
tory and non-severable; and (8) estimated costs associated with
utilities for facilities. Note that these costs do not include pro-
grammatic contract increases. Budget submissions must include a

9
description of the assumptions reflected in each category of the
fixed cost estimates.
Barriers to Critical Mineral Development.—The Department of
the Interior, in conjunction with the Department of Energy, is di-
rected to complete a study on actions it can take to increase the
domestic supply of critical minerals and other minerals that are
projected to experience increased price and demand in the next 20
years. They are to specifically examine the barriers to producing,
processing, recycling, stockpiling, and identifying critical minerals
alternatives or substitutes, including possible obstacles for securing
financing. The report should include steps the Departments can
take to assist critical mineral projects in overcoming these barriers.
The report should also examine whether there is a need to create
a critical mineral reserve and the feasibility of undertaking such an
effort. Additionally, the report should develop a description of a
preferred location for developing, processing, recycling, and stock-
piling critical minerals. Finally, the report should also provide a
list of critical minerals and our dependence on imports for each, as
well as examine domestic sources and potential domestic sources.
Wildland Fire Consolidation.—The Committee is aware of the
administration’s proposal to consolidate the wildfire functions
across the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior.
While nothing in this bill provides the funding or authority nec-
essary for the administration to execute this consolidation, the
Committee is interested in understanding more about the adminis-
tration’s proposal to create a more effective and efficient wildland
fire workforce. No later than 120 days after enactment, the Com-
mittee directs the Forest Service, in consultation with the Depart-
ment of the Interior, to provide a report to the Committee on a cur-
rent capacity and needs study for wildland fire personnel and as-
sets across the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior.
Additionally, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act, the
Committee directs the Forest Service to provide the Committee
with a briefing on how they would plan to consolidate wildland fire
programs to achieve the most efficient and effective use of wildland
fire offices, coordinating bodies, programs, budgets, procurement
processes, and research programs with the Department of the Inte-
rior. Within 90 days of the enactment of this act, the Forest Service
is directed to brief the committee on the anticipated costs to imple-
ment the Executive Order entitled, ‘‘Empowering Commonsense
Wildfire Prevention and Response’’, signed on June 12, 2025.
Staffing.—The Committee is greatly concerned with the actions
taken regarding staffing across the Department of the Interior and
the other agencies funded in this bill. The staff are the lifeblood of
the Department and these agencies and the uninformed manner in
which staffing reductions have been imposed in the name of effi-
ciency is anything but efficient. The Committee expects the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the other agencies funded in this bill to
maintain the requisite staffing levels to ensure that operations are
not deleteriously affected or have a negative impact on the eco-
nomic output and support to States, localities, and tribes.
Agency Budget Staff.—The Committee notes the value of having
a full set of budget staff maintained at specific agencies in addition
to having department-level budget office staff and therefore directs

10
each agency funded by this act to maintain its own separate budget
office at the agency level. The Committee notes that section 447 of
the bill restricts transfers of funds among accounts with the effect
of moving personnel and affirm that agency budget staff is covered
within that provision.
Execution of Energy Projects.—The Committee urges the Depart-
ment to utilize resources in order to conduct decisions, actions, con-
sultations, and other undertakings related to renewable energy
projects in a timely manner so as to avoid unnecessary project
delays and cost increases so that the United States can ensure per-
mitting reliability to industry, maximize energy production, and
bring down Americans’ energy costs.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
The Committee includes congressionally directed spending as de-
fined in section 5(a) of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate. In the interest of providing full disclosure of funding provided
in the bill, all projects are listed in a table accompanying this re-
port.
The vast majority of congressionally directed spending projects
funded in the bill support the improvement of drinking water and
wastewater infrastructure in the United States. The Committee
has confirmed that each funded water infrastructure project is eli-
gible for funding under the State Revolving Funds, the Indian
Health Service sanitation deficiency system, or is otherwise cer-
tified as eligible.
The bill also funds a number of historic preservation projects,
each of which the Committee has confirmed is listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Land-
mark pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C.
470 et seq.). Other funded projects support on-the-ground conserva-
tion activities, capital improvement and maintenance on public
lands, and forest resiliency and wildfire risk reduction efforts
which will further the missions of longstanding programs funded
within the bill.
LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND
With enactment of GAOA, Congress provided a permanent ap-
propriation of $900,000,000 per year from the Land and Water
Conservation Fund [LWCF]. Along with other mandatory appro-
priations, LWCF programs are subject to a 5.7 percent sequestra-
tion, with those sequestered amounts becoming available in the
subsequent fiscal year. GAOA also mandated that account alloca-
tions and detailed project information be proposed by the adminis-
tration through the President’s budget submission, and that such
allocations, following review by the Committees on Appropriations,
may be modified through an alternate allocation.
The Reauthorization of LWCF in Section 3001 of the John D.
Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (Public
Law 116–9) required that funding for Federal purchases and for
the suite of grant programs providing financial assistance to States
each constitute at least 40 percent of total funds available each fis-
cal year from all sources, annually. That total includes

11
$900,000,000 in mandatory appropriations provided under GAOA,
as well as deposits to LWCF under Public Law 109–432. These de-
posits amounted to $117,875,000 in fiscal year 2025 and are also
projected at $117,875,000 in fiscal year 2026. Accordingly, the
Committee has taken the full amounts available for LWCF expend-
itures into account in determining its allocations and expects that
future budget submissions will clearly delineate all revenues cred-
ited to LWCF and will adhere to statutory requirements in the pro-
posed allocation to Federal and State programs.
The Committee rejects the budget proposal to allow funding for
deferred maintenance on Federal lands as an eligible use of the
Land and Water Conservation Fund. Since its inception over sixty
years ago, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been the
mechanism to safeguard and preserve for future generations the
natural, cultural, and historical treasures of the American land-
scape. While maintaining the built environment that facilitates the
management and recreation opportunities on these lands is a ne-
cessity, there are other funding avenues for deferred maintenance,
including through a reauthorized Legacy Restoration Fund. LWCF
is the only source available for saving places that will otherwise be
lost forever, including significant inholdings essential to ensure
cost-efficient management of existing public lands, improve access
for sportsmen and families, conserve habitat for game and non-
game species, protect iconic scenery in national parks and forests,
safeguard community water supplies, and provide other basic pub-
lic land benefits. The intent and uses of LWCF have been codified
and reaffirmed by both the Dingell Act of 2019 and the GAOA of
2020.
The Committees recognizes and appreciates the Forest Service’s
submission of the statutorily required Federal land acquisition
project list and the supplemental land acquisition project list. How-
ever, the Committee notes the absence of the fiscal year 2026 De-
partment of the Interior statutorily-required Federal land acquisi-
tion list for the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife
Service, and the National Park Service. The Committee reminds
the Department of the Interior of its statutory requirement in both
Public Law 116–152 and the general provision outlined in this act
in reference to submission of the Federal land acquisition project
list. The Committee looks forward to the Department of the Inte-
rior correcting this critical deficiency expeditiously and following
statute in forthcoming fiscal years.
Therefore, due to the absence of the Department of the Interior
statutorily required Federal land acquisition list, a detailed table
accompanying this report shows the LWCF allocation for fiscal year
2026 by agency, account, activity, and project, including the list of
specific Federal land acquisition projects for the Forest Service and
the Forest Legacy Program projects. The Committee will reassess
the Interior bureau allocations prior to enactment of this act and
as a full slate of land acquisition lists are provided.
Appraisals.—The Committee appreciates the commitment by the
Department and the Forest Service to meet congressional direction
to ameliorate concerns about delays and other process issues re-
lated to the appraisal function. Concerns persist, however, regard-
ing process inconsistencies across regions, the need for public

12
transparency regarding policies and manuals associated with ap-
praisal review, and other issues related to valuation. The Com-
mittee expects detailed regular reports related to the process and
policy changes being implemented, as well as the pilot program for
returning some functions to the Fish and Wildlife Service and Na-
tional Park Service, and will revisit this issue and funding for ap-
praisal services prior to enactment of a final fiscal year 2026 bill.
Fish and Wildlife Service.—The Service is expected to provide
outreach to all units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, in-
cluding Clarks River, Don Edwards, Green River, Loxahatchee, and
Okefenokee, to ensure these refuges are accessing all available
funding tools, including recreational access and inholdings. The
Service is strongly encouraged to continue due diligence work on
the accumulating backlog of parcels available at Clarks River and
Green River National Wildlife Refuges and is directed to brief the
Committee on such efforts within 90 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee directs the Service to consider habitat conservation
plan land acquisition applications that enhance efforts to establish
State research forests through the Cooperative Endangered Species
Conservation Fund program. The Committee supports future con-
servation easement acquisition in the Mascoma River Division of
the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge and land ac-
quisition at Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge by the Service.
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee encour-
ages the Service to acquire lands within the Okefenokee National
Wildlife Refuge’s boundaries, which will expand hunting, fishing,
and recreation access and help reduce fire risk in the Refuge and
nearby communities.
National Park Service.—The Committee supports future land ac-
quisition for the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park by the
Service.
Big Cypress National Preserve and Florida Panther National
Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee is aware of the ecological and cul-
tural significance of the Big Cypress National Preserve and Florida
Panther National Wildlife Refuge and of the potential damage to
these public lands should the owners of the subsurface rights en-
gage in oil, gas, or mineral exploration or extraction. The Com-
mittee also is aware of the time-sensitive opportunity for the De-
partment of the Interior to acquire the subsurface rights to these
lands, thereby ensuring permanent protection for these areas. The
Committee urges the Department to prioritize and expedite the re-
view of due diligence and the decision-making process with respect
to this opportunity, and directs the Appraisal and Valuation Serv-
ices Office to report to the Committee on its decision no later than
180 days after enactment of this act.
LWCF State Conservation Grants.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of providing Federal funds from the Land and
Water Conservation Fund under the Great American Outdoors Act
to States, the District of Columbia and insular areas in a timely
manner to avoid any undue impacts on staffing and outdoor recre-
ation projects at the State and local level. Therefore, the National
Park Service shall release application guidance and expected allo-
cations to States, the District of Columbia and insular areas not
later than 60 days after enactment of this act. The Committee is

13
concerned with the reduction of mission-critical staff for the Na-
tional Park Service and directs the office to achieve staffing levels
that will allow it to provide robust technical assistance, timely
grant decisions and oversight of State and Local Assistance pro-
grams under the Great American Outdoors Act.
Forest Legacy Program.—For over 30 years, the Forest Service
and States have worked together through this program to protect
privately owned forest lands through conservation easements and
land purchases, all while not adding to the Federal estate. The
Committee appreciates the Forest Service’s successful implementa-
tion of this program and its efforts to ensure that States fully un-
derstand the tools available under the current statute and regula-
tion, including management agreements that can contribute to the
program’s continued success.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
Reprogramming guidelines for the agencies funded in this bill
were codified in Division D of Public Law 116–94 and further de-
scribed in the accompanying explanatory statement. These guide-
lines are repeated here for emphasis and reference, and are contin-
ued in this bill as a Title IV general provision.
The following are the procedures governing reprogramming ac-
tions for programs and activities funded in the Department of the
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
The agencies funded by this act are reminded that no reprogram-
ming shall be implemented without the advance approval of the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in accordance
with the procedures included in this act. The agencies funded in
this act are reminded that these reprogramming guidelines are in
effect, and must be complied with, until such time as the Commit-
tees modify them through bill or report language.
Definitions.—‘‘Reprogramming,’’ as defined in these procedures,
includes the reallocation of funds from one budget activity, budget
line-item, or program area to another within any appropriation
funded in this act. In cases where either the House or Senate Com-
mittee on Appropriations report displays an allocation of an appro-
priation below that level, the more detailed level shall be the basis
for reprogramming.
For construction, land acquisition, and forest legacy accounts, a
reprogramming constitutes the reallocation of funds, including un-
obligated balances, from one construction, land acquisition, or for-
est legacy project to another such project.
A reprogramming shall also consist of any significant departure
from the program described in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes all proposed reorganizations or other workforce ac-
tions detailed below which affect a total of 10 staff members or 10
percent of the staffing of an affected program or office, whichever
is less, even without a change in funding. Any change to the orga-
nization table presented in the budget justification shall also be
subject to this requirement.
Agencies are reminded that these longstanding General Guide-
lines for Reprogramming require agencies funded by this act to
submit reorganization proposals for the Committees’ review prior to
their implementation. It is noted that such reprogramming guide-

14
lines apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce restructure, re-
shaping, transfer of functions, or bureau-wide downsizing and in-
clude closures, consolidations, and relocations of offices, facilities,
and laboratories. In addition, no agency shall implement any part
of a reorganization that modifies regional or State boundaries for
agencies or bureaus that were in effect as of the date of enactment
of this act unless approved consistent with the General Guidelines
for Reprogramming procedures specified herein. Any such re-
programming request submitted to the Committees on Appropria-
tions shall include a description of anticipated benefits, including
anticipated efficiencies and cost-savings, as well as a description of
anticipated personnel impacts and funding changes anticipated to
implement the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only when an unfore-
seen situation arises, and then only if postponement of the
project or the activity until the next appropriation year would
result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be deferred through
reprogramming, shall not later be accomplished by means of
further reprogramming, but instead, funds should again be
sought for the deferred project or activity through the regular
appropriations process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situations, reprogramming
should not be employed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by Congress, or to de-
crease allocations specifically increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval will be con-
sidered as expeditiously as possible, and the Committees re-
mind the agencies that in order to process reprogramming re-
quests, adequate and timely information must be provided.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogramming must be submitted
to the Committees in writing prior to implementation if it exceeds
$1,000,000 annually or results in an increase or decrease of more
than 10 percent annually in affected programs or projects, which-
ever amount is less, with the following exceptions:
(a) With regard to the Tribal priority allocations of the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs [BIA] and Bureau of Indian Education
[BIE], there is no restriction on reprogrammings among these
programs. However, the Bureaus shall report on all
reprogrammings made during a given fiscal year no later than
60 days after the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, the Committees do not require
reprogramming requests associated with the States and Tribes
Partnership Grants or up to a cumulative total of $5,000,000
from carryover balances among the individual program areas
delineated in the Environmental Programs and Management
account, with no more than $1,000,000 coming from any indi-
vidual program area. No funds, however, shall be reallocated
from individual Geographic Programs.
(c) With regard to the National Park Service, the Commit-
tees do not require reprogramming requests associated with
the park base within the Park Management activity in the Op-

15
eration of the National Park System Account. The Service is
required to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations on spending trends for the park base within 60 days
of enactment of this act.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in these procedures shall
refer to any charges, reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget ac-
tivity or budget line item for costs associated with general agency
administrative costs, overhead costs, working capital expenses, or
contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against any program,
budget activity, subactivity, budget line item, or project funded
by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act unless such assessment and the basis therefore are
presented to the Committees in the budget justifications and
are subsequently approved by the Committees. The expla-
nation for any assessment in the budget justification shall
show the amount of the assessment, the activities assessed,
and the purpose of the funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assessments, as such esti-
mates were presented in annual budget justifications, shall be
submitted through the reprogramming process and shall be
subject to the same dollar and reporting criteria as any other
reprogramming.
(c) Each agency or bureau which utilizes assessments shall
submit an annual report to the Committees, which provides de-
tails on the use of all funds assessed from any other budget ac-
tivity, line item, subactivity, or project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or assessments be
used to finance projects and activities disapproved or limited
by Congress or to finance programs or activities that could be
foreseen and included in the normal budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget should not be ini-
tiated before enactment of the bill without notification to, and
the approval of, the Committees. restriction applies to all such
actions regardless of whether a formal reprogramming of funds
is required to begin the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings between budget activi-
ties, budget line-items, program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this recommendation, including those below the
monetary thresholds established above, shall be reported to the
Committees within 60 days of the end of each quarter and shall in-
clude cumulative totals for each budget activity or budget line item,
or construction, land acquisition, or forest legacy project.
Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest Legacy.—Lands shall
not be acquired for more than the approved appraised value, as ad-
dressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–646, unless such acqui-
sitions are submitted to the Committees on Appropriations for ap-
proval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, wherein the estimated value
of the Federal lands to be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000
shall not be consummated until the Committees have had 30 days
in which to examine the proposed exchange. In addition, the Com-
mittees shall be provided advance notification of exchanges valued
between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

16
Budget Structure.—The budget activity or line item structure for
any agency appropriation account shall not be altered without ad-
vance approval of the Committees.

These actions were taken by the Committee to ensure the De-
partments and Agencies funded in this bill spend money in accord-
ance with the intent of Congress.
The Committee is disappointed with the utter lack of regard for
complying with Congressional intent on spending funds as appro-
priated.

TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
LAND AND WATER RESOURCES
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT
The Bureau of Land Management [Bureau or BLM] manages
more than 245 million acres of public lands, primarily in 11 West-
ern States and Alaska. The Bureau also has responsibility for 700
million acres of federally owned subsurface mineral estate. The Bu-
reau is mandated to administer these lands for multiple uses, in-
cluding recreation, wildlife habitat, mineral and energy production,
timber harvesting, and rangeland grazing, while managing natural,
cultural, and historical resources.
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,260,462,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,256,992,000
The Committee recommends $1,256,992,000 for Management of
Lands and Resources. The detailed allocation of funding by pro-
gram and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Program directives and specific funding requirements are
noted in the following narrative.
Wild Horse and Burro Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $141,972,000 for wild horse and burro activities.
It is clear that the landscape cannot support the populations in
excess of the appropriate management level [AML], and that the
Bureau should scale up targeted removals in the most heavily eco-
logically impacted areas with a goal of achieving a sustainable herd
population below AML through a humane and sustainable multi-
pronged approach of fertility control, targeted removals, off-range
holding, and adoptions, in accordance with current law and animal
welfare protocols. With the funds provided, the Bureau must ad-
dress the fact that the cost for housing horses in off-range facilities
is reducing the availability of resources to care for and manage on-
range populations, or to conduct gathers for fertility control treat-
ment or removal. Not later than 30 days after enactment of this
act, the Bureau is directed to restart quarterly briefings for the
Committee on the state of the program and shall include informa-
tion on the number of off-range holding contracts offered, including
renewals, the number of applicants for such contracts, and the
number of awarded contracts, information on the cost of contract
adjustments for change orders, and how the Bureau is working to
reduce the costs of off-range holdings.
Land Management Priorities.—The Committee recommends
$3,246,000 for congressionally directed spending in this program. A
(17)

18
detailed list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending’’ table accompanying this report.
Wildlife Habitat Management.—The Committee recommends no
less than $34,000,000 for threatened and endangered species activi-
ties. The Committee appreciates the Bureau’s work on its 5-year
strategic plan and looks forward to an action plan that includes
priorities identified through science-based criteria.
Sage-Grouse.—The Committee recommends no less than
$71,000,000 for sage-grouse conservation activities within Wildlife
Habitat Management. Greater sage-grouse conservation funding is
set apart because the Committee expects that these funds will re-
sult in increased capacity and expertise in ecological restoration,
continued implementation of the National Seed Strategy, and re-
duction of invasive plants through monitoring, early detection, and
targeted removal, specific to habitat improvements for sage-grouse.
Increasing the success of restoring sagebrush plant communities,
particularly after burned events, is critical to conserving the broad-
er sagebrush ecosystem. The Bureau is expected to use the mul-
tiple existing and relevant strategies for sagebrush restoration to
increase the success of projects that restore burned, degraded, or
otherwise unhealthy habitat. Further, the Committee expects the
Bureau to only use these funds for native, genetically-appropriate
plant species in revegetation and restoration activities in sage-
grouse habitat.
Plant Conservation Activities.—The bill provides no less than
$20,600,000 for plant conservation and restoration. The Committee
expects the Bureau to continue the research agenda identified in
the Seed Strategy, support the interagency Native Plant Materials
Development program, the Seeds of Success program, the Plant
Conservation Alliance, regional native plant materials development
programs, and related activities.
Energy and Minerals.—The Committee recommends no less than
$18,500,000 for legacy well remediation to maintain program ca-
pacity and continue progress toward cleanup of the next cluster of
legacy wells in need of remediation.
Alaska Conveyance.—The Committee recommends $32,662,000
for Alaska conveyance. The Committee recognizes the importance
of the Bureau of Land Management Alaska Native Vietnam-era
Veterans Allotment Program and the Committee recommends an
additional $1,008,000 in funding to be used for this program. Fur-
ther, the Committee recognizes the challenges associated with im-
plementation of the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Allotment
Program and includes a 5-year program extension to allow the Bu-
reau sufficient time to locate and assist all eligible veterans and
their decedents.
17(b) Program.—The Committee supports the Bureau’s efforts to
enter into agreements with Alaska Native entities to administer
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] 17(b) easements
and directs the Bureau to make funds available to implement these
agreements. To that end, the Committee recommends $1,500,000 to
be available to the Bureau to provide funding to Alaska Native en-
tities with which it has entered into 17(b) easement agreements
given the importance of having safe, public access to public lands
or major waterways. Of the funds provided, the Committee directs

19
that no more than 5 percent be available to the Bureau for admin-
istrative expenses. The Bureau is directed to provide a briefing
within 60 days of enactment of this act on these efforts.
Resource Management Planning.—The Committee recommends
$65,000,000, including up to $10,000,000 for sage grouse and sage-
brush restoration planning.
National Conservation Lands.—The Committee recommends
$59,135,000 for National Conservation Lands, including
$11,000,000 for National Scenic and Historic Trails. National Con-
servation Lands conserve the Nation’s heritage and this funding
will allow increased inventory, monitoring, and protection of cul-
tural resources; enhance proper management of all resources; and
provide a quality visitor experience through recreational access.
Furthermore, this funding ensures that units in the National Con-
servation Lands system are adequately staffed with land managers,
law enforcement officers, and cultural resources experts.
Conservation Status Ranking.—The Committee provides
$2,000,000 to support efforts to update conservation status ranks
for species of conservation concern in the Pacific Northwest using
transparent and standardized tools through cooperative agree-
ments with institutions of higher learning in the region.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance related to activities funded in this account.
Western Oregon.—The Committee appreciates the Bureau’s work
with the State of Oregon to renew the Western Oregon Operating
Plan and directs the Bureau to continue to fully participate in the
unified wildfire protection system and to cooperate to maintain the
level of fire protection for western Oregon forestlands and commu-
nities through the full term of the agreement to 2029. The Bureau
is directed to aggressively target hazardous fuels treatments and
report annually on the amount spent, as well as the scope of haz-
ardous fuels management required across BLM-managed lands, in-
cluding Oregon and California Grant Lands.
Renewable Energy.—The Bureau is directed to hire and train
dedicated geothermal personnel and to develop training materials,
and standard operating procedures to provide technical support to
district offices, in order to ensure the timely review of geothermal
energy projects on Federal lands.
Metallurgical Coal.—The Bureau is directed to brief the Com-
mittee regarding barriers to finalizing pending lease applications
for metallurgical coal within 60 days of enactment of this act.
Availability of Data.—The Committee is aware of the Bureau’s
work to address recommendations from the Government Account-
ability Office regarding the management of key data systems used
to oversee development on Federal lands. The Committee supports
these ongoing efforts and expects the Bureau to continue make
progress towards closing the recommendations in GA0–21–209 to
ensure the timely reporting of data made available to the public on
a consistent and predictable basis.
Rio Puerco Watershed.—The Committee reiterates its support for
the Rio Puerco Watershed Program and encourages the Bureau to
continue its financial support.
Aquifer Recharge.—The Committee continues to direct the Bu-
reau to work with the State of Idaho to provide appropriate access

20
for recharge projects. The Bureau is directed to brief the Com-
mittee within 90 days of enactment of this act on its use of authori-
ties provided by section 1105 of Public Law 116–260, which allow
the Bureau to use existing easements and rights of ways to move
and percolate water for aquifer recharge without further permis-
sions or additional requirements.
Tribal Contracting.—The Bureau is encouraged to utilize con-
tracts with Indian Tribes pursuant to the Indian Self-Determina-
tion and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93–638) to enable
greater collaboration and co-stewardship of public land and natural
resources with Indian Tribes.
Range Management.—The Bureau is directed, to the greatest ex-
tent practicable, to make vacant grazing allotments available to a
holder of a grazing permit or lease when lands covered by the hold-
er of the permit or lease are unusable because of drought or wild-
fire.
Grazing Allotments.—The Bureau must prioritize management of
active allotments impacting riparian areas, that are not meeting
land health standards, or do not have current assessments and re-
duce the backlog of active grazing permits that require analysis
and new management decisions under the National Environmental
Policy Act.
Signage for Wilderness Areas.—The Committee directs the Bu-
reau to ensure that the public is adequately informed regarding the
lands protected as well as routes that are open or closed with prop-
erly posted and maintained signage for the areas protected by Pub-
lic Law 116–9.
Caja del Rio, New Mexico.—The Committee is concerned about
documented acts of desecration of sacred sites and illegal dumping
at the Caja del Rio. The Bureau is directed conduct government-
to-government consultation with Tribal governments and engage
with other stakeholders to address these issues and provide a sta-
tus update to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this
act.
Consultation.—The Committee encourages the Secretary to en-
gage, as directed, in additional meaningful, consultations with fed-
erally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
Corporations affected by the Final Rule titled ‘‘Special Areas With-
in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska’’. The Committee ex-
pects improved consultation with Alaska Natives on the North
Slope of Alaska, on this rule and other major actions by the Inte-
rior Department that impact their economy, well-being, and ances-
tral lands. The Committee directs the Secretary to conduct mean-
ingful consultations with Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations and
other Tribal entities in the North Slope region and do everything
in their power to ensure that those Alaska Native views are under-
stood and reflected in decisions on the implementation of the rule
and all other decisions made by the Department.
Soda Ash.—In accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act and the
Non-Energy Leasing minerals rule, the Bureau set a 10-year, in-
dustry-wide royalty rate of 2 percent on January 1, 2021, for all ex-
isting and future Federal soda ash and sodium bicarbonate leases.
The Committee encourages the Bureau to work with soda ash pro-
ducers to assist them in reducing royalty rates and directs the Bu-

21
reau to take the necessary steps to reduce the Federal royalty rate
for soda ash as appropriate.
Ambler Access Project.—The Committee notes that section
201(4)(b) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
[ANILCA] of 1980 requires the Secretary to permit access for sur-
face transportation purposes from the Ambler Mining District to
the Alaska Pipeline Haul Road in accordance with the provisions
of the act and expects the Department to follow the law.
North Anchorage Land Agreement.—The Committee recognizes
that the North Anchorage Land Agreement of March 15, 1982, as
amended, and authorized as a matter of Federal law by section
1425 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of
December 2, 1980 (Public Law 96–487), was intended to address
long-standing land entitlement issues in and surrounding the Mu-
nicipality of Anchorage and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The
continued importance of Fort Richardson for our Nation’s defense
has made it impossible for Eklutna Inc., to realize the agreed-upon
benefits set out within the North Anchorage Land Agreement and
remaining entitlement of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
of December 18, 1971 (Public Law 92–203). Of the amounts appro-
priated, up to $500,000 shall be made available in fiscal year 2026
for the Appraisal and Valuation Services Office, or a contracted
federally qualified appraiser, to complete a land appraisal and mar-
ket analysis within 90 days of the date of enactment of this act for
the remaining lands designated for conveyance to Eklutna Inc.
through the North Anchorage Land Agreement and Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act. The appropriation shall first fully fund the
cost of the surface appraisal and then, if adequate funds remain,
the cost of a subsurface appraisal. In order to provide an accurate
and balanced appraisal to inform a future equal value land-ex-
change, the AVSO shall appraise the North Anchorage Land Agree-
ment military lands as if uncontaminated by military use.
Good Samaritan Remediation.—The Committee notes the impor-
tance of Public Law 118–155 in addressing the remediation of
abandoned hardrock mines as well as meeting our Nation’s mineral
needs. The Bureau is directed to use all available authorities pro-
vided under Public Law 118–155 and to brief the Committee on
any permit applications that were considered to be denied pursuant
to section 4(m)(2)(B) of that act.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee encourages the
Bureau to consider applications for virtual fencing technologies for
cattle in improving rangeland management and directs the Bureau,
within 90 days of enactment of this act, to submit a report on the
potential rangeland improvements, benefits to wildlife habitat, and
cost savings resulting from the use of virtual fencing technologies
on Federal grazing allotments.
Critical Minerals Supply Chains and Reliability.—The Com-
mittee reminds the Bureau that Public Law 117–58 Section 40206
requires a joint effort with the Forest Service to submit a report
to Congress which includes regulatory and legislative proposals to
improve timeliness of permitting activities and the development
and publication of a performance metric for evaluating the progress
made in expediting permitting activities. In addition to these re-
ports, the Committee directs the Bureau to provide a briefing with-

22
in 90 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, on its
status for satisfying section 40206 of Public Law 117–58.
OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $115,521,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 115,521,000
The Committee recommends $115,521,000 for Oregon and Cali-
fornia Grant Lands. The detailed allocation of funding by activity
is included in the table accompanying this report.
The Bureau is directed to aggressively target hazardous fuels
treatments and report annually on the amount spent, as well as
the scope of hazardous fuels management required across Oregon
and California Grant Lands; and to regularly report timber sale ac-
complishments for sales that have been sold and awarded rather
than merely offered for sale. The Bureau is expected to report these
activities in a manner consistent with the Forest Service and only
count awarded volume. The Committee appreciates the Bureau’s
commitment to treating Sudden Oak Death syndrome and provides
funding adequate to continue these activities.

FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS
U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [Service] is the principal Fed-
eral agency responsible for conserving, protecting, and enhancing
fish, wildlife, plants, andtheir habitats. The Service manages more
than 150 million acres in the National Wildlife Refuge System,
which encompasses 568 national wildlife refuges, thousands of
small wetlands, and other special management areas and Marine
National Monuments. It also operates 72 national fish hatcheries,
65 fish and wildlife management offices, and 80 ecological services
field stations. The agency enforces Federal wildlife laws, admin-
isters the Endangered Species Act [ESA] (Public Law 93–205),
manages migratory bird populations, restores nationally significant
fisheries, conserves and restores wildlife habitat such as wetlands,
and helps foreign governments with their conservation efforts. It
also oversees the Federal Assistance program, which distributes
hundreds of millions of dollars in excise taxes on fishing and hunt-
ing equipment to State fish and wildlife agencies.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,475,353,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,462,934,000
The Committee recommends $1,462,934,000 for Resource Man-
agement. All programs and subactivities included are continued at
enacted levels unless otherwise specified below or in the table. The
detailed allocation of funding by program and activity is included
in the table accompanying this report. Program directives and spe-
cific funding requirements are noted in the following narrative.
Ecological Services.—The Committee recommends $283,998,000
for Ecological Services activities. Within the Ecological Services
program, funding is recommended as follows:
Listing.—The Committee recommends $21,120,000 for endan-
gered species listing activities. The Service is directed to brief the
Committee on its work plan for this funding as it relates to petition
activities, listing of foreign species, and critical habitat designa-
tions.
Planning and Consultation.—The Committee recommends
$116,191,000 for planning and consultation. Included in the rec-
ommendation is $4,000,000 for Gulf Coast Restoration activities.
The Committee also recommends $10,354,000 to support environ-
mental review and permitting of energy projects on public lands;
$2,772,000 for Environmental Response and Restoration;
$3,500,000 for National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] permit-
ting; and $2,859,000 for Bay Delta Ecosystem Restoration. The
Committee also recommends $1,500,000 for Pesticide Consulta-
tions.
Conservation and Restoration.—The Committee recommends
$37,571,000 for Conservation and Restoration. The recommenda-
tion includes $1,000,000 for the Alaska Nannut Co-management
Council; and $500,000 for the Eskimo Walrus Commission. The
Committee also recommends $1,432,000 for Coastal Barrier Re-

24
sources Act; $6,507,000 for Environmental Response and Restora-
tion; $7,373,000 for marine mammals; $3,250,000 for the Sage-
brush Steppe Ecosystem; and $3,471,000 for the National Wetlands
Inventory.
Recovery.—The Committee recommends $109,116,000 for activi-
ties in support of the recovery and delisting of threatened and en-
dangered species, which includes $5,250,000 for the State of the
Birds to respond to the urgent needs of critically endangered birds
that, due to climate change, now face imminent extinction from
non-native mosquitoes that carry avian malaria and other patho-
gens lethal to these birds; $2,300,000 for the Prescott Grant pro-
gram; and $1,000,000 for the wolf-livestock demonstration pro-
gram. The recommendation includes $10,500,000 for Recovery
Challenge matching grants. Recovery Challenge grants are to be
used to implement high priority recovery actions as prescribed in
recovery plans to recover federally listed species. Actions should in-
clude, but are not limited to, genetically-sound breeding, rearing,
and reintroduction programs. Project partners must provide con-
tributions at least 50 percent of the project cost, with the remain-
ing funding coming from Recovery Challenge funds. Partner con-
tribution calculations may include in-kind services. Unless an af-
fected State is a partner on the project, no funds may be awarded
to a project until the project partners have consulted with such
State. Further, the Committee directs the Service to conduct a com-
petitive solicitation and provide the funding to the awardees within
365 days of enactment of this act.
Additional Ecological Services guidance is provided below.
Traditional Knowledge.—The Service manages lands and natural
resources of great importance to Indian Tribes, and the Committee
appreciates the acknowledgment of the benefits of traditional eco-
logical knowledge by the Service in past policy statements and
guidance in managing these lands and resources. However, the
Committee is concerned the Service has not fully incorporated tra-
ditional Tribal knowledge in its planning processes and its imple-
mentation of the Endangered Species Act [ESA], and would like to
see added importance given to the application of this knowledge.
When appropriate, the Committee expects the Service to make
every effort to incorporate traditional knowledge in its planning de-
cisions, including in ESA decisions. The Committee also expects the
Service to engage in additional outreach to Tribal governments in
circumstances where traditional knowledge may provide valuable
information for species like the northern sea otter.
Endangered Species Act Consultations.—The Committee con-
tinues to be concerned regarding the timing of processing of Endan-
gered Species Act Section 7 consultation requests, including in
West Virginia, North Dakota, and elsewhere. While the Committee
recognizes the Service is working to clear the backlog, the Service
is directed to report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment
of this act on the existing backlog, including the number of out-
standing requests and relevant staff per State. The Committee is
concerned about current staffing levels at the Service and their
ability to prioritize. The Committee also directs the Service to di-
rect additional staff and other resources to States with the most
significant backlogs in order to reduce the response times for these

25
consultations. Additionally, the Committee notes that a provision to
provide transfer authority of unobligated Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58) funding to the Service and the
National Marine Fisheries Service to expedite these reviews was
enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law
118–42) as requested. The Committee continues to support this
provision.
Native Watershed Forests.—Watershed forests provide the impor-
tant ecological service of recharging aquifers and other under-
ground water resources in addition to having carbon sequestration
benefits, an important component to addressing climate change.
Such forests may also provide critical habitat for endangered en-
demic species uniquely evolved for the ecosystems they create. In
such cases, active management becomes a cost effective way to sup-
port multiple conservation goals. The Committee urges the Service
to support State and local management of native watershed forests.
Candidate Conservation.—The Committee recommends
$14,538,000 for Candidate Conservation efforts to facilitate vol-
untary conservation efforts for at-risk species under consideration
for listing under the ESA, specifically by developing landscape level
partnerships with private landowners, States, Tribes, and agencies
on Candidate Conservation Agreements to promote a collaborative
approach for conservation planning.
Collaboration Between Federal Agencies and Private Forest Own-
ers.—The Committee recognizes that many at-risk species inhabit
private lands and that the Service must consider non-regulatory
and voluntary collaborative conservation efforts with private land-
owners to accomplish its mission. The Service is directed to con-
tinue to utilize its grant and other programs to pursue collabo-
rative species conservation with private landowners to the max-
imum extent practicable, specifically for the Northern Long-Eared
Bat and the Wood Turtle. Overall, these ongoing collaborative ef-
forts through programs such as the Wildlife Conservation Initiative
will play a vital role in conserving at-risk and listed species, allow
for cooperation, and ultimately help achieve important wildlife con-
servation outcomes. Private landowners interested in habitat con-
servation are important partners and their efforts should be en-
couraged by improving access to a fuller range of conservation re-
sources that exist across the Federal Government and other enti-
ties. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Service to support
non-profit organizations with expertise and experience in working
with private landowners to provide greater access to information
and resources in their local area related to the conservation of wild-
life habitat on private lands.
State Research Forests.—The Committee directs the Service to
support cooperative research, monitoring, and recovery efforts for
the protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species,
such as the spotted owl and marbled murrelet, on state research
forests and to report to the Committee within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on progress and future plans for such forests in-
cluding the Elliott State Research Forest.
Jaguar Habitat Connectivity Research and Restoration.—The
Committee encourages the Service to prioritize research and res-
toration of jaguar habitat and connectivity in the U.S.-Mexico bor-

26
derlands. Prioritization should include, but not be limited to, the
following actions within the Borderlands Secondary Area: mapping
of potential trans-border linkages and identification and mitigation
of impediments in these corridors, assessing the level of protection
in current and potential jaguar range, maintaining and increasing
important corridors and administration of protected areas, devel-
oping methodologies for jaguar habitat restoration, and identifying
prioritized lands for habitat restoration.
Biobanking.—The Committee is aware that the Service, through
its regional offices, is exploring the use of biobanking, which is the
preservation of genetic material, including tissues, living cell lines
and gametes, as a tool to preserve the genetic diversity of species
in order to enhance recovery efforts. The Committee encourages the
Service to expand upon these efforts including incorporating sam-
ple collection for biobanking into the recovery planning process.
Western Monarch Butterfly.—The Committee is particularly con-
cerned over the rapid decline in western monarch butterfly popu-
lations and urges the Service to continue to act expeditiously to
make a final determination on ESA protections for the western
monarch. Further, the Service is directed to utilize Service-man-
aged lands to the maximum extent practicable to serve as habitat
corridors for migrating monarchs, in particular the western mon-
arch. The Committee recognizes the Service provides resources for
monarchs and other pollinators across multiple accounts, and the
Committee recommends not less than $8,000,000 for the western
monarch butterfly and other pollinators within National Wildlife
Refuge System, Inventory and Monitoring and including an addi-
tional $1,000,000 within Science Support. The Service is encour-
aged to work alongside Federal agencies, State, Tribal, and non-
governmental organizations on a comprehensive strategy to in-
crease habitat and monitoring of critical pollinator species. The
Service is expected to continue to work with the National Fish and
Wildlife Foundation [NFWF] to expand and leverage monarch re-
covery efforts.
Florida Grasshopper Sparrow.—The Committee directs the Serv-
ice to continue to support at the enacted level. Furthermore, the
Committee is encouraged by the success of the Service’s captive
breeding program as managed by its conservation partners and
notes that augmenting the wild population with captive bred re-
leases as early as this year will mark an important new phase in
the species’ recovery. The Committee notes that the disease and
health studies necessary to understand and combat captive bred
sparrow mortality may have important benefits to the recovery of
other endangered birds including the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow.
Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow.—The Committee encourages the
Service to support the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow Captive Breed-
ing and Release Pilot Program. The Committee recognizes the need
to restore wild populations of the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow as
a method to improve water management flexibility in the Ever-
glades system, which has been affected by regulatory requirements
associated with the Endangered Species Act and has had impacts
on the ecology and wildlife of Water Conservation Area 3A and the
reservation of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Further-
more, the Committee is encouraged by the success of the Service’s

27
captive breeding programs as managed by its conservation partners
and notes that augmenting the wild population with captive bred
releases as early as this year will mark an important new phase
in the species’ recovery.
Red Knot Recovery Program.—The Committee supports the ef-
forts of the Service’s Red Knot Recovery program. Funding rec-
ommended for these activities should be used to improve horseshoe
crab egg density surveys, safeguarding the red knot’s food supplies,
filling data gaps, and addressing new threats as they emerge.
Native Handicrafts.—The Committee reiterates that the Service’s
2016 elephant ivory regulation does not apply to Alaska Native
handicrafts made from walrus ivory and mammoth ivory. However,
the Committee is concerned that the Federal prohibitions on the
sale and trade of elephant ivory have negatively impacted the Alas-
ka Native arts economy. The Committee appreciates the Service’s
efforts on this matter to date. The Committee expects the Service
to continue its efforts to promote this distinction and directs the
Service to develop a plan for greater outreach on this matter.
Habitat Conservation.—The Committee recommends $69,820,000
for Habitat Conservation programs. The Partners for Fish and
Wildlife Program is recommended at $57,820,000. Within the rec-
ommended funds for Partners, $3,200,000 is for Nutria Eradication
activities, $643,000 for Environmental Data Quality and Access,
$3,285,000 for Washington Regional Fisheries Enhancement
Groups, an increase of $2,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, and $6,132,000 for Klamath Habitat Restoration, an increase
of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year enacted level.
The Committee recommends $12,000,000 for the Coastal Pro-
gram, which includes Ecosystem Restoration, Hood Canal Salmon
Enhancement, and Long Live the Kings.
National Wildlife Refuge System.—The Committee recommends
$525,555,000 for the National Wildlife Refuge System.
Within the recommended amount for the National Wildlife Ref-
uge System, $254,735,000 is for wildlife and habitat management.
Further, $17,925,000 is recommended for invasive species, with the
$300,000 included for European green crab efforts with more direc-
tion detailed below. The Committee notes an emphasis on invasive
species Strike Teams to focus on high priority invasive species
problems before they cause irreparable harm to the environment.
The Committee recommends $500,000 to help improve water effi-
ciency at the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge in order to main-
tain, improve, and replace and upgrade refuge infrastructure per
the direction included in the accompanying statement in the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260). The rec-
ommendation also includes $2,500,000 for the Marine National
Monuments, and $3,000,000 for nutria eradication.
The Committee recommends $76,000,000 for Refuge Visitor Serv-
ices. The Committee recommends $2,500,000 for Youth and Careers
in Nature, including $500,000 for the Arctic Youth Ambassadors
program, and $7,000,000 for the Urban Wildlife Conservation Pro-
gram within Refuge Visitor Services.
Urban Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge.—The Com-
mittee directs the Services’ Urban Wildlife Conservation Program
to continue partnerships with organizations that provide expertise

28
in Indigenous traditional ecological and cultural knowledge, capac-
ity building, employee training, and development and evaluation of
training methodologies provided by such organizations in western
States.
The Committee recommends $146,520,000 for refuge mainte-
nance.
The Committee recommends $45,500,000 for refuge law enforce-
ment.
Refuge Management Plans.—The recommendation includes
$2,800,000 for Refuge Planning. The Committee is concerned that
a number of refuge management plans have not been updated for
many years, and directs the Service to prioritize updating manage-
ment plans to improve the management of the oldest refuges.
Trapping in National Wildlife Refuges.—The Committee under-
stands that the Service makes efforts to provide information to the
public regarding acceptable trapping practices on refuge lands. The
Service is directed to improve efforts to inform the public about ac-
ceptable trapping practices and collect data on trapping activities
in refuges, and to share those efforts and outcomes with the Com-
mittee.
European Green Crab.—The Committee recognizes invasive Eu-
ropean green crab is becoming an increasing problem and rec-
ommends $300,000 for European green crab eradication efforts at
affected National Wildlife Refuges. Further, the Service and its
partners are directed to jointly brief the Committee no later than
90 days after enactment on this act on their collective efforts to ad-
dress European green crab.
Additional National Wildlife Refuge System funding guidance is
provided below.
Klamath Restoration.—The Service is directed to consider addi-
tional activities that could be undertaken to recover endangered
and threatened species, restore habitat, and improve the health of
the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges with the funds pro-
vided in fiscal year 2026 and during the fiscal year 2027 budget
formulation. The Service is also encouraged to continue to coordi-
nate with the Bureau of Reclamation where appropriate and con-
sult with Tribes.
Additional National Refuge System guidance is provided below.
Staffing of the National Wildlife Refuge System.—Over the past
decade, the Refuge System’s full-time equivalent [FTE] staffing has
decreased while the Refuge System has continued to grow. The
Committee is concerned with the current level of FTEs within the
Refuge System. Further, within 60 days of enactment of this act,
and monthly thereafter, the Department and the Service are di-
rected to brief the Committee on Refuge System operations, to in-
clude staffing levels by refuge, visitor data by refuge, and other
data necessary to convince the Committee that operations have not
been and will not be deleteriously affected in an effort to make the
Refuge System operate more efficiently.
Further, the Committee directs the Service to submit, no later
than 90 days after the enactment of this act, a report detailing by
month: (1) how many permanent, probationary, and temporary po-
sitions were terminated during Fiscal Year 2025 and in which ref-
uge units or complexes they served, their titles, and whether they

29
were permanent, probationary, or temporary staff; (2) how many
permanent, probationary, and temporary positions remain filled
and in which refuge units or complexes they serve, their titles, and
whether they are permanent, probationary, or temporary staff; and
(3) which Refuge System units or complexes have two or fewer
staffers, what the filled positions at those refuges are, and if those
staff are permanent, probationary or temporary.
Within the funding recommended for National Wildlife Refuge
System, the Committee encourages the Service to prioritize hiring
and retention of FTEs particularly to fill longstanding vacancies in
the refuge system such as at the Northern Maine Wildlife Refuge
Complex and Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge
Complex.
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee encour-
ages the Service to contribute funding aligned with commitments
established in the 2018 license agreement with the South Florida
Water Management District towards the management of invasive
plant infestations, including Old World Climbing Fern, which
threaten the value of this resource, ongoing Everglades restoration
efforts, the provision of critical wildlife habitat, and the enjoyment
of the public.
Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex.—The
Committee supports the Service’s collaboration with non-Federal
partners to develop and implement the Blackwater 2100 ‘‘A Strat-
egy for Salt Marsh Persistence in an Era of Climate Change.’’ The
plan seeks to restore and protect 800–1,000 acres of marsh, which
is one-fifth of tidal marsh losses since the 1930’s, using thin layer
placement, living shorelines, invasive species control, research, and
other management strategies to enhance climate change resiliency
and protect communities.
John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee sup-
ports the salt marsh restoration work in the John H. Chafee Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge to enhance salt marsh resiliency with native
plantings and through improved drainage and tidal flushing. Fur-
thermore, the Committee directs the Service to prioritize these on-
going efforts.
Community Safety.—The Committee is aware of significant con-
cerns among residents in Kaktovik, Alaska, related to the Service’s
program for polar bear viewing. While tourism has increased sig-
nificantly in recent years, the Committee has received reports of
bears becoming less fearful of humans as a result of tourism, lead-
ing to more human encounters with bears within the village. In ad-
dition, tourism has reportedly made it more difficult for local resi-
dents to travel to and from Kaktovik, given the limited availability
of air service. The Committee instructs the Service to review its
program for polar bear tourism, consult and incorporate the views
of Kaktovik residents in its decisions related to the program, and
explore cooperative management of the Beaufort polar bear popu-
lation with Native peoples in the village.
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee di-
rects the Service to continue to follow the directive from previous
fiscal years that prohibits a caribou hunt on Kagalaska Island and
efforts to remove cattle on Chirikof and Wosnesenski Islands in the
State of Alaska.

30
Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.—The Committee is aware that
the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge has identified 2,500 acres of
forested habitat impacted by spruce bark beetles, currently ready
for treatment, several acres of which are adjacent to existing roads,
facilities, campgrounds, trails and other high use recreation sites.
In an effort to protect the refuge and surrounding communities, the
Committee encourages the Service to treat the 2,500 high priority
acres ready for treatment within the funds provided. These treat-
ments would meet multiple objectives by removing beetle-killed
trees and reducing risk to the public, employees and infrastructure,
while reducing accumulations of hazardous fuels.
Good Neighbor Agreements.—The Committee notes that forest
ecosystems in the National Wildlife Refuge System are susceptible
to elevated wildfire risk, drought, and insect and disease infesta-
tion much like forestland under the administrative jurisdiction of
other Federal land management agencies. The Committee recog-
nizes that the environmental stewardship of national wildlife ref-
uges and adjacent non-Federal lands would benefit if the Service
offered cross-boundary fuels reduction projects to neighboring
State, local, and Tribal governments similar to those issued by the
Bureau of Land Management and the USDA Forest Service under
Good Neighbor Agreements [GNA]. Thus, the recommendation in-
cludes the authority for this work in section 442.
Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Service to update commitments and funding
contributions established in its 2016 agreement with neighboring
landowners for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife,
and their habitats at Palmyra Atoll. The Committee supports con-
tinuing these efforts, particularly the management of invasive spe-
cies, climate change threats, ongoing native forest restoration ef-
forts, the provision of critical wildlife habitat, and the benefit of the
public.
Conservation and Enforcement.—The Committee recommends
$173,132,000 for Conservation and Enforcement.
The recommendation includes $3,500,000 for the Service’s work
with the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to combat trafficking of
counterfeit arts and crafts, and to conduct criminal investigations
of alleged violations of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (Public Law
101–644). Further, the Service is directed to provide the Committee
a briefing on this work not later than 90 days following enactment
of this act.
ePermits Operations.—The Committee does not support the cre-
ation of a new subactivity by transferring funding to the Inter-
national Affairs program at this time.
Big Cats Public Safety Act Enforcement.—The Committee is
aware of the Service’s additional responsibilities pursuant to the
enactment of Public Law 117–243. The Committee would like to en-
sure that the Service has adequate resources to implement and en-
force this act. The Committee encourages the Service to collaborate
with United States Department of Agriculture and the Department
of Justice and reminds the Service of the directive to report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on staffing, im-
plementation, enforcement status, and additional funding needs re-
lated to Public Law 117–243.

31
Wildlife Trafficking.—The Service plays a critical role in the on-
going effort to combat the global crisis of wildlife poaching and traf-
ficking, which escalates the risk of animal-to-human disease trans-
mission and human-wildlife conflict and is driven by demand for
high-value illegal wildlife products, facilitated by sophisticated
criminal networks profiting from this multi-billion dollar black
market industry. Poaching of rhinoceros, pangolin, loris, and ele-
phants has reached unprecedented levels, and illegal trade is un-
dermining the conservation of scores of other species. The Com-
mittee continues to support government-wide efforts to combat
wildlife trafficking. The Committee maintains resources that will
support the Service in continuing to strengthen its forensic capa-
bilities to disrupt smuggling networks; improve collaboration with
other Federal, State, local, and foreign governments; and promote
international wildlife conservation. The Committee remains con-
cerned about the global health risk from wildlife to human disease
transmission, particularly in light of recent national health emer-
gencies.
International Affairs.—The Committee recommends $28,593,000
for International Affairs. Long-term success for conserving wildlife
and wild places relies on building the capacity in countries for
managing their own protected areas and species, including among
Indigenous Peoples and communities. Within the amount rec-
ommended, the Committee encourages the Service to support
projects that foster partnerships with universities or other institu-
tions that are educating the current and next generations of con-
servationists.
Migratory Bird Management.—The Committee recommends
$52,680,000 for migratory bird management, which includes
$29,868,000 for Conservation and Monitoring, $16,821,000 for the
North American Waterfowl Management Plan activities, and
$591,000 for the Federal Duck Stamp Program.
Incidental Take for Migratory Birds.—The Committee is con-
cerned with the decline of North American bird species, including
the 1,093 species of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Trea-
ty Act [MBTA] that are experiencing population decreases due to
a variety of threats. The Committee supports the Service’s work to
establish an incidental take authorization program within the per-
mitting program for the MBTA.
Pacific Flyway.—The Committee is concerned about avian bio-
diversity and habitat in the Pacific Flyway. Several species within
the flyway are experiencing severe declines and small populations
and are at risk of extirpation, particularly at the critical stop over
points. The Committee supports science-based research and deci-
sion-making on habitat requirements, regional movements, and
population connectivity that will guide management and conserva-
tion of these species and their habitats in the Pacific Flyway.
Theodore Roosevelt National Wildlife Refuge Complex.—The Mat-
hews Brake and Yazoo National Wildlife Refuges within the Com-
plex were established to provide habitat for wintering waterfowl
and resident wildlife. The Committee is concerned these important
refuges no longer meet their intended purpose due to lack of ade-
quate management and invasive aquatic plants, such as water hya-
cinth. Within available funds, the Committee directs the Service to

32
implement measures to restore enhance, and better manage habi-
tat for waterfowl and wildlife on the refuges, and urges the Service
to partner with local landowners and nonprofit conservation orga-
nizations to meet this objective.
Habitat Improvements for Nesting Migratory Waterfowl.—The
Committee is concerned with the declining production of breeding
ducks. The Committee emphasizes that outdoor recreation contrib-
utes billions to the U.S. economy annually, and that participation
is closely linked to opportunity, and opportunity is linked to robust
populations. Research has recently show that hen houses and other
nesting habitat improvements in areas of high breeding duck den-
sities can yield significant gains in nest success and other vital
rates. Therefore, the Committee directs the Service to report to the
Committee no later than 180 days of enactment of this act on the
efforts the Service is implementing to partner with non-profit con-
servation organizations to support the construction and installation
of hen houses and the development of breeding habitat in the Prai-
rie Pothole Region and the Pacific Flyway.
Fish and Aquatic Conservation.—The Committee recommends
$220,310,000 for Fish and Aquatic Conservation. The Committee
encourages the Service to include adequate support for mitigation
activities at National Fish Hatcheries in future budget submis-
sions. Additionally, funds are maintained for the improvements to
aquatic habitat through the removal of locks and dams. The rec-
ommendation includes $4,750,000 for Klamath Restoration, an in-
crease of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level, and in-
cludes $10,750,000 for Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement ac-
tivities, an increase of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level. Further, $5,000,000 is recommended for implementation of
the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The Service is directed to work in co-
operation with State fish and game agencies. This includes funding
for anadromous salmonids for implementation of the Yukon River
Salmon Agreement.
National Fish Habitat Program.—The Committee understands
that the Service has worked to reduce administrative costs in the
National Fish Habitat program and encourages the Service to seek
to reduce these costs further to make additional funding available
to projects recommended and submitted by the National Fish Habi-
tat Board for approval by the Secretary.
National Fish Hatchery System Operations.—The Committee rec-
ommends $73,603,000 for National Fish Hatchery System Oper-
ations. The Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership is rec-
ommended at $1,200,000. Funding in the amount of $8,000,000 is
recommended for the Warm Springs Fish Health Center [FHC]
which provides disease diagnosis, biosecurity and disease manage-
ment, disease treatment and prevention, fish health inspection
services for Federal, State, and Tribal hatcheries responsible for
production of salmonids and warm water species for recovery, res-
toration, and recreational fisheries, and inspections and certifi-
cations for the National Triploid Grass Carp Program. Additional
funding is recommended to develop environmental DNA tools to
forecast and detect aquatic invasive species, aquatic nuisance spe-
cies, aquatic pathogens, and rare species for Federal, State, and
Tribal hatcheries.

33
Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Restoration Infrastructure Im-
provements.—The salmon and steelhead hatcheries, adult fish
traps, and juvenile release facilities along the lower Snake River
and in the Columbia River Basin are facing immediate and signifi-
cant infrastructure improvement needs due to aging critical infra-
structure including pipelines, generators, and rearing units. While
this is not the responsibility of the Service alone, the Committee
believes the water development agencies should be contributing
more to protect threatened and endangered species. Multiple part-
ners are necessary to fully address mitigation activities in the
basin, therefore the Committee directs the Service to continue dia-
logue with the multiple partners involved to come to a viable solu-
tion in fiscal year 2026. In the meantime, the Committee directs
the Service to assist States and Tribes with accelerating critical
capital and maintenance projects to improve salmon and steelhead
facilities on the lower Snake River and Columbia River basin, and
the Committee recommends $6,000,000 within National Fish
Hatchery Operations for these efforts.
6PPD.—The Committee is concerned with the impact of 6p-phen-
ylene-diameine (6PPD] and its transformant, 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-
q), on aquatic ecosystems. Stormwater runoff containing 6PPD-q
has already been linked to mass die-offs of endangered and threat-
ened fish species across the Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay
watersheds. The Committee supports the Service’s work to better
understand the impacts of 6PPD and 6PPD-q on aquatic species in
freshwater environments. The Committee directs the Service to
continue coordinating across Federal and State agencies on 6PPD
research and management and to continue to work across agencies
on robust government-to-government consultation with impacted
Tribes. The Service is directed to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee within 90 days of enactment of this act on its 6PPD-related
activities, including the Service’s current strategy, an overview of
research work completed to date, a plan for addressing potential
data gaps, recommendations for future research activities, and po-
tential funding sources.
Maintenance and Equipment.—The Committee recommends
$20,119,000 for maintenance and equipment expenses related to
the National Fish Hatchery System. A portion of the funding rec-
ommended for National Fish Hatchery Maintenance and Equip-
ment shall be allocated to hatcheries where partner agencies fund
mitigation work.
Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation.—The Committee rec-
ommends $126,588,000 for aquatic habitat and species conserva-
tion. Within aquatic habitat and species conservation, funding is
recommendation as follows:
—Habitat Assessment and Restoration.—The Committee rec-
ommends $47,832,000 for habitat assessment and restoration
activities. Funding is recommended in the amount of
$11,500,000 for activities associated with the Delaware River
Basin Conservation Act (Public Law 114–322). The Service is
encouraged to support the Delaware River Basin Restoration
Program’s existing, successful practice of allowing cash or in-
kind contributions of services or materials to be used for the
non-Department of the Interior share of the cost of a project

34
funded under the grant program. The recommendation also in-
cludes $15,000,000 for fish passage improvements. Within the
recommended funding, the recommendation includes an addi-
tional $1,000,000 for the Service to comply with the instruc-
tions and requirements in the explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023, regarding implementation of the Fisheries Restora-
tion and Irrigation Mitigation Act [FRIMA] (Public Law 106–
502).
—Population Assessment and Cooperative Management.—
The Committee recommends $26,613,000 for population assess-
ment and cooperative management activities. Great Lakes Fish
and Wildlife Restoration Grants are recommended at
$3,000,000. The program supports critical work to restore
Great Lakes fisheries and inform management decisions
through sound science. This includes the Great Lakes Mass
Marking Program, which is essential to assessing hatchery
production and supporting a robust fishery. Within funds rec-
ommended, the Service is encouraged to support these impor-
tant efforts. The recommendation includes $818,000 for the
Lake Champlain sea lamprey program.
The Committee remains concerned by the decline of Amer-
ican shad in coastal rivers and encourages the Service to col-
laborate with academic research institutions to research, mon-
itor, conserve, and restore other anadromous fish, in close col-
laboration with State, Tribal, and local governments.
The Committee directs the Service to continue working with
public and private partners on fish passage and monitoring
technologies, including initiatives related to fish identification
and monitoring, and others, to improve conservation outcomes.
The Committee directs the Service to submit to the committees
a report outlining how existing funding may be used to im-
prove fish population sustainment or recovery.
—Aquatic Invasive Species.—The Committee recommends
$52,143,000 for aquatic invasive species activities, an increase
of $3,500,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Within
these funds, $5,038,000 is recommended to implement section
5(d)(2) of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (Public Law 106–
506). The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for research on
hydrilla, eel, and milfoil invasive grasses.
Lake Tahoe Lahontan Cutthroat Recovery Program.—For over 25
years, the Tahoe Basin Restoration work has been a collaborative
effort, this partnership manifested into the Lake Tahoe Environ-
mental Improvement Program [EIP] in 1997 and was reauthorized
in the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act in 2016. The Committee sup-
ports these collaborative efforts that leverage Federal dollars and
support regional economies while at the same restoring habitats,
improving tributaries, and removing invasive species. The Service
is directed to report to the Committee within 180 days of enact-
ment of this act on how this ongoing work is going to support the
recovery of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout as authorized in section
5(4), of Public Law 106–506.
Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission.—The Committee
recommends $700,000 for the Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon

35
Compact, as authorized in Public Law 98–138, for research, moni-
toring, conservation, and habitat restoration work related to this
high-priority watershed. The Committee directs that the Secretary
undertake a special resource study of the National significance of,
and the suitability and feasibility of carrying out a basin-scale,
nonregulatory program of conservation, stewardship, and enhance-
ment of habitat for fish and wildlife in Connecticut River basin.
Non-Intrusive Zebra Mussel Elimination.—The Committee rec-
ommends $3,500,000 for zebra mussel eradication. The Committee
is aware of the environmental and economic threat posed by
invasive quagga and zebra mussels.
Invasive Carp.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
work conducted by the Service to combat the serious threat of
invasive carp and recommends $28,000,000 for invasive carp activi-
ties, an increase of $1,000,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
Overall, this funding is aimed at protecting and enhancing activi-
ties in the Great Lakes to prevent invasive carp from entering and
establishing in the Great Lakes. Funding recommended should also
be used to control invasive carp in the Mississippi River and its
Sub-basins, including the Upper Mississippi River Sub-basin; Mis-
souri River Sub-basin; Arkansas-Red-White River Sub-basin; Lower
Mississippi River Sub-basin; Tennessee Cumberland Sub-basin;
and Ohio River Sub-basin, including in Kentucky Lake, Lake Bar-
kley, and the Ohio River. The Service should consider the utility
of creating a dedicated funding source to increase the intensity and
geographic scope of efforts to prevent entry into the Great Lakes
and control in areas where invasive carp are currently located. The
Service is directed to continue to work with those States with exist-
ing cooperative agreements, including non-profits, to develop and
implement innovative solutions to reduce invasive carp popu-
lations.
The Committee encourages the Service to focus on invasive spe-
cies removal as it relates to the eradication efforts for invasive
Carp. While the Committee recognizes the importance of studying
and understanding invasive carp patterns, the Service is encour-
aged to take action on a strategy that increases the focus on bio-
mass removal.
Additionally, $3,334,000 is recommended for implementation of
State Aquatic Nuisance Species management plans to help control
the spread of invasive carp, an increase of $500,000 to the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level.
Invasive Species Competitive Grants.—The Committee is aware
that work is ongoing in several regions to address the threats
posed by aquatic invasive species and directs the Service to con-
tinue to make available competitive grant funding for projects to
eliminate these destructive, non-native species. Further, the Com-
mittee directs the Service to expeditiously award these grants.
Prioritization of Combatting Invasive Plant and Animal Spe-
cies.—Invasive plant and animal species are a pervasive problem
affecting communities across the Nation. Invasives, such as the
carp, European Green Crab, nutria, quagga and zebra mussels, em-
erald ash borer, Eurasian milfoil, elodea, and the Hemlock Woolly
Adelgid threaten our natural resources and wreak havoc on the
communities and industries that rely upon them. Preventing

36
invasive species from gaining a foothold in our communities and
suppressing established species is of utmost importance. The Com-
mittee makes several increases to programs designed to combat
invasive species before and after they become a problem. The Com-
mittee encourages the Service to support research, monitoring,
mitigation, and outreach efforts in all regions.
Quagga Mussel.—The Committee recognizes the potential threat
of invasive quagga mussels in the Pacific Northwest and directs the
Service to brief the Committee no later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this act on detection, control and prevention efforts of
Quagga Mussel in the Columbia River Basin as well as coordina-
tion on these efforts with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
their Watercraft Inspection Program.
Science Support.—The Committee recommends $32,793,000 for
Science Support
Science Partnerships.—The Committee recommends $24,031,000
for Science Partnerships. Of which, an increase of $1,000,000 is
recommended for continued work for monarch conservation activi-
ties through the Center for Pollinator Conservation.
Chesapeake WILD Grant Program.—The recommendation for
Science Partnerships includes $8,000,000 for the Chesapeake
WILD grant program.
Service Science.—The Committee recommends $8,762,000 for the
Service Science programs. Within Service Science, $3,500,000 is
recommended for White-Nose Syndrome research.
The Committee recognizes that snow machines are used for ac-
cess and for subsistence purposes in the winter over frozen water-
ways in rural Alaskan communities and directs the Service to brief
the Committee within 90 days of enacted regarding the Service’s
policy for snow machine access over waterways that are frozen in
the winter in National Wildlife Refuge areas within Alaska.
Stewardship Priorities.—The Committee recommends
$19,115,000 in congressionally directed spending for stewardship
projects to further conservation goals. Further detail on these
projects is provided in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending’’ accompanying this report.
General Operations.—The Committee recommends $138,211,000
for General Operations, including $41,275,000 for Servicewide Bill
Paying; $24,657,000 for Central Office Operations; and $36,983,000
for Management and Administration. The recommendation includes
$5,500,000 for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and rec-
ommends $26,500,000 for the National Conservation Training Cen-
ter. Continued funding is recommended for the Native Coordination
Office at the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.

equipment damaged or destroyed by storms, floods, fires, and simi-
lar unanticipated events.
Line Item Construction Projects [CDS].—The Committee rec-
ommends $1,000,000 in congressionally directed spending for Line

ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The bill continues several administrative provisions from pre-
vious fiscal years.
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
Since the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, the Na-
tional Park System has grown to encompass 433 sites spanning
more than 85 million acres in all 50 States, the District of Colum-
bia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The
National Park Service [Service], created in 1916, is charged with
preserving these sites ‘‘unimpaired for the enjoyment of future gen-
erations.’’ The Service and its employees also contribute to the pro-
tection of other historical, cultural, and recreational resources
through a variety of grant and technical assistance programs. More
than 330 million people visit National Park units each year.
Since the enactment of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public
Law 116–152) [GAOA], the Service has had an unprecedented op-
portunity to make investments into addressing backlog mainte-
nance of critical park infrastructure. The Legacy Restoration Fund,
as authorized in GAOA, expired in fiscal year 2025. The Committee
looks forward to the prompt reauthorization of the Legacy Restora-
tion Fund to continue to address the deferred maintenance backlog
needs on our public lands and further invest in our National treas-
ures.
The Committee recommends a total of $3,270,057,000 for the Na-
tional Park Service.
OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,894,424,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,869,424,000
The Committee recommends $2,869,424,000 for the operation of
the National Park System.
The recommendation provides funding for base operations, spe-
cifically for the purpose of maintaining operations and access to
Service units and sites. Offsets are taken from non-base project ac-
counts.
Additional program changes are in the table that accompanies
the Committee report.
Resource Stewardship.—The Committee recommends
$398,820,000 for resource stewardship. Within the Resource Stew-
ardship program, $2,000,000 is provided to address active forest
management at national parks, $6,500,000 is provided to address
quagga and zebra mussels, $800,000 is provided for Cave and
Karst Ecosystem Research, and $400,000 is provided to fund Alas-
ka subsistence activities. Funding for the partnership wild and sce-
nic river program is provided $5,648,000.
Visitor Services.—The Committee recommends $279,535,000 for
visitor services. The recommendation includes funding for the Na-
tional Capital Performing Arts program at the enacted level. The
recommendation also includes no less than $2,400,000 for efforts to
expand recreational fishing, camping, and instruction focusing on
introductory recreation experiences in parks throughout the year in

40
a variety of recreational activities such as paddling, climbing, hik-
ing, cycling, snowshoeing, and surfing. The recommendation pro-
vides the enacted level for funding volunteers in parks programs,
interpretation and education programs, and youth partnership pro-
grams. The recommendation also provides not less than the en-
acted level for the Indian Youth Service Corps.
Park Protection.—The Committee recommends $430,176,000 for
park protection. Within the amounts provided, the Committee rec-
ommends $950,000 for veterans’ fire corps.
Mount Rushmore National Memorial Law Enforcement.—The
Committee is concerned about law enforcement staffing levels at
Mount Rushmore National Memorial and notes the need for addi-
tional full-time law enforcement officers to enhance visitor safety,
protect the monument, and effectively manage increased visitation.
The Committee encourages the National Park Service to prioritize
funding for these additional law enforcement positions within
available resources. The Committee also requests that the Service
provide a briefing to the Committee about law enforcement staffing
needs within 90 days.
Facility Operations and Maintenance.—The Committee rec-
ommends $914,164,000 for facility operations and maintenance.
The Committee recognizes the importance of investing in maintain-
ing park infrastructure and preventing future backlogs and there-
fore recommends $188,184,000 for cyclic maintenance, equal to the
enacted level, and $110,980,000 for repair and rehabilitation
projects.
Park Support.—The Committee recommends $651,517,000 for
park support. The Committee recommends $15,000,000 in match-
ing program funds for the National Park Foundation within the
Operation of the National Park System.
Cumberland Island National Seashore.—The Committee urges
the Service to prioritize staffing at Cumberland Island National
Seashore so that the Service can continue to maintain facilities,
law enforcement capacity, and natural and cultural resources.
External Administrative Costs.—The Committee recommends
$195,212,000 for external administrative costs, and encourages the
National Park Service to consistently and effectively recoup all po-
tential reimbursements. The funding level reflects the Service’s in-
tention to expand the use of these recoupments and will not have
any impact on Service operations.
NPS Staffing.—While national parks generate billions of dollars
of economic output annually for the U.S. economy that helps boost
States, localities, and tribes, visiting a national park is often a
‘‘bucket list’’ adventure or a once in a lifetime opportunity for some.
The Committee is concerned about actions that could potentially
lessen Americans’ ability to visit parks or have a safe experience
while visiting parks, and that otherwise could depreciate the value
of time spent exploring some of America’s great natural wonders.
Within 60 days of enactment of this act, and monthly thereafter,
the Department and the Service are directed to brief the Com-
mittee on park operations, to include staffing levels by park, visitor
data by park, and other data necessary to convince the Committee
that operations and natural and cultural resource protection have

41
not been and will not be deleteriously affected in an effort to make
parks operate more efficiently.
Adaptive Recreation Equipment.—The Committee supports the
Service’s work in expanding accessible options for outdoor recre-
ation, including through partnerships with external organizations
to ensure that adaptive recreation equipment is available for use
by visitors with disabilities. The Committee encourages the Service
to prioritize ways to provide more opportunities for more visitors
to explore more areas of the outdoors.
Appalachian National Scenic Trail.—The Appalachian National
Scenic Trail is a 2,190-mile linear park stretching through 14
States and 88 counties, more than any other unit of the National
Park System. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail draws visitors
from all over the United States and the world, bolstering the econ-
omy of the communities along the trail. The Committee is aware
that the Trail is experiencing increased visitation and encourages
the Service to include sufficient resources in future budget requests
to meet its expanded visitor services, law enforcement, compliance,
and land acquisition requirements.
Beaver Conservation.—The Committee encourages the Service to
prioritize restoration of current and historic riparian areas in ways
that support beaver populations, use infrastructure that is beaver
friendly, allow for beavers to construct dams and otherwise influ-
ence water flow in lieu of hard infrastructure where appropriate,
and is mindful of the ways in which beavers can influence a land-
scape.
Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.—The Service is
directed to prioritize activities that will advance development of the
Park, including the acquisition of key sites as outlined in the law
and restoration of historic sites. The Committee believes the acqui-
sition of Slater Mill’s historic dam will contribute positively to the
cultural, natural, and recreational resource base of the Park. The
Service shall brief the Committee on its plan to fulfill this directive
within 60 days of enactment of this act.
Chesapeake Bay Office.—The National Park Service Chesapeake
Bay office carries out activities and responsibilities related to ex-
panding public access to the Bay and serves as the lead agency on
several multi-State and Federal goals as a part of the 2014 Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed Agreement. The Committee supports oper-
ational funding for the Chesapeake Bay Office in order to meet the
goals established by the Bay Watershed Agreement.
Chilkoot Trail.—The Service is expected to continue to keep the
Committee apprised of administrative barriers to completing the
full length of the Chilkoot Trail in Klondike Gold Rush National
Historical Park and efforts to restore full public access to this trail
along the U.S.-Canada Border.
Dark Skies and Natural Sounds Data.—The Committee directs
the National Park Service to maintain and properly store Dark
Skies and Natural Sounds Data, which is used to support every na-
tional park in the country to minimize light and noise pollution
both for the visitor experience and impacts on wildlife. If the Serv-
ice is unable to continue this critical work, the Committee directs
the National Park Service to transfer the Dark Skies and Natural
Sounds Data to another Federal agency.

42
Denali.—The Committee recognizes the mountain located at 6
63°04’12N, by 151°00’18W, in the State of Alaska, as Denali and
includes a provision in the bill that prohibits the use of funds for
the purposes of naming the mountain anything other than Denali.
Director’s Order 21.—The Committee expects the Service to con-
tinue to implement Director’s Order 21.
National Lakeshores.—The Committee appreciates the Service’s
allocation of partial funding for improving trails in freshwater Na-
tional Lakeshores, including for ADA accessibility. The Committee
encourages the Service to, dependent on available funding,
prioritize completing funding for the project once the full cost is
known and construction documents are complete. The Service is di-
rected to keep the Committee updated on developments related to
this project.
New Philadelphia National Historic Site.—The Committee di-
rects the Service to ensure that park operations begin in a reason-
able timeframe and to keep the Committee apprised of develop-
ments related to the site.
Newly-Designated National Scenic Trails.—The Committee notes
the designation of three new national scenic trails as units of the
park system, including the Ice Age, the New England, and the
North Country National Scenic Trails. The Committee notes that
the Service has incorporated ongoing funding for these newly des-
ignated trails into the Service’s base operations budget and directs
the Service to ensure that commensurate access to resources is pro-
vided to them.
Roosevelt-Campobello International Park Commission.—Funding
for the Roosevelt Campobello International Park is provided as re-
quested. The Service is directed to continue to follow the direction
contained in the statement of managers accompanying the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114–113) concerning
the submission of future budget requests for the Roosevelt-Campo-
bello International Park.
Springfield Race Riot.—The Committee directs the National Park
Service to work with the community to complete the Foundation
Document for the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National Monument.
The Committee also directs NPS to keep the Committee informed
on the progress being made at the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Na-
tional Monument with quarterly reports beginning 90 days after
enactment.
Theodore Roosevelt National Park.—The Committee notes the
Service’s decision to terminate the Livestock Plan Environmental
Assessment and appreciates the decision to continue maintaining a
genetically diverse herd of horses in the park commensurate with
the historic herds during the period when President Theodore Roo-
sevelt was a rancher in the area. The Committee supports the long-
term genetic viability of the herd and directs the Service to com-
plete a full Population Viability Analysis [PVA] of the herd and
brief the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.—The Committee en-
courages the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park
Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to work with the Theo-
dore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation to support loans of
historic, educational, artistic, natural and other museum collec-

43
tions, particularly those not on display to the public. The loans
should be consistent with existing law and policy, including such
terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary for the
preservation and exhibition of such collections.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $89,593,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 91,596,000
The Committee recommends $91,596,000 for national recreation
and preservation programs.
Natural Programs.—The Committee recommends $18,579,000 for
natural programs.
Cultural Programs.—The Committee recommends $39,327,000
for cultural programs. The Committee recognizes the importance of
supporting Native culture and arts development, which contributes
to maintaining the cultural diversity of the Nation and the cultural
survival of the regional indigenous populations. The Committee is
concerned with the reduction of mission-critical staff for Cultural
Programs at the Service and encourages the office to achieve staff-
ing levels that will allow it to provide robust technical assistance
and oversight for cultural program activities.
Funding is also recommended for grants to nonprofit organiza-
tions or institutions for the purpose of supporting programs for Na-
tive Hawaiian or Alaska Native culture and arts development at a
total program level of $2,750,000. Native American Graves Protec-
tion and Repatriation Act (Public Law 101–601) grants are pro-
vided $3,407,000, grants to preserve and interpret Japanese Amer-
ican Confinement Sites as authorized by the Norman K. Mineta
Japanese American Confinement Education Act are provided
$4,655,000, grants administration is provided $3,597,000, and other
cultural programs are funded at the enacted level.
9/11 Memorial Competitive Grant Program.—The Committee
recommends $4,000,000 for the competitive grant program author-
ized by the 9/11 Memorial Act (Public Law 115–413).
Heritage Partnership Programs.—The Committee recommends
$30,985,000 for heritage partnership programs. This level of fund-
ing provides $29,919,500 for grants to national heritage areas and
$1,065,000 to administer the program. The Committee rec-

44
ommendation increases funding to reflect newly designated herit-
age areas; and merges funding for the existing Blackstone River
Valley National Heritage Corridor into the program at the prior
funding level within the Heritage Partnership Program.
Each National Heritage Area has been designated by Congress in
law for its unique and nationally significant qualities and re-
sources. The Committee reminds the Service of the critical impor-
tance of providing Federal funds under the National Heritage Area
Act to National Heritage Areas in a timely manner to avoid any
undue impacts on the operations and activities of National Herit-
age Areas.
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
Grants.—The Committee recommends $3,407,000 for Native Amer-
ican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act grants. The Com-
mittee finds that the Service must work to maximize the impact of
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
[NAGPRA] grants to expedite and assist federally recognized
Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, museums, institutions
of higher education, and other affected entities in achieving compli-
ance with the implementing regulations that went into effect on
January 12, 2024 (43 CFR 10). The Committee notes that more
than 400 museums nationwide are now working under a tight
timeline to meet existing requirements to update inventories under
the new rule and that annual compliance estimates are in at least
the tens of millions of dollars. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to consider raising the ceiling on the maximum NAGPRA
grant amount to support expeditious disposition of the maximum
number of human remains and funerary, sacred, and patrimonial
objects.
Not later than 30 days after enactment of this act, and monthly
thereafter, the National Park Service shall provide a detailed re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate detailing any and all funding allo-
cated, committed, transferred, reprogrammed, or otherwise shifted
or set aside for the planning or procurement of statues or other ac-
tivities as described in Executive Order 13934 (85 Fed. Reg. 41165;
relating to building and rebuilding monuments to American he-
roes), Executive Order 13978 (86 Fed. Reg. 6809; relating to build-
ing the National Garden of American Heroes), and Executive Order
14189 (90 Fed. Reg. 8849; relating to celebrating America’s birth-
day), including the accounts, agencies, or offices originally holding
such funds, the authorities cited for allocating, committing, trans-
ferring, reprogramming, or otherwise shifting or setting aside such
funding, the accounts, agencies, or offices currently managing such
funds, and any obligations and expenditures made of such funds.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $168,900,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 168,246,000
The Committee recommends $168,246,000 for the Historic Pres-
ervation Fund [HPF]. Program changes are in the comprehensive
table that accompanies the Committee report.
The Committee recommendation provides $62,150,000 for grants-
in-aid to States and territories and $23,750,000 for grants-in-aid to
Tribes to reflect an increase in Tribal Historic Preservation Officers
[THPO] and to maintain fiscal year 2024 enacted funding for each
existing THPO. The recommendation also provides $11,000,000 for
preservation grants for Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities; $5,000,000 for History of Equal Rights grants; and
$1,250,000 in grants for underrepresented communities. The Com-
mittee also reminds the Service of the critical importance of pro-
viding Federal funds under HPF to States and Tribes in a timely
manner to avoid any undue impacts on State Historic Preservation
Officers and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers that could slow
survey, evaluation, and nomination processes for the National Reg-
ister and create unnecessary delays for infrastructure and other
projects by hindering the Section 106 process under the National
Historic Preservation Act. Therefore, the Service is directed by 120
days after enactment of this act to award the funds under HPF.
The Committee is concerned with the reduction of mission-crit-
ical staff for cultural programs at the Service and encourages the
fund to achieve staffing levels that will allow it to provide robust
technical assistance and oversight for cultural program activities.
African American Civil Rights Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommends $24,000,000 for African American Civil Rights grants.
The program documents, interprets, and preserves sites and stories
related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights as
citizens.
Save America’s Treasures.—The Save America’s Treasures pro-
gram is provided $25,500,000. The Committee supports this pro-
gram because of its important role in providing preservation and
conservation assistance to nationally significant historical prop-
erties and collections.
Historic Preservation Fund Projects.—The Committee rec-
ommends $15,596,000 in congressionally directed spending for his-

47
toric preservation projects, each of which the Committee has con-
firmed is listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a
National Historic Landmark pursuant to the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.).
CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $172,255,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 140,791,000
The Committee recommends $140,791,000 for construction re-
quirements for the National park system. As noted previously, the
Committee looks forward to the prompt reauthorization of the Leg-
acy Restoration Fund to continue to address the deferred mainte-
nance backlog needs on our public lands.
Within the funds provided in this bill, $55,520,000 is provided for
line item construction and maintenance. Requests for reprogram-
ming will be considered pursuant to the guidelines in the front of
this report.
The Committee has not received the detailed budget justification
for the National Park Service for fiscal year 2026, which the Com-
mittee expects will follow longstanding practice to include a project
and funding list along with detailed project data sheets for line
item construction projects that will be ready for construction and
recommended for fiscal year 2026 funding.
When the Committee receives this updated list, the Committee
intends to specify each line item construction project in a final, full-
year funding bill, consistent with longstanding practice.
The Committee recommends a total of $3,848,000 in funding for
emergency and unscheduled projects within base funding. These
funds support the Service in responding after facilities and re-
sources are damaged or destroyed in emergencies.
Denali National Park Road.—The Committee recognizes the
Service is continuing to make progress on restoring access to
Kantishna following the Pretty Rocks landslide damage and appre-
ciates that the Service continues to ensure the project has the re-
sources necessary to ensure completion without delay. This in-
cludes planning and resource allocation to address road damage
and deferred maintenance along the transportation corridor from
milepost 43 to milepost 92. The Service is encouraged to perform
preliminary surveys of this road area and to develop a plan to
promptly address road maintenance needs upon completion of the
bridge at Polychrome Pass.
Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.—The Committee supports
the ongoing efforts to develop the Fort Vancouver National Historic
Site for long-term usage. The building and grounds restoration pro-
vides the benefits of preserving a historic site, providing leased
space for the use of Federal and other entities, and improving the
Site for the enjoyment of the public. Further, the Committee notes
that Tribes have had a strong presence in this area since time im-
memorial. The Service is reminded of their responsibility to give
consideration to Tribal proposals, recommendations, and knowledge
that affect management decisions on a Tribe’s former homelands.
The Service is directed to consult with any Tribes within 20 miles
of Fort Vancouver and incorporate feedback during the production
of any Traditional Use Studies. Further, the Committee directs the

48
Service to evaluate co-stewardship of the Fort Vancouver National
Historic Site with any Tribes located within 20 miles. Within 90
days after the enactment of this act, the Service shall provide a re-
port to the Committee on Tribal consultation efforts, progress made
towards rehabilitation, and specific, actionable plans for the next
phase of rehabilitation and expanded use at the site.
Hurricane Ridge Day Lodge.—The Committee recognizes the im-
mense historical and recreational loss of the Hurricane Ridge Day
Lodge due to a fire in 2023. The lodge welcomed 300,000 visitors
every year and provided important facilities for Olympic National
Park staff. The Committee notes that emergency funding has been
provided to rebuild the lodge, including temporary facilities to
maintain visitor and staff safety during construction due to harsh
conditions at the site and high volume of visitors. The Service’s
prior estimate for the project was approximately $80,000,000. The
Committee urges the Service to prioritize reconstruction of this
center and directs the Service to engage with impacted commu-
nities on the Olympic Peninsula, provide robust outreach to those
communities, and continue keeping the Committee informed of con-
struction timelines.

U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Established in 1879, the U.S. Geological Survey [the Survey]
serves as the Earth and natural science research bureau for the
Department of the Interior and isthe only integrated natural re-
sources research bureau in the Federal Government. The Survey
conducts research, monitoring, and assessments to contribute to
understanding America’s lands, water, and biological resources. Its
research and data products support the Department’s resource and
land management needs and also provide the water, biological, en-
ergy, and mineral resources information needed by other Federal,
State, Tribal, and local government agencies to guide planning,
management, and regulatory programs. Scientists, technicians, and
support staff of the Survey are located in nearly 400 offices in
every State and in several foreign countries throughout the world.
The Survey leverages its resources and expertise in partnership
with more than 2,000 agencies of Federal, State, local, and Tribal
governments; the academic community; nongovernmental organiza-
tions; and the private sector.

6PPD.—The Committee is concerned with the impact that 6p-
phenylene-diameine [6PPD] and its transformant, 6PPD-quinone
[6PPD-q], are having on aquatic ecosystems. Stormwater runoff
containing 6PPD-q has been linked to mass die-offs of endangered
and threatened salmon across the Puget Sound and San Francisco
Bay areas. The Committee supports the Survey’s research on the
fate and transport of tire-wear particles, along with how 6PPD and
6PPD-q impact aquatic species in both marine and freshwater envi-
ronments. The Committee directs the Survey to continue coordi-
nating across Federal and State agencies on shared priorities, and
to engage in robust government-to-government consultation with
impacted Tribes. The Survey is directed to provide a report to the

Committee recommends $49,470,000 for the Biological Threats and
Invasive Species Research Program.
The Committee recommends $11,000,000 to address Invasive
Carp issues in the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi River Basin.
In order to effectively control the spread of Invasive Carp, the Com-
mittee expects all six sub-basins of the Mississippi River Basin will
be included in funding opportunities.
The Committee remains concerned by the rapid and growing in-
vasion of European green crab around the country, including in the
Pacific Northwest, and provides $800,000 for invasive European
green crab research. Further, the Survey and its Federal partners
are directed to jointly brief the Committee no later than 90 days
after enactment of this act on their collective efforts to address Eu-
ropean green crab.
The bill continues the direction contained in Senate Report 118–
83 regarding chronic wasting disease [CWD] and provides
$9,970,000, to research the predominant pathways and mecha-
nisms of the transmission of chronic wasting disease in wild, cap-
tive, and farmed populations of cervids in North America. In car-
rying out this and other research, USGS may consult, partner, or
contract with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
State and Federal public and private entities, and any chronic
wasting disease task forces and working groups. In particular, the
Committee encourages research and investment into carcass dis-
posal methods to mitigate the spread of chronic wasting disease
and recommends that the relevant agencies work in consultation
with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, and the States to develop and provide rec-
ommendations for carcass disposal methods which are compliant
with relevant Federal clean air and water and solid waste regula-
tions. The Committee also encourages USGS to work in partner-
ship with the Fish and Wildlife Service to aid state wildlife agen-
cies in the application of existing human dimensions research to
the management and prevention of chronic wasting disease.
The Committee notes the grave ecological threats and public nui-
sance posed by many invasive species and directs the Survey to
prioritize research, detection, and response efforts on invasive spe-
cies with extremely high impacts on natural resources, native wild-
life populations, and public access and enjoyment, including Bur-
mese Pythons in the Florida Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp,
as well as Lionfish in the Gulf of America, Caribbean, and South
Atlantic waters.

Earth Mapping Resources Initiative [Earth MRI] in support of a
prioritized nationwide program of topographic, geologic, and geo-
physical mapping to enhance understanding of the Nation’s min-
eral resource potential to better manage the supply of critical min-
erals. The Committee continues the direction contained in Senate
Report 118–83. The Committee urges the Survey, when developing
critical mineral maps, to consider other sensitive resources such as
sacred Tribal sites, sensitive watersheds, critical habitat, and other
areas with special designations, and prioritize mapping in those
areas that do not conflict with other previously identified sensitive
resources. The Committee expects critical mineral mapping efforts
in Alaska to continue, pursuant to the budget request, at no less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level and directs the Survey to

52
brief the Committee on such efforts within 90 days of enactment
of this act.

lithium resources and where there is infrastructure to develop the
commercial manufacturing ecosystem.
Tribal Engagement on Energy Development on Tribal Lands.—
The Committee recognizes the importance of an energy strategy
that includes potential energy development on Tribal lands for im-
proving the domestic mineral supply chain to further national en-
ergy capabilities. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department
of the Interior to engage with Tribal communities on activities that
assess the comprehensive resource potential and impacts of devel-
opment on Tribal Lands, including lands owned by an Alaska Na-
tive Corporation, in Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota,
New Mexico, Montana, Colorado, Alaska, and Arizona.
Mineral Resources.—The Committee directs the Survey to explore
the inclusion of items on the Department of Energy [DOE] Critical
Materials list and the Department of Defense [DOD] Critical and
Strategical Materials list on the Survey’s Critical Mineral List.
Further, the Committee directs the Survey to provide a report to
the Committee not later than 120 days after the enactment of this
act that discusses the methodologies used to determine which new
critical minerals shall be added and a plan to collaborate with DOE
and DOD on future updates.

above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level, for the continued develop-
ment, operations, and maintenance of the ShakeAlert earthquake
early warning [EEW] system as well as the timely processing of
station permits and License to Operate applications. The Com-
mittee supports continued efforts to complete and operate the EEW
system on the West Coast and of the funds provided, the Com-
mittee recommends that no less than $4,000,000 be used to begin
the expansion of the ShakeAlert Earthquake Early Warning sys-
tem to Alaska, following the details in the recent Phase 1 Technical
Implementation Plan. The Committees direct the Survey to work
with States to secure any additional funding necessary. Further,
the Committee notes that the Survey has provided a 50-state Na-
tional Seismic Hazard Map and encourages the Survey to explore
the possibility of aligning future updates for States and territories
into one unified and comprehensive model.
The Committee provides $3,450,000 for Subduction Zone Science,
supporting implementation of the Survey’s Subduction Zone science
plan, which would improve the understanding of risks posed to vul-
nerable communities in subduction zone environments, including
near the Cascadia subduction zone, and deliver scientific informa-
tion and tools for disaster risk reduction. The Committee supports

53
the Survey’s ongoing efforts to develop novel techniques and tech-
nologies to efficiently and accurately monitor seafloor faults. The
Committee supports the historic partnership on earthquake re-
search between the National Science Foundation [NSF] and the
Survey. With NSF’s Subduction Zone Earthquake Center, the Com-
mittee encourages the Survey to continue its support of the current
center.

level for the Cooperative Landslide Hazards and Assessment Com-
petitive Grant Program. Within funds provided, $1,000,000 is for
deployment, operation, and maintenance of detection and moni-
toring systems in high-risk areas, including Southeast Alaska. In
light of the increasing frequency of catastrophic wildfires, the Com-
mittee encourages the Survey to prioritize efforts to predict and re-
duce the risk of post-wildfire landslides. The Committee directs the
Survey to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to complete its landslides data for Alaska on its Risk Index Maps.
The Committee also directs the Survey to continue to collaborate
with the Interagency Landslide Working Group in Southeast Alas-
ka as well as Alaska State and local governments to assess land-
slide potential and hazards. Within the provided funds, no less
than $1,500,000 shall be used for collaborating with local and re-
gional entities in Alaska, particularly areas with heightened risk
like those communities in Prince William Sound and Southeast
Alaska, and to deploy, operate, and maintain landslide detection
and monitoring systems in high-risk areas. The Committee also di-
rects the Survey to collaborate with local and Indigenous people
and entities to support and maintain landslide monitoring systems

54
and to collaborate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration and State and local governments to assess landslide
potential and hazards.
Further, the Committee directs the Survey to provide informa-
tion to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this act re-
garding the cost of creating an Interagency Landslide Observing
System with participants from Federal, State, Tribal, and munic-
ipal entities for the purpose of creating a cohesive landslide moni-
toring system in areas where emerging landslide hazards pose
threats to communities.

lakes in the Great Basin and the migratory birds and other wildlife
dependent on those habitats.
The Committee continues $1,000,000 in funding for the U.S.-
Mexico transboundary aquifer project.
The Committee encourages cooperation with western state water
resource agencies facing challenges with long-term water sustain-
ability as a result of increasing drought conditions. The Committee
directs the Survey to dedicate resources to enhance cooperation

55
with western state water resource agencies through respective
State Water Science Centers which possess local and regional
water science expertise that is urgently needed to help Western
States adapt to a changing climate.
The Committee understands the importance of the Ogallala Aq-
uifer and the declines in water levels seen in recent measurements.
The Survey is directed to develop recommendations to establish a
consortium of state water resource management agencies to im-
prove and coordinate study on the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides
drinking water to over two million people in the United States. By
coordinating across States and with the Survey’s Water Resources
Mission Area, researchers will be able to pool research expertise
and resources to more effectively understand and manage hydro-
logic changes in the aquifer to ensure the future availability of
water in the region.
No less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level is provided for Co-
operative Matching Funds.
National Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program.—
The Committee recommends $112,006,000 for the National Ground-
water and Streamflow Information Program. The Survey is encour-
aged to work with research organizations and the power industry
to identify and address critical information gaps to better prepare
for adverse stream conditions that can threaten reliable generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity.
The recommendation includes $29,500,000 to continue with the
Next Generation Water Observing System [NGWOS], and the Com-
mittee recommends no less than fiscal year 2024 enacted levels to
work with universities and other partners to develop innovative
water resource sensor technologies that are scalable to regional and
national monitoring network operations. The Committee rec-
ommends continued support of streamgages along the Ohio River
at the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Committee continues to
support projects to ensure the highest priority advancements in
water monitoring systems are being addressed and continues the
direction contained in Senate Report 118–83.
The Committee recommends $3,870,000 to support and maintain
operational capacity of existing streamgages and water quality and
ecological assessments on certain transboundary rivers, including
those at risk from mining pollution originating in Canada, includ-
ing in the Kootenai watershed. This includes at least $120,000 for
the streamgage on the Unuk River; and fiscal year 2024 enacted
levels for expanded water quality monitoring and analysis efforts
in the Kootenai watershed to support interagency efforts to evalu-
ate and reduce transboundary pollution through the installation of
new streamgages, expanded analyses, and related activities. The
Committee directs the Survey to continue to expand its streamgage
monitoring of transboundary watersheds and to work with the En-
vironmental Protection Agency to ensure the relevant equipment is
deployed to the Kootenai watershed to support the Agency’s work
to evaluate and reduce transboundary pollution. The Committee
continues the direction that the Survey enter into a formal partner-
ship with local Tribes and other Federal agencies as necessary in
the area to develop a water quality strategy for the transboundary
rivers.

56
The Committee recognizes the ongoing monitoring of critical
water budget components in the Klamath Basin to provide the in-
formation needed to assess controls of inflow to Upper Klamath
Lake from surface water and groundwater, improve snowmelt pre-
diction, and forecast impacts of drought and other drivers on water
availability for both human and ecological uses and the Committee
recommends $3,000,000 to continue this expanded work.
Hydrological Science Talent Pipeline.—The Committee believes
that robust participation with universities in the hydrologic
sciences is essential to building a talent pipeline as well as building
capacity to support future hydrological research and operational ef-
forts. To support this, the bill maintains the fiscal year 2024 en-
acted level within the Water Availability and Use Science Program
and the National Groundwater and Streamflow Information Pro-
gram to pursue such cooperative research agreements, including
considering universities in Western States facing groundwater
management challenges to build capacity and expertise in ground-
water hydrologic sciences and locations where the Survey has pend-
ing hydrological facilities as well as where there are other Federal
operational hydrologic resources.

BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [Bureau or BOEM] is
responsible for resource evaluation, environmental review, leasing
activities, and lease management for the Nation’s offshore energy
and minerals resources.
OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $211,162,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 200,057,000
The Committee recommends $200,057,000 for Ocean Energy
Management. This amount will be partially offset with the collec-
tion of offsetting rental receipts and cost recovery fees totaling
$58,000,000. The detailed allocation of funding by program and ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report. Program
directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the fol-
lowing narrative.
Renewable Energy.—The Committee expects the Bureau to con-
tinue its legally required responsibilities in the administration of
the Renewable Energy Program. As the Bureau refines the offshore
wind permitting process, in order to facilitate responsible develop-
ment, it must include steps to understand existing ocean uses by
consulting early and often with the commercial fishing industry
and other stakeholders.
Offshore waters also contain cultural and natural resources of
significance and value to Tribal communities. The Committee ap-
preciates the Department’s commitment to Tribal co-stewardship
and expects the Bureau to work on effective engagement, incor-
porating Indigenous knowledge and Tribal input into decision-mak-
ing processes, and assisting Tribes to build capacity for active par-
ticipation in all stages of project development.
Due to the need for coordination and collaboration on regional re-
search and monitoring of the impacts to marine wildlife and habi-
tats, the Committee expects the Bureau to continue to work with
the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative as appropriate to sup-
port the priorities stated in the science plan, including a passive
acoustic monitoring network. Further, the Bureau should pursue
opportunities to expand public-private partnerships to leverage the

59
resources, expertise, and capacity in the private sector to provide
additional scientific data.
Conventional Energy.—The Committee expects the Bureau to ad-
vance the National OCS Program in an expeditious manner by
completing the sales of the 10th Program (Lease Sales 262, 263,
and 264) and developing the 11th program.
Carbon Sequestration.—The Committee strongly urges the Bu-
reau to publish the proposed rule on carbon, capture, and seques-
tration required by Public Law 117–58 by the end of calendar year
2025 and to provide a briefing to the Senate Committees on Appro-
priations and Energy and Natural Resources on the Bureau’s
progress toward meeting that deadline within 60 days of enactment
of this act and every 60 days thereafter until it is published.
Marine Minerals.—The Committee recognizes the strategic im-
portance of developing domestic sources of critical minerals and ex-
pects the Bureau to continue mineral assessments and activities.
The Committee further encourages the Bureau to facilitate timely
lease sales for critical minerals within the U.S. Outer Continental
Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zones, including in the Gulf of Amer-
ica Region and the Pacific. As part of this, the Bureau is expected
to explore potential mineral resources in deep water and imple-
ment new technologies in ocean exploration and sampling proc-
esses. The Bureau is further encouraged to maintain its partner-
ships with academia to characterize the environment of potential
marine mineral resources, utilizing universities and research insti-
tutions with expertise in deepwater exploration to evaluate mineral
deposits using technologies that minimize disturbance to the sea-
bed ecosystem.
BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT
The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement [Bureau
or BSEE] is responsible for regulating and enforcing safety, envi-
ronmental, and conservation compliance during the development of
the Nation’s ocean energy and mineral resources on the Outer Con-
tinental Shelf, and oil spill research.
OFFSHORE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $205,330,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 206,330,000
The Committee recommends $206,330,000 for Offshore Safety
and Environmental Enforcement. This amount will be partially off-
set with the collection of offsetting rental receipts, cost recovery
fees, and inspection fees, totaling $65,000,000. The detailed alloca-
tion of funding by program and activity is included in the table ac-
companying this report.
Offshore Decommissioning.—The Committee provides $3,880,000
for the Bureau to continue work to plug and abandon orphan infra-
structure, including orphan wells, platforms, and pipelines. The
Committee is providing these funds to provide the Bureau with a
foundation to allow it to be most efficient and consistent in con-
tracting this work, however, expects that once current identified
decommissioning needs are provided for, the line item for decom-
missioning activities will be discontinued.

60
New and Emerging Technology.—The Committee encourages the
Bureau to review and consider new and emerging technology, in-
cluding alternative procedures or non-hydraulically operated equip-
ment as appropriate, given the best available science and while en-
suring that risks are properly identified and mitigated. The Bureau
is further urged to implement a performance standard for Blow
Out Prevention Technology designed to sever and seal a well under
all conditions to significantly decrease the potential for loss of well
control and resulting oil spills.
OIL SPILL RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,099,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,099,000
The Committee recommends $15,099,000 for oil spill research.
OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement
[OSMRE] was established in 1977 to oversee and carry out the re-
quirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
(Public Law 95–87) in concert with States and Indian Tribes.
OSMRE’s primary objectives are to ensure coal mining activities
are conducted in a manner that protects citizens and the environ-
ment during mining, ensure the land is properly reclaimed, and
mitigate effects of past mining by reclaiming historic coal aban-
doned mine land [AML]. OSMRE addresses its mission through
grants to States and Tribes to carry out their own regulatory and
reclamation programs and the administration of OSMRE’s regu-
latory and reclamation programs. The Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 (Public Law 109–432) re-
vised the mine reclamation fee distribution mechanism beginning
in fiscal year 2008. State and Tribal reclamation grants are now
provided under mandatory appropriations instead of through this
bill.
REGULATION AND TECHNOLOGY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $116,186,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 111,538,000
The Committee recommends $111,538,000 for Regulation and
Technology. The detailed allocation of funding by activity is in-
cluded in the table accompanying this report. The recommendation
includes $59,904,000 for State and Tribal regulatory grants. The
Committee encourages the Office to assess the solvency of bond
pools and sureties to ensure that resources for coal mine reclama-
tion will be available in the event of multiple claims occurring over
a limited timeframe.
ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $162,546,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 162,546,000
The Committee recommends $162,546,000 for the Abandoned
Mine Reclamation Fund. Of the funds recommended, $32,546,000
shall be derived from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and

61
$130,000,000 shall be derived from the General Fund. The detailed
allocation of funding by activity is included in the table accom-
panying this report.
State and Tribal Economic Revitalization Grants.—The Com-
mittee recommends a total of $130,000,000 for the Abandoned Mine
Land Economic Revitalization [AMLER] grants to States and feder-
ally recognized Indian Tribes for the reclamation of abandoned
mine land in conjunction with economic and community develop-
ment and reuse goals. Program changes were made in fiscal year
2024 to expedite funding to recipients, but the Committee remains
concerned that these changes will not result in expedited project
completion. The Office is directed to brief the Committee within 90
days of enactment of this act on implementing GAO’s recommenda-
tions detailed in GAO–24–106680 and specifically, meeting States’
goals for project review.
For fiscal year 2026, $86,000,000 shall be divided equally be-
tween the three Appalachian States with the largest unfunded
needs for the reclamation of Priority 1 and Priority 2 sites as delin-
eated in the AML Inventory System; and $33,000,000 shall be di-
vided equally between the next three Appalachian States with the
largest unfunded needs for the reclamation of Priority 1 and Pri-
ority 2 sites as delineated in the AML Inventory System; and
$11,000,000 shall be for grants to federally recognized Indian
Tribes.
INDIAN AFFAIRS
BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
The Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] was founded in 1824 to up-
hold a government-to-government relationship between the Federal
Government and Tribal entities. The Federal Government retains
trust responsibility for individual Indians and Tribes as a result of
formal treaties and agreements with Native Americans.
The Bureau provides services directly or through contracts,
grants, or compacts to a population of nearly 2 million American
Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of 574 federally rec-
ognized Indian Tribes in the lower 48 States and Alaska. Programs
administered by the BIA and Tribes include an education system
for almost 45,000 elementary and secondary students; 33 Tribal
colleges, universities, and post-secondary schools; social services;
natural resource management on 56 million acres of trust land;
economic development; law enforcement; administration of Tribal
courts; implementation of land and water claim settlements; re-
placement and repair of schools; repair and maintenance of roads
and bridges; and repair of structural deficiencies on high-hazard
dams.
OPERATION OF INDIAN PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,897,709,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,918,712,000
The Committee recommends $1,918,712,000 for the Operation of
Indian Programs account. All programs and subactivities included

62
are continued at enacted levels, except requested fixed costs and in-
ternal transfers, or unless otherwise specified below or reflected in
the table accompanying this report. Any additional increases are
general program increases unless otherwise specified.
Bureau of Indian Affairs Reductions in Force [RIF] Oversight and
Service Transition Plan.—The Committee directs the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs to submit, no later than 90 days after enactment of
this act, a report detailing: (1) the number and location of facilities
with operations to carry out statutorily required functions of the
BIA as of January 19, 2025; (2) the number of facilities of the BIA
as of the date of enactment of this act; (3) a detailed description
of what comment or input BIA reviewed from Federal clients it
served in the area or region prior to the field office closure; (4) a
detailed summary for transitioning the statutorily required func-
tions of a facility that is no longer in service as of the date of enact-
ment of this act; (5) metrics for measuring performance of statu-
torily required functions at a program, project, or activity level
disaggregated by region; (6) the number of FTEs hired to perform
statutorily required functions hired under Schedule C or the Sched-
ule Policy/Career since January 20, 2025; (7) the number of FTEs
assigned to perform each statutorily required functions for Federal
clients, buildings, and other assets located in the State of Arizona
and elsewhere as of January 19, 2025; (8) the number of FTEs as-
signed to perform each statutorily required functions for Federal
clients, buildings, and other assets located in the State of Arizona
and elsewhere as of the date of enactment of this act; (9) a detailed
description of any delays or disruptions in services that have oc-
curred as of January 20, 2025, for Federal clients, buildings, and
other assets located in the State of Arizona and elsewhere; and (10)
a detailed description of what actions or procedures the BIA has
implemented to monitor any impact to service delivery or to ad-
dress service concerns from Federal clients in areas or regions
where the BIA has closed a facility.
Tribal Government.—The Committee recommends $398,987,000
for Tribal government programs. The recommendation supports
$7,002,000 for Small Tribes supplement.
The Committee has heard concerns from more recently federally
recognized Tribes about equitable distribution of Consolidated Trib-
al Government Program Funds. Many of these Tribes have smaller
populations and land bases but have significant lingering needs in
establishing certain Tribal government operations. The Committee
encourages the Bureau to continue to provide technical assistance
to the maximum extent practicable to these more recently federally
recognized Tribes on how best to leverage funding through existing
programs.
The Committee believes additional transparency is warranted on
the methodology and data the Bureau uses each year to calculate
and distribute the Small Tribe Supplement to over 300 Tribes in
New York, California, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, Michigan,
Nevada, Alaska, and elsewhere with limited resources for the oper-
ation of their Tribal governments. The Committee directs the Bu-
reau to prepare a report no later than 60 days after enactment of
this act for the current and the previous two fiscal years that lists
the Tribes who qualify for the Small Tribe Supplement, identifies

63
and explains the methodology used to calculate each Tribe’s rev-
enue to determine eligibility for the Small Tribe Supplement (list-
ing the programs that are counted against the cap), and a chart
showing how those calculations were made for each eligible Tribe
each year. The Committee expects the Bureau to post this data on-
line for at least 60 days to enable Tribes to review it and propose
corrections before funds are distributed to ensure correct data is
being used. The Committee further directs the agency to notify it
30 days before adopting or finalizing any changes to the current
formula, which has been in place serving small and needy Tribes
around the country for over 25 years.
Road Maintenance.—The Committee recommends $39,190,000
for road maintenance.
The Committee continues funding at fiscal year 2024 levels for
school bus roads. The Committee directs the Bureau to report back
within 60 days of enactment of this act on funds provided to imple-
ment the NATIVE Act within road maintenance that have not been
utilized for roads, along with a strategy outlining how to meet the
increased demand to address tourism needs across Indian Country.
Human Services.—The Committee recommends $163,747,000 for
Human Services programs, accounting for internal transfers.
Tiwahe.—The Committee expects funding to existing Tiwahe
pilot programs to continue in the same amounts to the same recipi-
ents, including funding to support women and children’s shelters.
Finally, the Committee received the Federal and Tribal reports on
the Tiwahe Initiative, which include recommendations on future
action and expansion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is directed to
submit a plan on how to expand the program to all Tribes incre-
mentally along with a strategy on how to consider existing pilot
programs during any expansion and be consistent with the final re-
port and available funding.
Social Services/Children and Families.—Within Human Serv-
ices, the Committee recommends $52,954,000 for Social Services to
support Indian Child Family Violence Prevention activities to fill
the gaps in Tribal child welfare services-specifically child protection
and child abuse treatment, the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA],
to support ICWA grants to assist American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives to assert their sovereignty under ICWA, and to protect the
rights of children in State welfare and judicial systems. The Com-
mittee expects the Bureau to continue to work with Tribes through
Tribal consultation in the delivery of services to children and fami-
lies within Indian Country.
The Committee also acknowledges the discrepancy of Alaska Na-
tive and American Indian children that are disproportionately rep-
resented in foster care systems and Tribes are the only entity in
Children in Need of Assistance [CINA] cases not provided an attor-
ney by the state. The Committee notes funds included shall be used
to meet the ICWA’s mandate and attorney assistance in CINA
cases.
Within available funds, the Committee encourages BIA to
produce a plan to share information on the recommendations in-
cluded in the Native Children Commission’s report with Indian
Country and other stakeholders.

64
Housing Improvement Program.—The Committee recommends
$11,939,000 for the Housing Program.
Trust-Natural Resources Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $326,608,000 for Trust and Natural Resources programs.
It is the Committee’s understanding that the Bureau has entered
into cooperative agreements with Ahtna Inter-Tribal Resource
Commission and the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fisheries Com-
mission, and has initiated similar agreements with other organiza-
tions. Therefore, it is the Committee’s expectation that within the
funding provided, pilot projects and programs for Alaska subsist-
ence will continue. The Bureau will report to the Committee within
60 days of enactment of this act on a distribution plan for these
funds.
Within funds for Natural Resources, the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level is provided to support the Indian Youth Service Corps.
Rights Protection Implementation.—The Committee recommends
$51,459,000 for Rights Protection Implementation. Within the
funding provided for Rights Protection Implementation, an addi-
tional $500,000 is provided in a general program increase to benefit
the off-reservation hunting, fishing, and gathering rights supported
by this program, an additional $759,000 is provided for Columbia
River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites construction in ac-
cordance with the assessment conducted under Public Law 116–99,
and an additional $1,000,000 is to aid in the implementation of the
U.S. Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty.
The Committee continues support for the Bureau’s partnership
with local Tribes and the U.S. Geological Survey to help develop a
water quality strategy for transboundary rivers.
The Committee supports those Tribal communities who must
meet treaty obligations and directs the Bureau to report to the
Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act outlining miti-
gation strategies under this subactivity that could help these com-
munities meet their treaty obligations.
Tribal Management/Development Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $18,544,000 for the Tribal Management/Development
Program.
Endangered Species.—The Committee recommends $5,993,000
for Endangered Species.
Tribal Community Resilience.—The Committee recommends
$34,291,000 for Tribal Community Resilience. The provided fund-
ing includes funding for relocation grants, for which all Tribes shall
be eligible. The Committee is concerned about the amount of frozen
grant funding and reminds BIA of the critical importance of pro-
viding Federal funds under TCR in a timely manner to avoid any
negative impacts on Tribes, and directs BIA to release previously
appropriated funding expeditiously. Within 30 days of enactment of
this act, and monthly thereafter, BIA is directed to provide the
Committee a status update on all current TCR frozen grants, in-
cluding the reason(s) why funding has not yet been awarded, who
is responsible for approving the unfreezing, how long they have
been frozen, when it is expected that there will be a final decision
on the funding, and when the funding will be distributed.
The Committee reminds the Bureau that the Denali Commission
was designated as the lead coordinating agency for Alaska Native

65
village relocation in 2015, and the Commission has been leading
the efforts since then. The Committee recommends the Bureau
work closely with the Commission in order to avoid duplication of
work and to take advantage of the Commission’s expertise in the
area when considering relocation grants.
Integrated Resource Information Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $2,954,000 for Integrated Resource Information Program.
Agriculture and Range Program.—The Committee recommends
$41,438,000 for the Agriculture and Range Program. This includes
$14,291,000 for Invasive Species and $27,147,000 for the Agri-
culture Program [TPA]. The program increase for invasive species
is provided to address the spread of invasive European Green Crab,
with further direction explained below. Additionally, the Com-
mittee directs the BIA to provide information on the historic geo-
graphic distribution of funds provided by the Agriculture and
Range program.
European Green Crab.—The Committee remains concerned by
the rapid and growing invasion of European green crab around the
country, including in the Pacific Northwest. This crab species preys
on native vegetation, which is important habitat for endangered
salmon and other species that are critical to uphold Tribal treaty
rights and Puget Sound recovery. The Committee provides
$2,000,000 to address the spread of invasive European Green Crab
in the Puget Sound region. The Committee directs the Bureau to
coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to ensure a com-
prehensive Federal approach to addressing the threat posed by Eu-
ropean green crab, mitigate harm, and protect native crab and
other shellfish populations. Further, the Bureau and its Federal
partners are directed to jointly brief the Committee no later than
90 days after enactment of this act on their collective efforts to ad-
dress European Green Crab.
Tribal Forestry.—The Committee recommends $62,887,000 for
Tribal Forestry. Of these funds, $28,259,000 is provided for For-
estry Projects and $34,628,000 for base funding.
The Department of the Interior is expected to promote and ex-
pand the use of agreements with Indian Tribes to protect Indian
trust resources from catastrophic wildfire, insect and disease infes-
tation, or other threats from adjacent Federal lands, as authorized
by law. The Committee reminds the Bureau of the directive to co-
ordinate with the Office of Wildland Fire to submit a report de-
scribing how the Department determines the use of wildfire sup-
pression and rehabilitation resources and prioritizes Indian forest
land. The Committee notes that many Tribal communities are at
a heightened risk of wildfire due to funding constraints and a fire
detection deficit. In order to address the heightened fire risks, the
Committee directs the Bureau to take special consideration of pre-
fire detection technologies to protect the public, property, vital in-
frastructure, cultural resources, and natural resources, and adopt
strategies for their implementation across Tribal lands. The Com-
mittee also reminds the Bureau of the directive in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022
(Public Law 117–103) to provide a report within 1 year summa-
rizing the fire detection deficits across Tribal lands and their ef-

66
forts to prioritize early detection strategies and fire mitigation as
part of the Natural Resources Management Program, and looks for-
ward to that report.
Water Resources.—The Committee recommends $18,005,000,
which includes $8,269,000 for Water Resources [TPA], and
$9,736,000 for Water Management, Planning and Pre-development.
Fish, Wildlife and Parks.—The Committee recommends
$23,751,000 for Fish, Wildlife and Parks programs, which includes
$10,783,000 for Wildlife and Parks [TPA] and $12,968,000 for Fish,
Wildlife, and Parks Projects to support the operation and mainte-
nance of fish hatcheries.
Energy and Minerals.—The Committee recommends $30,814,000
for Energy and Minerals.
Resource Management Program Oversight.—The Committee rec-
ommends $8,218,000 for Resource Management Program Over-
sight.
Trust-Real Estate Services.—The Committee recommends
$170,387,000 for trust-real estate services programs. The Com-
mittee directs no less than the enacted program level of $450,000
for the certification of historical places and cultural sites, including
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] (Public Law 92–
203) sites.
Probate.—The Committee is concerned about the length of time
it takes for BIA to probate Tribal citizens’ assets and the adminis-
trative burden associated with the process. Within 60 days of en-
actment of this act, BIA is directed to provide a report indicating
how many FTEs the BIA would need nationally to reduce the pro-
bate backlog to less than 2 years in each region; the resources BIA
would need to ensure technical assistance to ensure proper training
and capacity for self-governance providers handling probate pack-
ages; and the average amount of time it takes for Interior to com-
plete the probate process for eligible States and what, if any, oppor-
tunities exist to improve timeliness and comply with regulatory
deadlines.
To help reduce the probate backlog and help process lands
records, rights of way, and other real estate functions, the Com-
mittee recommends $16,886,000 for Trust-Real Estate Services
Oversight, of which $3,501,000 is provided to Central Oversight
and $13,385,000 to Regional Oversight, additionally, $18,140,000 is
provided for Probate [TPA].
Gila River Trust Accounting.—The Committee has been made
aware of funding issues related to the implementation of the Gila
River Indian Community Federal Rights-of-Way, Easements and
Boundary Clarification Act (Public Law 115–350). To carry out the
functions outlined in the law, the Committee recommends an addi-
tional $500,000 to complete the work related to surveys which is
holding up development.
Real Estate Services.—The committee is concerned with the po-
tential loss of economic opportunity in Tribal communities. This
means a potential reduction in key Tribal programs and social
services. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department
will provide to the committee the current backlog of realty applica-
tions pending for Rights of Way and leasing at the Department,
and a plan to address the backlog.

67
The Committee directs the Bureau, in coordination with the
Osage Agency, to provide a report within 120 days that details the
process of an owner, current or potential lessee, current or future
developer, Tribal owner, or head right owner would follow to obtain
trust records upon request, including the average amount of time
needed by the Bureau to respond to this request. The report shall
detail step by step instructions of how an entity or individual
would procure these records and what is required of the entity or
individual to get that access.
Public Safety and Justice.—The Committee recommends
$558,812,000 for Public Safety and Justice programs.
Criminal Investigations and Police Services.—The Committee rec-
ommends $274,152,000 for Criminal Investigations and Police
Services to support officers and investigators on the ground per-
forming crucial public safety services on a 24/7 basis in Indian
Country.
For funds dispersed for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to address the
impacts of the McGirt v. Oklahoma decision, the Bureau, in coordi-
nation with the Oklahoma Tribal recipients for McGirt related pub-
lic safety and justice funding, is required, to the maximum extent
practicable, to report on the number and specific types of convic-
tions in their respective court systems. Additionally, the report is
required to include barriers to collecting this data from Tribes and
any statutory updates needed to best accomplish conviction report-
ing under these funds. The Bureau is expected to deliver a report
to the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee recognizes the critical need for increased law en-
forcement resources in Tribal communities, including those in Pub-
lic Law 280 (PL 280) States. Despite the jurisdictional limitations
imposed by PL 280, the safety and well-being of Tribal commu-
nities remain a top concern. To address the challenges these com-
munities face, the Committee directs the BIA to conduct com-
prehensive Tribal consultation with Tribes in PL 280 States, aim-
ing to explore the available flexibilities that would enable these
Tribes to utilize their existing and future resources more effectively
for law enforcement purposes, given the importance of ensuring
Tribes have the flexibility and resources to improve public safety
within their communities. The consultation should specifically con-
sider the potential for Tribes to use their Tribal Priority Allocations
[TPA] for law enforcement needs, among other possible avenues.
The Committee directs the BIA to report to the Committee within
180 days of the enactment of this act on the outcomes of the con-
sultation and any recommended actions to support Tribal law en-
forcement in PL 280 States.
The Committee remains concerned about the theft, looting, and
trafficking of sacred objects and items of cultural patrimony, and
notes the importance of enforcing the Native American Graves Pro-
tection and Repatriation Act [NAGPRA], or other related laws. The
Committee recommends continued funding for these activities,
equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
The Committee also expects the recidivism initiative adminis-
tered through the Tiwahe initiative to be continued. Within the
amounts provided, the Committee supports enacted funding levels
for implementation of the Violence Against Women Act [VAWA]

68
(Public Law 103–322) for both training and VAWA-specific Tribal
court needs.
International Drug Trafficking.—The Committee is deeply con-
cerned about the growing presence of international drug trafficking
organizations in Indian Country, despite the efforts of Tribal law
enforcement. These organizations are contributing to violent crime
and drug trafficking and exacerbating the crisis of missing and
murdered Indigenous women. The Committee directs the BIA to
develop a comprehensive plan to address these issues. This plan
should be created in close cooperation with relevant Tribal, Fed-
eral, State, and local agencies, and through thorough consultation
with Tribal governments and surrounding communities. The goal is
to create a coordinated and effective response to the threats posed
by these organizations. Furthermore, the Committee directs the
BIA to provide a briefing to the Committee within 90 days of the
enactment of this act. This briefing should cover the progress made
in developing this plan, the policies that have been established, and
the steps that will be taken to combat the influence of these organi-
zations in Indian Country.
Detention/Corrections.—The Committee recommends
$136,879,000 for detention and corrections. The Committee re-
mains concerned with the welfare of inmates in custody at BIA and
Tribal jails across Indian Country and directs the BIA to provide
regular updates on fulfilling recommendations from the Depart-
ment’s Office of Inspector General related to training, coordination,
and standardized protocols to maintain accountability and over-
sight over BIA and Tribal jails.
Pre-Conviction Detention.—The Committee is concerned about
the practice of sending individuals to out-of-state detention facili-
ties in other BIA regions for pre-conviction detention, particularly
prevalent in the Rocky Mountain Region. This practice is costly
and results in the separation of individuals who have not been con-
victed of a crime from their communities, causing undue hardship
for both the detainees and their families. Thus, the Committee di-
rects the BIA to explore and consider alternatives to this practice.
The BIA should prioritize solutions that keep individuals closer to
their communities, reduce costs, and maintain the integrity of the
pre-conviction process. The Committee expects the BIA to engage
with Tribal governments and local stakeholders to identify viable
alternatives and to provide a briefing within 90 days of enactment
of this act on the progress of these efforts.
Nevada Detention Contracts.—The Committee is concerned about
the potential loss of detention services for Tribes in Nevada. The
Committee notes that detention services are essential to ensure
public safety, therefore directs the Bureau to provide a briefing no
later than 90 days of enactment of this act on how the Bureau in-
tends to work with the Tribes in Nevada on a path forward.
Law Enforcement Special Initiatives.—The Committee rec-
ommends $27,847,000 for law enforcement special initiatives,
which includes an additional $250,000 with an emphasis on ad-
dressing the crisis of missing, trafficked, and murdered indigenous
people, especially women. Native American women continue to face
high rates of violence, and the Committee notes that a lack of data
on the number of women and girls who go missing or murdered

69
further complicates the ability to address this crisis. Increases are
provided to help better address the crisis by identifying gaps in in-
formation sharing and data collection, and more dedicated re-
sources to resolve cold cases. Funding is maintained to perform
background check investigations to help with the hiring process.
Additional funding is included for cold-case offices and for deten-
tion and corrections staff. Within 90 days of enactment of this act,
the Bureau shall brief the Committee on the status of law enforce-
ment vacancies in each Bureau region, as well as the number of
law enforcement checks pending as of the date of enactment. At the
same time as the annual budget request, the Bureau shall provide
detail on how funding provided in fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year
2026 is being used to expedite these investigations.
Further, to assist Tribal and Federal law enforcement agencies
in finding missing persons, the Secretary shall make funding avail-
able through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Serv-
ices, for software platforms that assist the agencies in finding miss-
ing persons. Such contributory software platforms may combine
law enforcement public records data, analytics, geospatial mapping,
and cellular network forensics.
Tribal Justice Support.—The Committee recommends
$34,836,000 for Tribal Justice Support. The Committee remains
concerned about Tribal courts’ needs as identified in the Indian
Law and Order Commission’s November 2013 report, which notes
Federal investment in Tribal justice for Public Law 83–280 States
has been more limited than elsewhere in Indian Country. The
Committee expects the Bureau to continue to work with Indian
Tribes and Tribal organizations to consider options that promote,
design, or pilot Tribal court systems for Tribal communities subject
to full or partial State jurisdiction under Public Law 83–280.
The Committee notes that a number of States with large Indian
populations have no law enforcement presence in Tribal commu-
nities and Alaska Native Villages despite high crime rates; how-
ever, these Tribes are not eligible for certain Native public safety
and justice funding simply because they are located in Public Law
280 States. The Bureau is reminded that it is directed to conduct
Tribal consultation on the budgetary needs of Tribal law enforce-
ment, including wellness courts and other essential judicial needs
for the Tribes in these States, and report back to the Committees
on the available Federal funding, within the Department of the In-
terior or elsewhere, for these Tribes or outlining the barriers to the
development of such funding.
Victim/Witness Assistance Program.—The Committee is con-
cerned with the high declination rates of criminal cases in Indian
Country by Federal law enforcement and encourages the Bureau of
Indian Affairs/Witness Assistance Program to help advocate for
families and survivors by bringing forward information and wit-
nesses that could be used by Federal law enforcement in active
missing person cases, homicides, and other investigations.
In addition to these resources, the bill also includes funding to
focus on retention and advanced training needs. The Committee re-
mains fully supportive of the Indian Police Academy in Artesia,
New Mexico, and expects the Bureau to continue to support the
Academy in its role as the central justice services training location

70
for law enforcement training for entry-level law enforcement offi-
cers, agents, and corrections officers. The Committee recommends
$5,663,000 for the Indian Police Academy. The bill includes an ad-
ditional $500,000 to operate advanced training activities in the
Great Plains region that focuses on training for detectives,
forensics, and other advanced training, per the accompanying
statement in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public
Law 116–260).
The Committee is aware that Indian reservations have violent
crime rates that are more than two and a half times higher than
the National average. The Committee recognizes the need to ad-
dress crime and violence in Indian Country and is concerned by the
high vacancy rate among Bureau law enforcement personnel. The
Committee notes that the vacancy and turnover rate is especially
high in the Great Plains Region, which contains nearly three quar-
ters of all corrections officer vacancies, 68 percent of all special
agent vacancies, and over half of all Bureau of Indian Affairs police
officer vacancies. The Committee directs the Bureau, working with
other Federal partners, to report back to the Committee within 1
year of enactment of this act on the training needs for Bureau law
enforcement and Tribal law enforcement by location, with a com-
prehensive plan on how to recruit, train, and fill the vacancies, in-
cluding whether hiring and retention is hindered by delayed hiring
processes and delayed background checks. As part of this report,
the Committee expects the Bureau to work with the Indian Police
Academy to clearly identify what funding mechanisms are author-
ized that may be used for the recruitment, training, and facility
needs, as well as what type of partnerships, including Federal,
State, and Tribal, could be utilized to address and fill these needs.
Further, because of the ongoing public safety issues facing Tribal
nations, the Committee supports the Bureau’s innovative new ef-
forts to help with law enforcement recruitment and retention like
the pay parity effort which began in fiscal year 2024, but more ac-
tion is necessary to support Tribes and Tribal safety. Therefore, the
Committee directs the Bureau to expedite the hiring process, in-
cluding background checks, and training. The Committee also di-
rects the Bureau to work closely with Tribal leaders on this issue
to ensure the Bureau has the resources necessary to meet this
higher level of service.
The Committee understands the funding provided in previous fis-
cal years for opioid addiction was not used solely for this purpose,
but instead was used to hire additional drug enforcement officers
to assist with all drug-related issues on Tribal lands. The Com-
mittee acknowledges that each community may have its own
unique drug-related issues apart from opioids and continues this
funding without the designation for opioid addiction.
Community and Economic Development.—The Committee rec-
ommends $31,046,000 for community and economic development
programs. The Committee recommends an increase of $500,000 to
the enacted funding levels to carry out the provisions of the NA-
TIVE Act (Public Law 114–221) to support strategic planning and
capacity-building for Tribes, and for grants, studies, and tourism
projects for Tribes and eligible Native Hawaiian Organizations,
with further direction explained below.

71
NATIVE Act Implementation.—The Committee notes that the
NATIVE Act, Public Law 114–221, requires an annual report out-
lining actions taken, policies formulated, and management plans
and tourism initiatives formulated to include American Indians
and Alaska Natives [AI/AN], Tribal organizations, and Native Ha-
waiian organizations. Additionally, the NATIVE Act requires a co-
leadership role to integrate Federal tourism assets within the Fed-
eral Government to strengthen and develop Native American tour-
ism, yet both of these requirements have not been met. Therefore
the Committee directs the Bureau to produce and submit the re-
quired report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of
this act. Further, the NATIVE Act requires the Bureau and the De-
partment of Commerce to enter into a Memorandum of Under-
standing [MOU] with a qualified Native-led non-profit organization
with an established record of managing a national program pro-
viding outreach, training, and support specific to Native American
communities in the development, growth, and enhancement of cul-
tural tourism. The Committee further directs the Bureau to keep
the Committee informed on how the Bureau intends to implement
the MOU in future years once the report is released.
The Committee supports and recommends funding for the Bu-
reau’s job training efforts, and support for business incubators in
Indian Country, in accordance with the budget request.
The Committee understands the importance of preserving native
languages for all Tribal communities. The Committee previously
appropriated funds to the Bureau of Indian Education to build ca-
pacity for language immersion programs or to create new pro-
grams; however, those States that have federally recognized Tribes
without Bureau-funded schools have been prevented from partici-
pating in this program, even though eligibility for these grants has
included potential applicants beyond the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation school system. The Committee recommends no less than en-
acted funding under this subactivity for language immersion
grants. The Committee expects that eligibility will include any pri-
vate nonprofit or Tribal organization in those States without Bu-
reau-funded schools that are interested in further enhancing or cre-
ating native language immersion programs.
Executive Direction and Administrative Services.—The Com-
mittee recommends $260,634,000 for Executive Direction and Ad-
ministrative Services.
Special Initiatives.—The Committee recommends $8,491,000 in
congressionally directed spending for Special Initiatives. A detailed
list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spend-
ing’’ table accompanying this report.

INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,000,000
The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for Indian Land Consoli-
dation. This account is to reduce land fractionation and increase
Tribal majority ownership of lands to provide more control over
land management, use, and protection. The Committee is con-
cerned that the Bureau did not include administrative expense esti-
mates in the budget request and expects the Bureau to do so in fu-
ture budget justifications. Further, the Committee expects that
each fiscal year the Bureau will provide metrics, including the
number of fractionated interests purchased and acreage consoli-
dated.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $356,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 350,000,000
The Committee recommends $350,000,000 for Contract Support
Costs. The Committee continues language establishing an indefi-
nite appropriation for contract support costs estimated to be
$350,000,000 for fiscal year 2026. By retaining an indefinite appro-
priation for this account, additional funds may be provided by the
Bureau if its budget estimate proves to be lower than necessary to
meet the legal obligation to pay the full amount due to Tribes. The
Committee believes fully funding these costs will ensure that
Tribes have the necessary resources they need to deliver program
services efficiently and effectively.
PAYMENTS FOR TRIBAL LEASES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $69,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 53,000,000
The Committee recommends $53,000,000 for Payments for Tribal
Leases. The Committee recommends establishing a separate appro-
priation account for payments for Tribal leases estimated to be
$53,000,000 for fiscal year 2026. Section 105(l) of the Indian Self
Determination Education Assistance Act provides that Tribes and
Tribal organizations carrying out Federal functions under a self-de-
termination contract or self-governance compact may enter into a
lease agreement with the Department of the Interior or Indian
Health Service for the facilities used to carry out these functions.
CONSTRUCTION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $133,780,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 136,280,000
The Committee recommends $136,280,000 for Construction Pro-
grams. All programs and subactivities included are continued at
enacted levels unless otherwise specified below or reflected in the
table accompanying this report. Internal transfers within the ac-
counts are reflected below and in the table.

73
Public Safety and Justice Construction.—The Committee rec-
ommends $48,291,000 for public safety and justice construction.
The Committee recommends $33,500,000 for the Facilities Replace-
ment and Construction Program; $3,500,000 for Employee Housing;
$6,620,000 for Facilities Improvement and Repair; $171,000 for
Fire Safety Coordination; and $2,000,000 for Fire Protection.
The Committee is concerned with the continuous dilapidated con-
ditions of public safety and justice facilities and understands the
demand for public safety and construction funding remains high
and the backlog to replace public safety facilities has grown expo-
nentially. The Committee is aware there are many condemned fa-
cilities across the country including the Hopi, White Mountain
Apache, Warm Springs, and San Carlos Apache detention and jus-
tice facilities and directs the Bureau to keep the Committee ap-
prised on the progress to replace these facilities.
The Committee expects the Bureau to distribute funds provided
in this act to expeditiously complete construction of adult detention
center projects that were previously awarded. Remaining amounts
should be considered available for all public safety and justice fa-
cilities, consistent with previous direction. Direction is provided for
the Bureau to: (1) produce a plan on how to spend unobligated pub-
lic safety and justice balances on facilities in poor condition; and
(2) provide the plan to the Committee within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act.
Additionally, the Bureau is directed to provide information to the
Committee on any gaps in facilities resources associated with the
growing demand for advanced law enforcement training.
Tribal communities, including Alaska Native communities, don’t
have sufficient public safety facilities to hold individuals until they
can be transported to appropriate corrections facilities. The Bureau
is reminded of the directive in fiscal year 2024 to provide a report
indicating whether existing programs available can address this
need, or whether additional authorities and programs are nec-
essary to provide funding to address this need.
The Committee supports the Bureau’s efforts to recruit, train and
retain its Tribal law enforcement personnel. The Committee is
aware that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking to enhance its
advanced training center and increase advanced training of stu-
dents throughout the Great Plains and Northern Regions. Of the
additional funding provided under Public Safety and Justice Con-
struction, funding may be used for planning and design stage and
construction including required due diligence studies, to construct
facilities—to include administrative space, classrooms, and storage
areas—necessary to meet the growing demand for Tribal law en-
forcement advanced training as needed.
Resources Management Construction.—The Committee rec-
ommends $65,694,000. This funding includes: $24,519,000 for irri-
gation projects, of which not less than $2,987,000 is for the Navajo
Indian Irrigation Project and $10,000,000 is for projects authorized
by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation [WIIN]
Act (Public Law 114–322); $36,730,000 for dam projects; $1,016,000
for survey and design; $2,758,000 for engineering and supervision;
and $671,000 for Federal power compliance. The Committee ex-
pects the funds designated for WIIN Act (Public Law 114–322) ac-

74
tivities will be deposited into the Indian Irrigation Fund to fund
those projects authorized by Public Law 114–322.
The Committee continues the previous fiscal year funding for
dam safety. However, the Committee is concerned that an un-
known number of dams on reservations have not received a hazard
classification, and the current review process is behind schedule,
resulting in delays for comprehensive reviews. The Committee
strongly encourages the Bureau to begin dam safety work expedi-
tiously and report back to the Committee on the best way to effec-
tively quantify the potential pool of dams on reservations in need
of a review and/or classification.
Other Program Construction.—The Committee recommends
$22,295,000. This includes $2,419,000 for telecommunications re-
pair and $9,497,000 for construction program management, which
includes funding for the Fort Peck water system as well as funding
for facilities improvement and repair.
Ft. Peck Water System.—The Committee directs the Bureau to
prioritize and allocate the necessary funding to support the contin-
ued operations and maintenance of the Ft. Peck Water System in
Montana. The Bureau is to ensure that this funding is sufficient
to maintain the system’s functionality and reliability, thereby en-
suring the continued delivery of safe and clean drinking water to
the communities it serves. The Bureau is directed to keep the Com-
mittee informed of any challenges to maintain operations and
maintenance and steps taken to address them.
San Carlos Irrigation Project.—The Committee is aware of chal-
lenges with the ability of the San Carlos Irrigation Project’s power
system to purchase power when there are fluctuations in market
conditions. The Bureau should keep the Committee updated re-
garding challenges of the project to purchase power.
INDIAN LAND AND WATER CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS
PAYMENTS TO INDIANS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $976,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 976,000
The Committee recommends $976,000 for the Indian Land and
Water Claim Settlements account.
INDIAN GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,329,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,329,000
The Committee recommends $13,329,000 for the Indian Guaran-
teed Loan account. The Committee directs the Office of Indian Eco-
nomic Development to report on its efforts to restart the use of the
Interest Subsidy at this critical time. The Committee understands
that Interest Subsidy is not as critical when interest rates are low,
but conversely it is very critical when interest rates are high. The
report should document how planned uses of the interest subsidy
impacts the program if defaults increase and how Interest Subsidy
can mitigate those defaults.

75
BUREAU OF INDIAN EDUCATION
OPERATION OF INDIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,131,617,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,131,617,000
The Committee recommends $1,131,617,000 for the Operation of
Indian Education Programs. The detailed allocation of funding by
program and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Internal transfers within the accounts are reflected below and
in the table.
The Committee fully supports broadening access to Native lan-
guage and culture programs, which have been linked to higher aca-
demic achievement for Native youth. The Committee expects the
Individual Student Equalization Program [ISEP] to continue to en-
hance access to Native language and culture programs in Bureau-
funded schools and directs the Bureau to report within 60 days of
enactment of this act on how previous funding provided has been
and can continue to be used to support these programs.
Within the funds provided for education program enhancements,
continued funding is provided for native language immersion
grants with the understanding that the recipients of these grants
are Bureau-funded schools. The Bureau is expected to report within
60 days of enactment of this act regarding the status of fiscal year
2025 funds and the planned distribution of funds in this act.
The Committee remains concerned about the distribution meth-
odology of the Johnson O’Malley [JOM] assistance grants and is
aware that Congress enacted the Johnson O’Malley Modernization
Act (Public Law 115–404) in 2018. In addition to requesting a re-
port detailing the Bureau’s compliance with the act, the Committee
once again requests that the Department include estimates of nec-
essary appropriations levels to provide per pupil funding levels
equal to the fiscal year 2018 level per pupil levels for all newly re-
ported eligible students.
Interagency coordination must be improved for the multiplicity of
programs that affect the well-being of Native children. In addition
to education, these include healthcare, mental and behavioral
healthcare, social service, child welfare, and juvenile justice pro-
grams. The Committee encourages the Bureau to work with other
relevant Federal, State, local, and Tribal organizations to begin the
process of identifying ways to make programs more effective in
serving Native children. In addition, the Committee directs the De-
partments of Education and Interior to develop a cooperative agree-
ment to work together to improve the quality of education opportu-
nities offered to Indian youth and to ensure there is no overlap in
services between the Departments.
Haskell Indian Nations Campus.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities
[TCUs] to address persistent educational disparities in Native
American communities. The Committee directs the Bureau to sub-
mit a report to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate
within 240 days of enactment of this act providing a detailed ac-
count of infrastructure and safety improvements made at Haskell

76
Indian Nations University using Interior funding, and identify re-
maining gaps in campus facilities, safety, and educational program-
ming that must be addressed to meet institutional needs.
The Committee directs the Bureau to strengthen coordination
and establish regular lines of communication with the Haskell In-
dian Nations University Board of Regents. The Board, as a Tribally
elected body, plays a critical role in institutional governance, rep-
resentation, and advocacy. Improved collaboration will enhance
transparency, promote accountability, and support the long-term
success and operational stability of the university.
The Committee directs the Bureau to submit a report to the
Committee on Appropriations of the Senate within 90 days of en-
actment of this act evaluating the potential benefits and implica-
tions of transferring governance authority for Haskell Indian Na-
tions University to its Tribally elected Board of Regents. The report
shall assess how such a transfer would support Tribal self-deter-
mination, institutional accountability, and improved student out-
comes. It should also provide recommendations on necessary steps,
timelines, and statutory changes needed to implement the transi-
tion.
The Committee directs the Department of the Interior, in coordi-
nation with the Bureau of Indian Education [BIE] to submit a re-
port to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate within 30
days of enactment of this act detailing current policies and proce-
dures for conducting background checks on all Department employ-
ees assigned to BIE schools and programs. The report shall include:
(1) the frequency and standards for background checks; (2) proto-
cols for addressing findings of concern; (3) the date of the most re-
cent background check for each category of employee; and (4) any
gaps or delays in implementation across the Department’s edu-
cational institutions.
The Committee notes that the Bureau is required to compensate
teachers and counselors at a pay rate that is consistent with the
Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Prac-
tices Act, as provided by 25 U.S.C. 201. The Committee directs the
Bureau to clearly display funding amounts required to comply with
Department of Defense Education Activity (Public Law 86–91, as
amended) pay rates as part of future budget justifications and en-
courages the Bureau to include sufficient funding in its budget re-
quest to fully fund these requirements.
Further, the Committee directs the Bureau to provide an anal-
ysis of ISEP funds beginning in fiscal year 2026 in the annual
budget request that details: The Bureau’s pay rate for teacher and
counselor salaries; the Department of Defense [DOD] pay rate for
teacher and counselor salaries; the amount of funding provided for
teacher and counselor pay parity in annual budget requests and ac-
tually provided with available funds; the amount of annual funding
spent on Bureau-funded schools non-salary expenses (including stu-
dent services, safety, programming, and other standard operations);
the impact that any shortfall of ISEP funds for required pay in-
creases had on school services and programming (if any); and a
complete accounting of any amounts Bureau-funded schools may
not have received because fixed costs increases that align with

77
DOD teacher and counselor pay parity requirements were not in-
cluded in annual budget requests.
FERS Eligibility for Employees at BIE Tribally Controlled
Schools.—The Committee is concerned about the inequity created
by the loss of Federal Employees Retirement System [FERS] bene-
fits for teachers and staff when Tribes exercise their self-deter-
mination right to operate BIE-funded schools under Public Law
100–297 grants or Public Law 93–638 contracts. The loss of these
benefits is a major impediment to the recruitment and retention of
teachers and staff, as these Tribally Controlled Schools often bear
the hardship of recruiting, hiring, and training teachers and staff
only to lose them shortly thereafter to other schools offering better
pay and benefits. Any policy denying Federal benefits to employees
carrying out a Federal trust responsibility is incompatible with the
Federal policy of self-determination. Congress recognized this in-
compatibility and barrier to recruitment and retention in 2020
when it extended the Federal Employee Health Benefits [FEHB]
program to teachers and staff of Tribally Controlled Schools. Thus,
the Committee directs the Bureau to analyze the extent of the
problem and the systems, processes, and authorizations necessary
to extend FERS benefits to teachers and staff employed by these
schools; develop an associated plan, timeline, and budget; and re-
port back to the Committee with a proposal no later than 180 days
after the date of enactment of this act.
The Committee directs the Bureau to work with the Indian
Health Service as appropriate to continue integrating school-based
preventative health services, such as dental, mental, and behav-
ioral care, into elementary schools in order to improve health out-
comes of Tribal students.
EDUCATION CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $234,725,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 234,725,000
The Committee recommends $234,725,000 for Education Con-
struction. Funding amounts support a level of $152,401,000 for re-
placement schools; $19,648,000 for replacement facilities;
$3,880,000 for employee housing repair; and $41,296,000 for facility
improvement and repair.
The Committee recognizes that many Tribal colleges have signifi-
cant unfunded needs and directs the Bureau to work with Tribal
leaders and other stakeholders to develop a consistent methodology
for determining Tribal colleges operating and maintenance needs to
inform future budget requests. The Committee included directives
under the Bureau of Indian Education-Operation of Indian Edu-
cation Programs in previous years directing the Bureau to develop
a methodology regarding the operating and infrastructure needs for
Tribal colleges, but the Bureau has not yet complied and submitted
a methodology. The Committee again directs the Bureau to conduct
an assessment of Tribal colleges facility needs and develop a dis-
tribution methodology to address these needs. The Committee also
directs the Bureau to report back within 60 days of enactment of
this act on how it conducts student counts at Tribal colleges and
how funding is provided to address facilities operation, mainte-
nance, and construction needs.

78
The Committee expects that the discretionary funding for the fa-
cility improvement and repair program will continue to be used to
address deficiencies identified by annual school safety inspections.
The Committee remains concerned about the deferred maintenance
projects at schools and directs the Bureau to submit the allocation
plan as required by Public Law 115–31. The Committee is encour-
aged to learn that BIA and BIE continue to work together to en-
sure annual safety inspections are completed for all BIE school fa-
cilities. However, the Committee is concerned that, as noted by
GAO in report GAO–16–313, BIA and BIE have not developed con-
crete tracking and capacity-building systems to ensure safety
issues flagged by these inspections are addressed in a timely man-
ner. Furthermore, the Committee is concerned by reports from
Tribally-operated BIE schools that BIE does not provide timely ac-
cess to or training about the Facilities Improvement and Repair
Program and other available emergency maintenance funding. The
Committee reminds the Bureau that it has yet to comply with the
reporting requirements for school safety inspections included in
Senate Report 116–123, and that this report should be delivered
within 30 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee understands that many schools are in need of re-
pair, improvement, and upgrades to be in good condition. The Com-
mittee stands ready to work with the administration and Tribes to
develop a comprehensive strategy that provides safe, functional,
and accessible facilities for schools. The Committee reminds the
Bureau of the previous requirement to report back on the progress
the Bureau has made towards implementing a long-term facilities
plan similar to the Department of Defense process in 2009, as en-
couraged in the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public
Law 114–113.
BUREAU OF TRUST FUND ADMINISTRATION
Congress has designated the Secretary of the Interior as the
trustee delegate with responsibility for approximately 55 million
surface acres of land, 57 million acres of subsurface mineral inter-
ests, and management of approximately $8.2 billion held in trust
by the Federal Government on behalf of American Indians, Alaska
Natives, and federally recognized Indian Tribes. The Bureau of
Trust Fund Administration [BTFA] is assigned trust management
of these assets includes conserving, maintaining, accounting, in-
vesting, disbursing, and reporting to individual Indians and feder-
ally recognized Tribes and Tribal organizations on asset trans-
actions generated from sales, leasing and other commercial activi-
ties on these lands.
FEDERAL TRUST PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $100,009,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 100,009,000
The Committee recommends $100,009,000 for the Federal Trust
Programs account. The recommendation includes $1,459,000 for ex-
ecutive direction.

79
Individual Indian Money Accounts.—The Committee has con-
cerns with the timely distribution and management of proceeds
held in Individual Indian Money accounts at the Bureau of Trust
Funds Administration. Delays in disbursement and accounting im-
pact the financial health of Tribal members who reside in commu-
nities with a lack of economic opportunity, and fail to uphold the
Department’s trust asset management responsibilities on behalf of
tribes. The Committee encourages the Department to respond to
IIM withdraw requests in as expedited a time as possible.
DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $147,418,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 127,418,000
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$127,418,000 for the Office of the Secretary account. The bill con-
tinues the direction from previous fiscal years to maintain the Of-
fice of Native Hawaiian Relations within the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget.
Leadership and Administration.—The Committee recommends
$90,969,000 for the leadership and administration activity. This cut
reflects the Committee’s frustration with the Department’s unwill-
ingness to provide timely responses to requests for information;
failure to proactively engage the Committee on decisions related to
appropriated resources; and to take draconian steps that are likely
to decrease efficiencies rather than increase them. The Department
is strongly encouraged to take more seriously its relationship with
the Committee. Without tangible steps in that direction, the Com-
mittee will consider changes to the appropriations structure that
will enable the Committee to take targeted cuts within this ac-
count.
Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony [STOP] Act.—The STOP
Act fills a key void in preventing the export and trafficking of Trib-
al cultural heritage items in the international market and facili-
tating their repatriation to their respective Tribal communities.
The Committee recommends $500,000 for the Department to begin
implementation of this important mission. Further, timely imple-
mentation of the export certification system established by the
Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony Act (Public Law 117–258) is
necessary to prevent the illegal export of protected Tribal sacred
objects to foreign markets. The Department is directed to complete
its STOP Act regulations expeditiously and brief the Committee
within 60 days of enactment of this act on its plan to implement
the export certification system required by the STOP Act.
Subsistence Activities.—The Committee believes marine mammal
subsistence harvest management and enforcement decisions should
be, to the extent practicable, led by Alaska Native Organizations
at the local level, with Federal agencies working in partnership
with Alaska Native Organizations. The Committee expects the
Service to finalize a co-management agreement with the Alaska
Nannut Co-Management Council [ANCC], and in the interim, to

80
work closely with ANCC on enforcement actions that may arise in
relation to subsistence uses of polar bears. The Service is directed
to provide funding to Alaska Native Organizations with which it
co-manages marine mammals at no less than fiscal year 2021 lev-
els. The Service is reminded of the report due to the Committee on
the Service’s efforts to work collaboratively with other Federal
agencies on activities related to marine mammal subsistence har-
vests and directs this report to be submitted no later than 30 days
after the enactment of this act, if still outstanding at the time of
enactment of this act.
Management Services.—The Committee recommends $36,499,000
for the management services activity.
Indian and Arts and Crafts Board [IACB].—The recommendation
includes not less than $1,806,000 for the IACB to support activities
related to enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. The Com-
mittee supports the work of the IACB to promote the economic de-
velopment of Native Americans through the expansion of the In-
dian arts and crafts market and combatting illegal sales and traf-
ficking of indigenous artwork through IACB’s administration and
enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act.
Indian Youth Service Corps.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to continue progress on standing up the Indian Youth
Service Corps. Across the Department, the Committee continues to
provide ongoing funding to support youth through the Indian Youth
Service Corps and directs the Department to work in partnership
with land management agencies to identify additional capacity for
the program.
Plum Island.—The Committee directs the Department to provide
a briefing to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act
regarding processes and potential resources needed to complete a
transfer for permanent conservation of Plum Island, including
management of and partnerships with State, Federal, and Tribal
entities, and potential costs for managing the island.
Native Hawaiian Community Resilience Program.—The Com-
mittee has made a concerted effort to support community-led adap-
tation projects, habitat restoration, and coastal management, in-
cluding on Native Hawaiian homelands thus, the Committee sup-
ports the continuation of the Kapapahuliau grants. The Committee
urges the Secretary to consider this program during the 2027 budg-
et formulation and work with Congress on a permanent solution.
Lastly, the Committee directs the Department to provide a briefing
to the Committee and the Committee on Indian Affairs no later
than 90 days upon enactment of this act on how to build on these
efforts.
INSULAR AFFAIRS
The Office of Insular Affairs [OIA] was established on August 4,
1995, through Secretarial Order No. 3191, which also abolished the
former Office of Territorial and International Affairs. OIA has ad-
ministrative responsibility for coordinating Federal policy in the
territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands [CNMI], as
well as oversight of Federal programs and funds in the freely asso-

81
ciated States of the Federated States of Micronesia [FSM], the Re-
public of the Marshall Islands [RMI], and the Republic of Palau.
The Compacts of Free Association recognize each Freely Associ-
ated State as a sovereign State with the capacity to conduct foreign
affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact. The Compacts
place full responsibility for defense with the United States. The
Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assist-
ance, principally through the Department of the Interior. The Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118–42, Division G,
Title II, §201, the ‘‘Compact of Free Association Amendments Act
of 2024,’’ approved new economic assistance packages for the Freely
Associated States through 2043.
ASSISTANCE TO TERRITORIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $120,107,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 120,367,000
The Committee recommends $120,367,000 for assistance to terri-
tories. Funding levels for each subactivity can be found in the table
accompanying this report.
The Committee recognizes that the Office of Insular Affairs’ most
impactful spending is through projects to improve education, drink-
ing water, sanitation, health, safety, transportation, reliability of
power, availability of technology, including through fiber optics,
and economic opportunity and sustainability. The Committee di-
rects these funds to be awarded accordingly and timely. Addition-
ally, OIA is directed to continue to award non-competitive technical
assistance funds to support investments in civic education pro-
grams for Insular Area students. If the Department does not make
the aforementioned awards in a timely manner, the Committee will
consider adding statutory requirements.
The Committee understands that investing in OIA plays a crit-
ical role in furthering and protecting U.S. national security, and
supports the OIA and its efforts to combat the People’s Republic of
China’s efforts to weaken U.S. leadership. The Committee is con-
cerned by the lack of OIA representatives stationed in some of the
Freely Associated States and U.S. territories within OIA’s jurisdic-
tion. The Committee recommends an additional $1,760,000 to sup-
port OIA personnel in each jurisdiction under its purview as well
as corresponding desk officers.
Brown Tree Snake.—The Committee recognizes the damage
caused by the invasive Brown Tree Snake [BTS] on Guam and the
significant threat of its spread to other Pacific island areas, includ-
ing the State of Hawaii and other Insular communities. The Com-
mittee supports the ongoing efforts of OIA to prevent the spreading
of the BTS from Guam and encourages OIA to continue to
prioritize this work in the future. Further, the Committee directs
OIA to work in close coordination with other Federal and local
partners to leverage resources to the maximum extent practicable.
The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for these efforts, an in-
crease of $500,000 over fiscal year 2024 enacted levels, and directs
OIA to provide a briefing to the Committee within 180 days of en-
actment on the progress being made on the eradication efforts.
The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for increased support to
the territories for investments in infrastructure. Mandatory fund-

82
ing for the Capital Improvement Project program has not been in-
creased or adjusted for inflation since the program’s current au-
thorization in 1996, and significant increases in construction and
labor costs continue to erode at the impact of the program on infra-
structure needs in the territories. This additional discretionary
funding will provide additional grant funding to the territories as
they continue to address critical needs for infrastructure improve-
ment.
Funding for Energizing Insular Communities is provided equal to
the request.
COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,463,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 813,000
The Committee recommends $813,000 for Compact of Free Asso-
ciation programs.
OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $97,950,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 97,950,000
The Committee recommends $97,950,000 for the Office of the So-
licitor.
Freedom of Information Act [FOIA].—The Committee appreciates
the efforts made by the Office of the Solicitor to increase the proc-
essing capacity of the Department’s FOIA program and reduce the
Department’s FOIA request backlog. The Committee directs the
Department to include in future budget justifications an exhibit on
staffing levels and metrics showing the status of the FOIA request
backlog.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $67,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 67,000,000
The Committee recommends $67,000,000 for the Office of Inspec-
tor General.
DEPARTMENT-WIDE PROGRAMS
WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Department’s Wildland Fire Management account funds the
Office of Wildland Fire and fire prevention, readiness, suppression,
and rehabilitation activities performed by the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
and National Park Service.
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,147,171,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,148,171,000

83
The Committee recommends $1,148,171,000 for wildland fire
management. Program directives and specific funding requirements
are noted in the following narrative.
Fire Operations.—The Committee recommends $909,721,000 for
Wildfire Preparedness and Suppression. This amount includes
$526,064,000 for preparedness and $383,657,000 for fire suppres-
sion operations.
The Department is urged to implement technology moderniza-
tions outlined in section 1114 of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conserva-
tion, Management, and Recreation Act (Public Law 116–9). These
upgrades will improve firefighter and public safety and enhance ef-
fective and cost-efficient wildfire response, through expanded use of
uncrewed aircraft systems and better incident support, such as re-
mote location tracking, smoke projections, safe operations in de-
graded visual environments, and wildfire decision support.
The Department is encouraged to increase adoption of decision
support tools such as Potential Operational Delineations [PODs],
Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessments [QWRA], and scenario in-
vestment tools for increased work on joint cross boundary planning
with State, local, and Tribal governments.
Other Operations.—The Committee recommends $238,450,000 for
other wildland fire management operations. This includes
$214,450,000 for fuels management, $10,000,000 for burned area
rehabilitation, $10,000,000 for fire facilities, and $4,000,000 for
joint fire science. Within fire facilities, no less than $4,000,000 is
provided for the Department’s firefighter housing improvement ini-
tiative.
The Department is directed to prioritize collaboratively-developed
wildfire risk reduction efforts in high-risk firesheds with frag-
mented ownership of Federal, State, and private forest lands, sus-
ceptibility to wildfire and concentration of homes. The Department
is further directed to brief the Committee within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act on the proposed distribution of hazardous fuels
funding to its component bureaus, the allocation methodology, and
how it takes into account areas with special designations, such as
the Oregon and California Grant Lands.
WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS RESERVE FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $360,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 370,000,000
The Committee recommends $370,000,000 for the Department of
the Interior Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund for fis-
cal year 2026.
CENTRAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,661,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 9,661,000
The Committee recommends $9,661,000 for the Central Haz-
ardous Materials Fund.

84
ENERGY COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,800,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,800,000
The Committee recommends $4,800,000 for the Energy Commu-
nity Revitalization Program. The detailed allocation of funding by
activity is included in the table accompanying this report.
The Committee continues to expect this program to be used to
implement section 40704 of Public Law 117–58 and directs the De-
partment to finalize guidance for State and Tribal grants and
memoranda of understanding with other Federal agencies, includ-
ing the Forest Service and Environmental Protection Agency, to
implement the program as authorized. The bill also provides fund-
ing for these activities on Federal lands within the Department’s
individual land management bureaus and the Forest Service.
NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND RESTORATION
NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,715,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,715,000
The Committee recommends $7,715,000 for the Natural Resource
Damage Assessment Fund.
WORKING CAPITAL FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $107,710,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 107,710,000
The Committee recommends $107,710,000 for the Working Cap-
ital Fund.
OFFICE OF NATURAL RESOURCES REVENUE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $167,937,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 167,937,000
The Committee recommends $167,937,000 for the Office of Nat-
ural Resources Revenue [ONRR].
The Committee directs the Department to distribute revenues
from operations in the Gulf of America Region in a manner con-
sistent with Public Law 109–432. The Committee clarifies that the
disbursement of funds under Public Law 109–432, as revenue shar-
ing amounts, are not to be treated as an award or grant by the
United States. It is the intent of the Committee that the single
audit requirements under 2 CFR 200 do not apply for revenues dis-
bursed under Public Law 109–432.

85

TITLE II
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Environmental Protection Agency [EPA or Agency] was cre-
ated through Executive Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, de-
signed to consolidate certain Federal Government environmental
activities into a single agency. The plan was submitted by the
President to the Congress on July 8, 1970, and the EPA was estab-
lished as an independent agency in the executive branch on Decem-
ber 2, 1970, by consolidating 15 components from five departments
and independent agencies.
A description of EPA’s pollution control programs by media fol-
lows:
Air.—The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101–
549) authorize a national program of air pollution research, regula-
tion, prevention, and enforcement activities.
Water Quality.—The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Public
Law 92–500), as amended, provides the framework for protection of
the Nation’s surface waters. The law recognizes that it is the pri-
mary responsibility of the States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate
water pollution. The States determine the desired uses for their
waters, set standards, identify current uses and, where uses are
being impaired or threatened, develop plans for the protection or
restoration of the designated use. They implement the plans
through control programs such as permitting and enforcement, con-
struction of municipal waste water treatment works, and nonpoint
source control practices. The act also regulates discharge of dredge
or fill material into waters of the United States, including wet-
lands.
Drinking Water.—The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 (Public
Law 93–523), as amended in 1996, charges EPA with the responsi-
bility of implementing a program to assure that the Nation’s public
drinking water supplies are free of contamination that may pose a
human health risk and to protect and prevent the endangerment
of ground water resources which serve as drinking water supplies.
Hazardous Waste.—The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
of 1976 [RCRA] (Public Law 94–580) mandated EPA to develop a
regulatory program to protect human health and the environment
from improper hazardous waste disposal practices. The RCRA Pro-
gram manages hazardous wastes from generation through disposal.
EPA’s responsibilities and authorities to manage hazardous
waste were greatly expanded under the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98–616). Not only did the
regulated universe of wastes and facilities dealing with hazardous
waste increase significantly, but past mismanagement practices, in
(87)

88
particular prior releases at inactive hazardous and solid waste
management units, were to be identified and corrective action
taken. The 1984 amendments also authorized a regulatory and im-
plementation program directed to owners and operators of under-
ground storage tanks.
The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act of
2012 (Public Law 112–195) amended subtitle C of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act (Public Law 89–272) to establish an electronic means
of tracking wastes subject to RCRA regulation.
Pesticides.—The objective of the pesticide program is to protect
the public health and the environment from unreasonable risks
while permitting the use of necessary pest control approaches. This
objective is pursued by EPA under the Food Quality Protection Act
(Public Law 104–170); the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (Public Law 61–152); the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Public Law 75–717); and the Pesticide Registration
Improvement Extension Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–117) through
three principal means: (1) review of existing and new pesticide
products; (2) enforcement of pesticide use rules; and (3) research
and development to reinforce the ability to evaluate the risks and
benefits of pesticides.
Radiation.—The radiation program’s major emphasis is to mini-
mize the exposure of persons to ionizing radiation, whether from
naturally occurring sources, medical or industrial applications, nu-
clear power sources, or weapons development.
Toxic Substances.—The Toxic Substances Control Act (Public
Law 94–469) established a program to stimulate the development
of adequate data on the effects of chemical substances on health
and the environment and instituted control action for those chemi-
cals which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment. The original statute was amended by the Frank R.
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act of 2016 (Pub-
lic Law 114–182). The act’s coverage affects thousands of chemicals
currently in commerce and all new chemicals.
Multimedia.—Multimedia activities are designed to support pro-
grams where the problems, tools, and results are cross media and
must be integrated to affect results. This integrated program en-
compasses EPA’s research, enforcement, and abatement activities.
Superfund.—The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Com-
pensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–510) estab-
lished a national program to protect public health and the environ-
ment from the threats posed by inactive hazardous waste sites and
uncontrolled spills of hazardous substances. The original statute
was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–499). Under these authorities, EPA
manages a hazardous waste site clean-up program that includes
emergency response and long-term remediation.
Brownfields.—The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–510), as
amended by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields
Revitalization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107–118), established a na-
tional program to assess, clean up, and provide support to States,
Tribes, local communities, and other stakeholders to work together
to develop Brownfields.

89
Leaking Underground Storage Tanks.—The Leaking Under-
ground Storage Tank [LUST] Program addresses petroleum re-
leases from federally regulated underground storage tanks. It was
created in 1986 when Congress amended subtitle I of the Solid
Waste Disposal Act (Public Law 89–272). EPA implements the
LUST response program primarily through cooperative agreements
with the States. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act (Public Law 109–
58) expanded eligible uses of the Trust Fund to include certain leak
prevention activities.
Inland Oil Spill.—The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Pub-
lic Law 80–845), as amended by section 4202 of the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–380), established a national program
to help prepare for, and respond to, any oil spill affecting the in-
land waters of the United States.
PROGRAMMATIC GUIDANCE
The Committee recommends $8,641,650,000 for the Agency.
Workforce.—EPA staff include scientists, engineers, analysts,
community coordinators, and program managers who help protect
public health and the environment in communities across the coun-
try. EPA permanent staff numbers remain well below historic lev-
els despite the growing workload to support clean air, clean water,
and a stable climate. The Committee expects the Agency to submit
as part of its operating plan, staffing targets by National Program
Management area, in line with the Agency’s enacted appropriation.
The Committee expects the Agency to continue to develop work-
force and staffing plans. Further, not later than 45 days after the
end of each quarter, the Agency shall submit data on the number
of full time equivalent employees employed by the Agency in the
same format as the fiscal year 2020 employment target data was
submitted.
PFAS and Contaminants of Emerging Concern.—The Committee
remains concerned regarding PFAS and its effects on our commu-
nities and supports the Agency’s previous actions on PFAS, includ-
ing issuing its first-ever drinking water standard, designating two
substances as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act [CERCLA], and updat-
ing interim guidance on the destruction and disposal of PFAS-con-
taining materials. In April 2025, the Administrator announced
major Agency actions on PFAS. The Committee is still awaiting a
briefing on this updated PFAS plan. Immediately following the en-
actment of this act, the Agency is directed to brief the Committee
on the Agency’s actions and provide the Committee with a spend
plan that details funding at the program project level for fiscal year
2026.
Congressional Budget Justification.—The Agency is directed to
continue to include the information requested in House Report
112–331 and any proposals to change State allocation formulas
that affect the distribution of appropriated funds in future budget
justifications.
Reprogramming.—As a result of incorporating the Agency table
by reference, the reprogramming guidelines no longer apply.
Combination of Separate Fiscal Year Grant Funding.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges instances in which the Agency combined sepa-

90
rate fiscal year grant appropriations and put out a multi-year Re-
quest for Application and directs the Agency to brief the Committee
before publishing a multi-year Request for Application of grant
funding.
Changes to Grant Formulas or Allocations.—The Agency is di-
rected to brief the Committee before making changes to grant fund-
ing allocations or formula changes.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund.—The Committee believes that a
nonrecurring expenses fund [NEF] is an important tool for a De-
partment or Agency to have. However, access to such an account
requires confidence in a Department or Agency that it will spend
the funds within the parameters set forth for the NEF by Congress.
To date, EPA has not demonstrated that it is willing to be trans-
parent with the Committee on how its spending money appro-
priated by Congress. As such, the recommendation does not sup-
port establishing a NEF for EPA. However, the Committee will
consider providing EPA with the requested in a future fiscal year
if EPA shows that it is willing to be transparent, responsive, and
forthcoming with how it spends appropriated dollars.
Grant Terminations.—The Committee urges the EPA to uphold
grant obligations made to local governments and nonprofit organi-
zations that are working to improve access to healthcare in rural
areas while ensuring appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars.
OFFICE OF THE ADMINISTRATOR
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $183,830,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 107,883,000
The Committee recommends $107,883,000 for the Office of the
Administrator, including $63,760,000 for the Immediate Office of
the Administrator and $44,123,000 for the Office of the Chief Fi-
nancial Officer. The Committee has moved $183,830,000 out of the
Environmental Programs and Management that were otherwise
spent on operations of the Office of the Administrator and the Of-
fice of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure there is transparency
in funding required to support those Offices. The Committee is
frustrated with how EPA has decided to not have a working rela-
tionship with the Committee and to disregard Congressional direc-
tives related to staffing and funding. The Committee will consider
targeted increases to funding for the Offices if the Offices can dem-
onstrate that it takes its relationship with the Committee seri-
ously.
The Committee directs EPA to expeditiously brief the Committee
on the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed reorganization
on July 17, 2025, related to the Office of the Administrator. Once
the Committee has received the briefing and efficient corresponding
information, the Committee will reevaluate the funding levels and
structure for the Office of the Administrator and the Chief Finan-
cial Officer, among others, provided in this act.
The following table summarizes the Committees’ recommenda-
tion for the Immediate Office of the Administrator.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $756,073,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 742,595,000
The Committee recommends $742,595,000 for Science and Tech-
nology. The recommendation includes an additional $30,343,000 for
this account from Hazardous Substance Superfund to fund ongoing
research activities authorized by the Comprehensive Environ-
mental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public
Law 96–510), as amended. The detailed allocation of funding by
program and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Program directives and specific funding requirements are
noted in the following narrative.
Office of Research and Development.—The Committee notes that
EPA has a long and proud tradition of being one of the world’s
leading environmental and human health research organizations.
The Office of Research and Development [ORD] conducts cutting-
edge research to better understand and mitigate harm to humans
and the environment from contamination from natural and human-
made disasters, radiation exposure, wildfire smoke emissions,
chemical releases, drinking water contamination, chemicals in ev-
eryday products, and other threats. For example ORD’s
foundational research on PFAS chemicals exposed profound risks to
human health and spurred bipartisan funding to address the im-
pacts of PFAS on drinking water, bans on certain PFAS chemicals,
and further research.
The Committee is appalled that the Agency has announced the
imminent closure of ORD, which would result in the further loss
of biologists, chemists, engineers, ecologists, and other expert sci-
entists numbering in the thousands and the closure of world-class
laboratories and research centers. The Agency has touted savings
of $748,800,000 in direct Federal spending, but fails to acknowl-
edge the immeasurable risk to our health and environment that
would come from undermining EPA’s ability to clean up hazardous
chemicals, respond to disasters, and support states and Tribal Na-
tions with sound, actionable science. The Committee notes that the
Agency did not include a proposal to close ORD in the fiscal year
2026 budget request nor amended the budget request to that end
nor did the Agency submit the reorganization to the Committee as

92
required by the reprogramming guidance pursuant to section 422
of Public Law 118–42 and continued under the terms and condi-
tions of Public Law 119–4.’’ The Committee directs the Agency to
immediately halt all actions related to the closure, reduction, reor-
ganization, or other similar such changes to ORD and the EPA sci-
entific workforce and instead, if the administration continues to
wish to pursue this change, include any such changes within the
President’s budget request for fiscal year 2027 as a proposal for the
Committee to make a decision on in a final funding bill for that
year.
Clean Air.—The Committee recommends $138,624,000. The Com-
mittee supports the Agency’s efforts to modernize its monitoring,
analytic, and testing capabilities.
The Committee notes the Agency’s Science Advisory Board pan-
el’s review of the Clean Air Allowance Trading Program, urges the
networks to keep active at their fiscal 2021 levels, and recommends
$4,260,000 to modernize the Clean Air Status and Trends Network
[CASTNet]. The Committee directs the Agency to provide a report
within 180 days of enactment of this act on current and future
plans for the Clean Air Status and Trends Network and the Na-
tional Trends Network as well as funding requirements.
Within available funding, the Committee encourages increased
emphasis for the Federal Vehicle and Fuels Standards and Certifi-
cation line and encourages resources be allocated to vehicle re-
search and development and enforcement, including testing capa-
bilities of the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory.
Electric Pathway.—The Committee notes the Agency still has not
implemented the electricity program under the Renewable Fuel
Standard [RFS], despite past direction from this Committee. The
Committee directs the Agency to finalize the eRINS program with-
in 90 days of enactment of this act and to process all electric path-
way feedstock petitions prior to issuing the final 2026 Renewable
Volume Obligation rule. The Committee expects that the eRIN pro-
gram will be implemented with all eligible feedstocks, particularly
those that support agriculture activity, minimize wildfire risk, and
reduce methane emissions.
Homeland Security.—The Committee recommends $33,957,000.
The Committee urges the Agency to prioritize activities related to
the cybersecurity of the Nation’s water systems. The Committee is
concerned by public reports of cyberattacks on water systems
across the world and recommends additional funding for the Agen-
cy to prevent cyber threats in coordination with other Federal
agencies and partners.
The Committee supports the Agency’s Pesticide Licensing Pro-
gram and encourages the Agency to continue ensuring the program
is implemented appropriately, efficiently, and as Congress in-
tended. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Agency to con-
sider pesticide usage data, existing conservation practice data, real
world studies on the impact of spray drift and surface water, and
sub-county level species range maps when conducting Endangered
Species Act [ESA] assessments of pesticides, among other appro-
priate information. Additionally, the Committee encourages the
Agency to coordinate with and seek input from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture and impacted stakeholders when considering

93
mitigation actions related to impacts of pesticides on listed species
and their designated critical habitat before publishing an interim
decision or interim decision.
Research: Air, Climate, and Energy.—The Committee rec-
ommends $94,080,000. The Committee supports EPA’s efforts to
advance climate research. The Committee encourages the Agency
to prioritize research into improving air pollution monitoring capa-
bilities and methodologies. Within available funds, the Committee
continues funding for the study under the heading ‘‘Partnership
Research’’ contained in the explanatory statement accompanying
Public Law 115–141.
Research: Chemical Safety and Sustainability.—The Committee
recommends $124,496,000.
Research: Safe and Sustainable Water Resources.—The Com-
mittee recommends $109,270,000 for the Safe and Sustainable
Water Resources Program. Of the funds recommended, $5,000,000
shall be allocated for grants under Section 2007 of Public Law 115–
270.
Research: National Priorities.—The Committee recommends
$19,530,000 for Research: National Priorities, of which $6,222,000
is for extramural research grants, independent of the Science to
Achieve Results [STAR] grant program, to fund high-priority water
quality and availability research by not-for-profit organizations
that often partner with the Agency. Because these grants are inde-
pendent of the STAR grant program, the Agency should strive to
award grants in as large an amount as is possible to achieve the
most scientifically significant research. Funds shall be awarded
competitively with priority given to partners proposing research of
national scope and who provide a 25-percent match. The Agency is
directed to allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of enactment
of this act. The Committee supports the Agency’s efforts to
prioritize new Federal research that will help farmers, ranchers,
and rural communities manage PFAS impacts in agricultural set-
tings and communities and includes $7,000,000 to continue that
work. The Agency is directed to work with the Department of Agri-
culture to invest in agronomic research to better understand PFAS
uptake into plants and animals to help reduce PFAS exposure in
our food supply and promote farm viability.
The Committee recommends $6,278,000 for Congressionally Di-
rected Spending grants. Further detail on these projects is located
in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending’’ accom-
panying this report.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee has provided the fol-
lowing additional guidance with respect to funding provided under
this account.
Science to Achieve Results [STAR] Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommends funds to continue the STAR program and directs the
Agency to distribute grants consistent with fiscal year 2024. The
Committee urges that funding for Children’s Environmental Health
and Disease Prevention be continued. The Committee supports the
efforts of the Agency to focus this funding on research related to
early life stage, including prenatal, vulnerabilities to environ-
mental stressors. The Committee remains interested in the feasi-
bility of reestablishing the Graduate Fellowship program and of im-

94
plementing a mechanism to allow for submission of unsolicited,
principal investigator-initiated proposals to STAR in order to cap-
ture innovative research ideas that may exist outside of the Agency
and that advance its mission. The Agency is directed to brief the
Committee on the program within 60 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee looks forward to receiving the briefing directed in
the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 116–260.
Wildfire Smoke Research.—The Committee notes with concern
the adverse health effects that smoke from wildland fire has on im-
pacted communities. The Committee is aware of and supports ef-
forts by EPA to develop best-practices, community-based interven-
tions, and communication strategies for affected communities in-
cluding for underserved or under-monitored communities. The
Committee encourages the Agency to expand its efforts to identify
methods to reduce smoke exposure during wildfire episodes and im-
prove wildfire smoke monitoring and prediction.
Plastics.—The Committee continues the directive contained in
Senate Report 118–83.
Landfill Emissions Research.—The Committee encourages the
Agency to prioritize efforts to refine greenhouse gas and air pollut-
ant measurement. In particular, municipal solid waste landfills
continue to be a significant source of greenhouse gas and haz-
ardous air pollutant emissions. The Committee directs that at least
enacted levels be used by the Office of Research and Development
to support research to frequently monitor and quantify emissions
of methane and hazardous air pollutants from landfills using the
most effective technologies, including infrared spectroscopy from
satellites, as appropriate and, during the times the emissions are
measured, measurement of any quantity of methane captured by
the landfill gas collection system. The Committee notes the Agen-
cy’s Unified Agenda seeking to reexamine its air quality standards
for municipal solid waste landfills.
Harmful Algal Blooms.—The Committee recognizes the increas-
ing challenges many communities face from harmful algal blooms
[HABs] in freshwater and coastal ecosystems. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to fund research grants that help promote sci-
entific progress towards preventing and controlling HABs in fresh-
water and coastal ecosystems, including research to: (1) determine
the effectiveness of existing nutrient prevention and treatment
technologies; (2) evaluate the scale-up of emerging nutrient treat-
ment technologies and develop new technologies; and (3) develop
best management practices to help both rural and urban commu-
nities reduce nutrients in their watersheds. Within the Safe and
Sustainable Water Research Program, the Committee encourages
EPA to prioritize funding for research on how to better understand
and address HABs, support States in their efforts to prevent and
manage HABs, and research the health issues related to aero-
solized exposure to water contaminated with HABs. Further, the
Committee notes the Agency’s research to improve the under-
standing of discrete and diffuse sources of nutrient pollution that
contribute directly to HABs as well as research to better under-
stand the variety of nutrients that can contribute to HABs.
Research Vessels.—The Committee notes the Lake Explorer II
vessel is close to being condemned and encourages current funding

95
be used to ensure continuity of the Agency’s water quality and bio-
logical monitoring of the Great Lakes, including by replacing the
vessel.
PFAS.—The Committee continues its support for PFAS research
at enacted levels and supports the research priorities outlined in
the PFAS Framework to Prevent Unsafe New PFAS from Entering
the Market.

The Committee recommends $2,869,076,000 for Environmental
Programs and Management.. The detailed allocation of funding by
program and activity is included in the table accompanying this re-
port. Program directives and specific funding requirements are
noted in the following narrative.
The Committee recommendation includes a new appropriations
account which includes funding recommendations for the Imme-
diate Office of the Administrator and the Office of the Chief Finan-
cial Officer. Of which, funding for these two offices previously came
from programs within the Environmental Programs and Manage-
ment appropriations account, totaling $183,830,000 for fiscal year
2025. For fiscal year 2026, this funding has been moved from the
Environmental Programs and Management appropriations account
and into the Office of the Administrator appropriations account.
Clean Air.—The Committee recommends $299,000,000 for Clean
Air. These resources will support efforts to address harmful air pol-
lutants including greenhouse gases that are contributing to climate
change. The resources recommended include funding for the phase
down of the use of hydrofluorocarbons. The Committee appreciates
the Agency’s work to implement this phase down and recognizes
more resources are necessary to make grants under the authority
provided in 42 U.S.C. 7676(h)(5). The Committee requests a brief-
ing within 120 days of enactment of this act on these efforts.
The Committee recognizes the value of and continues to support
the Energy Star program and recommends $36,000,000 for Energy
Star, equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Therefore, the
Agency is directed to report to the Committee not later than 30
days after the enactment of this act on the future of Energy Star
at the Agency.
The Committee encourages the Agency in partnership with other
Federal agencies to study and incorporate capabilities for observa-
tional methane and greenhouse gas monitoring and information

96
systems that will integrate data from a variety of observational
sources. The goal of such a system should be to make data more
accessible and usable to Federal, State, Tribal, and local govern-
ments, researchers, the public, and other users and to inform the
Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory.
The Committee directs the Agency to submit a report within 180
days of enactment of this act on how it will work with local, State,
and Federal stakeholders, especially where Federal sources are a
significant source of nonattainment, to reduce criteria pollutants.
Where appropriate, the Committee encourages the Agency to solicit
information from the public on ideas for achieving emissions reduc-
tions which could include incentive programs.
The Committee commends EPA for its efforts through the
AirNow Fire and Smoke Map to better forecast and communicate
the impact of wildfire smoke on communities. The Committee is
concerned that air quality monitors are not currently distributed
equitably across impacted communities. The Committee encourages
EPA to expand its support for wildfire smoke monitoring, including
improving instrumentation, technical assistance, and outreach,
using the resources provided in this bill with a focus on tradition-
ally underserved or under-monitored communities. The rec-
ommendation continues funding for wildfire smoke-related activi-
ties.
The Committee remains very concerned over the Agency’s wood
stove certification and testing program. The Committee notes the
Inspector General’s report finding significant shortcomings in the
program leading to little health benefits at significant public cost.
The bill maintains the enacted level for the Agency’s wood stove
certification and testing standards work. The Agency is directed to
use the base funding to increase its staffing and other required ef-
forts to support the wood stove certification and testing program.
The Agency is further directed to brief the Committee within 60
days of enactment of this act on improvements the Agency plans
to make to the program and how it will better communicate with
State and local stakeholders.
Compliance.—The Committee recommends $97,795,000 for Com-
pliance. The Committee supports the Agency’s efforts to modernize
its compliance information systems to reduce duplication of effort
and improve their utility for the public, States, Territories, Tribes,
and other stakeholders, as well as efforts to accelerate EPA’s devel-
opment and adoption of Smart Tools for Field Inspectors. The Com-
mittee urges the Agency to facilitate ample opportunities for stake-
holder input into the development of these efforts.
Enforcement.—The Committee recommends $284,931,000.
The Committee funds EPA’s Civil Enforcement activities and en-
courages the Agency to focus its enforcement resources on the most
serious environmental violations, including through National En-
forcement and Compliance Initiatives [NECIs] that seek to improve
air quality, provide for clean and safe water, and ensure chemical
safety. The Committee also notes the potential of addressing PFAS
contamination in the future NECIs and considering voluntary Sup-
plemental Environmental Projects [SEPs] as appropriate.
Environmental Protection: National Priorities.—The Committee
recommends $30,700,000 for competitive grants for qualified non-

97
profit organizations to provide technical assistance for improved
water quality or safe drinking water, adequate waste water to
small systems, or individual private well owners. The Agency shall
provide $26,000,000 for Grassroots Rural and Small Community
Water Systems Assistance Act (Public Law 114–98), for activities
specified under section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42
U.S.C. 300j–1(e)(8)). The Agency is directed to provide funding to
the most qualified and experienced non-profit organizations in pro-
viding technical assistance to small water systems and to issue the
grant awards on an annual basis.
The Agency is also directed to provide $3,450,000 for grants to
qualified not-for-profit organizations for technical assistance for in-
dividual private well owners, with priority given to organizations
that currently provide technical and educational assistance to indi-
vidual private well owners. The Agency is directed to provide, on
a national and multi-State regional basis, $1,250,000 for grants to
qualified organizations for the sole purpose of providing on-site
training and technical assistance for wastewater systems. The
Agency shall require each grantee to provide a minimum 10 per-
cent match, including in-kind contributions. The Agency is directed
to allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this
act. Additionally, the Agency must consult with the Committee be-
fore making multi-year awards.
Geographic Programs.—The Committee recommends
$684,726,000 for Geographic Programs.
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.—The Committee recommends
$368,000,000 for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. A long-
term goal of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative [GLRI] articu-
lated in the GLRI Action Plan calls for land use, recreation, and
economic activities that are managed to ensure that nearshore
aquatic, wetland, and upland habitats will sustain the health and
function of natural communities. The Committee is aware that
metropolitan planning organizations in the region are working on
site-specific land-use and economic development projects with local
communities bordering the Great Lakes that can help advance this
effort. The Agency is encouraged to work with these groups to ad-
vance this long-term goal as they allocate funding under the GLRI.
The Committee encourages Agency funds for Great Lakes projects
to be made available for projects in the historic Great Lakes Basin,
which includes the Chicago River Watershed. Further, the Com-
mittee notes the need to address contaminated sediment and urges
the Agency to seek a non-Federal in-kind resources for the Chicago
River Watershed.
The Committee encourages the Agency to work with the other
members of the Great Lakes Interagency Taskforce and implement
projects benefiting historically underserved communities.
The Committee is encouraged by the Agency’s commitment to ac-
celerate the clean-up of Areas of Concern. The Committee notes
that there is currently no community representation standard for
Areas of Concern Public Advisory Councils, which are the entities
charged with increasing public awareness, representing public pri-
orities, and ensuring project implementation. The Committee urges
the Agency to brief the Committee on how communities most im-
pacted by Areas of Concern are represented in decision-making

98
processes, steps to enhance community engagement and local ca-
pacity building, and the Agency’s plan for engaging the Great
Lakes community in the development of Action Plan IV. Finally,
the Committee recommends the GLRI Distinct Tribal Program be
funded at 5 percent of the annually appropriated GLRI funding
level.
Chesapeake Bay.—The Committee recommends $92,000,000 for
the Chesapeake Bay program. From the total amount provided, at
least $10,000,000 is recommended for nutrient and sediment re-
moval grants, at least $10,000,000 is recommended for small water-
shed grants to control polluted runoff from urban, suburban and
agricultural lands, and at least $8,000,000 is recommended for
State-based implementation in the most effective basins.
Puget Sound.—The Committee recommends $57,000,000, an in-
crease of $3,000,000 to fiscal year 2024 enacted levels, for the
Puget Sound program and continues the direction contained in the
explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–42.
South Florida.—The Committee recommends $8,500,000 for the
South Florida program. Within the funds provided, the Committee
recommends at least $2,000,000 to monitor coral health in South
Florida; $1,150,000 to enhance water quality and seagrass moni-
toring in the Caloosahatchee Estuary and Indian River Lagoon, es-
pecially with respect to assessing the impact of Lake Okeechobee
discharges and harmful algal blooms; and $1,150,000 to enhance
water quality and seagrass monitoring in Florida Bay and Biscayne
Bay, especially with respect to assessing the impact of Everglades
Restoration projects and harmful algal blooms.
Long Island Sound.—The Committee recommends $40,002,000
for the Long Island Sound program. The Committee directs the
Agency to follow the directives contained in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 118–42.
Gulf of Mexico.—The Committee recommends $25,524,000 for the
Gulf of Mexico Geographic Program. The Committee notes that hy-
poxia continues to be a growing cause for concern. The Committee
directs the Agency to coordinate with the Department of Agri-
culture, the Gulf States, and other State, local, and private part-
ners to leverage greater resources toward conservation projects on
working-lands within the Gulf Region and Mississippi River Basin.
The Agency is directed to distribute funds in the same manner as
fiscal year 2024.
Lake Champlain.—The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for
the Lake Champlain program. These funds shall be allocated
through the Lake Champlain Basin Program, other than con-
tinuing the enacted levels to support significant, impactful projects
identified in the State implementation plan that will make measur-
able progress towards meeting the phosphorus reduction targets of
the EPA’s 2016 Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for
Lake Champlain.
Lake Pontchartrain.—The Committee recommends $2,200,000 for
the Lake Pontchartrain program. The Lake Pontchartrain Restora-
tion Program has been administered through the active participa-
tion of stakeholders within the sixteen-parish basin since the pro-
gram’s inception and the Committee expects local stakeholder con-

99
sensus to continue to play an integral role in the approval of rec-
ommended projects.
Northwest Forest.—The Committee continues to support the
Northwest Forest Program at not less than the fiscal year 2021
funding level.
Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Program.—
The Committee appreciates the ongoing research to combat aquatic
nuisance species transported by commercial shipping and ballast
water operations in order to implement the Great Lakes and Lake
Champlain Invasive Species Program as authorized by the Vessel
Incident Discharge Act (Public Law 115–282). The Committee di-
rects the Agency to use funds from the appropriate Geographic Pro-
gram to build on these implementation efforts to reduce the risk of
introduction of invasive species into the Great Lakes and Lake
Champlain. The Agency is directed to brief the Committee on the
details of these funding amounts with 90 days of enactment of this
act.
Indoor Air and Radiation.—The Committee recommends
$26,852,000 for Indoor Air and Radiation. The Committee encour-
ages the Agency to continue indoor air efforts in order to address
wildfire smoke, extreme heat, and other indoor air quality hazards.
The Committee recognizes the importance of safe and healthy
learning environments which includes access to clean indoor air.
The Committee supports the Agency’s Indoor Air Quality Tools for
Schools program and the ongoing grant programs to improve indoor
environmental quality in schools. Within available funds, the Com-
mittee supports technical assistance and science-based resources on
implementing source reduction strategies, sustainable ventilation,
filtration and other indoor air quality improvements for healthy
school environments.
Information Exchange/Outreach.—The Committee recommends
$77,893,000 for Information Exchange/Outreach. Tribal capacity
building is recommended at not less than $14,414,000. Environ-
mental Education is recommended at not less than $9,500,000.
International Programs.—The Committee recommends
$15,177,000. This includes funding for high-priority water and
wastewater treatment facilities along the U.S. Mexico Border to
prevent transboundary pollution, including raw sewage discharges,
harmful chemicals, and large amounts of debris. The Committee
recognizes that cross-border water infrastructure systems and
projects are inadequate for current challenges, including for im-
pacts from transboundary pollution events and security risks. The
Committee directs the Agency to ensure robust funding is directed
to border areas with the highest water and sewage pollution and
projects located near Ports of Entry critical to border security ef-
forts while continuing to ensure projects selected have appropriate
sponsors, funding, and means for sustainable operations. The Com-
mittee requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this act
on progress for a sewage pathogen prediction model, expansion of
the South Bay International Water Treatment Plant, and
prioritization of funding for the Border Water Infrastructure Grant
Program.
Pesticide Licensing.—The Committee recommends $115,375,000.
The Committee continues the direction contained in Senate Report

100
118–83. The Committee recommends that the Agency ensure that
any epidemiological study or data considered by the Agency for reg-
ulatory decisionmaking in the pesticide review process meets ap-
propriate data requirements and peer review and consider whether
to update its guidance accordingly.
The Committee recognizes more resources are necessary to up-
date the Framework for Incorporating Human Epidemiologic and
Incident Data in Risk Assessments for Pesticides. The Committee
directs the Agency to continue to update and refine its draft
Rodenticide Strategy to include stakeholder input on the feasibility
of mitigation measures, measurable feedback on their effectiveness
at minimizing exposure to nontarget wildlife, and to listed species
and their habitat. Finally, the Committee notes the Agency’s re-
view of neonicotinoid insecticides on birds, insects, and the environ-
ment in addition to the tests regularly undertaken as part of pes-
ticide registration.
The Committee is concerned by the timeliness and pace of oper-
ations at the Office of Pesticide Programs [OPP] and notes the stat-
utory requirements in the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act
of 2022, in particular on the independent third-party assessment
(FIFRA section 33(c)(3)(C)) and extension of decision review time
periods (FIFRA section 33(f)(5)(A)), are not being met. Such delays
and uncertainty deter potential applicants and fundamentally un-
dercut the program’s impact. Therefore, within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act, the Committee directs EPA to report back to the
Committee of EPA’s receipt of the third party audit final report in-
cluding how the Agency will ensure there are adequate personnel
levels to meet statutory obligations and identifying areas where
staffing is necessary to reduce backlog. The Committee expects
OPP to prioritize resources to meet statutory deadlines and re-
quirements in a transparent manner.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (Public Law 94–580).—
The recommendation includes $120,650,000. The Committee appre-
ciates EPA’s work to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic
and other waste in waterways and oceans.
Of funds recommended under the Resource Conservation and Re-
covery Act program area, $9,000,000 is for implementation of a
Federal permit program for coal combustion residuals in non-
participating States, as authorized under section 4005(d)(2)(B) of
the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(2)(B)), or to pro-
vide technical assistance to States establishing their own permit-
ting program under section 4005(d) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act
(42 U.S.C. 6945(d)).
Alaska Contaminated Sites.—The Committee recognizes the in-
justice done to Alaska Natives when, in return for settling their ab-
original rights to land under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act, the Federal Government conveyed to them thousands of con-
taminated sites which to-date largely remain contaminated because
of Federal inaction. This enduring environmental injustice poses a
significant threat to human health and the environment, including
to drinking water sources, homes, schools, and more. The Com-
mittee recommends $21,000,000 for the inventory, verification, as-
sessment, and remediation of these contaminated sites, as well as
related community outreach and involvement. The Committee rec-

101
ognizes that neither the State of Alaska nor the Agency are respon-
sible for the contamination. The Committee continues to thank the
Agency for its leadership on this longstanding environmental injus-
tice.
Toxics Risk Review and Prevention.—The Committee rec-
ommends $112,953,000 for Toxics Risk Review and Prevention ac-
tivities. The Committee reminds the Agency that the Lautenberg
Act established a shared responsibility for the taxpayer and indus-
try to contribute their share to support the TSCA program. The
Committee notes recent actions related to changes to the fee
amounts, the Agency’s total costs for administering TSCA, exemp-
tions, and modifications to requirements and timeframes, and di-
rects the Agency to provide a briefing within 60 days of enactment
of this act and a report to the Committee within 90 days of enact-
ment of this act outlining implementation of these changes.
The Committee supports the Safer Choice program and directs
that the program be funded at no less than the enacted level and
operated consistent with prior years. Given the significant impact
lead exposure has on children and their development, the Com-
mittee encourages EPA to prioritize its efforts to protect the public
from lead hazards, including working with other agencies and de-
partments to advance progress in addressing lead hazards in
homes with children and in schools.
The Committee understands the Agency’s Office of Pollution Pre-
vention and Toxics technology systems are in need of significant
modernization and notes the infusion of funds from recent con-
tinuing resolutions for these purposes. Of the funds recommended,
the Committee encourages the Agency to begin the stabilization
and modernization of relevant systems.
The Committee notes that the Agency has recently finalized a
Risk Evaluation Framework rule regarding the use of personal pro-
tective equipment. The Agency is directed to brief the Committee
about how stakeholder feedback is being considered by the Agency
within 180 days of enactment of this act.
6PPD-quinone.—The Committee continues to be concerned with
the impact that 6p-phenylene-diameine [6PPD] and its
transformant, 6PPD-quinone [6PPD-q], are having on aquatic eco-
systems. The Committee supports the Agency’s work on the recent
testing method, its efforts to evaluate and implement stormwater
management tools, and its research of safe alternatives to 6PPD.
The Committee directs the Agency to continue coordinating across
Federal and State agencies on shared priorities and to engage in
robust government-to-government consultation with impacted
Tribes. The Agency is directed to provide a report to the Committee
within 90 days of enactment of this act on 6PPD-related activities,
including the Agency’s current strategy, alternatives and storm
water management solutions, a plan for addressing potential data
gaps, recommendations for future research activities, and potential
funding sources.
Further, Congress has provided the Agency with robust tools to
address the harms caused by toxic chemicals. The Committee notes
the requirements under the Lautenberg Act for chemical sub-
stances that present an unreasonable risk to the environment, is
encouraged by the Agency’s recent decision relating to a petition re-

102
garding 6PPD, and reminds the Agency of their obligations to up-
hold Tribal treaty rights.
New Chemical Submissions.—The Committee directs the Agency
to develop and then implement an improvement plan to the New
Chemicals program with the goal of improving the timeframe for
new chemical reviews to be completed and determinations made
given the 90-day statutory deadline. The Agency is directed to sub-
mit and brief the Committee on the plan within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act. Further, the Agency is directed to enhance com-
munication, improve the transparency of the process, and commu-
nicate status of submissions with new chemicals submitters. EPA
is encouraged to accommodate pre-consultation meetings prior to
submission and improve transparency for submitters of the status
of their submissions in the review process. The Agency is directed
to brief the Committee within 120 days of enactment of this act on
these efforts.
Tiered Testing.—The Committee encourages the Agency to con-
duct an objective analysis of all relevant, reliable, and reasonably
available existing information before requiring additional testing to
fill information needs for risk-based decision-making for both new
and existing chemicals. Further, the Committee directs the Agency
to employ a tiered testing and assessment framework to address
data needs, in accordance with the law.
Ensure Clean Water: National Estuary Program/Coastal Water-
ways and Wetlands.—The Committee recommends $60,884,000, of
which the Committee recommends $850,000 per estuary for each of
the 28 national estuaries in the National Estuary Program [NEP]
authorized by section 320 of the Clean Water Act (Public Law 92–
500). The Committee also recommends at least $2,500,000 in com-
petitive grants under the NEP.
National Estuary Program.—The Committee supports the Na-
tional Estuary Program [NEP] and believes that estuaries provide
critical ecosystem services that protect human health and public
safety. These include water filtration, flood control, habitat en-
hancement and restoration, shoreline stabilization, erosion preven-
tion, and the protection of coastal communities during hurricanes
and storms. The Committee recognizes that many industries rely
on healthy estuaries, and the Committee has provided funding to
ensure the protection of these critical ecosystems.

notes concerns of the Agency’s analysis of costs and feasibility in
the proposed rule published on January 23, 2024. The Agency is di-
rected to report to the Committees on the economic analyses under-
lying each option in the proposed rule within 30 days of enactment
of this act.
Ensure Safe Water.—The Committee recommends $117,000,000.
The Committee recommends funding via the State and Tribal As-
sistance Grant account to support monitoring for unregulated con-
taminants under section 1445(a)(2)(C) of the Safe Drinking Water
Act and urges the Agency to proceed expeditiously to implement
this program. The Agency is directed to brief the Committee on the
Agency’s implementation plan within 180 days of the enactment of
this act. The Committee appreciates the completion of the 2024
Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey Assessment and rec-
ognizes the assessment results in a substantial increase in drink-
ing water infrastructure need since the sixth assessment.
The Committee is concerned about the availability of safe drink-
ing water curing national emergencies and natural disasters. The
Committee directs the Agency to collaborate with State govern-
ments on the development of a standardized pre-approval process
consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements for use of
mobile water treatment systems that demonstrate defined capabili-
ties for up to 180 days. The Agency is further directed to report to
the Committees, within 120 days of enactment of this act, a report
outlining coordination efforts and actions taken.
The Committee is concerned by the long processing time for Un-
derground Injection Control Class VI well applications and the
small number of final decisions approved by the Agency. The Com-
mittee urges greater priority be given to these permits within the
Agency, including reviewing State applications for primacy.
The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for the Agency’s contin-
ued work within the Underground Injection Control [UIC] program
related to Class VI wells for geologic sequestration to help develop

104
expertise and capacity at the Agency and process primacy applica-
tions.
In addition, the Committee recommends $1,200,000 to support
Class VI regulator education and training programs in conjunction
with States, or other eligible entities such as an association of
States.
The Agency is directed to provide an update to the Committee on
the program direction regarding Underground Injection Control
Wells contained in Senate Report 118–83.
Ensure Clean Water.—The Committee recommends $242,292,000.
The Committee recommends not less than the enacted level for the
WaterSense program and maintains previous program direction.
The Committee supports the Agency’s ongoing activities related
to integrated planning, which will be increasingly necessary as
States and communities work to meet their myriad clean water ob-
ligations while keeping rates affordable for water ratepayers. The
Committee recommends up to $2,000,000 for integrated planning
activities consistent with section 402(s) of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342(s)).
The Committee continues to appreciate EPA’s work to advance
water recycling through the National Water Reuse Action Plan.
The Committee directs the Water Reuse Interagency Working
Group to analyze the public benefit of a Federal investment tax in-
centive that will encourage and leverage private investment in
water reuse and recycling infrastructure.
The Committee notes the Agency’s consideration of effluent limit
guidelines and biosolids regulations with respect to PFAS chemi-
cals. Within available funds, the Committee encourages the Agen-
cy, through full-time equivalents [FTEs] and extramural funding,
to expeditiously collect data and take action to better protect com-
munities impacted by discharges of PFAS.
Urban Waters.—The Committee recommends $1,500,000 for the
Urban Waters program.
Drinking Water Quality.—The Committee directs the Agency to
provide a briefing not later than 60 days following the enactment
of this act on resources available for the Agency to assist States
and counties with a high prevalence of violations of drinking water
regulations, such as Wyoming County and McDowell County in
southern West Virginia.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance with respect to funding provided under this ac-
count.
Community Air Quality Monitoring.—As part of the Agency’s en-
hanced air quality monitoring effort, the Committee urges the
Agency to prioritize air quality monitoring systems that yield fre-
quently repeated measurements of pollutants, cumulative impacts
approaches, and identify hotspots or areas of persistent elevated
levels of pollutants localized to and caused by the characteristics of
a specific geographic location. The Committee expects the Agency
to utilize this information to provide regularly updated data to
overburdened and marginalized communities and for public aware-
ness, enforcement purposes where applicable, and other activities.
Transboundary Watersheds.—The Committee directs the Agency
to continue and expand its work coordinating with Federal, State,

105
local, and Tribal agencies to monitor and reduce transboundary
mining pollution in the Kootenai watershed and other U.S.-British
Columbia transboundary watersheds. The Committee notes that
U.S. and Canada have provided a joint reference to the Inter-
national Joint Commission for the development of an action plan
to reduce and mitigate transboundary water pollution. The Com-
mittee supports efforts to compliment the Commission’s work. The
Committee recommends $2,000,000 for such monitoring, manage-
ment, and interagency activities in U.S.-British Columbia trans-
boundary watersheds. The Committee directs the Agency to allo-
cate these funds in its fiscal year 2025 operating plan to the appro-
priate program project area for carrying out these activities. The
Committee reminds the Agency of the direction in the explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 117–103 to brief the Com-
mittee within 90 days on the Agency’s progress to document base-
line conditions and mining-related impacts, and any additional
staff or resources needed for this project.
Small Refinery Relief.—The Committee recognizes that the Re-
newable Fuels Standard [RFS] under Clean Air Act section
211(o)(9) provides that EPA may exempt small refineries from com-
pliance with the RFS in certain circumstances and that a small re-
finery ‘‘may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension
of the exemption for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-
ship.’’
Pre-Commercial Thinning.—The Committee recognizes that pre-
commercial thinning from non-Federal forestland that is not eco-
logically sensitive forestland can qualify as renewable biomass for
purposes of the RFS under the provisions detailed in 40 CFR
80.1401. The Committee directs the Agency to support other Fed-
eral agencies leading efforts to enhance markets for low-grade and
low-value wood. The Agency is further directed to brief the Com-
mittee on these efforts within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Ethylene Oxide.—The Committee notes previous Agency action
on ethylene oxide emissions and encourages continued collaboration
with stakeholders.
Asbestos.—As the Agency continues to find the risks associated
with exposure to asbestos unreasonable, the Committee encourages
the Agency to expeditiously finalize safeguards, including to ad-
dress gaps in risk evaluations that protect communities from fur-
ther exposure.
Output-Based Regulations.—The Committee encourages EPA to
inform States of applicable tools, such as output-based regulations,
that will encourage fuel efficiency as an air pollution prevention
measure and assist States in meeting environmental and energy
goals.
Further, the Committee requests additional information about
the state of manufacturing decarbonization. The Committee re-
quests a briefing within 120 days regarding the regulatory barriers
and costs, potential for reducing emissions emitted throughout
manufacturing processes permitting, and waste utilization opportu-
nities.
Chemical Reviews.—The Committee continues the direction con-
tained in Senate Report 118–83.

106
Children and Other Sensitive Populations.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of improving the internal and exterior envi-
ronments at K–12 schools. In order to ensure the Administration
is providing the most comprehensive information regarding oppor-
tunities for assistance to schools, the Committee requires the Agen-
cy to work with the Departments of Energy and Education, includ-
ing to update the requirements and report required by the Energy
Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–260). In executing this, the Committee
recommends new and existing opportunities for schools to improve
their environments for students, reduce emissions, and eliminate
frequently-littered plastic sources.
Northwest Area Contingency Plan Critical Energy Infrastructure
Hub Resiliency Study.—The Committee is concerned by the poten-
tial environmental impacts from oil spills in the Columbia River
Basin as a result of a potential seismic event. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to update the Area Contingency Plan and to
collaborate with institutions of higher education and State, local,
and Tribal governments to work with the community to develop
earthquake resilient plans in urban areas and recommends
$1,000,000 within Ensure Clean Water program project area for
this purpose.
Electric Arc Furnace Steel Slag.—The Committee notes the Agen-
cy’s efforts to evaluate EAF steel slag and encourages the Agency
to be consistent, where appropriate, with regulations governing
blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace, and open hearth furnace slag.
Prescribed Burns.—The Committee recognizes that prescribed
burns have proven to be an effective and necessary tool to combat
catastrophic wildfires and notes the implementation tools to sup-
port communities consistent with enacted law. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to develop additional tools for reducing the re-
sources required to pursue exceptional events documentation for
prescribed burns.

Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance with respect to funding provided under this ac-
count.
Contaminants of Emerging Concern.—The Committee rec-
ommends that Emergency Response and Removal activities include
collaborative work with State, Tribal, and local governments to
help communities address contaminants of emerging concern. Fur-
thermore, the Committee recommends that the Agency expedi-
tiously remediate Superfund sites contaminated by these emerging
contaminants, including PFAS, and provide technical assistance
and support to States and Tribes during the remedial cleanup proc-
ess.
Tribal Guidance.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
government-to-government Tribal consultation, as well as the ne-

108
cessity to honor Tribal treaty rights and resources protected by
treaties. EPA is directed to fully implement the Agency’s Guidance
for Discussing Tribal Treaty Rights to ensure Agency actions ade-
quately consider treaty rights proactively throughout the consulta-
tion process.
Bubbly Creek, Illinois.—The Committee supports the inclusion of
the restoration of the South Fork of the South Branch of the Chi-
cago River known as ‘‘Bubbly Creek’’ in its Lakewide Management
Plan. The Committee directs the Agency to maximize its partner-
ships and resources to ensure that no further delays impede res-
toration. The Committee directs the Agency, in close coordination
with the Army Corps of Engineers, to expedite interagency discus-
sions on a project management structure that will allow the project
to move to construction. The Committee directs EPA to update the
Committee on the status of negotiations within 30 days and to fi-
nalize a plan to move to construction within 180 days of enactment
of this act.
Manganese.—The Committee is concerned about manganese soil
contamination in Chicago and encourages EPA to clean up all af-
fected areas to the lowest possible limits for residential screening
and monitoring to protect public health. The Committee encourages
further community engagement as EPA monitors and tests con-
taminated sites as well as continued EPA assistance to assess and
safely clean up affected areas.
LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $89,214,000

ity is included in the table accompanying this report.
STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,381,745,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,386,109,000
The Committee recommends $4,386,109,000 for State and Tribal
Assistance Grants, The detailed allocation of funding by program
and activity is included in the table accompanying this report. Pro-
gram directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the
following narrative.

109
Infrastructure Assistance.—The Committee recommends
$3,279,776,000 for Infrastructure Assistance. The Committee is
aware that the Agency requires a certified operator in order to re-
lease funds for certain water and sanitation funding; however,
some communities do not have a community system for either, or
access to a certified operator. Therefore, the Committee directs the
Agency to work with the Indian Health Service and those commu-
nities that lack water and sanitation systems, as well as a certified
operator, to prevent the potential loss of funding and develop a
training plan for operator certification.
State Revolving Funds.—The Committee recommends
$2,764,962,000 for State Revolving Funds [SRFs] to support drink-
ing and clean water infrastructure. These funds provide support for
critical investments in water infrastructure in communities across
the country.
Infrastructure Projects.—From within funds recommended for
capitalization grants for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund
and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, the Committee rec-
ommends $349,668,000 from the Clean Water SRF and
$247,569,000 from the Drinking Water SRF be for Congressionally
Directed Spending grants for the construction of drinking water,
waste-water, and storm-water infrastructure and for water quality
protection. Each project shall provide not less than 20 percent
matching funds from non-Federal sources, unless approved for a
waiver. Applicable Federal requirements that would apply to a
Clean Water State Revolving Fund or Drinking Water State Re-
volving Fund project grant recipient shall apply to a grantee receiv-
ing a congressionally directed spending grant under this section.
The Committee notes that the following funding sources are to be
treated as non-Federal funds and can be used to meet the non-Fed-
eral matching fund requirement: U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Community Development Block Grant Pro-
gram; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development Pro-
gram; and Appalachian Regional Commission grants. Funding
made available to jurisdictions through the American Rescue Plan
act of 2021 (Public Law 117–2) is considered Federal funds and
may not be applied towards the non-Federal cost share require-
ment. With approval from the project recipient, the Administrator
may provide funding by grant or cooperative agreement to States
to administer any Congressional Directed Spending projects being
co-funded by the State SRF program or to support administration
of other Congressional Directed Spending projects. A detailed list
of projects is located in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed
Spending’’ accompanying this report.
The Committee recommends a total of $597,237,000 in funding
for 291 drinking water and clean water Congressionally Directed
Spending projects.
The Committee remains concerned that EPA does not have suffi-
cient resources necessary to expeditiously implement this program
and fully support recipients as they address applicable Federal
grant requirements. Accordingly, the Committee recommends
$19,000,000 in new funding for salaries, expenses, and administra-
tion for Congressionally Directed Spending provided in previous fis-
cal years and in this act. Further, the Committee appreciates the

110
Agency’s engagement with the Committee regarding additional, po-
tential solutions to help resolve the Agency’s significant backlog of
Congressionally Directed Spending projects and directs the Agency
to identify and commence regulatory actions and other administra-
tive actions that will help obligate funding more quickly, including
to adopt state environmental reviews. Further, the Committee di-
rects the Agency to report to the Committees within 30 days of en-
actment of this act on the status of each Congressionally Directed
Spending project provided through each fiscal year since Public
Law 117–103. The Committee reminds the Agency of previous com-
mitments to seriously engage with the Committee on finding long-
term solutions to the growing backlog of CDS projects.
Cost Share Waivers for Watershed Scale Benefits.—The Com-
mittee is concerned that the Agency has limited cost share waiver
criteria for community grants within the State Revolving Funds to
direct financial benefit in areas where projects provide clear indi-
rect benefits to eligible communities and encourages EPA to reex-
amine waiver eligibility for community grant projects, such as im-
proved water quality, conserved water, and drought resiliency.
1944 Water Treaty.—The Committee recommends the Agency to
coordinate with NADBank, the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
and the U.S. Department of the Interior to produce a comprehen-
sive report to improve the water storage and systems of the region
affected by the 1944 water treaty. The Agency is directed to work
with NADBank to consult with relevant constituents from the
State of Texas, Rio Grande Valley agriculture, appropriate Texas
water agencies, and the IBWC as necessary, to compile a report.
The Committee directs the Agency to report to the Committee with-
in 1 year of enactment of this act. Further, the Committee directs
the Agency to work with NADBank to re-establish the Water Infra-
structure fund as authorized to provide concessional financing for
water infrastructure to areas affected by the 1944 water treaty and
to address the need for water security. The Committee recommends
the Agency to work with NADBank to prioritize projects for water
infrastructure that will address water security in areas with a se-
vere need in the United States.
Diesel Emission Reduction Act Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommends $60,000,000 to continue a grant program to reduce diesel
emissions, including through electrification, as authorized by sec-
tion 793 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–58).
Targeted Airshed Grants.—The Committee recommends
$68,800,000, an increase of $1,000,000 to fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, for Targeted Airshed Grants. These grants shall be distrib-
uted on a competitive basis to nonattainment areas that EPA de-
termines are ranked as the top five most polluted areas relative to
annual ozone or particulate matter 2.5 standards, as well as the
top five areas based on the 24-hour particulate matter 2.5 standard
where the design values exceed the 35 mg/m3 standard. To deter-
mine these areas, the Agency shall use the most recent design val-
ues calculated from validated air quality data. The Committee
notes that these funds are available for emission reduction activi-
ties deemed necessary for compliance with national ambient air
quality standards and included in a State Implementation Plan
submitted to EPA. The Committee reminds the Agency of the re-

111
port request contained in Senate Report 118–83 and seeks updates
with how more recent funds were allocated. EPA shall provide a re-
port to the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this act that
includes a table showing how fiscal year 2024 and 2025 funds were
allocated. The table shall also include grant recipients and metrics
for anticipated or actual results.
Reducing Lead in Drinking Water.—The Committee encourages
these funds to be prioritized and distributed to assist the commu-
nities most burdened by lead service lines in meeting the Adminis-
tration’s 10-year goal as outlined in the Lead Pipe and Paint Plan.
Sewer Overflow Control Grants.—The Committee recommends
$39,000,000 to continue a grant program to control and treat sewer
overflows and stormwater, as authorized in section 4106 of Public
Law 115–270.
Wildfire Smoke Preparedness.—The Committee recommends
$8,500,000, an increase of $1,500,000 to fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, for wildfire smoke preparedness grants. These grants shall be
distributed on a competitive basis to States, federally recognized
Tribes, public pre-schools, local educational agencies as defined in
20 U.S.C. 7801(30), and non-profit organizations, for assessment,
prevention, control, or abatement of wildland fire smoke hazards in
community buildings, including schools as defined in 20 U.S.C.
3610(6), and related activities, and that serve disadvantaged com-
munities or vulnerable populations. The Federal share of the costs
of such activities shall not exceed 90 percent except that the Ad-
ministrator may waive such cost share requirement in the case of
facilities located in economically distressed communities. A max-
imum of 25 percent of grant funding under this paragraph during
this fiscal year may go to recipients in any one State. Further, the
Committee encourages the Agency to expand its efforts to select re-
cipients that research and identify methods to reduce smoke expo-
sure during wildland fire episodes, in addition to current eligibility
categories, and improve wildfire smoke data collection, monitoring,
prediction and community preparedness.
Technical Assistance for Wastewater Treatment Works.—The
Agency is directed to allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of
enactment of this act.
State & Tribal Assistance Grants—Other.—The Committee rec-
ommends $20,364,000 for Congressionally Directed Spending
grants. Further detail on these projects is located in the table titled
‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending’’ accompanying this report.
Stormwater Centers of Excellence.—The Committee supports ad-
dressing the unique challenges posed by managing stormwater and
runoff in different regions of the country, including impacts on
varying ecosystems. The Committee notes the importance of ad-
vancing stormwater management technologies and techniques to
protect endangered aquatic species. The Committee recommends
$2,000,000 for the Agency’s Centers of Excellence for the
Stormwater Infrastructure Technology Program.
Categorical Grants.—For Categorical Grants to States, Tribes,
and other environmental partners for the implementation of dele-
gated programs, the Committee recommends $1,106,333,000. The
Committee recommends additional resources to support State and
Tribal capacity to address environmental challenges and protect

112
the public. The Committee believes that it is vital for the Agency
to work collaboratively with State and Tribal partners and support
their work to implement delegated environmental programs.
Categorical Grant: Nonpoint Source (Sec. 319).—The Committee
recommends $174,500,000. The Committee expects the Agency to
examine the allocation formula to ensure that resources are spent
in areas with the most pressing need.
Categorical Grant: Public Water System Supervision.—The Com-
mittee recommends $115,990,000 in Public Water System Super-
vision Grants. Of the funds recommended, $12,000,000 is to further
support States, Territories, and Tribes in addressing PFAS and
other contaminants of emerging concern as they carry out their
Public Water System Supervision programs.
Categorical Grant: State and Local Air Quality Management.—
The recommendation includes $235,922,000 for State and Local Air
Quality Management. The Committee recommends increased re-
sources to help expand the capacity of air pollution control agencies
to implement programs to address greenhouse gas emissions, im-
prove air quality monitoring and outcomes, and reduce dispropor-
tionate exposure to dangerous pollution in communities. The Agen-
cy is directed to allocate funds for this program using the same for-
mula as fiscal year 2015. Should the Agency seek to change the for-
mula, the Agency shall submit a proposal in its fiscal year 2027
budget justification for consideration by the Committee.
Categorical Grant: Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste
Grants.—The Committee recommends $101,500,000 for hazardous
waste financial assistance grants. The bill includes a provision sup-
porting categorical grant funds for the purpose of providing grants
to assist States in the development and implementation of State
programs for the control of coal combustion residuals under section
2301 of the Water and Waste Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–322),
and the Agency is directed to continue funding of not less than
$4,000,000 from the Hazardous Waste Financial Assistance cat-
egorical grants program project for this purpose. The Committee
notes that funds awarded under the authority provided by this act
are not subject to section 3011 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act
(Public Law 89–272).
Additionally, of the funding recommended, $3,500,000 is to sup-
port post-consumer materials management or recycling facilities,
consistent with section 302(a) of the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act (Public
Law 116–224).
Categorical Grant: Tribal General Assistance Program.—The
Committee recommends $72,200,000 for Tribal General Assistance.
Categorical Grant: Wetland Program Development Grant.—The
Committee notes that this program, authorized under section
104(b)(3) of the Clean Water Act, allows for a wide range of activi-
ties, and encourages the Agency to coordinate with States and
Tribes to ensure existing wetlands programs may successfully uti-
lize these funds.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee has provided the fol-
lowing additional guidance with respect to funding provided under
this account.
PFAS.—The Committee supports EPA’s implementation of fund-
ing for PFAS and emerging contaminants under the bipartisan In-

113
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58). Con-
gress provided a total of $10,000,000,000 to address PFAS and
other emerging contaminants through the Drinking Water State
Revolving Fund, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the
Small and Disadvantaged Communities Program that includes a
critical state response to contaminants program. The Committee
encourages EPA to prioritize support to communities including pro-
viding technical assistance, information sessions, grant workshops,
as well as extensive advertising and outreach to ensure States,
Tribes and local entities are aware of and can fully participate in
opportunities to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants
provided by the bipartisan infrastructure law. The bill clarifies
Congressional intent that funding provided in fiscal year 2025, in-
cluding from Public Law 117–58, for grants for addressing contami-
nants under subsections (a) through (j) of section 1459A of the Safe
Drinking Water (42 U.S.C. 300j–19a) may be used by a State to
provide assistance to benefit one or more owners of drinking water
wells that are not public water systems or connected to a public
water system for necessary and appropriate activities related to a
contaminant pursuant to subsection (j) of section 1459A of the Safe
Drinking Water Act. In implementing this funding, the Committee
directs the Agency to encourage States to prioritize beneficiaries
that make less than the average household income for that state.
Use of Iron and Steel.—The recommendation includes language
in title IV general provisions that stipulates requirements for the
use of iron and steel in State Revolving Fund projects, and the rec-
ommendation includes only the following guidance. The Committee
acknowledges that EPA may issue a waiver of said requirements
for de minimis amounts of iron and steel building materials. The
Committee emphasizes that any coating processes that are applied
to the external surface of iron and steel components that otherwise
qualify under the procurement preference shall not render such
products ineligible for the procurement preference regardless of
where the coating processes occur, provided that final assembly of
the products occurs in the United States.
Schools and Clean School Bus Program.—The Committee directs
the Agency to conduct outreach to potential applicants in histori-
cally disadvantaged, underserved, low-income, and rural commu-
nities regarding the availability of resources for the replacement of
existing school buses. The Agency should collaborate with the De-
partments of Energy and Transportation to ensure technical assist-
ance, funding resources, and procedures to ensure that mechanics
and drivers have the training needed, that charging infrastructure
is appropriately installed, and the investment in clean school buses
protects and creates high-quality jobs throughout the domestic sup-
ply chain. Further, the Committee encourages the Agency to con-
tinue to work with the Departments of Energy and Education for
educational institutions to expand the transition to clean energy
and transportation.
Regional Water Commissions.—The Committee continues the di-
rection contained in Senate Report 118–83.
Food Waste.—The Committee encourages the Agency to supple-
ment education through the Recycling Education Outreach pro-
gram for a National Education Campaign on Food Waste Reduction

114
to be carried out in partnership with other stakeholders as detailed
in the Draft National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste
and Recycling Organics. The Committee requests a briefing within
180 days of enactment of this act, including regarding funding for
anaerobic digestion and food waste reduction infrastructure grants
in the Waste Minimization and Recycling Program for the Solid
Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant program.
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $72,274,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 64,510,000
The Committee recommends a total of $64,510,000 for the Water
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program [WIFIA]. The
Committee recommends $7,640,000 to assist with the administra-
tive expenses for the WIFIA program and up to $5,000,000 for the
implementation of the Securing Required Funding for Water Infra-
structure Now Act, as authorized by section 4201 of Public Law
115–270. Greater investment in the replacement of aging infra-
structure will help mitigate nationwide issues the Committee is
tracking related to contaminants such as lead and arsenic, Com-
bined Sewer Overflows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows, and the
pressing need to improve water delivery.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

FOREST SERVICE
The Forest Service [Service], a bureau of the Department of Agri-
culture, manages 193 million acres in 44 States and territories. In
addition, the Service maintains a system of research stations and
experimental forests and ranges throughout the country. The Serv-
ice also provides technical and financial assistance to private land-
owners, States, and communities to help sustain the Nation’s
urban and rural forests.
White Oak.—White Oak occupies 103 million acres in the eastern
U.S. and is critical for wildlife, biodiversity, and forest products.
Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Service is directed to
report to the Committee on efforts, including monitoring and re-
search, the Service is involved in to regenerate white oak in na-
tional forests and on State, Tribal, private, and other non-Federal
lands. Additionally, the Committee recognizes the importance of
seed stock and tree nurseries in efforts to regenerate white oak
populations.
Wildfire Recovery.—The Service is directed to partner with
Tribes to prioritize recovery on lands impacted by wildfire. Within
90 days of date of enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter,
the Service is directed to brief the Committee on these efforts.
21st Century Conservation Service Corps and Job Corps.—The
Service offers workforce development experiences for youth from
rural, suburban, and urban communities through a portfolio of pro-
grams including the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, the
Youth Conservation Corps, and hundreds of Public Lands Corps
and 21st Century Conservation Service Corps partnerships with
non-government organizations. The Committee appreciates the
Service’s continued focus on establishing additional work-based
learning projects that better integrate these programs into agency
operations and creating additional career ladders throughout the
Department of Agriculture for Job Corps graduates. The Com-
mittee directs the Service to continue to expand advanced wildfire
training offerings at Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.

and restoration efforts in the greater Lake Tahoe fireshed, at no
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted levels as stipulated in the
tables incorporated by reference for National Forest System and
State, Private, and Tribal Forestry.
FOREST SERVICE OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,150,000,000
Committee Recommendation ................................................................ 1,106,000,000
The Committee recommends $1,106,000,000 for Forest Service
Operations. The detailed allocation of funding by program and ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report.
FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $300,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 308,497,000
The Committee recommends $308,497,000 for Forest and Range-
land Research. Program directives and specific funding require-
ments are noted in the following narrative.
The Forest Service research and development program rep-
resents the premier forest science institution in the world. The
basic and applied research produced by these Federal scientists
and collaborators is integral to improving the health of our forests
and grasslands by addressing threats like climate change, invasive
species and diseases, biodiversity loss, and uncharacteristic fire.
Research and development is also important to the health of rural
economies through the Service’s work to deliver new technologies
and uses for woody biomass. The Committee provides the invest-
ments and directed projects in this bill in anticipation of more in-
novative solutions for sustainable management and biomass utili-
zation to come.
Forest Inventory and Analysis.—The bill provides $32,197,000 for
the Forest Inventory and Analysis [FIA] program, the authoritative
national data source for forests and forest carbon data, which pro-
vides comprehensive data collection, analysis and reporting on for-
est conditions, including urban and community forest environ-
ments, across all forestlands for use by all forest stakeholders.
While Federal and non-Federal teams work to collect the data,
the Committee recognizes the efforts of the Forest Service research
and development staff who are responsible for analyzing and trans-
lating the data into actionable products. The Committee directs the
Service to provide a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this
act detailing the interdependency of FIA and other Research and
Development programs.
To increase data resolution of products based on the FIA plot
network and to develop ways to deal with nonresponse on the FIA
plot network, the Service should work to complete the small area
estimation effort with partners, and continue development, dem-
onstration, and deployment of advanced forest carbon monitoring,
reporting, and verification technologies such as LiDAR,
hyperspectral monitoring, uncrewed aircraft systems, in collabora-
tion with Research and Development and other partners.

117
Research and Development Programs.—The Committee rec-
ommends $60,300,000 for base research activities and $212,000,000
for salaries and expenses.
The Committee supports the current structure consisting of the
five regional research stations, the International Institute of Trop-
ical Forestry, and the Forest Products Laboratory, and directs that
each of the existing facilities and programs be funded at least at
the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Service is reminded that the
benefit to the agency and public should be identified prior to initi-
ating a project and that the research priority should be for projects
requested by or benefitting the agency’s mission first, not those
from external entities. The Committee also expects that funds col-
lected from reimbursable agreements by the research program will
be reinvested at the station level into programs of work, rather
than used to offset salaries and expenses.
The Committee notes that the National Agroforestry Center
should be appropriately staffed to provide technology transfer and
technical assistance delivery to meet increasing producer demand
for agroforestry technical assistance and scale implementation of
agroforestry practices, thus advancing the health, diversity, climate
mitigation and adaptation, and productivity of working lands,
waters, and communities.
Forest Products Laboratory.—The Committee expects the Lab to
continue research to advance wood markets, including research on
the amount of carbon stored annually in harvested wood products,
evaluated by specific wood producing sectors, setting the stage for
the completion of this carbon storage accounting on an annual
basis. The Committee further notes that the Lab should prioritize
wood innovation tech transfer and science deployment while pro-
tecting the taxpayer’s intellectual property, and fill positions that
are necessary for these efforts.
Needle Blight Mitigation.—The Committee recognizes the effect
of non-native insect pests and fungal pathogens on pine forests and
industrial wood plantations, particularly in loblolly pines, across
the southeastern United States and includes $3,000,000 to continue
collaborative research to determine the distribution and movement
of needle pathogens, understand the disease cycle and the environ-
mental factors that drive the emergence and distribution of the
needle pathogens, and determine if the appearance is due to more
aggressive strains of the pathogens and the origins of the patho-
gens.
Experimental Forests in the Northeast.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of experimental forests in the northeastern
United States for assessing the long-term response of eastern white
pine and northern hardwoods to various forest management pre-
scriptions, controlled burning and natural factors, such as insects,
disease, weather events and climate change. The continued collec-
tion of data and sustained research on experimental forests in the
Northeast is essential for predicting future forest conditions to in-
form management on National Forest System lands. This research
is also critical for advising private landowners and the forest indus-
try on how to build resilience into forest stewardship.
The Committee recognizes the importance of filling vacant re-
search and leadership positions with qualified personnel and en-

118
courages the Service to expeditiously fill these vacancies with fund
provided in this act.
Northwest Wildland and Rangeland Fire Science Consortium.—
The Committee continues to recognize the growing economic and
ecological threat wildfires pose to communities in the Northwest.
The Committee provides $1,000,000 to partner with a consortium
of higher education institutions with a demonstrated history of col-
laborating on forest and rangeland wildfire research in the North-
west region to advance the design and implementation of geo-
graphically, ecologically, and culturally relevant science-based
treatments at scale across public, private, and Tribal forests and
rangelands. This program should include all stakeholders, includ-
ing industry partners.
Research Funding Priorities.—The Service is reminded that fund-
ing for the following research initiatives is in addition to funds oth-
erwise provided to individual research stations and therefore is not
to be factored into base allocations for the stations. These items are
further incorporated by reference in the table accompanying this
report.
—$6,000,000 to support the Northeastern States Research Coop-
erative, a collaboration among universities in Maine, New
Hampshire, New York, and Vermont, sponsoring research to
sustain the health of northern forest ecosystems and commu-
nities, develop new forest products and improve forest biodiver-
sity management. Within the available funds, the Cooperative
is directed to continue the work of the Digital Forestry Sys-
tems Research Consortium to advance digital forest manage-
ment systems to increase ecosystem services and operational
efficiency in eastern forests.
—$2,000,000 to support Forest-based Cellulose Nanomaterials re-
search, including material forms, manufacturing processes, and
technology transfer.
—$1,800,000 to support the development of engineering solutions

Risk Mitigation within the National Forest System by col-
lecting data using drones, radar, and weather stations to model
future flood scenarios and glacier changes.
—$4,000,000 to support Wildfire and Watersheds cooperative re-
search to advance understandings and innovative solutions to
address wildfire impacts on forested source water, downstream
clean water, and water treatability.
—$3,000,000 to support Wildland Urban Interface Workforce De-
velopment through university-led research and partnerships to
better understand fires in the wildland-urban interface, im-
prove workforce development for wildfire management profes-
sionals, and improve the safety and efficiency of wildland fire-
fighting techniques.
—$1,000,000 to support a Northwest wildland and rangeland fire
science consortium.
—$1,500,000 to support Biomass Commercialization with Forest
Products Laboratory university partnerships, including lumber
standards, mass timber construction, and durability.
—$1,000,000 to support Outbreak Timber Salvage Research re-
lated to drought and needle tip blight and ips beetle outbreaks.

119
—$500,000 to support Pacific Northwest Fish Modeling work to
better understand the upper limit of fish distribution.
—$3,000,000 to support Needle Blight Mitigation collaborative
research.
Joint Fire Science.—The Committee recommends $4,000,000 to
support the Joint Fire Science program. Combined with $4,000,000
in the Department of Interior Wildland Fire Management account,
a total of $8,000,000 is provided for this program. The Committee
expects the program to continue to work with a broad network of
academic researchers to address the range of research needs to bet-
ter address fundamental connections and interactions across all
temporal phases of wildfires and enhance wildfire resilience. The
Committee expects the program to focus on salient issues such as
understanding smoke impacts, identifying drivers of fire costs, ana-
lyzing fire behavior, and quantifying fire’s effects on resources and
communities. The Committee urges the Governing Board to re-
spond to the recommendations included in the Report of the
Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, including
by establishing mechanisms to partner with the National Science
Foundation and the Department of Defense to address scientific in-
novation and technology development related to wildfires, post-fire
monitoring and recovery, and watershed health-related fire re-
search.

Within the funds provided, $1,000,000 is to support the Forest
Ecosystem Monitoring Cooperative which supports existing aca-
demic partnerships in the Northern Forest Region.

120
Sudden Oak Death.—Since 2001, the Service has been treating
Sudden Oak Death infestations on public lands in Oregon and Cali-
fornia in partnership with the Bureau of Land Management. The
Committee expects the Service to continue these efforts and rec-
ommends $2,000,000 to support Sudden Oak Death treatments and
partnerships with States and private landowners.
Spruce Budworm.—The Committee remains concerned about in-
creased threat levels of spruce budworm on Federal, State, private,
and Tribal forested lands in the Northeastern United States.
Therefore, the Committee provides 42,000,000 for Cooperative
lands forest health management, of which, $10,000,000 shall be
used to support Spruce Budworm Mitigation activities in the East-
ern United States.
Western Bark Beetle.—The Committee remains concerned about
the high rate of tree mortality in National Forests due to insect
and disease outbreaks. In many cases throughout the West, bark
beetle infestation threatens local communities and non-Federal
lands located outside of a National Forest unit. The Committee in-
structs the Service to prioritize the use of funding provided under
the Western Bark Beetle Initiative for projects located on non-Fed-
eral land in cases where state government partners identify a need
related to community wildfire protection.
Cogongrass Management.—Within the funds provided,
$3,000,000, is Cogongrass Management Pilot Program for the For-
est Service to work with Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv-
ice to provide grants to State departments of agriculture and for-
estry commissions in States identified in the final environmental
assessment published in the Federal Register on September 23,
2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 59735), to combat and treat cogongrass through
established cogongrass control programs.
Urban and Community Forestry.—The Committee recognizes the
need to restore and improve urban forests to combat exotic invasive
woody species. The Service should continue regional multi-organi-
zational collaborations to support conservation efforts for effective
urban and community forestry grants.
The Service is further directed to work with the Office of Urban
Agriculture to provide a report outlining a strategy for capitalizing
on Forest Service authorities to use agroforestry to develop green
infrastructure, resilient local food sheds, and workforce develop-
ment, within 180 days of enactment of this act.
State, Private, and Tribal Forestry Performance Measures.—The
Committee recognizes the integral relationship between the Service
and State forestry agencies in delivering the scale and coordination
necessary to meet the Nation’s forestry priorities, including State
and local wildland fire response capacity, wildfire prevention and
mitigation, addressing insects and diseases impacting forested
landscapes, and empowering private forestland owners. The Com-
mittee directs the Service, in coordination with State forestry agen-
cies, to utilize existing data collection platforms in establishing per-
formance measures for State, Private, and Tribal Forestry pro-
grams, and to deliver a performance report to the Committee with-
in 270 days of enactment of this act.
Forest Resource Information and Analysis.—The Committee rec-
ommends $19,594,000 for congressionally directed spending in this

121
program. In order to align with 2022 agency guidance, no match is
required for these projects. A detailed list of projects is included in
the ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spending’’ table accompanying this
report.
International Programs and Trade.—The Committee rec-
ommends $20,000,000 for the Forest Service Office of International
Programs. The Committee supports the International Program for
its benefits to American forestry stakeholders. The Committee di-
rects the Office to collaborate with other Department of Agriculture
agencies to continue to promote American wood product exports by
implementing applied research, technical cooperation, financial as-
sistance, marketing initiatives, and other support mechanisms. The
Committee expects that funds collected from reimbursable agree-
ments will be reinvested into programs of work, rather than used
to offset salaries and expenses.
In fiscal year 2023, the Committee included language providing
for the creation of a supporting organization in order to com-
plement and expand the impact of the Office of International Pro-
grams. Now that the Forest Service International Foundation has
been established, the Committee encourages continued cooperative
support and investment by the Forest Service. While the Com-
mittee directs that no match shall be required from the Founda-
tion, the Foundation is expected to prioritize securing external
funding, as appropriate. The Service is directed to brief the Com-
mittee on funding and the state of the partnership within 90 days
of enactment of this act.

The Committee recommends $1,866,143,000 for the National For-
est System. The detailed allocation of funding by program and ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report.
Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness.—The Committee rec-
ommends $47,500,000 for Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness.
These funds are used to maintain recreation sites like camp-
grounds and trails, rehabilitate recreation infrastructure like public
use cabins, improve visitor use, manage special use authorizations,
and protect heritage sites. Within these funds, $2,500,000, is pro-
vided to address trail maintenance needs within National Forests
in States and territories outside of the continental United States.
Within the funds provided, $1,000,000 is included for the Office
of Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Resources-Travel, Tourism

122
and Interpretation Program to support the Native American Tour-
ism and Improving Visitor Experience [NATIVE] Act (Public Law
114–221) Implementation, including to identify and provide tech-
nical assistance, training, and rural development support to Tribes,
Tribal organizations and Native Hawaiian organizations to promote
sustainable native tourism activities. The Committee directs the
Service, in consultation with Indian tribes, Tribal organizations,
and Native Hawaiian organizations, to identify areas where tech-
nical assistance, training, and cultural tourism development sup-
port is needed to implement the NATIVE Act. The Service shall
brief the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act, and
quarterly thereafter, on these efforts. Within the funds provided,
$3,000,000 is available to support National Recreation Areas Infra-
structure and Trails Development and to build the capacity of local
user groups and partnership organizations in National Recreation
Areas administered by the Service and established after 1997. The
Service is encouraged to evaluate how it supports the administra-
tion, cooperative management, and collaboration with the National
Park Service for the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.
Law Enforcement.—The Committee is concerned about the in-
creased financial burden that is being placed on parishes adjacent
to National Forests in the State of Louisiana. The Committee rec-
ommends an additional $86,000 to support cooperative law enforce-
ment agreements.
Grazing Management.—The Committee recommends $6,000,000
for Grazing Management. The Service is directed, to the greatest
extent practicable, to make vacant grazing allotments available to
a holder of a grazing permit or lease when lands covered by the
holder of the permit or lease are unusable because of drought or
wildfire. The Service must prioritize management of active allot-
ments that are not meeting or are inconsistent with current forest
plan standards or do not have current assessments, and reducing
the backlog of active allotments requiring analysis and new man-
agement decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act,
according to the priorities established in the Forest Service Hand-
book. The Service is directed to brief the Committee within 90 days
of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, on its progress
to relieve the backlog of fully processed permits.
Fuels Management.—The Committee recommends $175,450,000
for Hazardous Fuels and fuels management activities. Within the
funds recommended, $30,000,000 is for Wood Innovation Grants;
$15,000,000 is for the Community Wood Energy Program; and
$6,600,000 is recommended for the Southwest Ecological Restora-
tion Institutes. Wood Innovation Grants are an important tool for
creating and expanding markets for low-grade and low-value wood,
providing economic diversity for forest communities and reducing
wildfire risk in the process. The Committee notes that these efforts
can deliver a cost-effective and sustainable path to reduce excessive
hazardous fuels loads, foster long-term forest resilience, and poten-
tially aid in carbon storage. The Service must expand its efforts
that will open the door to new, widespread uses for wood-based
nanotechnology, mass timber and cross-laminated timber, fire-re-
sistant building materials, high-energy efficient wood for energy
production, affordable housing, and other promising products.

123
The Committee recognizes that investing in proactive fuels re-
duction activities has potential to mitigate the even higher costs
that result from wildfire and supports addressing the current back-
log of fuels reduction treatments, including through expanded use
of prescribed fire. Active management under substantial agency
oversight is necessary to maintain past treatments, address addi-
tional areas to reduce wildfire risk and improve wildfire resilience.
The Service is encouraged to continue seeking innovative methods
to promote broader adoption of new technologies and processing
systems to produce value-added wood products that will increase
commercial demand for biomass harvested through hazardous fuels
reduction activities.
Fuels Outcome Metrics.—The Committee is concerned that exist-
ing performance indicators for fuels management are insufficient
and directs the Service to work collaboratively across deputy areas
to define and expand the use of outcome-based performance metrics
that better capture the extent to which forest health is improved
and wildfire risk reduced. The Service shall report to the Com-
mittee on models and decision support tools to improve reporting
within 90 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter.
Fuels Contracts.—The Committee is aware that the Service is
pursuing contracting mechanisms that accelerate hazardous fuels
reduction efforts. The Committee urges the Service to utilize these
contracting mechanisms on project areas across the country, such
as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative, to prioritize forest health
and restoration, including hazardous fuels treatment, in accordance
with the Wildfire Crisis Strategy.
Prescribed Fire Strategy.—The Service is directed to develop a
national strategy for increasing the use of prescribed fire consistent
with the ecological needs of an area and brief the Committee on the
strategy within 270 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly
thereafter on implementation of the strategy.
Vegetation and Watershed Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $30,000,000 for Vegetation and Watershed Management.
The Committee recognizes that wildfire risk mitigation and aquatic
restoration efforts are critical to protecting the quantity and qual-
ity of source water on National Forest System lands that provides
drinking water and agricultural use. The Committee encourages
the Service to conduct additional outreach to water users to utilize
existing vegetation and watershed management funding to dem-
onstrate the value of restoring aquatic ecosystems to build resil-
ience to natural hazards in source watersheds, including through
the Water Source Protection Program.
Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $22,000,000 for Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management.
The Committee expects the Service to maintain no less than
$2,000,000 for threatened and endangered species activities to con-
tribute to significant recovery actions. The Committee expects the
Service to increase its efforts to recover listed plant and animal
species and take actions that will protect sensitive plant and ani-
mal species from requiring listing. The Service is directed to pro-
vide an accounting of how funds are allocated to specific recovery
programs and activities to the Committee in its congressional budg-
et justification.

124
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund.—The Com-
mittee recommends $31,000,000 for Collaborative Forest Landscape
Restoration [CFLR] and continues language allowing additional
projects to be funded with this significant expansion of the pro-
gram. CFLR is an important tool the Service has to facilitate large
scale projects on National Forests that make meaningful progress
for forest and watershed health while also creating jobs with the
generation of commercial timber. These projects come to fruition
through identifying innovative techniques for getting work done,
increasing community support for restoration projects, leveraging
capacity, expanding the scale of restoration, and creating and
maintaining jobs by a diverse set of local stakeholders who are
committed to forest restoration and sustaining rural communities.
Salaries and Expenses.—The Committee recommends
$1,459,352,000 for Salaries and Expenses, including for employees
who carry out functions funded by the Capital Improvement and
Maintenance, Range Betterment Fund, and Management of Na-
tional Forest Lands for Subsistence Uses accounts.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance related to activities funded in this account.
Black Hills National Forest.—The Committee directs the Service
to provide a briefing within 60 days of enactment of this act on his-
toric timber sale program trends in the Black Hills National Forest
and the potential impacts on forest health.
Pisgah National Forest.—The Committee directs the Service to
provide a briefing on management challenges and resulting im-
pacts to the ecosystem related to increased recreational use in the
Wilson Creek Area of the Pisgah National Forest.
Tongass National Forest.—The Service is expected to meet the
targets outlined in the current 2016 Tongass Land and Resource
Management Plan. The Committee continues the direction con-
tained in Senate Report 115–276. The bill provides funding nec-
essary to for the Service’s costs to process rights-of-way applica-
tions.
Alaska Trail Facilities.—The Committee is concerned to hear the
Service may not meet required maintenance needs for Forest Serv-
ice administered trail facilities along the Turnagain Arm corridor
within the Kenai Mountain Heritage Area and which may result in
closing trail facilities along the corridor during their peak usage
months in the summer. The Committee recognizes the Service’s re-
sponsibility to maintain trail facilities within the corridor to sup-
port public access and use of public National Forest lands and is
directed to take the steps necessary to ensure facilities within this
corridor will be operational for use, particularly in peak times of
visitation. Of the funds made available within this act, the Service
is directed to allocate the resources necessary to ensure the Service
provides necessary maintenance and activities to keep Service trail
facilities open and operational during peak visitor months.
Prairie Dog Management.—The Committee remains concerned
about the rapidly increasing levels of prairie dogs in the Dakota
Prairie Grasslands and as well their encroachment and degrada-
tion to adjacent non-Federal lands. The Committee encourages the
Service to promulgate an amendment to the 2018 Prairie Dog Man-
agement Plan which would limit occupied prairie dog habitat to not

125
more than 1.5 percent of the Federal land in any single grazing al-
lotment and ensure prairie dog control activity is conducted within
a one mile buffer between Federal land and State and private land.
Sediment Removal.—The Service shall initiate the development
of necessary guidance to establish a streamlined process to facili-
tate, when feasible, the relocation of noncontaminated, accumu-
lated sediment from behind a dam or impoundment within or adja-
cent to Forest Service lands, where such sediment impairs water
supply or electric power generation, or if left unattended, would
pose a threat to the structural integrity of the dam.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee is aware of the
Service’s interest in the use of virtual fencing to improve grazing
outcomes and riparian area health. The committee supports contin-
ued investment in virtual fencing through the Range Betterment
Fund and directs the Service to provide a report within 90 days of
enactment on rangeland improvements, benefits to wildlife habitat,
and cost savings resulting from the use of virtual fencing tech-
nologies on national forest system lands.
Rural Airstrips.—The Committee believes that rural airstrips
provide important administrative, recreational, and emergency
functions across our public lands and the Committee directs the
Department of Agriculture to assist Federal Land Managers, in-
cluding but not limited to the Bureau of Land Management, United
States Forest Service, and National Park Service, as well as the
Federal Aviation Administration in charting airstrips located on
Federal Lands that are and may be useful for administrative, rec-
reational, and emergency purposes.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $151,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 151,250,000
The Committee recommends $151,250,000 for Capital Improve-
ment and Maintenance. As in previous years, this amount is offset
with a scoring credit related to the Roads and Trails Fund. Pro-
gram directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the
following narrative. All funding for specific programs, directives, or
congressionally directed spending identified herein is in addition to
funds otherwise provided to stations and regions and therefore is
not to be taken into account when allocating those resources.

126
The Committee recognizes the importance of the Legacy Restora-
tion Fund authorized by the Great American Outdoors Act (Public
Law 116–152), which provided $1,425,000,000 over 5 years to ad-
dressing deferred maintenance. These mandatory funds augment
the appropriations from this account, which continues to be nec-
essary for new construction and to maintain Service infrastructure
so that additional projects are not added to the deferred mainte-
nance backlog.
Facilities.—The Committee recommends $31,400,000 for Facili-
ties, of which at least $4,000,000 is for firefighter housing improve-
ments.
The Committee believes that the Service should be an exemplar
in using mass timber building materials and require the use of
mass timber in the construction, renovation, or repair of its facili-
ties.
Roads.—The Committee recommends $73,000,000 for Roads. The
Service should focus on managing and protecting investments made
to the National Forest Road System, which provides access to resi-
dents, visitors, outfitters, emergency responders, and those in-
volved in restoration, stewardship and commercial activities. This
will reduce accidents, minimize ecological impacts, and provide safe
access to communities and residents as secondary evacuation
routes during emergencies.
Trails.—The Committee recommends $20,000,000 for Trails, of
which no less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level is for trail op-
erations, maintenance, and construction on National Scenic and
Historical Trails. The Committee is aware of the growing need to
sustain and increase the capacity for resilient trail building within
the outdoor recreation community. The Service is encouraged to
collaborate with regional training centers that provide resources for
training trails stewards responsible for the maintenance of trails
for public use and is further encouraged to focus on maintaining
geographical diversity in its partnerships.
Legacy Roads and Trails.—The Committee recommends
$6,000,000 for Legacy Roads and Trails.
The Service is directed to provide an annual report to the Com-
mittee within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, detailing Leg-
acy Roads and Trails Remediation accomplishments, including
miles of roads and trails improved, miles of streams restored, num-
ber of bridges and stream crossings constructed, miles of road de-
commissioned, and number of jobs created.
Construction Projects.—The Committee recommends $20,850,000
for congressionally directed spending in this program. A detailed
list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spend-
ing’’ table accompanying this report.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,099,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,099,000
The Committee recommends $1,099,000. This account provides
for carrying out the Service’s responsibilities for subsistence under
the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law
96–487).
WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,426,111,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,426,111,000
The Committee recommends $2,426,111,000 for wildland fire
management.
Fire Operations.—The Committee recommends $192,000,000 for
preparedness, $1,011,000,000 for suppression operations, and
$1,223,111,000 for salaries and expenses.
The Committee expects that with these resources, the Service
will continue to transform its wildland fire workforce to allow for
increased firefighter pay, create year-round firefighting and fuels
management capacity, supply appropriate levels of personal protec-
tive equipment, and implement technology modernizations outlined
in section 1114 of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Manage-
ment, and Recreation Act (Public Law 116–9) to increase the safety
of firefighters and the public, as well to enhance effective responses
to wildfire.
Procurement Forecasting.—The Service should actively engage
with stakeholders, including industry partners, to leverage their

128
expertise and innovation in developing and implementing new tech-
nology and contract processes for where they can address wildland
fire management priorities, challenges, and opportunities.
Firefighter Housing.—The Committee is concerned that the low
availability, high cost, and/or disrepair of housing provided by Fed-
eral agencies in many areas of the country is a barrier to the re-
cruitment and retention of Federal wildland firefighters. Accord-
ingly, the Service is encouraged to address the housing needs nec-
essary to support a professional firefighting capacity with a pre-
dominantly permanent workforce, including by determining the
maintenance and reconstruction needs for existing housing and
new housing needed in order to recruit and retain firefighters in
areas where it is difficult to find housing.
New Technology Adoption.—Instead of establishing a joint office
for wildfire science technology as proposed in the budget request,
the Committee directs the Service to use existing resources to cre-
ate a strategic plan for adopting new technologies. The Service
should fully utilize the expertise of the Fire Science Laboratory to
develop and deploy new technologies, tools and techniques that will
assist in prediction, detection, monitoring, suppression, and other
capabilities that must be improved to respond to the higher inci-
dence of catastrophic wildfire. This includes remote automated
weather stations, space-based remote sensing data, satellite im-
agery, and integrated acquisition technology services. Further, the
Service is encouraged to work with States and other Federal agen-
cies to evaluate existing contracts and identify opportunities to
allow greater use and coordination of satellite data.
WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS RESERVE FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,390,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,480,000,000
The Committee recommends $2,480,000,000 for the Forest Serv-
ice Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund for fiscal year
2026.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The bill continues or modifies administrative provisions included
in prior year appropriations acts that give direction on the use and
transfer of appropriated funds and further provide for the efficient
operations of the Service.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
The Indian Health Service [IHS] is the agency within the De-
partment of Health and Human Services that has responsibility for
providing Federal health services to approximately 2.6 million
American Indians and Alaska Natives. The provision of health
services to Tribes grew out of the special relationship between the
Federal Government and Indian Tribes that was established in
1787, based on article I, section 8 of the Constitution, and given

129
form and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court de-
cisions, and Executive orders that followed. Most notable among
these is the Snyder Act of 1921 (Public Law 67–85), which provides
the basic authority for most Indian health services provided by the
Federal Government to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.
IHS services are provided directly and through Tribally-con-
tracted and operated programs in over 600 healthcare facilities lo-
cated throughout the United States, primarily in rural and isolated
areas. Healthcare is also purchased from more than 9,000 private
providers annually. The Federal system consists of 28 hospitals, 61
health centers, and 34 health stations. Through Public Law 93–
638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,
Tribes and Tribal organizations compact and contract health pro-
grams to manage 17 hospitals, 249 health centers, and 70 health
stations. In addition, grants to 34 nonprofit urban Indian health or-
ganizations provide a variety of health and referral services.
Access to a good education, safe and reliable housing, clean
drinking water, and access to healthcare are all important for posi-
tive health outcomes and life expectancy. Disparities among these
areas of basic infrastructure have contributed to health disparities
among Native American communities. In order to truly address In-
dian Country’s healthcare needs, more must be done to address the
comprehensive full-scale social determinants of health across the
Federal Government. IHS plays a pivotal role in not only providing
direct care services to Native Americans but through preventative
programs that make a meaningful difference for Native American
health outcomes.
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,987,440,000
Advance Appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 4,684,029,000
Committee recommendation, new appropriations, 2026 .................... 347,111,000
Committee recommendation, total resources available, 2026 ............ 5,069,849,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2027.............. 4,805,147,000
The Committee recommends $5,069,849,000 in total resources for
fiscal year 2026 for Indian Health Services, an increase of
$82,409,000 to the fiscal year 2025 level. The Committee rec-
ommendation also recommends $4,805,147,000 in advance appro-
priations for the Services account for fiscal year 2027. The fol-
lowing direction relates to the total fiscal year 2026 funding rec-
ommendation. All programs, projects, and activities are maintained
at fiscal year 2025 enacted levels unless otherwise stated.
Recruitment and Retention.—The Committee remains concerned
the IHS is not able to recruit and retain enough clinical staff to
maintain a high quality of care at the Service’s federally operated
facilities and directs the Service to work with the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to expedite creation of market-specific pay scales
to ensure the Service is able to offer competitive recruitment pack-
ages, an issue highlighted in the 2018 GAO report that examined
agency challenges filling provider vacancies (GAO–18–580). The
Committee reminds IHS a report is owed on any regulatory or stat-
utory limitations that prohibit the Service from offering incentives,
such as scheduling flexibility, that the Service believes hurts its re-
cruitment and retention efforts. The Committee is encouraged by

130
the establishment of the Office of Quality that will hopefully im-
prove access to care and availability of service. The Committee di-
rects the Service to establish measurements for tracking the im-
provement of patient health rather than defining increased funding
alone as the metric for measuring improvements.
The Committee is aware of IHS collaboration with the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs and Health Resources and Services Ad-
ministration focused on workforce development and physician resi-
dency placement. The Committee applauds this collaboration and
requests quarterly reports on progress to bring additional coordi-
nated training opportunities to physicians in Tribal communities.
Public Health Workforce.—The Committee recommends that
funds provided for supporting public health workforce across the
agency shall include a distribution among all IHS Service Areas
not just in areas where BIE schools are present.
Protecting Patients from Abuse.—The Committee remains deeply
troubled by past reports of sexual abuse. The Service is directed to
keep the Committee promptly apprised of any investigations into
sexual abuse and provide policy recommendations for Congress to
consider if barriers exist to address issues. Further, the Committee
directs the Service to take immediate action to investigate any
abuse allegations and take appropriate and prompt disciplinary ac-
tions to protect patients from harm.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The Committee recommends
$78,409,000 for staffing of newly opened health facilities within the
Services account. The Committee has a longstanding policy of pro-
viding sufficient staffing funds for all facilities that are expected to
open during the fiscal year. Funds for staffing of new facilities are
limited to facilities funded through the Health Care Facilities Con-
struction Priority System or the Joint Venture Construction Pro-
gram that have opened in fiscal year 2024 or will open in fiscal
year 2025. None of these funds may be allocated to a facility until
such facility has achieved beneficial occupancy status. As initial es-
timates included as part of the annual budget request are refined,
IHS is expected to communicate updated cost estimates to the
Committee.
Hospitals and Health Clinics.—The Committee recommends
$2,658,289,000 for Hospitals and Health Clinics, an increase of
$72,085,000 to the enacted level. The bill maintains funding at fis-
cal year 2025 enacted levels for the Alzheimer’s program and
Produce Prescription Pilot program. The bill also continues funding
at the fiscal year 2025 enacted levels for the domestic violence pre-
vention program, accreditation emergencies, health information
technology, healthy lifestyles in youth project.
Community Health Aide Program Expansion.—The Committee
supports the expansion of the Community Health Aide Program
[CHAP] in lower-48 States and recommends an additional
$3,000,000 for these efforts within the funding provided for Hos-
pitals and Health Clinics. This expansion should not divert funding
from the existing CHAP program in Alaska.
Village Built Clinics [VBC].—The Committee directs IHS to work
collaboratively with impacted Tribes and Tribal organizations to
produce, within 120 days of enactment of this act, the data needed
to accurately calculate the funding for VBC lease funding, includ-

131
ing the number of outstanding VBC facilities, their current funding
levels, and if necessary, any additional amounts needed to fully
fund the eligible operating and ownership costs for all VBC facili-
ties.
Improving Maternal Health.—The Committee remains concerned
with the maternal mortality crisis in the United States, which is
even more acute in Native American communities. American In-
dian and Alaska Native women are two times more likely to die of
pregnancy-related causes than White women, and 93 percent of
pregnancy-related deaths among American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive women are preventable. The Committee recommendation sup-
ports funding for maternal health initiatives and provides an addi-
tional $1,000,000 for these efforts as noted above. The Committee
reminds the IHS of the directive to brief the Committee within 90
days of enactment of this act on its plans for such funds. Further,
the Committee directs IHS to coordinate with the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Ad-
ministration, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to
further enhance its maternal health initiatives, which should in-
clude improved data collection to facilitate an agency-wide effort to
improve outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native women.
Dental Therapy Education Program.—Within the funds provided,
funding is maintained at enacted levels for the dental health ther-
apy education program that currently trains students in Alaska,
Washington, Idaho, and Oregon.
Electronic Health Records.—The Committee is aware there is a
need for a new electronic health record system to improve the over-
all interoperability, efficiency, and security of the Service’s informa-
tion technology system and recommends $190,564,000 for this ef-
fort, equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Further, the Com-
mittee understands many Tribes recently upgraded computer sys-
tems for the new Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] system, and
it is important these systems are compatible. It is the Committee’s
expectation that the Service will be able to use the compiled infor-
mation gathered during this recent effort with VA to inform both
the Service and the Committee on which Tribes use their own sys-
tem and the estimated costs. Finally, the Committee notes that the
Electronic Health Records is excluded from the advance appropria-
tion for fiscal year 2027 as specified in bill language.
Dental Health.—The recommendation includes $259,501,000 for
dental health, an increase of $5,384,000 to the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. The Service is encouraged to coordinate with the Bu-
reau of Indian Education [BIE] to integrate preventive dental care
at schools within the BIE system.
Mental Health.—The recommendation includes $131,308,000 for
mental health programs, an increase of $1,194,000 to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. The bill maintains fiscal year 2025 fund-
ing for the behavioral health integration initiative to better inte-
grate treatment programs for mental health and substance abuse
problems and for the suicide prevention initiative.
Alcohol and Substance Abuse.—The recommendation includes
$267,404,000 for alcohol and substance abuse programs, an in-
crease of $633,000 to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The bill re-
tains funding provided in previous fiscal years for the Generation

132
Indigenous initiative; and for the youth pilot project, two important
programs to prevent substance abuse. The Committee continues
bill language that allocates funding for essential detoxification and
related services provided by the Service’s public and private part-
ners to IHS beneficiaries. The Service shall continue its partner-
ship with Na’Nizhoozhi Center in Gallup, New Mexico, and work
with the Center and other Federal, State, local and Tribal partners
to develop a sustainable model for clinical capacity, as provided by
the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 115–31.
The Committee is concerned that alcohol and opioid use disorders
continue to be some of the most severe public health and safety
problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native [AI/AN] indi-
viduals, families, and communities. To address this problem, the
Committee continues to direct IHS to increase its support for cul-
turally competent preventive, educational, and treatment services
programs and to partner with academic institutions with estab-
lished AI/AN training and health professions programs to research
and promote culturally responsive care. Additionally, the Com-
mittee encourages the Service to employ the full spectrum of medi-
cation assisted treatments [MAT] for alcohol and opioid use dis-
orders, including non-narcotic treatment options that are less sub-
ject to diversion combined with counseling services.
Opioid Grants.—To better combat the opioid epidemic, the rec-
ommendation includes fiscal year 2025 enacted funding to continue
a Special Behavioral Health Pilot Program, as authorized by Public
Law 116–6. The Director of IHS, in coordination with the Assistant
Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, shall award
grants for providing services, provide technical assistance to grant-
ees under this section, and evaluate performance of the program.
Further, the Committee has heard from Tribes that assistance
should not only focus on opioids, and therefore urges IHS to exam-
ine whether grant funds should be made available to address all
types of drug abuse.
Purchased/Referred Care.—The recommendation includes
$996,755,000 for purchased/referred care.
Within the funding provided for Purchased/Referred care, the
Service shall consider providing support for the delivery of
healthcare services for the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee In-
dians of Oklahoma, as requested.
Indian Health Care Improvement Fund.—The recommendation
includes $74,138,000 in funding for the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Fund.
Public Health Nursing.—The recommendation includes
$115,926,000 for public health nursing, an increase of $2,978,000
to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Health Education.—The recommendation includes $24,617,000
for health education, an increase of $135,000 to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
Urban Indian Health.—The recommendation includes
$90,419,000 for the Urban Indian Health program, equal to the en-
acted level. The Committee is committed to improving the health
and well-being of AI/AN living in urban Indian communities. De-
spite the excellent efforts of Urban Indian Organizations, AI/AN
populations continue to be left out of many Federal initiatives.

133
Therefore, the Committee reminds the IHS of the directive to ex-
plore the formation of an interagency working group to identify ex-
isting Federal funding supporting Urban Indian Organizations
[UIOs] and determine where increases are needed, or what pro-
grams should be amended to allow for greater access by UIOs; to
develop a Federal funding strategy to build out and coordinate the
infrastructure necessary to pilot and scale innovative programs
that address the needs and aspirations of urban AI/ANs in a holis-
tic manner; develop a wellness centered framework to inform
health services; and meet quarterly with UIOs to address other rel-
evant issues. In addition to the Indian Health Service, the working
group should consist of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S.
Department of Education, U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, U.S.
Department of Labor, the Small Business Administration, the Eco-
nomic Development Agency, FEMA, the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
and others as identified by UIOs.
Direct Operations.—The bill provides $103,805,000 for Direct Op-
erations, equal to the enacted level.
Continued Directives.—The Committee continues the directions
contained in Public Law 116–260, Consolidated Appropriations Act
2021, regarding the dental health therapist training program and
first-aid kit enhancements.
Indian Health Professions.—The recommendation includes
$80,568,000 for the Indian Health Professions program. The Com-
mittee believes this is a critical program and expects this increase
will allow the Indians into Medicine program to expand to four
sites. Within funds, the recommendation also includes funding for
the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians into Nursing Program,
and American Indians into Psychology Program at no less than the
enacted levels.
The Committee reminds IHS that any grant made under section
112 of Public Law 94–437 to the Quentin N. Burdick American In-
dians Into Nursing Program is not intended to reduce the eligibility
of any other applicants to receive grants under section 112 of the
Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The Committee directs IHS
to report to the Committee not later than 30 days after enactment
of this act on actions taken to ensure that the regional location of
the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into Nursing Program
grant recipient does not disqualify other applicants to receive
grants under section 112 of Amend Indian Health Care Improve-
ment Act.
Study on the Comparative Healthcare Delivery Between the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Indian Health Service
(IHS).—The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to
conduct a study not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
of this act, that at a minimum provides: (1) a comparison of per-
patient funding levels for healthcare services provided by VA and
IHS, including historical funding trends over the past 10 fiscal
years; (2) an analysis of recruitment and retention strategies uti-
lized by VA, including but not limited to hiring flexibilities, pay in-
centives, and workforce development programs, and the extent to
which such strategies could be adapted or extended to IHS; (3) rec-

134
ommendations for legislative or administrative actions that Con-
gress and the Department of Health and Human Services can take
to improve IHS hiring, recruitment, and retention outcomes, in-
formed by VA best practices; (4) identification of statutory or regu-
latory barriers that limit IHS from implementing hiring authorities
or incentives like those available to the VA.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,036,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,819,000,000
The Committee has continued language from fiscal year 2021 es-
tablishing an indefinite appropriation for contract support costs es-
timated to be $1,819,000,000 in fiscal year 2026. By retaining an
indefinite appropriation for this account, additional funds may be
provided by the Agency if its budget estimate proves to be lower
than necessary to meet the legal obligation to pay the full amount
due to Tribes. The Committee believes that fully funding these
costs will ensure Tribes have the resources they need to deliver
program services efficiently and effectively.

sociated with facilities leased or owned by Tribes and Tribal orga-
nizations for carrying out health programs under ISDEAA con-
tracts and compacts as required by 25 U.S.C. 5324(l).
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $506,854,000
Advance appropriations, 2026 .............................................................. 510,774,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ........................................................................... 808,806,000
Committee recommendation, new appropriations, 2025 .................... 298,032,000
Committee recommendation, total resources available, 2025 ............ 510,774,000
Committee recommendation, advance appropriations, 2026.............. 519,500,000
The Committee recommends $808,806,000 in total resources for
fiscal year 2026 for health facilities operations of the IHS. This
amount is $8,726,000 above the enacted level. The Committee rec-
ommendation also provides $510,774,000 in advance appropriations
for the account for fiscal year 2027. All programs, projects, and ac-
tivities are maintained at fiscal year 2025 enacted levels unless
otherwise specified. The following direction relates to fiscal year
2026 funding.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The Committee recommends
$8,726,000 for staffing of newly opened health facilities within the
Facilities account.
Maintenance & Improvement.—The recommendation includes
$170,595,000 for Maintenance and Improvement, equal to the en-
acted level.
Sanitation Facilities Construction.—The recommendation in-
cludes $106,627,000 for Sanitation Facilities Construction activi-
ties, equal to the enacted level. The bill provides $17,039,000 for
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS] projects in this program.

135
A detailed list of projects is included in the ‘‘Congressionally Di-
rected Spending’’ table accompanying this report.
Health Care Facilities Construction.—The recommendation in-
cludes $182,679,000 for Health Care Facilities Construction, equal
to the enacted level. Of the funds provided, fiscal year 2025 fund-
ing is maintained for the small ambulatory clinic program.
Equipment.—The recommendation includes $32,598,000 for med-
ical equipment upgrades and replacement, equal to the enacted
level.
Facilities & Environmental Health Support.—The recommenda-
tion includes $316,307,000 for Facilities & Environmental Health
Support, an increase of $8,726,000 above the enacted level. The
health impacts of a lack of sanitation infrastructure remain a pub-
lic health crisis in Indian Country. The Committee is concerned
that delayed decisionmaking is jeopardizing these projects and di-
rects the Service to brief the Committee within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act on the status of discussions with other Federal
partners involved to ensure funding is coordinated and projects are
completed. Within the funds provided for facilities and environ-
mental health support projects, fiscal year 2025 funding is main-
tained for preliminary engineering reports and provides funding for
the certification training that was transferred to this budget line
in fiscal year 2023 as requested.
Housing Quarters.—The Committee believes that funds for hous-
ing quarters is essential to help resolve the widespread housing
shortages, which have contributed to high vacancy rates for med-
ical personnel throughout the system, particularly in rural areas.
These funds have been used in areas with chronic housing short-
ages, such as Alaska and the Great Plains, in order to ameliorate
these problems. The Committee expects a report from the Service
within 60 days of enactment of this act on the distribution of funds.
Health Facilities Requirements in Alaska.—The Committee con-
tinues the directive for the Service to work with appropriate Tribal
organizations and submit a report to the Committees within 1 year
of enactment that includes an assessment of updated facilities
needs in the State of Alaska as well as recommendations for alter-
native financing options which could address the need for addi-
tional healthcare facilities space suitable to meet the current and
future healthcare needs of IHS beneficiaries in the State. Addition-
ally, within 30 days of enactment of this act, the Service is directed
to provide the Committee with a briefing detailing why this direc-
tive has not been previously met, despite inclusion in previous fis-
cal years.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The bill includes an administrative provision that prohibits IHS
from using funds for non-federally recognized tribes.

literature review on the health effects of descendants of toxic-ex-
posed service members and veterans. The Committee encourages
the Agency to identify and conduct research to explore the associa-
tion between the health conditions of descendants of service mem-
bers and veterans, and specific military toxic exposures. Within 1
year of enactment of this act, the Agency is encouraged to establish
a publicly available website with information on the activities and
findings of the Agency.
Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of the Pediatric Environmental
Health Specialty Units [PEHSUs] program and its support from
ATSDR in helping to identify environmental risks to the health of
children and reproductive-age adults. The Committee encourages
ATSDR to continue its support for PEHSUs.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Congress established the Smithsonian Institution in 1846 to ad-
minister a large bequest left to the United States by James
Smithson, an English scientist, for the purpose of establishing in
Washington, DC, an institution ‘‘for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.’’ The act establishing the Smithsonian pro-
vided for the administration of the trust, independent of the Gov-
ernment itself, by a Board of Regents and a Secretary, who were
given broad discretion in the use of these funds. The board was to
be composed of both private citizens and members of all three
branches of the Federal Government in order to ensure ‘‘the wise
and faithful use’’ of the Institution’s funds. The trust funds were
permanently loaned to the U.S. Department of the Treasury to be
maintained in a separate account, with the interest from that
money used for the operation of the Institution. Construction of the
Smithsonian Castle was completed in 1855 and collections that the
Government had accepted on behalf of the Institution were moved
into the building. Today, the Smithsonian Institution is the world’s
largest museum and research complex, housing approximately 157
million objects and specimens and receiving an estimated 17 mil-
lion visitors annually.
The Smithsonian Institution’s facilities include 19 museums and
galleries, the National Zoo, and 9 research facilities, most located
in or near Washington, DC, with others in Massachusetts, New
York, Florida, Arizona, Hawaii, and the Republic of Panama.

Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum.—Public Law
116–260, enacted on December 27, 2020, established the Smithso-
nian American Women’s History Museum [SAWHM] within the
Smithsonian Institution. Women have made invaluable contribu-
tions to our country across such diverse fields as government, busi-
ness, medicine, law, literature, sports, entertainment, the arts, and
the military, and the SAWHM will be the first comprehensive mu-
seum anywhere in the United States dedicated to the full story of
women’s history. This comprehensive museum will document the
spectrum of the experiences of women in the United States, rep-
resent a diverse range of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds,
more accurately depict the history of the United States, and add
value to the Smithsonian Institution for the American people.
Funding will support continued activities including: recruitment
and selection of additional personnel, including human resources
activities; formation of planning and coordination teams to develop
exhibitions, public programs, education, research, collections acqui-
sition, technology, and capital fundraising; and developing adminis-

140
trative operations. The Committee looks forward to continuing to
support the development of the SAWHM as detailed plans for
siting, design, construction, operations, and private fundraising be-
come available for review.
National Museum of the American Latino.—Public Law 116–260,
enacted on December 27, 2020, established the National Museum
of the American Latino [NMAL] within the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The mission of the NMAL is to give voice to both the richness
and the challenges of the Latino American experience, to make it
possible for all people to understand the depth, complexity, and
promise of the American experience, and to serve as a national
forum for collaboration and celebration of Latino American history
and culture. The NMAL will be the keystone for people in the
United States and visitors worldwide to learn about Latino con-
tributions to life, art, history, and culture in the United States and
will serve as a gateway for visitors to view Latino exhibitions, col-
lections, and programming at other Smithsonian Institution facili-
ties and museums throughout the United States.
Funding will support continued activities including: recruitment
and selection of additional personnel, including human resources
activities; formation of planning and coordination teams to develop
exhibitions, public programs, education, research, collections acqui-
sition, technology, and capital fundraising; and developing adminis-
trative operations. The Committee looks forward to continuing to
support the development of the NMAL as detailed plans for siting,
design, construction, operations, and private fundraising become
available for review.
Repatriation of Human Remains.—The Committee notes that
since the passage of the National Museum of American Indian Act
(Public Law 101–185) in 1989, the Smithsonian Institution has re-
patriated the remains of approximately 5,000 Indigenous people.
The Committee appreciates the commitment the Smithsonian Insti-
tution has made to repatriation activities, including the establish-
ment of a taskforce to develop a formal policy for handling all
human remains. The Committee directs the Smithsonian to act
with urgency in prioritizing repatriation activities for Indian
Tribes, as governed by the act, and in developing ways to improve
the repatriation policies within Smithsonian Institutions.

Government, the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] is the of-
ficial arts organization of the United States Government. As the
largest annual funder of the arts in the United States, the NEA
has helped to create and sustain regional theater, opera, ballet,
symphony orchestras, museums, and other arts organizations that
Americans now enjoy. Since its founding, the National Endowment
for the Arts has awarded more than 120,000 grants that have
brought the arts to Americans in communities both large and
small. The NEA, through its competitive, peer-reviewed grants
process, uses the majority of its annual operating funds to award
grants to nonprofit organizations for arts education, arts outreach,
artistic excellence, and partnership agreements. In addition to
those activities, State and jurisdictional arts agencies are awarded
40 percent of the Endowment’s funds.

tary Healing Arts Network, to serve the unique needs of patients
and families of military personnel and veterans diagnosed with
Traumatic Brain Injuries and associated psychological health con-
ditions. The Committee supports the NEA’s continued efforts to ex-
pand upon this successful program to embed Creative Arts Thera-
pies at the core of integrative care efforts in clinical settings, ad-
vance collaboration among clinical and community arts providers to
support wellness and reintegration efforts for affected families, and
advance research to improve our understanding of impacts of these

143
interventions in both clinical and community settings. The Com-
mittee also encourages State arts agencies to explore how they can
contribute to expanding arts programs for service members and
their families at the local level. The distribution of funds among
the agency’s various activities is displayed in the table that accom-
panies this report.
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES
The National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] was estab-
lished by the 1965 National Foundation on the Arts and Human-
ities Act (Public Law 89–209) as an independent Federal agency of
the United States Government dedicated to supporting research,
education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.
Today, it is the largest funder of humanities programs in the Na-
tion. NEH’s longstanding tradition of a peer-reviewed competitive
grant process is designed to ensure that the most meritorious
projects are funded. Typically, NEH grants are used to support cul-
tural institutions, such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges,
universities, public television and radio, and individual scholars.
The NEH, through its State-Federal partnership, also provides
grants to State humanities councils in all 50 States and the six ter-
ritories.
GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $207,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 207,000,000
The Committee recommends $207,000,000 for grants and admin-
istration of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Com-
mittee maintains fiscal year 2024 enacted funding at $7,000,000 for
Special Initiatives for the Endowment, including the ‘‘A More Per-
fect Union’’ initiative. The Committee supports the ‘‘We the People’’
initiative which encourages a better understanding of the history
of our country and the democratic principles upon which it was
founded, by supporting grants for the teaching and study of Amer-
ican history. The Committee encourages the NEH to incorporate
and continue the two popular components of the former ‘‘We the
People’’ initiative grant opportunities, the National Digital News-
papers Program, and the Landmarks of American History and Cul-
ture workshops as part of the initiative or with other funds.
The Committee supports the Documenting Endangered Lan-
guages initiative and NEH’s partnership with the National Science
Foundation [NSF] to develop and advance knowledge concerning
endangered human languages, and is especially concerned with the
linguistic threats faced by ethnic and religious minorities in Cen-
tral and East Asia, including the Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Mongo-
lians.
The mission of the NEH is to aid the American People in the ex-
amination of the human condition, to understand our cultural her-
itage, to foster mutual respect for diverse beliefs and cultures, to
develop media and information literacy, and to promote civic en-
gagement. In order to advance racial equity, the Committee directs
that NEH continue to develop an Office of Outreach whose mission
will be to enhance the agency’s efforts on behalf of underserved

144
communities and institutions, such as Tribal Nations, Historically
Black Colleges and Universities [HBCUs], Hispanic Serving Insti-
tutions [HSIs], Tribal Colleges and Universities [TCUs], veterans,
community colleges, and others. The Committee also welcomes the
establishment of a Chief Diversity Officer to serve within the office
of the Chairperson, to oversee efforts to improve diversity, equity,
and inclusion, and to create better access within NEH’s programs,
operations, outreach and communications, human capital, and re-
search and analysis. Further, the Committee encourages NEH to
provide support for projects that illustrate the transformative role
of women in American history, such as Katherine Johnson and
Amelia Earhart, to educate and inspire the next generation of
women leaders and professionals in fields such as aviation, ad-
vanced computer technologies and the STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math) disciplines.
The distribution of funds among the agency’s various activities is
displayed in the table that accompanies this report.
COMMISSION OF FINE ARTS
The Commission of Fine Arts was established in 1910 to fill the
need for a permanent agency whose members would be qualified to
make available to the Government expert opinion on questions of
art and architecture. The Commission’s mission, as design pro-
posals are brought before it, is to safeguard and improve the ap-
pearance and symbolic significance of the city as a capital. The
Commission provides knowledgeable advice on matters pertaining
to architecture, landscape architecture, sculpture, painting, and the
decorative arts to all branches and departments of the Federal and
District of Columbia governments when such matters affect the Na-
tional Capital. The Commission also must approve of the site and
design of all commemorative works and memorials erected in the
District. The Commission advises on the design of circulating and
commemorative coinage and must approve the siting and design for
national memorials, both in the United States and on foreign soil,
in accordance with the American Battle Monuments Act and the
Commemorative Works Act (Public Law 106–214).

ating support to District of Columbia nonprofit arts and other cul-
tural organizations. In fiscal year 1988, administrative responsi-
bility for the program was transferred from the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities to the Commission of Fine Arts. Cur-
rently, this program helps support more than 20 nationally re-
nowned organizations in the Nation’s Capital by providing funding

ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89–
665) established the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as
an independent Federal agency. The Council’s mission is to pro-
mote the preservation, enhancement, and productive use of our Na-
tion’s historic resources, and to advise the President and Congress
on national historic preservation policy. It also provides a forum for
discussion of Federal activities, programs, and policies that affect
historic properties. One of the principal responsibilities of the
Council is to implement section 106 of the National Historic Preser-
vation Act (Public Law 89–665), which requires that the Council be
given an opportunity to comment on the impacts of projects or ac-
tions undertaken by other Federal agencies on sites or structures
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,585,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,585,000
The Committee recommends $8,585,000 for the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation. The Council’s responsibility to assist
Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations with the National His-
toric Preservation Act’s Section 106 process, which requires Federal
agencies to consider the effects of their projects on historic prop-
erties, is a critical opportunity for these communities to provide
input about how Federal projects might affect historic, culturally
significant sites.
The Committee notes that recent major Federal investments in
transportation, energy, telecommunications, water, and other infra-
structure have resulted in a sharp increase in Section 106 reviews,
which are required under the National Historic Preservation Act.
As a result, State Historic Preservation Offices [SHPOs], Tribal
Historic Preservation Offices [THPOs], and Indian Tribes have
seen their workloads increase significantly over the past several
years. The Committee recognizes the value of close partnership and
coordination between SHPOs, THPOs, and Tribes, and encourages
increased opportunities for SHPOs, THPOs, and Tribes to share
best practices. The Committee directs the Council to report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act describing, with
examples, the magnitude of the increased workloads and the im-
pacts on SHPOs and THPOs.
NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION
The National Capital Planning Commission [NCPC] was estab-
lished in 1924 as a park planning agency. Two years later, the
agency’s role was expanded to include more comprehensive plan-
ning. The National Capital Planning Act of 1952 (Public Law 592)

146
designated the NCPC as the central planning agency for the Fed-
eral Government in the National Capital Region. Today, major
functions and responsibilities of the NCPC include comprehensive
and coordinated planning for the Nation’s Capital; an annual as-
sessment of all proposed Federal capital improvements in the Na-
tional Capital region; the review of proposed Federal development
projects; and representation of the Federal interest in local and re-
gional planning initiatives.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,750,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,750,000
The Committee recommends $8,750,000 for salaries and expenses
of the National Capital Planning Commission.
UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was created by
Congress in 1980 through Public Law 96–388 with the mandate to
operate and maintain a permanent living memorial museum to the
victims of the Holocaust; provide appropriate ways for the Nation
to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust through the annual
national civic observances known as the Days of Remembrance;
and carry out the recommendations of the President’s Commission
on the Holocaust. The building that houses the museum was con-
structed with private funds and opened to the public in 1993. Since
that time, the museum has attracted four to five times the number
of expected visitors and has been highly successful in its fund-
raising efforts. With private contributions comprising nearly 50
percent of its annual operating budget, the Holocaust Memorial
Museum serves as a model for the public-private partnership.
HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $65,231,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 66,731,000
The Committee recommends $66,731,000 for operations of the
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, an increase of
$1,500,000 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Committee
continues not less than $2,000,000 for implementation of the Never
Again Education Act (Public Law 116–141) in order to support and
strengthen Holocaust education programs.
Due to the ongoing rise of antisemitism throughout the country,
the Committee believes it is now more important than ever to con-
tinue the education of the atrocities that occurred before, during,
and after the Holocaust. Within 90 days of enactment of this act,
the museum shall brief the Committees on plans to use these funds
for educational programming.
UNITED STATES SEMIQUINCENTENNIAL COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000

147
The Committee recommends $15,000,000 for salaries and ex-
penses of the United States Semiquincentennial Commission. The
Committee looks forward to celebrations commemorating the Na-
tion’s 250th anniversary in 2026 and continues to support the mis-
sion of the Semiquincentennial Commission. The Committee notes
that a total of $64,300,000 has been appropriated for the Commis-
sion since fiscal year 2020. The Committee continues to find that,
like other federally-funded entities, independent Federal oversight
of the Commission is warranted.
America250.—The Committee notes that the ‘‘America250 Play-
book: Our Journey to 2026,’’ approved by the U.S.
Semiquincentennial Commission, states that ‘‘America250 is the
nonpartisan initiative with a mission to celebrate and commemo-
rate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence, the Semiquincentennial [ . . . ]’’ and that
‘‘America250 aims to inspire our fellow Americans to reflect on our
past, strengthen our love of country, and renew our commitment to
the ideals of democracy through programs that educate, engage,
and unite us as a Nation.’’

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests). Following is a list of congressionally directed spending
items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this re-
port along with the name of each Senator who submitted a request
to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item so identified. Neither
the Committee recommendation nor this report contains any lim-
ited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.
