PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on March 26, 2025, by Representative Steil, H.R.
2392, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better
Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act of 2025, would establish a clear
regulatory framework for the issuance of payment stablecoins and,
consequently, protect consumers by setting necessary federal
guardrails for payment stablecoin issuance, redemption, and re-
serves, while also promoting innovation in the United States
through a tailored approach that supports new entrants into the
marketplace.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Stablecoins are digital assets designed to offer price stability, en-
abling them to be used for payments. Stablecoins seek to be less
volatile than other digital assets by being pegged to another asset’s
value. Today, stablecoins are primarily used in the United States
to facilitate trading, lending, or borrowing of other digital assets,
predominantly on or through digital asset trading platforms.
Stablecoins allow individuals to enter and exit the digital asset
markets efficiently.
Currently, there is no federal regulatory framework for payment
stablecoin issuers. Most states have yet to create regulatory frame-

works for digital asset businesses, forcing potential payment
stablecoin issuers to leverage existing state money transmitter
statutes. However, most state money transmitter statutes were not
crafted to address digital asset businesses, including payment
stablecoin issuance and related activities. New York is an example
of one state that has established a strong regulatory framework
specific to firms engaged in virtual currency activities. The frame-
work sets forth baseline requirements focused on the backing and
redeemability of payment stablecoins, stablecoin reserves, and at-
testations. The New York State Department of Financial Services
(NYDFS) evaluates a range of additional risks prior to authorizing
a regulated virtual currency entity to issue a stablecoin, including
but not limited to cybersecurity, Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money-
laundering (BSA/AML) and sanctions compliance, consumer protec-
tion, and safety and soundness of the issuing entity, among others.
House Financial Services Committee (Committee) Republicans be-
lieve that while payment stablecoins hold promise as a potential
cornerstone of a modern payment system, they must be issued
under a clear regulatory framework.
Committee Republicans are not alone in recognizing the tremen-
dous potential for payment stablecoins and the need for a federal
regulatory framework. In November 2021, the President’s Working
Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-
poration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency re-
leased a Report on Stablecoins (PWG Report), which included a
proposed federal regulatory framework to address existing and po-
tential risks of stablecoins. The PWG Report identified several ben-
efits and potential risks while recommending that Congress act
promptly to enact legislation ensuring payment stablecoins are sub-
ject to a federal regulatory framework. Specifically, the PWG Re-
port recommended that Congress enact legislation requiring
stablecoins to be issued only by insured depository institutions.
However, the Committee diverged from the recommendation in the
PWG Report as Members support nonbanks also issuing payment
stablecoins.
During the 117th Congress, following the PWG Report’s release,
the Committee began developing legislation to establish a federal
framework for both banks and nonbanks to issue payment
stablecoins. During this process, Committee Republicans developed
a framework, hosted numerous roundtables, and participated in
two hearings focused on payment stablecoin legislation.
At a hearing in December 2021, Charles Cascarilla, the CEO and
Co-Founder of stablecoin issuer Paxos, highlighted concerns within
the United States’ payment system and potential benefits of
stablecoins, stating:
At any given time, there are trillions of dollars’ worth of
capital held up in transactions that have not yet settled.
Remittance recipients and other payees don’t have access
to their funds. Money that could help others or be produc-
tively deployed is unnecessarily trapped in limbo. Whole
industries have developed to take advantage of these
delays, often to the detriment of those who can least afford
it. How many overdraft fees could have been avoided if
people received their money immediately after it was sent?

[. . .]Digital assets, and the blockchains they’re built on,
offer a better alternative.
During the same hearing, Stellar Development Foundation CEO
and Executive Director, Denelle Dixon, highlighted a pilot program
that MoneyGram International was testing on the Stellar network
to demonstrate that stablecoins are actively solving the issues that
Mr. Cascarilla raised in his testimony. Several witnesses also high-
lighted the disparities between the United States’ approach to reg-
ulation compared to other jurisdictions.
At a hearing in February 2022, the Department of the Treasury
also highlighted the risks of Congress not enacting a comprehen-
sive federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoin issuers.
The former Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance,
Nellie Liang, emphasized that:
Stablecoins are not subject to standards to address con-
cerns about run risk, payment system risk, or concentra-
tion of economic power. Some of the largest stablecoin
issuers operate with limited regulatory oversight, raising
significant questions about whether these stablecoins are
adequately backed and other aspects of their operations.
The regulatory frameworks that apply to stablecoin issuers
and service providers are inconsistent, creating opportuni-
ties for regulatory arbitrage and uncertainty among
stablecoin users.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) also recognizes
the need for legislation. At a hearing in May 2022, then Treasury
Secretary Janet Yellen testified before the Committee in her capac-
ity as Chair of FSOC and underscored the urgency of stablecoin
legislation, explaining that FSOC is ‘‘eager to work with [the Com-
mittee] to ensure that payment stablecoins and their arrangements
are subject to a federal prudential framework on a consistent and
comprehensive basis.’’ FSOC emphasized this point in its October
2022 Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regula-
tion, recommending that ‘‘Congress pass legislation that would cre-
ate a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin
issuers that also addresses the associated market integrity, inves-
tor and consumer protection, and payment system risks.’’
During the 118th Congress, Committee Republicans held three
hearings and several member roundtables focused on payment
stablecoins. Through these hearings and roundtables, the Com-
mittee received feedback and input from Republican and Demo-
cratic members. This feedback resulted in the introduction of H.R.
4766, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023.
This bill included bank and non-bank pathways for stablecoin
issuers to obtain regulatory approval, as well as the establishment
of uniform Federal standards for stablecoin issuers’ reserves; re-
demption policies; and capital, liquidity, and risk management obli-
gations, among others, all of which were incorporated in the STA-
BLE Act. Another key aspect of H.R. 4766 is the preservation of
stablecoin issuers’ ability to seek regulatory approval at the State
level, which is also reflected in the STABLE Act. Providing both
State and Federal pathways for payment stablecoin issuers has
been a key priority for Committee Republicans, reflecting the dual
banking system that underpins U.S. financial regulation.

The precedents set by H.R. 4766 informed the drafting of the
STABLE Act. During the first month of the 119th Congress, Presi-
dent Donald Trump signed an Executive Order titled ‘‘Strength-
ening United States Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.’’
The Executive Order established the President’s Working Group on
Digital Asset Markets and tasked it with ‘‘propos[ing] a Federal
regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of dig-
ital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States.’’1 In support
of these efforts, the House Committee on Financial Services and
the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
(Senate Banking Committee), along with the White House’s Artifi-
cial Intelligence and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, held a press con-
ference prioritizing the passage of payment stablecoin legislation.2
Building on the work of the 118th Congress, Subcommittee
Chairman Bryan Steil (R–WI) convened the first Digital Assets, Fi-
nancial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence Subcommittee hear-
ing of the 119th Congress in February of 2025 to discuss the impor-
tance of payment stablecoin legislation and the current state of the
payment stablecoin market. Since the Committee first began to
consider payment stablecoin legislation, the payments space has
further developed with more traditional payments market partici-
pants engaging in payment stablecoins. During the February hear-
ing, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Blockchain,
Crypto, and Digital Currencies at PayPal, Jose Fernandez da
Ponte, said:
We have been active in the space of crypto for the last
5 years and in the stablecoins for the last year and a half,
and the reason that we are there is because we are a pay-
ments company, not a blockchain company. We see the po-
tential of the technology to bring [about] the next genera-
tion of payment rails. . . .
As the payment stablecoin ecosystem develops, it is essential
that regardless of the type of market participant, high standards
are adhered to, protecting both customers and the broader financial
system. The STABLE Act took this into account and includes
strong consumer protection standards with which issuers must
comply. This would not only enable payment stablecoins’ continued
use in digital asset markets, but also in the next generation of pay-
ments and settlement. In March 2025, during a full committee
hearing discussing payment stablecoin legislation, the CEO of Dig-
ital Assets at BNY Mellon, Caroline Butler, emphasized:
The STABLE Act gives us the clarity and certainty to
know what we can actually perform in terms of activities
for our clients. . . . In addition, the consistency of apply-
ing those same standards across the ecosystem, so whilst
we need the clarity as a bank to understand what activi-
ties we can perform, we need to know that the ecosystem
we are performing those activities in is all players are

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 2392 is to establish a clear reg-
ulatory framework for the issuance of payment stablecoins that
protects consumers by setting necessary federal guardrails for pay-
ment stablecoin issuance, redemption, and reserves, while also pro-
moting innovation in the U.S. through a tailored approach that
supports new entrants into the marketplace.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 2392. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of House rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the
cost estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Stablecoin Transparency
and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy Act of 2025’’ or the
‘‘STABLE Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Definitions
Section 2 defines various terms, including digital asset, distrib-
uted ledger, payment stablecoin, permitted payment stablecoin
issuer, and primary federal payment stablecoin regulator, among
others. A permitted payment stablecoin issuer is one that has been
approved under one of the pathways made available under the Act.
Section 3. Limitation on who may issue a payment stablecoin
Section 3 prohibits the issuance of payment stablecoins in the
United States by any entity other than those approved as per-
mitted stablecoin issuers under the Act. Eighteen months after the
Act is enacted, custodial intermediaries will be prohibited from of-
fering or selling payment stablecoins unless they are issued by a
permitted payment stablecoin issuer. The prohibition on offering
and selling payment stablecoins of non-permitted issuers will not
apply to foreign payment stablecoin issuers that are subject to a
foreign payment stablecoin regulatory regime that the Secretary of
Treasury determines is comparable to the Act’s requirements in
Section 4. In addition, foreign issuers under such comparable for-
eign regimes must consent to examination and reporting require-
ments by a federal regulator. The prohibition also does not apply
to individuals transacting in payment stablecoins and other digital
assets for their own lawful purposes using a self-custody wallet.
Section 4. Requirements for issuing payment stablecoins
Section 4 establishes minimum standards that all payment
stablecoin issuers must comply with, regardless of the regulatory
path that they choose. Payment stablecoin issuers must maintain

reserves on a one-to-one basis with assets comprised of U.S. cur-
rency; deposits held at insured depository institutions, approved
foreign depository institutions, or insured credit unions; short-term
Treasury bills, notes, or bonds; short-term repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements; and money market funds invested solely in
the other assets included in the list of permissible payment
stablecoin reserves.
Such reserves may not be rehypothecated except for limited pur-
poses. Payment stablecoin issuers must establish and publicly dis-
close policies and procedures regarding redemption. Issuers must
publish the composition of their reserves monthly, have those re-
ports examined monthly by an independent registered public ac-
counting firm, and provide monthly certifications from their Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the issuer’s pri-
mary regulator regarding the truthfulness of these reports. This
section also clarifies that the STABLE Act does not alter the status
quo as it relates to legal eligibility for master account access.
Additionally, payment stablecoin issuers are treated as financial
institutions for purposes of applying the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
Section 4 requires the Secretary of Treasury, in coordination with
the primary federal payment stablecoin regulators, to issue regula-
tions applying tailored BSA obligations to payment stablecoin
issuers. These obligations will require issuers to establish and
maintain an anti-money laundering and countering the financing of
terrorism program, retain appropriate records of transactions in
their permitted payment stablecoins, monitor and report suspicious
activity, and maintain an effective customer identification program
for initial holders of their permitted payment stablecoins. In addi-
tion, Section 4 clarifies that permitted payment stablecoin issuers
must comply with all U.S. sanctions laws.
This section also places limitations on the activities of payment
stablecoin issuers and requires the primary federal payment
stablecoin regulators in consultation with state payment stablecoin
regulators to issue joint rulemakings establishing tailored capital
requirements, liquidity standards, and risk management require-
ments for reserve asset diversification, cybersecurity, operations,
and compliance. Payment stablecoin issuers are also prohibited
from paying interest or yield on their payment stablecoins.
Section 4 also requires state qualified payment stablecoin issuers
to issue payment stablecoins through state regulatory regimes that
have been certified by the Secretary of Treasury as meeting or ex-
ceeding the requirements of this section.
This section clarifies that payment stablecoins are not subject to
deposit insurance by the FDIC or share insurance by the National
Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and requires payment
stablecoin issuers to disclose this information on its website. Sec-
tion 4 also prohibits individuals convicted of a felony offense for
certain financial crimes from serving as an officer or director of a
payment stablecoin issuer.
Rulemakings issued under this section must be issued jointly by
the federal payment stablecoin regulators. The deadline for
rulemakings under this section is 180 days after enactment of the
Act.

Section 5. Approval of subsidiaries for insured depository institu-
tions and subsidiaries of nonbank entities
Section 5 establishes a process for payment stablecoin issuers
that seek to gain approval through the federal pathway. The Act
enables a depository institution to issue payment stablecoins
through a subsidiary that is approved by the appropriate federal
banking agency or the NCUA, as applicable. Entities chartered by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may issue a
payment stablecoin, if approved by the OCC. Lastly, a nonbank en-
tity can become a federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin
issuer, if approved by the OCC.
This section requires the primary federal payment stablecoin reg-
ulator to render a decision on applications within a certain time-
frame. If the primary federal payment stablecoin regulator fails to
issue a decision within the timeframe, the application will be
deemed approved. Factors that the primary federal payment
stablecoin regulator may consider when assessing the application
include the payment stablecoin issuer’s ability to meet the stand-
ards established in Section 4 of the Act. The regulator may only
deny an application if it determines the activities of the applicant
would be unsafe or unsound based on the applicant’s ability to
meet the requirements of Section 4. The regulator must provide a
written explanation for the denial that includes the shortcomings
of the application and actionable recommendations on how those
shortcomings could be addressed.
The payment stablecoin issuer is permitted to appeal the denial
through a process established under the Act. The primary federal
payment stablecoin regulators must report to Congress on payment
stablecoin issuer applications that have been pending for 6 months
or more, as well as the number of calendar days applicants have
waited for decisions. The primary federal payment stablecoin regu-
lator shall notify Congress once beginning to process applications.
The provisions of this section would preempt any conflicting state
law or licensing requirement.
Rulemakings issued under this section must be issued jointly by
the federal payment stablecoin regulators. The deadline for
rulemakings under this section is 180 days after enactment of the
Act.
Section 6. Supervision and enforcement with respect to subsidiaries
of insured depository institutions and federal qualified nonbank
payment stablecoin issuers
Section 6 establishes supervision and enforcement standards for
payment stablecoin issuers under the oversight of a primary fed-
eral payment stablecoin regulator. Subsidiaries of IDIs are subject
to supervision by the primary federal payment stablecoin regulator
in the same manner as such IDI.
Federal qualified nonbank stablecoin issuers are required to sub-
mit reports on their financial condition and compliance with the
Act to the OCC upon request and are subject to examinations. Both
federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers and subsidi-
aries of IDIs that issue payment stablecoins must comply with the
requirements of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act.
The enforcement provisions are similar to the enforcement pow-
ers under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and provides federal

payment stablecoin regulators authority to pursue suspension and
prohibition actions, cease-and-desist actions, and civil money pen-
alties against a payment stablecoin issuer or institution-affiliated
party of a permitted payment stablecoin issuer if the primary fed-
eral payment stablecoin regulator determines that such permitted
payment stablecoin issuer or institution-affiliated party is violating
or has violated the Act or any regulation or order issued there-
under.
Section 7. State qualified payment stablecoin issuers
Section 7 establishes that state payment stablecoin regulators
can license and supervise state qualified payment stablecoin
issuers provided that their state regulatory regime is certified by
the Treasury Secretary as meeting or exceeding the requirements
of Section 4.
The state regulator will retain supervisory, examination, and en-
forcement authority over state qualified payment stablecoins
issuers. State regulators may enter into memorandums of under-
standing with the appropriate primary Federal banking agencies to
jointly carry out supervision and enforcement, and must share in-
formation with the appropriate federal banking agency. The pri-
mary federal banking agency has back-up enforcement authority,
as specified in Section 6, over state qualified payment stablecoin
issuers that are subsidiaries of insured depository institutions or
institution-affiliated parties of such issuers for violations of the Act
under certain circumstances. The OCC has back-up enforcement
authority, as specified in Section 6, over state qualified, non-bank
payment stablecoin issuers or institution-affiliated parties of such
issuers for violations of the Act under certain circumstances. State
qualified payment stablecoin issuers also must comply with the re-
quirements of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Primary federal bank-
ing agencies have 180 days after enactment of the Act to set stand-
ards that would be used by the agencies to exercise their back-up
authority.
This section also allows state qualified payment stablecoin
issuers that are chartered or licensed in a certified state to issue
payment stablecoins in other states without a license. In order to
operate in states other than that in which the issuer has been
chartered or licensed, the state qualified payment stablecoin issuer
must notify regulators in those states before commencing business.
If an issuer wishes to operate in a state that does not have a regu-
latory regime certified under Section 4 of the Act, the issuer will
be subject to all applicable consumer protection laws of the state
in which the issuer seeks to operate and must adhere to the stand-
ards of the home state. If the issuer is seeking to operate in a state
with a regulatory regime that has been certified under Section 4,
the issuer will still be subject to the host state’s applicable con-
sumer protection laws to the same extent as state qualified issuers
licensed or chartered in that state, as well as be required to comply
with any payment stablecoin obligations that exceed those of their
home state regime.
Section 8. Customer protection
Section 8 establishes standards for entities that provide custodial
services for payment stablecoins and payment stablecoin reserves.

These custodians must be regulated by a federal regulator or sub-
ject to supervision by a state bank or credit union supervisor that
meets certain standards, including segregation or other similar re-
quirements. Entities must treat customer property as belonging to
the customer and take steps to protect the property from claims of
creditors.
Payment stablecoins and other property of a customer must be
separately accounted for and not commingled with the funds of the
custodian. Finally, the entities must submit information to the pri-
mary federal payment stablecoin regulator on their business oper-
ations and processes to protect customer assets. The requirements
of this section shall not apply to any entity solely on the basis that
such entity engages in the business of providing hardware or soft-
ware to facilitate a customer’s own custody or safekeeping of the
customer’s payment stablecoins or private keys.
Section 9. Rule of construction
Section 9 clarifies that a digital asset will not be considered a
payment stablecoin if it is redeemable exclusively for other digital
assets that are not primarily payment stablecoins or representa-
tions of the permissible reserves in Section 4 (or similar assets), or
if the digital asset is primarily used within a system controlled by
the issuer to access products, services, or loyalty rewards.
Section 10. Interoperability standards
Section 10 requires the primary federal payment stablecoin regu-
lators to work with the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology, other relevant standard setting organizations, and state
governments to consider standards for compatibility and interoper-
ability of permitted payment stablecoins both within the United
States and in foreign jurisdictions with comparable payment
stablecoin regulatory regimes.
Section 11. Moratorium on endogenously collateralized stablecoins
Section 11 imposes a two-year moratorium on the issuance of
endogenously collateralized stablecoins. An endogenously
collateralized stablecoin is any digital asset for which its originator
has represented will be converted, redeemed, or repurchased for a
fixed amount of monetary value; and that relies solely on the value
of another digital asset created or maintained by the same origi-
nator to maintain the fixed price.
Section 12. Studies and reports
Section 12 requires the Secretary of Treasury in consultation
with the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the NCUA, and the
SEC to carry out a study on non-payment stablecoins, including de-
centralized stablecoins, and provide a report to the relevant con-
gressional Committees on this study within a year of this Act being
enacted. This section also requires the Secretary in consultation
with the Board, the OCC, the FDIC, the NCUA, and the SEC to
carry out a study on the impact of payment stablecoins, including
an analysis of payment stablecoins’ use in domestic and cross-bor-
der payments and remittances, the role and use of payment
stablecoins in the Global South, and the extent to which payment
stablecoins reinforce the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve

Section 13 requires the primary federal payment stablecoin regu-
lators to provide the relevant Committees with an update on the
status of rulemakings required under this Act within 6 months.
Section 14. Authority of banking institutions
Section 14 clarifies the authority of depository institutions and
trust companies, as appropriate, to tokenize deposits, utilize dis-
tributed ledgers for books and records, and provide custodial serv-
ices for payment stablecoins.
Additionally, this section prevents federal agencies from requir-
ing entities to account for assets held in custody on their balance
sheet; hold regulatory capital against these assets, including for
payment stablecoins’ reserves, except as necessary to mitigate
against operational risks inherent with the custody or safekeeping
services, as determined by the appropriate federal banking agency,
NCUA, state bank supervisor, or state credit union supervisor; or
recognize a liability for any obligations related to activities or serv-
ices performed for digital assets that the entity does not own if that
liability would exceed the expense recognized in the income state-
ment as a result of the corresponding obligation. This language
would prevent the SEC or other federal regulators from issuing
guidance similar to the SEC’s SAB 121.
Section 15. Amendments to clarify that payment stablecoins are not
securities
Section 15 clarifies that the term ‘‘security’’ under the securities
laws does not include a payment stablecoin issued by a permitted
payment stablecoin issuer.

in each case as of such time or times as determined pursuant
to this title, and the rules and regulations issued by the Com-

the value of such securities: Provided, That the value so deter-
mined is not in excess of the higher of market value or asset
value of such securities in the case of majority-owned subsidi-

tions or orders, permit any security to be carried at cost, if it shall
determine that such procedure is consistent with the general intent
and purposes of this title. For purposes of sections 5 and 12, in lieu
of values determined as provided in clause (A) above, the Commis-
sion shall by rules and regulations permit valuation of securities at
cost or other basis in cases where it may be more convenient for
such company to make its computations on such basis by reason of
the necessity or desirability of complying with the provisions of any
United States revenue laws or rules and regulations issued there-
under, or the laws or the rules and regulations issued thereunder
of any State in which the securities of such company may be quali-
fied for sale.
The foregoing definition shall not derogate from the authority of
the Commission with respect to the reports, information, and docu-

lowing by any such company, as provided in sections 8, 30, and 31.

annual or a special meeting of the security holders of such
company duly called, (A) of 67 per centum or more of the vot-

(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘‘customer’’ of a debtor
means any person (including any person with whom the
debtor deals as principal or agent) who has a claim on ac-
count of securities received, acquired, or held by the debtor
in the ordinary course of its business as a broker or dealer
from or for the securities accounts of such person for safe-
keeping, with a view to sale, to cover consummated sales,
pursuant to purchases, as collateral, security, or for pur-
poses of effecting transfer.

cludes—
(i) any person who has deposited cash with the debt-
or for the purpose of purchasing securities;

tures contracts received, acquired, or held in a port-
folio margining account carried as a securities account

standing void or voidable in a suit between the claim-
ant and the debtor.

securities’’ means securities which were held for the account of
a customer on the filing date by or on behalf of the debtor and

verted. The term ‘‘customer property’’ includes—
(A) securities held as property of the debtor to the extent
that the inability of the debtor to meet its obligations to
customers for their net equity claims based on securities of
the same class and series of an issuer is attributable to the
debtor’s noncompliance with the requirements of section
15(c)(3) of the 1934 Act and the rules prescribed under
such section;
(B) resources provided through the use or realization of
customers’ debit cash balances and other customer-related
debit items as defined by the Commission by rule;

from or for such portfolio margining account, and the pro-
ceeds thereof; and
(E) any other property of the debtor which, upon compli-
ance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, would
have been set aside or held for the benefit of customers,

within the meaning of such term would not significantly
increase customer property.

with respect to whom an application for a protective decree has
been filed under section 5(a)(3) or a direct payment procedure
has been instituted under section 10(b).

for such member pursuant to section 13(c).
(7) FILING DATE.—The term ‘‘filing date’’ means the date on
which an application for a protective decree is filed under sec-
tion 5(a)(3), except that—
(A) if a petition under title 11 of the United States Code
concerning the debtor was filed before such date, the term

filed, the term ‘‘filing date’’ means the date on which such
proceeding was commenced; or
(C) if the debtor is the subject of a direct payment proce-
dure or was the subject of a direct payment procedure dis-

(8) FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY.—The term ‘‘foreign subsidiary’’
means any subsidiary of a member of SIPC which has its prin-
cipal place of business in a foreign country or which is orga-

priate percentage of such commissions based on SIPC’s
loss experience with respect to such instruments over at
least the preceding five years; and

connection with a transaction in the portfolio margining ac-
count of a customer carried as securities accounts pursuant to
a portfolio margining program approved by the Commission.
Such term does not include revenues received by a broker or
dealer in connection with the distribution of shares of a reg-

able annuities or from the conduct of the business of insurance.

cluded herein; minus
(B) any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on

(C) any payment by such customer of such indebtedness
to the debtor which is made with the approval of the trust-
ee and within such period as the trustee may determine
(but in no event more than sixty days after the publication
of notice under section 8(a)).
A claim for a commodity futures contract received, acquired, or
held in a portfolio margining account pursuant to a portfolio
margining program approved by the Commission or a claim for
a security futures contract, shall be deemed to be a claim with
respect to such contract as of the filing date, and such claim

tomers.
(12) PERSONS REGISTERED AS BROKERS OR DEALERS.—The
term ‘‘persons registered as brokers or dealers’’ includes any
person who is a member of a national securities exchange

(14) SECURITY.—The term ‘‘security’’ means any note, stock,
treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, any
collateral trust certificate, preorganization certificate or sub-
scription, transferable share, voting trust certificate, certificate
of deposit, certificate of deposit for a security, or any security
future as that term is defined in section 3(a)(55)(A) of the Se-
curities Exchange Act of 1934, any investment contract or cer-
tificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agree-

MINORITY VIEWS
In the 117th Congress, then-Chairwoman Waters launched bipar-
tisan negotiations to create a federal regulatory framework for
stablecoins: a subset of cryptocurrencies that are typically pegged
to the U.S. dollar.1 This work began in the wake of a major crypto
scam that robbed investors of their lifesavings: Terra USD, which
was marketed as a stablecoin and valued at $18 billion when it fell
from the $1 peg to 35 cents on May 9, 2022.2 The Biden Adminis-
tration recognized the importance of robust stablecoin regulation,
identifying a number of concerns including with respect to financial
stability, and urged Congress to pass legislation.3 In the 118th
Congress, Ranking Member Waters continued these negotiations,
resulting in bipartisan legislation agreed to by then Chair
McHenry’s and Ranking Member Waters’ staffs.4 The Waters bill
reflects extensive collaboration and technical assistance from the
Treasury Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Fed) and creates a strong federal framework that
supports responsible innovation with consumer protection, national
security, and financial stability front and center.
Instead of taking this product as a starting point, Senate and
House Republicans introduced their own bills called the ‘‘Guiding
and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GE-
NIUS) Act of 2025’’5 and the ‘‘Stablecoin Transparency and Ac-
countability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act of 2025,’’6
respectively. The STABLE Act is woefully deficient in establishing
an effective federal framework to regulate stablecoins. Most impor-
tantly, the bill does nothing to address glaring conflicts of interest
raised by the actions of President Trump and his Administration.
The bill also lacks critical provisions to maintain the longstanding
separation of banking and commerce; protect consumers; preserve
our national security; and promote financial stability.7

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RAISED BY THE ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP
The STABLES Act would enable large-scale conflicts of interest
from Trump and other Administration officials. On March 25, 2025,
one of President Trump’s companies, World Liberty Financial,8 an-
nounced that it would launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin, called
USD1.9 Others in his Administration have been tied to other
stablecoins, like Elon Musk and Commerce Secretary Howard
Lutnick.10 Despite this, Trump and others in his Administration
would have a direct hand in reviewing and modifying the rules im-
plementing the STABLE Act to maximize profits for stablecoins
they own. This is because Trump issued an Executive Order (EO)
undermining the independence of the Federal banking agencies.11
Banking agencies like the Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and
the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) have traditionally
issued regulations independent of the political influence of the
White House. Under President Trump’s new EO, rules drafted by
Federal regulators must be reviewed and approved by the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the White
House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB).12 When con-
ducting these reviews, OIRA runs an interagency review process to
allow other agencies to provide feedback as well.13 The STABLE
Act does nothing to address these massive conflicts of interest, al-
lowing the President and his family, along with others in his Ad-
ministration, to gain from their government positions, ensuring the
new regulatory framework works best for their stablecoins if not
undermining other stablecoins they would compete with.
CONSUMER PROTECTION
The STABLE Act lacks many of the integral consumer protec-
tions included in the Waters-McHenry bill that would have ensured
customers can hold payment stablecoins confidently. The STABLE
Act does not include regulation and supervision of third-party ven-
dors, so there would be no oversight or consequences if those enti-
ties harm consumers. Similarly, the bill does not give the Fed any
authority over State-regulated digital wallets that consumers use
to hold their stablecoins, leaving consumers who use those wallets
vulnerable. The bill also lacks language setting up a resolution re-
gime that would properly protect consumers if a stablecoin issuer
fails. And the STABLE Act does nothing to preserve the authority

of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is consistent
with the Trump Administration’s attacks on CFPB.
NATIONAL SECURITY
Stablecoin issuers in foreign jurisdictions can present a major na-
tional security concern. The largest stablecoin by market capitaliza-
tion is Tether (USDT) ($143.93 billion), 14 which is issued outside
of the United States. Experts caution that if there is not sufficient
oversight by U.S. regulators, stablecoins like Tether could ‘‘provide
a useful workaround to avoid U.S. sanctions.’’15 Tether specifically
was also under criminal investigation last year for possible viola-
tions of sanctions and anti-money-laundering laws.16
Under the STABLE Act, 18 months after enactment, custodial
intermediaries are prohibited from offering or selling payment
stablecoins in the United States unless the payment stablecoin is
issued by a permitted payment stablecoin issuer. This provision
will not be effective in practice as the section lacks criminal pen-
alties and enforcement mechanisms.
It may not be surprising that this provision does not have teeth
given that Commerce Secretary Lutnick is the former Chairman
and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald,17 which is the primary custodian for
Tether. Lutnick’s former company is also ‘‘developing a $2 billion
Bitcoin financing program that will be supported by Tether.’’18
While Secretary Lutnick has stepped down, his son, Brandon
Lutnick, is now Chairman and previously interned for Tether’s
Swiss business unit.19
FINANCIAL STABILITY AND THE SEPARATION OF BANKING AND
COMMERCE
Weak standards in the STABLE Act present a myriad of risks to
financial stability. First, the separation of banking and commerce
has long been in place in order to ensure that no firm in the United
States gains too much power in the economy. Since at least the
Great Depression, Congress has generally sought to prevent non-
financial commercial from owning and operating financial institu-
tions providing banking products and services. For example, Con-
gress passed the Banking Act of 1933, also known as the Glass-
Steagall Act, codifying the separation of banking and commerce to
prevent the risks arising from banking-and-commercial conglom-
erates,20 including risks of ‘‘systemic crises that would require huge
bailouts to avoid devastating financial, economic, and social con-
sequences.’’21 In 1956, Congress passed the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act, which generally prohibits a parent company that owns

a bank (i.e. bank holding company or BHC) from owning non-
financial commercial enterprises and are subject to supervision by
the Federal Reserve.22 Under the STABLE Act, the lack of separa-
tion between banking and commerce means that Facebook would
be able to revive its Libra project and issue its own stablecoin,
which Members on both sides of the aisle previously raised con-
cerns about.23 Additionally, Elon Musk can join the stablecoin eco-
system by launching an X stablecoin, and other commercial compa-
nies like Facebook or Amazon could also launch their own
stablecoins.
Furthermore, while the bill makes clear that stablecoins do not
enjoy the backing of FDIC insurance, there is no provision that
prohibits Treasury, the Fed, or other government agencies from
providing a taxpayer-funded bailout of these relatively weakly reg-
ulated entities. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)
also expressed ‘‘serious concerns’’ with the STABLE Act, including
that the bill did not have sufficient capital and liquidity require-
ments for issuers,24 and that there are provisions providing a
sweeping preemption of state authority.25 CSBS warned about the
ability for a single Federal regulator to permit an issuer to engage
in all kinds of non-stablecoin financial activities, such as lending,
with few protections, as well as the importance of maintaining the
separation of banking and commerce.26 CSBS also raised concerns
about weak protections for consumers in the event of an issuer’s
failure.27 Another concern is that the STABLE Act provides no
funding for government agencies to carry out the new obligations
required under the Act, including developing and updating regula-
tions, supervision, and enforcement. If this unfunded mandate is
unaddressed, this would likely mean there would be minimal activ-
ity by Federal regulators to carry out this Act, and/or they may
have to draw from other funding sources, like assessments paid by
banks and credit unions for other purposes, to carry out this Act.
With regard to State issuers, States would be required to seek
a one-time approval of their regulatory regimes with the Secretary
of Treasury. This could mean that in the Trump Administration,
Treasury could give all States rubber stamp approvals, even if the
State’s standards do not in fact meet or exceed the standards for
Federal issuers. This is especially true because State regime certifi-
cations are considered valid upon submission and remain valid un-
less they are rejected, and Treasury is only given 30 days to reject.
The only way a future Administration could take another look at
these regimes is if the State makes material changes to its regime.
Additionally, unlike the dual banking system where regulation
and oversight of State- chartered banks is shared between Federal

and State regulators, this bill creates a system with weak Federal
oversight of these entities and allows issuers to set up shop in a
State that has a weak supervision and enforcement approach. One
