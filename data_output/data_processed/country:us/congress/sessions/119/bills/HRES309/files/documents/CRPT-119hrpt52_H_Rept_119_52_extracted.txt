STATEMENT OF BUDGET AUTHORITY AND RELATED ITEMS
The resolution does not provide new budget authority, new
spending authority, new credit authority, or an increase or de-
crease in revenues or tax expenditures and a statement under
House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(2), and section 308(a)(1) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 is not required.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
In compliance with House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(3), the Com-
mittee states, with respect to H. Res. 309, that the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office did not submit a cost estimate and
comparison under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of

Section 2:
1974.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
On February 11, 2025, Jay Furman (‘‘Contestant’’) filed a Notice
of Contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives pursuant
to the Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA).1 Contestant ran as
the nominee of the Republican Party for the office of Representa-
tive to the United States Congress representing the Twenty-Eighth
Congressional District of the State of Texas in the November 5,
2024, general election. The other principal candidate for the Twen-
ty-Eighth Congressional District was incumbent Democrat Henry
Cuellar (‘‘Contestee’’). On November 25, 2024, the Texas Secretary
of State, Jane Nelson, along with Texas Governor Greg Abbott,
issued the Certificate of Election to the Clerk of the House of Rep-
resentatives, certifying Contestee as the winner of the Twenty-
Eighth Congressional District.
BASIS OF CONTEST
In his Notice of Contest, Contestant alleges that the official elec-
tion results for the Twenty-Eighth Congressional District were
tainted by fraud and vote tampering, and that absent such fraud
and tampering, the election would have been in favor of Contest-
ant. Specifically, Contestant claims that his name did not appear
on some ballots, some mail-in ballots were shredded, ballot boxes
were not secured, and ineligible voters participated in this election
contest. Contestant is asking that the House order a review to de-
termine whether election law violations occurred and a new elec-
tion pursuant to the authority in Article I Sec. 5 of the United
States Constitution.
STANDING
To have standing under the FCEA, a contestant must have been
a candidate for election to the House of Representatives in the last
preceding election and claim a right to the Contestee’s seat.2 Con-
testant was the Republican nominee and his name appeared as a
candidate for the Twenty-Eighth Congressional District on the offi-
cial ballot for the November 5, 2024 election, thereby satisfying the
standing requirement.

TIMING/NOTICE
FCEA requires that a contestant ‘‘shall, within thirty days after
the result of such election shall have been declared by the officer
or Board of Canvassers authorized by law to declare such result,
file with the Clerk and serve upon the contestee written notice of
his intention to contest such election.’’3 The Notice of Contest was
filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives on February
11, 2025, which is after the statutory deadline prescribed by the
FCEA.
ANALYSIS
The Committee finds that Contestant has failed to timely file his
notice of contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
Under the FCEA, the deadline to file for Contestant to file with the
Clerk of the House of Representatives to contest this election would
have been December 25, 2024, 30 days after the Secretary of State
and Governor of Texas officially certified the election results for
this contest. Contestant filed his notice of contest with the Clerk
on February 11, 2025, a date occurring after the prescribed time
period, therefore the Committee finds that this claim must be dis-
missed due to untimely filing.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Committee therefore con-
cludes that this contest should be dismissed.
