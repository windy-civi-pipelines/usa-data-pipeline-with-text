PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The bill provides funding for (1) the Department of Commerce
[DOC]; (2) the Department of Justice [DOJ]; (3) several inde-
pendent science agencies: the Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy [OSTP], the National Space Council, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration [NASA], and the National Science Foun-
dation [NSF]; and (4) several related commissions and agencies:
the Commission on Civil Rights, the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission [EEOC], the United States International Trade
Commission [ITC], the Legal Services Corporation [LSC], the Ma-
rine Mammal Commission, the Office of the United States Trade
Representative [USTR], and the State Justice Institute [SJI].
SUMMARY OF THE BILL
The total amount of regular discretionary budget authority rec-
ommended by the Committee for fiscal year 2026 is
$79,711,000,000. Additionally, the Committee makes available
$1,900,000,000 through the Crime Victims Fund [CVF] for victim
compensation and victim services. The Committee remains con-
cerned about the health of the CVF and its ability to continue to
support compensation to and services for survivors of crime in fu-
ture years. Therefore, the Committee directs the DOJ to continue
to advise litigating components and the Offices of the United States
Attorneys of the availability of the CVF as a repository for fines,
fees, and other penalties.
The Committee recommendation is consistent with the allocation
for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appro-
priations bill. The Committee has strived to achieve a careful bal-
ance between the competing priorities of law enforcement, national
security, economic development, scientific research, and space ex-
ploration, while having limited resources. As a result, this bill rep-
resents responsible spending at a time when the United States is
living within a constrained Federal budget.
The DOC is charged with addressing and executing several crit-
ical functions, which include ensuring the effective operation of our
Nation’s world class weather satellites and forecasting severe
storms; enforcing trade laws to ensure American businesses can
compete on a level playing field; collecting economic and population
data; promoting exports from small- and medium-sized businesses;
working with distressed communities to spur economic develop-
ment; and properly managing our Nation’s fisheries.
The Committee has made a concerted effort to spur U.S. eco-
nomic growth through targeted investments in the Economic Devel-
opment Administration [EDA] and our Nation’s trade agencies such
as the USTR and the ITC, as well as the International Trade Ad-
ministration [ITA] and the Bureau of Industry and Security [BIS]
(4)

within DOC. Together, these agencies help businesses get started,
compete internationally, and grow.
Additionally, the changing landscape of criminal activity and na-
tional security both at home and abroad continues to test the DOJ’s
ability to deal with and adapt to emerging threats. The Committee
believes that our Federal law enforcement agencies must work col-
laboratively to focus and streamline limited resources in a manner
that safeguards taxpayer dollars while preserving public safety.
The Committee strongly supports DOJ’s missions to combat violent
crime, disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations, and
uphold the administration of justice. In addition, the fiscal year
2026 bill provides funding for grants to help State, local, and Tribal
law enforcement responsibly and safely protect our Nation’s com-
munities, help survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault,
and better respond to substance use disorder. The Committee also
provides the necessary funding for the Bureau of Prisons to con-
tinue implementation of criminal justice reforms and programming
created by the First Step Act (Public Law 115–391).
For the science agencies, the Committee provides targeted invest-
ments to enable progress toward the goal of returning Americans
to the Moon—and ultimately setting foot on Mars—and enhancing
the United States’ leadership in space and science. Within NSF,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA],
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST],
the Committee recommendation supports initiatives to enhance
American competitiveness through research in quantum informa-
tion science, artificial intelligence, weather and climate research,
and other strategic fields. The bill also makes targeted investments
in NSF to continue its core research, develop the scientific work-
force, and fund programs in the Directorate of Technology, Innova-
tion, and Partnerships [TIP].
FIGHTING WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE
The departments, agencies, boards, offices, and commissions
funded in this bill can and should continue to reduce operating ex-
penses by placing greater scrutiny on overhead costs. Savings can
and should be achieved by reducing non-essential travel, office sup-
ply, rent, and utility costs. The Committee also calls on depart-
ments, agencies, boards, offices, and commissions funded in this
bill to continue to achieve savings by lowering travel contractor
costs related to air fares. The Committee continues longstanding
restrictions on first class travel.
The Committee is extremely concerned about the persistent pat-
tern of cost overruns and schedule slippages on major projects and
missions carried out by the agencies within this bill. In addition,
reports have exposed a culture within many agencies that exhibits
a lack of accountability and oversight of grant funding. Therefore,
the Committee continues bill-wide provisions to ensure greater
oversight and fiscal responsibility of taxpayer dollars.
First, the bill requires each agency to notify the Committee im-
mediately upon identification of program cost overruns greater
than 10 percent.
Second, the bill requires the Inspectors General of the DOC,
DOJ, NASA, NSF, and LSC to conduct reviews of grant and con-

6
tract funds to ensure funds are being spent appropriately. In addi-
tion, the Government Accountability Office [GAO] will review a
random sample of Congressionally Directed Spending projects.
Third, the bill requires all departments and agencies to link all
contracts that provide award fees to successful acquisition out-
comes, and prohibits funds to pay for award or incentive fees for
contractors with below satisfactory performance.
The Committee also supports long-standing provisions that were
once solely included in this bill but have since become government-
wide provisions. These include requiring each department, agency,
board, and commission funded in this bill to report spending on
large conferences to the Inspectors General for audit; requiring all
departments and agencies funded in this bill to provide full access
to documents and data for their respective Inspectors General to
conduct investigations and audits; and prohibiting funds from
being used for contracts, memoranda of understanding, cooperative
agreements, grants, or loan activities if the proposed recipient has
unpaid Federal tax liabilities or was convicted of a felony criminal
violation.
Finally, the Committee intends to continue to work with the
GAO to expand the review of selected large-scale acquisition and
construction projects. Specifically, the Committee directs ongoing
GAO reviews of large NASA projects, major research equipment
and facilities construction at the NSF, with reports to the Com-
mittee on a semiannual basis. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes funding for agencies’ Offices of Inspectors General [OIG] to
ensure strong accountability and oversight of Federal programs in
this bill.
Agencies shall provide access to all necessary data, as deter-
mined by GAO, in order for these reviews to be completed and pro-
vided to the Committee in a timely manner. The Committee be-
lieves that these project status reports are valuable in identifying
cost overrun and schedule slippage problems early so they can be
addressed immediately and has used information in the reviews to
develop this recommendation.
Federal Vehicle Fleet Management.—The General Services Ad-
ministration [GSA] issues guidance on Federal fleet management,
but the Federal vehicle fleet is decentralized, with each agency
maintaining flexibility to manage vehicle utilization as appropriate.
In order to provide better transparency and accountability of fund-
ing for Federal vehicles, the Committee directs agencies funded in
this bill to conduct an annual review of fleet utilization during the
third quarter of each fiscal year and provide their corresponding
OIGs with supporting documentation on the method used for deter-
mining optimal fleet inventories and justification for any deviation
from GSA’s Federal Property Management Regulations. OIGs shall
be responsible for conducting annual audits of fleet management
practices and make the subsequent results for non-law enforcement
sensitive agencies publicly available.
Reducing Duplication and Improving Efficiencies.—The Com-
mittee directs each agency funded in this bill to report to the Com-
mittee, within 1 year of enactment of this act, on all efforts made
to address the duplication of Federal programs identified by annual
GAO reports along with identifying substantive challenges and

7
legal barriers to implementing GAO’s recommendations and sug-
gested legislative recommendations that could help the agency to
further reduce duplication.
REPROGRAMMINGS, REORGANIZATIONS, AND RELOCATIONS
Section 505, contained in the General Provisions of Title V of the
bill, provides procedures for the reprogramming of funds. To repro-
gram is to change the use of funds from the specific purposes pro-
vided for in the bill and the accompanying explanatory statement
or, in the absence of direction from the Committee, from the spe-
cific purposes provided for in the administration’s budget request.
Each title of the bill has also traditionally included separate provi-
sions that define permissible transfers of resources between appro-
priation accounts. These transfer authority provisions are also pur-
suant to section 505 and were initiated in the early 1990s to pro-
vide additional flexibility to the agencies under the subcommittee’s
jurisdiction.
The Committee expects each department and agency to closely
follow the reprogramming procedures listed in section 505. These
procedures apply to funds provided under this bill, provided under
previous appropriations acts that remain available for obligation or
expenditure in fiscal year 2026, or provided from any accounts in
the Treasury available to the agencies funded by this bill. Section
505 requires that the Committee be notified by letter, at least 30
days prior to reprogramming of funds, whether permanent or tem-
porary, in excess of $500,000 or 5 percent, whichever is less, be-
tween programs, projects, or activities. Section 505 of this act is
also applicable in cases where funding for an activity is reduced by
5 percent. In addition, the Committee is to be notified of re-
programming actions which are less than these amounts if such ac-
tions would have the effect of committing the agency to significant
funding requirements in future years; increasing funds or per-
sonnel by any means for any program, project, or activity for which
funds have been previously denied or restricted by Congress; cre-
ating new programs, offices, agencies, or commissions or substan-
tially augmenting existing programs, offices, agencies, or commis-
sions; relocating offices or employees; or reorganizing offices, pro-
grams, or activities.
The Committee also expects that any items that are subject to
interpretation will be reported. In particular, the Department of
Justice is directed to submit to the Committee all legal opinions
evaluating section 505. The Committee expects that each depart-
ment and agency funded in the bill will follow these notification
policies precisely and will not reallocate resources or reorganize ac-
tivities prior to submitting the required notifications to the Com-
mittee. Reprogramming or transfer requests shall be submitted
only in the case of an unforeseen emergency or situation that could
not have been anticipated when formulating the budget request for
the current fiscal year.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS
The Committee directs that all departments and agencies funded
within this bill shall submit all of their fiscal year 2027 budget jus-

8
tifications concurrently with the official submission of the adminis-
tration’s budget to Congress. Further, all departments and agencies
with classified programs funded within this act are directed to sub-
mit their classified budget justification documents to the Com-
mittee, through appropriate means, at the same time the unclassi-
fied budget justifications are transmitted.
These justifications shall include a sufficient level of detailed
data, exhibits, and explanatory statements to support the appro-
priations requests, including tables that outline each agency’s pro-
grams, projects, and activities for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. For
example, when requesting an enhancement of resources, the jus-
tification should detail the existing program and what the new re-
sources would buy. The Committee directs the chief financial officer
of each department or agency funded in this act’s jurisdiction to en-
sure that adequate justification is given to each increase, decrease,
and staffing and function change proposed in the fiscal year 2027
budget, particularly within the departmental operations and man-
agement accounts.
The Committee expects that the fiscal year 2027 submissions will
include sufficient detail to justify all programs, projects, and activi-
ties contained in each department, agency, office, or commission
budget request. Budget justifications are prepared not for the use
of the agencies but are the primary tool the Committee uses to
evaluate the resource requirements and proposals requested by the
administration.
AGENCY SPENDING PLANS
Section 528, a longstanding provision of the Commerce, Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, requires each
agency funded by this act to submit spending plans to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the
Senate not later than 45 days after the date of enactment. Section
1113 of the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions
Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4) contained a substantially similar re-
quirement. Nonetheless, DOC, NASA, and NSF failed to provide
substantive spending plans. Accordingly, the Committee has cur-
tailed the flexibilities it had previously provided to DOC, NASA,
and NSF through transfer authorities.
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Committee directs the departments and agencies funded in
this bill to submit reports by the deadlines detailed herein or to
provide advance notification if there is sufficient reason why dead-
lines cannot be met, along with the expected date of submission.
The Committee also recognizes that some enduring reporting re-
quirements from previous appropriations laws may no longer be
necessary for congressional oversight purposes. In the interest of
reducing government waste and expediting responses to current re-
port mandates, each department or agency is invited to submit a
list of reporting requirements that it considers outdated or no
longer relevant for the review of the Committees on Appropria-
tions. Any list submitted for review shall cite the original author-

9
ity, as well as a justification for eliminating each reporting require-
ment.
REDUCTIONS-IN-FORCE
The Committee directs departments or agencies funded in the ac-
companying bill that are planning to conduct a reduction-in-force
to notify the Committee in writing 90 days in advance of the date
of the proposed personnel action.
APPROPRIATIONS LIAISONS
The Committee prefers to channel the majority of its inquiries
and requests for information and assistance through the budget of-
fices or comptroller offices of the departments and agencies which
it oversees but reserves the right to call upon any individual or or-
ganization in any agency under its jurisdiction. The Committee di-
rects the chief financial officer of DOC, DOJ, NASA, and NSF to
provide an in-person briefing to the Committee on the first day of
each quarter of fiscal year 2026.
ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE FOR FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES
The Committee directs the departments and agencies funded in
this bill to report to the Committee, within 180 days of the date
of enactment of this act, and include in annual budget justifications
thereafter, on their efforts to help provide access to high-quality af-
fordable child care for the children of those Federal employees. The
reports shall detail all current programs or efforts that assist de-
partment or agency employees with child care, identify programs-
including for recruitment and retention-that assist with child care,
provide the number of employees utilizing such programs, and de-
tail associated costs. Additionally, departments and agencies shall
survey employees on the level of interest in such programs or ef-
forts if they are not currently provided by a department or agency.
Where possible, departments and agencies shall identify whether
access to child care hinders recruitment or retention efforts, pro-
vide the geographical locations where such hindrance occurs, and
identify targeted solutions for such hindrances.
INDIRECT COST RATE
The Committee recognizes that indirect cost recovery has been
essential for supporting federally-funded research at university and
private laboratories, enabling critical institutional functions such
as Federal compliance, research facility operations, and administra-
tive support. The Committee acknowledges that optimizing indirect
cost rates can further enhance the efficiency of funding allocation
for direct research and programmatic activities, benefiting early-ca-
reer researchers, smaller institutions, and community-based orga-
nizations. Ensuring an effective balance in indirect costs is key to
sustaining U.S. leadership in scientific research and technological
innovation. The Committee notes the academic research commu-
nity’s efforts to develop a consensus proposal to refine this balance.

10
In anticipation of that effort, the Committee introduces a new Title
V General Provision on indirect cost rates.
FEDERAL TRUST AND TREATY RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee reminds agencies funded by this act of their obli-
gation to uphold the Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to
Tribes and Federal obligations to the Native Hawaiian Community.
This includes upholding treaty and reserved rights, and any other
rights and obligations under Federal law; supporting self-deter-
mination efforts by Native communities; fulfilling obligations under
Presidential Memoranda and Executive Orders; and conducting
early and robust government-to-government consultation with
Tribes, and meaningful outreach and engagement with Native Ha-
waiians.

TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
The Committee recommends a total of $10,873,807,000 for the
Department of Commerce [DOC]. The recommendation is
$485,997,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The DOC is responsible for a variety of activities critical to our
Nation’s well-being, including economic development, intellectual
property protection, standards and measurements, trade enforce-
ment, weather forecasting, and fisheries management. Our Nation
relies on the Department to maintain America’s competitiveness
within today’s foreign markets while promoting and expanding
international trade opportunities. The Department brings together
a diverse set of bureaus, specialized experts, research laboratories,
and applied technology programs to support and expand opportuni-
ties for growth in the private sector. Few departments have such
potential to directly impact the strength and sustainability of our
communities and local businesses.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $623,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 605,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $605,000,000 for the
International Trade Administration [ITA]. The recommendation is
$18,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The discre-
tionary appropriation is offset by $12,000,000 in fee collections. The
Committee recognizes the importance of Global Markets [GM] and
continues to strongly support the program. The Committee directs
ITA to apply reductions amongst the business units proportionally.
GM supports job creation in the United States and strengthens
U.S. economic and national security by promoting U.S. exports, at-
tracting inward investment, and ensuring market access and a
level playing field in international trade for U.S. companies and in-
dustries.
Offsetting Fee Collections.—ITA shall continue to identify and in-
clude an accurate assessment of expected fee collections and cor-
responding expenditures.
Travel and Tourism.—The Committee notes the importance of
travel and tourism as economic engines for communities across the
country. The Committee provides an amount equal to the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level for ITA to continue implementing the ‘‘Visit
America Act.’’
Staffing Levels at Foreign and Domestic Offices.—The Committee
is concerned that Global Markets staff vacancies within client-fac-
ing positions are hindering opportunities for U.S. businesses to
(11)

12
compete in international markets and compromising foreign direct
investment opportunities within the United States. The Committee
directs ITA to provide a briefing, within 180 days of enactment of
this act, on its strategy to ensure client-facing staff vacancies are
addressed so that GM services are not degraded.
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement [USMCA] Secretariat.—
The Committee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level for ITA to continue to support the U.S. Section of the Secre-
tariat, authorized by the USMCA Implementation Act (Public Law
116–113).
Budget and Staffing Oversight.—The Committee directs ITA to
continue to submit, no later than 30 days after the end of each fis-
cal quarter, an update on the previous quarter’s accomplishments,
upcoming activity, milestones, and budget and staffing updates.
Furthermore, the update shall contain recent hiring activity within
GM’s U.S. Commercial Service.
Silane.—The Committee recognizes the importance of silane gas
in building a competitive domestic advanced semiconductor supply
chain. The limited number of domestic sources for silane, along
with the potential export of available silane for foreign use, rep-
resent risks to national security. Multiple domestic sources of sil-
ane are needed to maintain the country’s leadership in advanced
semiconductors and to support job creation through building a ro-
bust domestic battery industry. Within 180 days of enactment of
this act, ITA is directed to coordinate with the Department of Ener-
gy’s Office of Electricity to provide a report to the Committee on
anticipated silane demand growth over the next decade, existing ef-
forts to diversify and increase domestic production of silane, and
risks to semiconductor, battery, and solar panel supply chains
posed by our reliance on imported silane.
Increased International Commercial Engagement and Export Pro-
motion.—The Committee is concerned by the continuing erosion of
the U.S. share of the global export market and believes that the
Department must prioritize ITA’s commercial engagement efforts
to level the international playing field for U.S. exporters. In par-
ticular, the Committee remains concerned that the Federal Govern-
ment does not have adequate resourcing in place to significantly in-
crease exports to Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Pa-
cific region. Prior to obligating funds to open any new international
office and hire additional staff, ITA shall provide the Committee
with a detailed spending plan, which shall include a staffing plan
and a justification for the establishment of any new office.
General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR].—The Committee
urges ITA to continue its efforts to educate small businesses about
the GDPR. The Committee is concerned that small businesses may
be unaware of compliance obligations as a result of GDPR and
could be vulnerable to fines and significant financial risk. The
Committee encourages ITA to work with Federal, State, and local
partners to raise awareness about GDPR obligations on American
small businesses.
Rural Export Assistance.—The Committee encourages the Sec-
retary to prioritize expanding international trade opportunities for
rural businesses. The Committee provides not less than the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level for rural export centers [REC] and not less

13
than $2,000,000 for the National Rural Export Center. Prior to ob-
ligating funds to open any new REC, hire additional staff based at
such new centers, and modify existing rural export centers, ITA
shall submit a detailed spending plan, which shall include a staff-
ing plan and a justification for the establishment of any new center
or modification of an existing center. The Committee directs ITA to
prioritize and provide full operational funding of this program, and
provide the Committee with a briefing, within 30 days of enact-
ment of this act, on efforts to sustain REC and the National Rural
Export Center.
Post-Conflict Support for Ukraine.—The Committee encourages
ITA to engage in post-conflict reconstruction planning for Ukraine,
including the expansion of U.S. activities to strengthen economic
engagement with Ukraine.
United Kingdom [UK] Tariff Rate Quota [TRQ] Attestation.—The
Committee is appreciative of the work that DOC and ITA have
done to protect domestic steel and aluminum producers, including
its work in establishing the 2022 TRQ with the UK. However, the
Committee is concerned with the UK’s seeming lack of trans-
parency with parts of the TRQ, specifically as it pertains to the
verification of the results of the audits conducted on British steel
producers that are owned or controlled by People’s Republic of
China [PRC] stakeholders. The Committee urges ITA to continue
working with the UK to publish data and audit information used
to make the determination in the UK’s attestation.
U.S.-European Union [EU] Trade and Technology Council
[TTC].—The Committee recognizes the importance of the TTC as a
forum for promoting U.S. and EU competitiveness and prosperity
through increasing transatlantic trade, investment, and engage-
ment on matters related to critical and emerging technology. The
Committee awaits receipt of the joint report on the U.S.-EU TTC,
as directed by the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public
Law 118–42.
Steel Import Monitoring Analysis Program.—The Committee
urges ITA to update the scope of its Steel Import Monitoring Anal-
ysis [SIMA] system to better harmonize it with the scope of the
President’s Section 232 steel tariffs. Comprehensive SIMA coverage
will help ensure that the derivative steel products entering into the
United States are doing so transparently and in a manner con-
sistent with U.S. and international trade laws.
Shipbuilding and Maintenance Sector.—The Committee notes the
strategic and economic importance of U.S. shipbuilding and mainte-
nance sector. Recent executive actions—including the Section 301
United States Trade Representative [USTR] Action on China’s Tar-
geting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Domi-
nance, and Executive Order 14629—have sought to strengthen the
sector. The Committee directs ITA, in consultation with USTR and
within 180 days of enactment of this act, to submit a report on the
U.S. shipbuilding and maintenance sector. The report shall include:
(1) the percentage of U.S. parts, components, and supplies that are
utilized in the implementation of Executive Order 14629 and in the
USTR’s relief measures; (2) an analysis of DOC’s ability to track
parts used in the maritime sector, including its ability to track
trade flows, identify foreign unfair trade barriers, and practices

14
that limit the export of U.S. parts and components; and (3) an
analysis of Federal efforts to restore U.S. capacity to build port in-
frastructure, including ship-to-shore cranes.
Trade Enforcement.—ITA is directed to submit an annual report
to the Committee providing the total number of open antidumping
and countervailing duty [AD/CVD] orders during the fiscal year, in-
cluding investigations and administrative reviews, compared to the
past three fiscal years, and the total number of final determina-
tions and final results in AD/CVD proceedings remanded to the
agency or subject to remand proceedings during the relevant fiscal
year by the U.S. Court of International Trade.
Cultural Trade Impact.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant role that cultural trade plays in our economic growth and di-
rects ITA to provide a briefing, within 180 days of enactment of
this act, regarding its current efforts to promote cultural trade
goods, future efforts, and recommendations for legislative actions
needed to further support the industries that create these goods.
BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $191,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 211,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $211,000,000 for the
Bureau of Industry and Security [BIS]. The recommendation is
$20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
BIS is the principal agency involved in the development, imple-
mentation, and enforcement of export controls for commercial tech-
nologies and for many military technologies as a result of export
control reform. The Export Enforcement Division detects, prevents,
investigates, and assists in the sanctioning of illegal exports of
such items.
Export Control Regulatory Compliance Assistance.—The Com-
mittee directs BIS to continue its exporter outreach program to
educate companies of all sizes on their obligations related to export
controls. In this effort, BIS, working with ITA U.S. Export Assist-
ance Centers, should continue targeting small- and medium-sized
businesses and working with State and local trade and export asso-
ciations, in addition to working with national industry groups, to
ensure that small- and medium-sized businesses have clear, easy-
to-understand information about complying with export control reg-
ulations.
Enforcement of Russia Export Controls.—The Committee con-
tinues to support BIS’s aggressive enforcement of Russian and
Belarussian export controls and other BIS efforts to counter Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Committee directs BIS, within 180
days of enactment of this act, to submit a report detailing the agen-
cy’s efforts to work with international allies and partners to har-
monize this export control regime, with the aim of denying Russia
access to controlled items to inhibit its illegal war of aggression in
Ukraine. The report shall also address the feasibility of banning
the export of the vessels, parts, and components necessary to ex-
port oil, petroleum, and LNG to Russia. The report shall detail the
extent of direct or indirect export, re-export, or in-country transfer

15
of any vessels built or retro-fitted to transport oil, petroleum, or liq-
uid natural gas to Russian persons and proxies of Russia, including
components or parts necessary to build or maintain such vessels.
Revision of Firearms License Requirements.—To understand the
impact BIS’s interim final rule [IFR] (89 FR 34680) has on U.S.
manufacturers and their suppliers and national security interests,
the Committee directs BIS, within 15 days of enactment of this act,
to provide a briefing that details the national security and eco-
nomic impacts of the IFR.
Competitiveness Assessment for New Breeding Techniques
[NBT].—The Committee notes that the PRC has engaged in the
forced technology transfer of American agricultural intellectual
property. The Committee is aware that China’s ag-biotech regu-
latory regime requires American companies seeking approval of
gene-edited crops utilizing NBTs to provide highly proprietary and
detailed sequencing information on their products as well as the
underlying technology. Scientific breakthroughs in ag-biotech are a
critical area of technological competition between the United States
and China when it comes to future food security. Therefore, the
Committee directs the BIS to develop and submit a plan to the
Committee, within 180 days of enactment of this act, regarding
tools the agency can use hasten the regulatory clearance and pro-
tection of this category of American precision plant breeding from
the forced export of sensitive U.S. technology.
Investigation on PRC-based Light Detection and Ranging
[LIDAR] Companies.—The Committee is concerned about the po-
tential national security threat posed by PRC-based LIDAR compa-
nies, and recognizes the partnerships between Chinese LIDAR
manufacturers and the People’s Liberation Army to enable autono-
mous military vehicles systems. Further, the Committee recognizes
the use of Chinese-manufactured LIDAR for police and prison sur-
veillance measures in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
The Committee directs BIS, within 180 days of the enactment of
this act, to report on whether PRC-manufactured LIDAR compa-
nies meet the requirements to be added to the Entity List.
Flow Cytometers.—The Committee is concerned with the possible
unintended consequences of IFR (RIN 0694–AJ95). The IFR may
have substantial consequences for American-made medical devices,
potentially creating an unfair advantage for Chinese manufactur-
ers while putting U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage. Further-
more, the Interim Final Rule may undermine national security by
weakening the biotech industry, a critical component in sustaining
technological leadership over global competitors. The Committee
encourages the Department to review this regulation and brief the
Committee, within 30 days of the enactment of this act, on implica-
tions to U.S. manufacturers and national security.
Artificial Intelligence [AI] Diffusion Rule.—The Committee notes
the Department’s withdrawal of the previous Interim Final AI Dif-
fusion Rule. As the Department continues working to ensure U.S.
leadership in the AI ecosystem, the Committee urges the Depart-
ment to balance commercial interest with national security. Main-
taining American leadership requires a continued competitive pres-
ence promoting adoption of U.S. innovations abroad.

16
Connected Inverter Systems.—The Committee notes that energy
systems with inverters increasingly rely on common computing and
network infrastructure to perform all aspects of operation and
maintenance. As such, its integration with the Internet of Things
[IoT] has introduced new security threats into the electrical grid.
Further, significant inverter equipment is produced by foreign enti-
ties of concern. As such, within 180 days of the enactment of this
act, the committee directs BIS to submit a report to the Committee
regarding the national security, foreign policy, and economic risks
associated with the widespread deployment of connected inverter
equipment manufactured by foreign entities of concern.
Reciprocal Defense Procurement [RDP] Agreements.—The Com-
mittee notes the recent GAO report on oversight of RDP Agree-
ments (GAO–25–106936) and its associated recommendations. Con-
sistent with the GAO recommendation directed at the DOC, the
Committee encourages BIS, in consultation with other appropriate
offices within Commerce, to update its guidance to address weak-
nesses in its methodology assessing the potential effects of RDP
Agreements on U.S. industry so that it is based on sound economic
reasoning and rigorous methodology and leverages the expertise of
other appropriate offices within the Department. The Committee
encourages DOC to collaborate with the Department of Defense to
develop a process, including written policies and procedures, for
evaluating the possible impacts of any RDP Agreement under nego-
tiation. Further, the Committee encourages the Department to de-
velop a written process for ongoing analysis and monitoring of the
impact these agreements have on U.S. industry over time, includ-
ing robust economic analysis and mechanisms for advising the De-
partment of Defense on recommended amendments during re-nego-
tiation of any existing agreement.
Whistleblower Incentives for Export Control Enforcement.—The
Committee recognizes the growing national security threat posed
by the illegal export of sensitive U.S. technologies, particularly ad-
vanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence-enabling chips, to
foreign adversaries. To strengthen enforcement of export controls
under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (title XVII of Public
Law 115–232), the Committee encourages the establishment of a
whistleblower incentive and protection program at BIS. Therefore,
the Committee directs the Department to submit a report, within
120 days of enactment, outlining a framework for such a program.
The report shall include the feasibility of a program that provides
financial rewards to individuals who voluntarily provide original
information relating to potential violations of U.S. export control
laws. The report should also include criteria for eligibility, proce-
dures for reward determinations, and mechanisms for interagency
coordination. Any framework shall include strict protections for the
identity and safety of whistleblowers, and rewards should be issued
only upon successful enforcement actions resulting from submitted
information. Further, in its framework, BIS is encouraged to de-
velop secure reporting channels, coordinate with relevant law en-
forcement and intelligence agencies, and allocate resources to re-
view, investigate, and act on credible tips. The report should also
identify anticipated funding needs for administration and over-
sight.

17
Defense Impact of Section 232 Tariffs.—The Committee directs
BIS, within 180 days of enactment of this act, to submit a report
on the impacts of existing section 232 tariffs on the defense supply
chain, including the number of jobs affected, and on national secu-
rity. This report should include information about increased costs
or lead times for new orders or materials; any potential shortages
of components, parts, or finished equipment; and the impact on
aerospace and defense manufacturers downstream of the tariffed
products.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $468,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 426,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $426,000,000 for the
Economic Development Administration [EDA]. The recommenda-
tion is $42,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
EDA provides assistance to local governments and nonprofit
agencies for public works, planning, and other projects designed to
facilitate economic development. This assistance could come in the
form of grants, contracts for research and technical assistance, or
prize competitions that incentivize entities beyond EDA’s usual set
of eligible recipients to think through and address broad economic
development issues. The Committee directs EDA to coordinate with
regional development organizations to support projects that will ad-
dress some of the pressing issues that challenge rural economic de-
velopment.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $400,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 360,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $360,000,000 for Eco-
nomic Development Assistance Programs. The recommendation is
$40,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee directs EDA to focus on its core programs and mission to aid
the most distressed communities across the country. The Com-
mittee expects EDA to use all available carryover and prior year
recoveries to the maximum extent possible. EDA shall consider geo-
graphic equity in making all award decisions and shall ensure that
rural projects are adequately represented among those selected for
funding. Of the amounts provided, funds are to be distributed as
follows:

Outdoor Recreation Projects.—The Committee notes that projects
supporting outdoor recreation are a catalyst for economic develop-
ment and should be eligible for EDA funding. EDA is encouraged
to consider such projects when consistent with a region’s Com-
prehensive Economic Development Strategy.
Economic Development Representatives.—The Committee strongly
supports EDA’s effort to promote access to its economic develop-
ment assistance programs through the use of Economic Develop-
ment Representatives [EDRs] in under-resourced communities. The
Committee directs EDA to provide a briefing on staffing levels of
EDRs within 30 days of the enactment of this act.
Prize Competitions.—The Committee encourages EDA to use
prize competitions, where appropriate, to help find innovative an-
swers to challenging, long-standing economic development issues.
Prize competitions have the potential to spur innovation and sur-
face the solutions needed to unlock economic opportunity.
Economic Adjustment Assistance [EAA].—EAA is EDA’s most
flexible economic development program, providing funding for
projects ranging from disaster recovery to business accelerators and
incubators. Within funding for EAA, the Committee supports
EDA’s collaborations with the Delta Regional Authority, the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional
Commission to assist distressed communities. Additionally, EDA is
directed to begin collaboration with the Southwest Border Regional
Commission.
The Committee also notes that EAA can assist communities deal-
ing with the closures of energy plants, resulting in job losses and
dramatic reductions to local tax bases. The Committee appreciates
the work EDA has undertaken in prior years to assist communities
impacted by recent or scheduled plant closures, including commu-
nities addressing biomass power plant closures, nuclear power
plant closures and coal-fired power plant closures. The Committee
directs EDA to consider the needs of these communities in award-
ing EAA grants.
Assistance to Manufacturing Communities and Distressed Com-
munities.—The Committee encourages EDA to invest in public-pri-
vate partnerships that target distressed areas seeking to diversify
their local workforce through advanced manufacturing operations.
When working with distressed communities, EDA shall work to
identify the best funding sources to meet community needs and to
assist with the technical requirements that must be included in
each grant proposal. The Committee reminds EDA that distressed
communities most in need of funding are often poorly positioned to

19
produce a technical and sophisticated proposal required for agency
funding.
Regional Innovation Program [RIP].—The Committee provides
$50,000,000 for the RIP program and directs EDA to invest in uni-
versity based, high-tech business incubators that encourage entre-
preneurship and patent creation, grow the workforce, and promote
technology commercialization, particularly for distressed manufac-
turing and legacy communities, and support the development of re-
gional innovation clusters that focus on clean and renewable en-
ergy technologies. EDA shall continue to ensure that RIP awards
go to multiple grantees in multiple and diverse geographic areas,
including an increased focus on organizations and States that have
not previously received funding from the program. Furthermore,
within funds provided for RIP, EDA shall award not less than 40
percent of grants to support rural communities.
Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs [Tech Hubs].—The
Committee provides $60,000,000 for the Tech Hubs program.
Recompete Pilot Program.—The Committee recommendation pro-
vides $15,000,000 for the Recompete Pilot Program. The Committee
encourages EDA to consider designating any finalists from a pre-
vious funding round that did not receive an implementation award
as finalists in future funding competitions.
Working Waterfronts.—Working waterfronts have long been an
important component of the U.S. economy, supporting commercial
and recreational activities. The Committee provides not less than
$7,000,000 for projects to revitalize, expand, and upgrade the phys-
ical infrastructure of working waterfronts to attract new industry,
encourage business expansion, diversify local economies, and gen-
erate or retain long-term private sector jobs and investment.
New Forest Products.—The Committee notes that many forest-
based economies have experienced disruption and decline in recent
years. EDA is encouraged to work, including through RIP, with
communities and regions that have been adversely impacted by
rapid changes in the timber and pulp marketplaces and to support
projects that help these communities develop related industries, in-
cluding commercialization of new forest products using low-grade
wood. This work may include the coordination of economic develop-
ment efforts across multiple States or Economic Development Dis-
tricts. Additionally, the Committee reiterates that communities fac-
ing job losses are eligible for all EDA programs.
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math [STEM] Apprentice-
ships and Workforce Development.—The Committee notes the re-
cent growth of STEM-related industries across the country. Given
this trend, the Committee provides $2,500,000 to create and ex-
pand STEM apprenticeship and other workforce training models to
help workers develop the skills necessary to join this growing in-
dustry. Within the funds provided, the Committee directs EDA to
prioritize implementation grants, to the extent practicable.
Rural Economic Development.—The Committee recognizes the
economic development challenges rural communities face and en-
courages EDA, in coordination with regional development organiza-
tions, including regional councils, to continue to support projects
that address these challenges.

20
Prioritizing Housing Supply.—The Committee recognizes that
economic development and job creation will not benefit residents
unless there is sufficient housing supply, and that land use regula-
tions in many regions prevent the new housing supply needed to
accommodate economic growth. The Committee encourages EDA to
provide guidance for the inclusion of a component in Comprehen-
sive Economic Development Strategies related to housing supply
and deregulation to address land use and zoning barriers to hous-
ing. The Committee also encourages EDA to ensure that projects
funded through its Planning and Local Technical Assistance pro-
grams include such a component, and to consider prioritizing juris-
dictions that have removed land use and zoning barriers to housing
production in discretionary grants, including its Economic Adjust-
ment Assistance, Public Works, and Recompete grants. Within 90
days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs EDA to pro-
vide an update on ways EDA funds could support housing supply
and land use deregulation priorities.
Program Duplication.—The Committee appreciates the GAO’s ef-
forts to analyze potential program duplication across the Federal
Government, pursuant to the directive in Senate Report 118–62
and as incorporated into the joint explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 118–42. The Committee looks forward to re-
viewing the report.
Capacity Building for Business Districts.—Business districts
drive entrepreneurship, local business ownership, economic growth,
and job creation. They are an essential part of the economic devel-
opment ecosystem for towns, cities, and rural communities. Local
business district organizations are well positioned to provide tech-
nical assistance to drive job creation and job retention in these
communities, but often face significant challenges in accessing EDA
funds due to the relatively small scale and highly local scope of
their operations. To help overcome these challenges, increase effi-
ciency, and minimize administrative costs, the Committee encour-
ages EDA to leverage national non-profit networks and their exist-
ing infrastructure to provide support to local business district orga-
nizations through capacity building grants, technical assistance,
training, and dissemination of best practices.
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
[EPSCoR] States and the Tech Hubs Program.—The Committee di-
rects EDA, in accordance with section 10621 of Public Law 117–
167, to ensure that, subject to available appropriations, at least one
eligible consortium so designated as a regional technology hub is
headquartered in a low population State that is eligible to receive
funding from the EPSCoR program of the National Science Foun-
dation.
Economic Development Research.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of university-based research in investigating the myr-
iad economic development challenges facing many regions in the
United States, especially in places that have not benefited from re-
cent technological developments and places transitioning from leg-
acy industries, among others. The Committee provides up to
$2,000,000 to support Research and Evaluation to better inform
economic development decision-making.

21
Assistance to Indigenous Communities.—The recommendation
provides $5,000,000 to provide resources to address the needs of In-
digenous communities that have historically suffered from a lack of
investment in core economic development needs.
Workforce Training Grants.—The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for EDA to invest in Workforce Training Grants, as
authorized by the Thomas R. Carper Water Resources Development
Act of 2024 (Public Law 118–272). Workforce development is a key
component of economic development and the strength of the U.S.
economy depends on a talented and well-trained workforce. EDA is
encouraged to award Workforce Training Grants to support re-
gional partnerships between industry and higher education to de-
velop innovative workforce solutions that create quality jobs, in-
cluding, but not limited to, sectors like advanced manufacturing,
biotechnology, and aeronautics.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $68,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 66,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $66,000,000 for sala-
ries and expenses. The recommendation is $2,000,000 below the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level.
Grant Oversight.—EDA personnel play an essential oversight
role to ensure that grant awards reach the communities they were
meant to serve. The Committee remains concerned that the ratio
of grant awards to EDA post-award management personnel is
unsustainable, jeopardizing the agency’s oversight responsibility as
stewards of Federal dollars. Lack of personnel also slows down the
pace of new awards. These facts underscore the need for additional
post-award management personnel. Therefore, within the funds
provided, EDA is directed to continue exercising proper oversight
of existing grant awards and ensuring new grant awards are made
in a timely manner.
MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY
MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $68,250,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $55,000,000 for the
Minority Business Development Agency [MBDA]. The recommenda-
tion is $13,250,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. MBDA
is the only Federal agency dedicated to promoting the growth of
minority-owned firms and assists small, medium, and large minor-
ity business enterprises in increasing revenues and creating jobs.
The President’s request for fiscal year 2026 proposes the elimi-
nation of MBDA. MBDA was permanently authorized under the
MBDA Act (division K of Public Law 117–58), and performs statu-
tory functions. Congress appropriated $68,250,000 in the Full-Year
Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 (Public Law
119–4) for the operations of the agency. The elimination of an agen-
cy with a permanent authorization and an appropriation requires

22
consultations between the Committee and the Department and the
enactment of a subsequent law.
Transfer Authority.—The amounts made available for the MBDA
may not be transferred for any other purpose.
MBDA Report and Briefing.—The Committee directs MBDA to
submit a report, within 45 days of enactment of this act, explaining
which components or functions of MBDA considers statutorily re-
quired. The Committee also directs MBDA to brief the Committee,
within 30 days of enactment of this act, on any changes to the
agency’s spending or expenditures that resulted from the agency’s
implementation of Executive Order 14238. These changes shall be
described at the program, project, or activity level.
Native Entities.—The Committee’s recommendation provides
$4,000,000 for grants to American Indian, Alaska Native, and Na-
tive Hawaiian entities qualified to provide business, financing, and
technical assistance services to Tribes and encourages MBDA to co-
ordinate with the Department’s Office of Native American Business
Development on these efforts.
ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $125,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 122,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $122,000,000 for Eco-
nomic and Statistical Analysis [ESA], including $8,000,000 for the
Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. The rec-
ommendation is $3,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. ESA conducts research to provide a better understanding of
the U.S. economy, helping government make more informed policy
decisions.
Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account.—The Committee recognizes
the national economic importance of the outdoor recreation indus-
try, and provides the fiscal year 2024 enacted amount to continue
providing national and State-level data detailed statistics on the
impact of outdoor reaction activities on the U.S. economy in sup-
port of the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of
2016 (Public Law 114–249). The Committee directs the Department
to continue working with the outdoor recreation industry, non-
governmental organizations, and other interested stakeholders to
refine the national-level statistics and to continue developing re-
gional statistics.
Commodity Checkoff Programs.—The Committee recognizes that
the Commerce Department’s Concrete Masonry Checkoff Program
is an industry-led program funding the research and promotion of
concrete masonry products. The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to maximize the effectiveness of its checkoff programs by uti-
lizing available escrow funds, managing agency cost reimburse-
ments or developing other administrative remedies, where prac-
ticable, to ensure program resources are fully utilized for their in-
tended purpose.
Distributional Measures of Growth.—The Committee’s rec-
ommendation supports ESA’s efforts to improve and expand dis-
tributional measures of growth. The Committee directs ESA to fur-

23
ther research methods that will allow a quarterly release schedule
with minimal delay.
Gross Domestic Product [GDP] Calculation.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of an accurate, comprehensive measure of
U.S. economic activity and is concerned about potential efforts to
change GDP calculation methods. The efforts may undermine trust
in GDP data, upon which policymakers, investors, and businesses—
among other parties—rely. The Committee directs ESA to brief the
Committee, within 30 days of enactment of this act, on any recent
or present plans to change the method by which GDP is calculated.
This briefing shall include the rationale for any proposed changes
and its likely effect on GDP. The Committee directs ESA to notify
the Committee of any subsequent efforts to change the way GDP
is calculated.
BUREAU OF THE CENSUS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,382,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,520,349,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,520,349,000 for
the Census Bureau. The recommendation is $137,849,000 above the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Data Sets.—The Committee notes the recent removal or modifica-
tion of various Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA]
data sets that were previously publicly available. The Committee’s
questions about these changes remain unanswered. The Committee
directs the Census Bureau and BEA, within 30 days of enactment
of this act, to provide a briefing on the scope of the removal and
modifications to the data sets. The Committee also directs the Cen-
sus Bureau and BEA to provide the Committee with a report, with-
in 180 days of enactment of this act, containing a list of all data
sets that were removed or modified as a result of recent executive
orders or other directives. The report shall also assess why the
data sets were removed or modified and how users of these data
products can access them in their original, unaltered forms.
Termination of Advisory Committees.—The Committee directs the
Census Bureau, in consultation with BEA and within 30 days of
the enactment of this act, to provide a report on the advisory com-
mittee terminations, which occurred in February 2025. The report
should include a complete explanation of why these committees
were terminated and a plan detailing how the Department will re-
ceive input from external stakeholders in the absence of these advi-
sory committees.
CURRENT SURVEYS AND PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $328,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 328,500,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $328,500,000 for cur-
rent surveys and programs. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This account provides for the sala-
ries and expenses associated with the statistical programs of the
Bureau of the Census, including measurement of the Nation’s econ-
omy and the demographic characteristics of the population.

24
PERIODIC CENSUSES AND PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,054,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,191,849,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,191,849,000 for
periodic censuses and programs. The recommendation is
$137,849,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This account provides for the constitutionally mandated Decen-
nial Census as well as other cyclical programs. Additionally, the
Census Bureau conducts individual surveys for other Federal agen-
cies on a reimbursable basis.
American Community Survey [ACS].—The census stakeholder
and data user communities are interested in ensuring the integrity,
utility, and reliability of data from the ACS. Given that the Census
Bureau did not fully release 1 year ACS estimates in 2021, the
Committee requests an update on steps the Census Bureau has
taken and intends to take to modernize the ACS, especially in-
creasing the survey’s sample size, expanding nonresponse follow up
operations, and reducing respondent burden. The Committee seeks
specific feedback estimating the cost of these and any other ACS
enhancements that the Census Bureau is considering. The Com-
mittee also directs the Census Bureau to report on how improve-
ments to the ACS relate to the Bureau’s broader operational trans-
formation efforts. The Committee directs the Bureau to provide a
report addressing these matters within 180 days of enactment of
this act.
Utilizing Libraries and Community Partners for Census Sur-
veys.—The Committee directs the Census Bureau to continue to
conduct outreach to public libraries and other community tech-
nology centers to ensure that they are fully informed about and
equipped to support residents’ participation in Census Bureau sur-
veys. The Bureau should work with libraries, in coordination with
the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as part of the over-
all strategy to maximize response to the ACS, other surveys, and
the decennial Census. Such outreach should include coordinating
with library organizations, providing libraries with informational
materials, and offering webinars or conference presentations to li-
brary audiences, as appropriate for Census surveys and tests.
Research and Evaluation Reports.—The Committee notes that,
earlier this year, the Census Bureau delayed key reports that help
prepare for the 2030 Census and ongoing surveys. The Committee
shares the interest of the census stakeholder and data user com-
munity in ensuring the integrity, utility, and reliability of data
from ongoing surveys and the decennial census. The Committee re-
quests a comprehensive report, within 180 days of enactment of
this act, on how the Census Bureau plans to field the 2030 Census
and other surveys. The report shall include estimated budgetary
needs to prepare for and execute the decennial census.
Effects of Field Office Closures.—The Committee notes that field
office presence is integral to the successful execution of the decen-
nial census and other census products. The Committee directs the
Census Bureau to submit, no later than 180 days after enactment
of this act, a report detailing: (1) the number and location of facili-

25
ties, by quarter, with operations to carry out statutorily required
functions of the Census Bureau; (2) a detailed description of the
criteria the Census Bureau reviewed prior to any field office clo-
sure; (3) a detailed summary for transitioning the statutorily re-
quired functions of a facility that is no longer in service as of the
date of enact of this act; (4) metrics for measuring performance of
statutorily required functions at a program, project, or activity
level disaggregated by region; (5) the number of full time equiva-
lents, by quarter, hired to perform statutorily required functions
hired under Schedule C or the Schedule Policy/Career; and (6) a de-
tailed description of what actions or procedures the Census Bureau
has implemented to monitor any impact to service delivery or to
address service concerns from Federal clients in areas or regions
where the Census Bureau has closed a facility.
Census Test.—Fiscal year 2026 is a crucial year in the ramp up
to the 2030 Census, as the Census Bureau is scheduled to conduct
the 2026 Census Test in six geographically and demographically di-
verse field sites nationwide and with a nationally representative
sample of households. The Committee urges the Census Bureau to
prioritize and protect funding and contracts necessary to ensure
the objectives of the 2026 Census Test are fully realized.
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION
ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $59,000,000

The Committee retains language from previous years allowing
the Secretary to collect reimbursements from other Federal agen-
cies for a portion of the cost resulting from the coordination of spec-
trum management, analysis, and operations. NTIA shall submit a
report to the Committee no later than June 1, 2026, detailing the
collection of reimbursements from other agencies.
Broadband Expansion.—The Committee directs the NTIA to
prioritize broadband deployment to unserved and then underserved
areas in accordance with Public Law 117–58. The Committee fur-
ther directs NTIA to coordinate with the Federal Communications
Commission [FCC] to maintain broadband coverage maps com-
pleted in accordance with Public Law 116–130. Consistent with rel-
evant statutes, NTIA’s broadband programs are not to distribute
funds to States or any providers without basing such decision upon
the FCC’s National Broadband Map and Broadband Funding Map,

26
to the extent applicable, and NTIA shall direct States distributing
funds to subgrantees to do the same.
Broadband Investments under the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act [IIJA].—In Public Law 117–58, Congress made a historic
$65,000,000,000 investment in broadband infrastructure, equity,
and affordability with the goal of connecting all Americans to high-
speed, reliable, and affordable Internet service. These investments
included $42,450,000,000 for the Broadband Equity, Access, and
Deployment [BEAD] program. The Committee supports the prompt
liquidation of BEAD funding to States in alignment with their ap-
proved state broadband plans. These investments also included
$2,750,000,000 to support three programs under the Digital Equity
Act to equip individuals and communities with the skills and tools
needed for full participation in all aspects of society. The Com-
mittee notes that NTIA has not issued any notice of funding oppor-
tunity [NOFO] for the fiscal year 2025 Digital Equity Act grant
funding as required by the IIJA. Should NTIA fail to release the
NOFOs by the time of the enactment of this act, the Committee di-
rects NTIA to issue them immediately upon enactment of this act.
Supply Chain and Workforce.—In administering its broadband
programs, NTIA shall consider the effect of supply chain, workforce
shortages, and uniform guidance procurement requirements, in ad-
dition to other known barriers such as permit approvals, to deter-
mine whether providers can reasonably meet deployment dead-
lines. If NTIA determines these factors unduly impact project com-
mitments or will deter program participation, the agency may use
its discretionary authority to provide waivers of such requirements,
in conjunction with other relief, as necessary.
Policy and Technical Training.—The Committee encourages
NTIA to work with the FCC and the Department of State to pro-
vide support for activities provided under section 7 of Public Law
98–549 and provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level for these activities. As part of these activities, NTIA may pro-
vide assistance and guidance in policy and technical training to im-
part best practices to information technology professionals from de-
veloping countries.

the historic investments Congress has made through the Tribal
Broadband Connectivity Program in the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260) and the IIJA. The Committee
directs NTIA to continue engaging with eligible entities to ensure
the full potential of these investments is realized. The Committee
also directs NTIA to accept applications for the Tribal Broadband
Connectivity Program by mail in addition to online. The Committee
notes the challenges of delivering broadband infrastructure to first-
time users in rural and remote areas, such as limited construction
seasons and higher costs for materials due to inflation. The Com-
mittee encourages NTIA to review such challenges for construction
projects and report to the Committee on the need for supplemental
project funding for construction projects in rural and remote areas,
in specific circumstances in which cost increases are beyond the
control of the award recipient, to ensure projects reach completion.
Broadband Funding Map.—The Committee seeks to ensure that
all Federal broadband deployment programs are working in a com-

27
plementary manner to maximize reach, without waste or redun-
dancy. No less than 90 days after the enactment of this act, the
NTIA shall submit a report to the Committee with a comprehen-
sive update on the measures NTIA has taken to coordinate with
the FCC and populate the Broadband Funding Map pursuant to
section 60105 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub-
lic Law 117–58) with the required data collected via the central
database pursuant to section 903 of title IX of division FF of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260). This
report should include any identification of gaps in data available or
accessible to NTIA in carrying out these statutory obligations.
FirstNet Authority’s Lack of Contract Oversight for Device Con-
nection Targets.—The Committee is disappointed in NTIA and in
the First Responder Network Authority [FirstNet Authority] for
their poor oversight of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband
Network [NPSBN]. The Committee is also alarmed and dis-
appointed in the FirstNet Authority response to the DOC OIG’s re-
ports that highlight the lack of oversight potentially impacting first
responders’ use of the NPSBN. NTIA shall brief the Committee, no
later than 60 days of enactment of this act, detailing how FirstNet
is providing the proper oversight of the NPSBN contract and how
FirstNet Authority plans to implement the DOC OIG’s audit rec-
ommendations.

parts and are not consistently involved in Embassy or consulate
conversations regarding intellectual property matters. The Sec-
retary is directed to work with USPTO, ITA, and the Department
of State to ensure that the attache´s are appropriately utilized, in-
cluding in discussions and negotiations at the counselor rank and
above.
Northern New England Community Outreach Office.—The
Unleashing American Innovators Act of 2022 (division W of Public
Law 117–328) directed USPTO to open a Northern New England
Community Outreach Office [NNECOO] to serve New Hampshire,
Maine, and Vermont. USPTO announced its selection of the loca-
tion of the NNECOO on December 13, 2023. The Committee was
pleased that USPTO entered into an agreement with the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire to open a temporary NNECOO in late 2024
while waiting for the General Services Administration to find a
permanent location. The Committee directs USPTO to provide
quarterly updates to the Committee on its progress in opening this
office, including site selection, facilities, staff hiring, and all related
matters.
IP Theft.—The Committee remains concerned with the growing
theft of IP by and on behalf of foreign government actors, especially
by the PRC, as made clear in the USTR’s Section 301 report, ‘‘Find-
ings of the Investigation into China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices
Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innova-
tion under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.’’ The Committee
urges USPTO to work with all relevant agencies to protect U.S. IP
through education, outreach, foreign IP attache´s, and ongoing trade
negotiations.
Inventorship Guidance for AI-assisted Inventions.—The Com-
mittee notes that USPTO’s Inventorship Guidance for AI-assisted
Inventions may affect the use of AI in the inventive process with
potential consequences for inventors and business. The Committee
directs USPTO, within 90 days of enactment of this act, to provide
a report outlining how the agency plans to address uncertainty for
inventors and businesses in the context of this guidance, including
whether the agency contemplates further changes to the guidance.

AI Safety Testing and Evaluations.—To further expand its crit-
ical work in AI, the Committee provides $6,000,000 for U.S. Center
for AI Standards and Innovation [CAISI], which was formerly
known as the U.S. AI Safety Institute [USAISI], to advance AI re-
search, standards, and testing. In addition, the recommendation
provides an amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for
NIST AI-research base activities.
The Committee encourages NIST to continue creating guidance
and benchmarks for evaluating and auditing AI capabilities, with
a focus on capabilities through which AI could cause harm, such as
in the areas of cybersecurity, biosecurity, and nuclear security. The
Committee is also pleased that NIST requested information from
the public about how to design AI red-teaming exercises for dif-
ferent types of model risks, including specific security risks such as
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks. The Committee
directs NIST to continue these workstreams and prioritize evalu-
ating, auditing, and red-teaming AI capabilities with the potential
to cause large-scale catastrophic harm. The Committee also encour-
ages NIST to build infrastructure and capacity to enable testing of
the most capable AI models ahead of their release and to work to-
wards performing such testing with industry partners in fiscal year
2026.
AI Model Evaluations.—The Committee supports the continu-
ation of the NIST development, implementation, and ongoing re-
finement of AI model evaluations, including testing for accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability across foundation models and high-
impact use cases. NIST is further directed to coordinate with rel-
evant Federal agencies, academia, and industry stakeholders to en-

30
sure these evaluations are aligned with national priorities for
trustworthy and responsible AI development.
Foreign AI Model Evaluations.—The Committee directs NIST to
assess the technical characteristics, capabilities, and potential na-
tional security risks of advanced AI foundation models developed
by foreign adversaries, including those from the People’s Republic
of China. NIST should focus on the development of robust model
evaluation tools, secure testing environments, and benchmarking
methodologies for comparing the capabilities of foreign and domes-
tic AI models, as well as track key drivers of AI performance, in-
cluding compute scale, data access, and algorithmic innovation. The
Committee further directs NIST to publish regular unclassified as-
sessments to inform policymakers on the global trajectory of AI ca-
pabilities and associated security risks.
National Synthetic Content Database.—The Committee supports
efforts by NIST to advance digital content authentication tech-
nologies through the development and maintenance of a National
Synthetic Content Database. The Committee recognizes the bene-
fits of a shared national database to provide coverage of synthetic
content developments, as well as to inform content authentication
efforts in both government and industry.
Digital Content Authentication Prize Challenge.—The Committee
acknowledges the critical importance of content authenticity in an
era where AI can produce highly realistic and potentially deceptive
material. The Committee is aware that competitions are a proven
approach to spurring innovation for complex technical challenges,
enabling the rapid identification of solutions through diverse en-
gagement. The Committee therefore encourages NIST to within 1
year conduct a prize competition on novel ways to identify syn-
thetic content. Priorities for the competition should include: ma-
chine detection and digital forensic methods to detect partial or
fully AI-generated content across single or multimodal content; as-
sessing the robustness, interoperability, and security of
watermarking and other labeling methods across modalities; and
testing innovations in tamper-evident or tamper-proofing content
provenance tools.
AI Consumer Adoption and Standards for Preventing Fraud and
Scams.—AI is a powerful technology that can lower the barrier for
bad actors to create and proliferate harmful scams. To that end,
the Committee encourages NIST to include in their research efforts
a focus on consumer fraud and scam risks, in order to maximize
the benefits of commercial AI deployment and address potential
consumer harms. Additionally, the Committee supports efforts by
NIST to develop standards for the disclosure of audio and visual
synthetic content, including solutions for verifying content prove-
nance and authenticity, as well as collaboration between AI devel-
opers and digital platforms to inform users about the authenticity
of shared content.
Quantum Information Science [QIS].—The Committee supports
NIST’s research program in QIS, as authorized in section 201 of
the National Quantum Initiative Act (Public Law 115–368) and
provides an amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for

tion development through the work of the Quantum Economic De-
velopment Consortium as created by the National Quantum Initia-
tive Act (Public Law 115–368). Within the funds provided, the
Committee encourages NIST to continue its coordination with the
Quantum Economic Development Consortium to conduct workshops
and develop reports identifying public and private use cases that
can benefit from near-term quantum applications. Such workshops
shall be inclusive of the wide variety of quantum technologies and
identify use cases where applications can be developed in under 24
months.
University-Based Quantum User Facilities.—The Committee di-
rects NIST to provide a briefing, within 90 days of the enactment
of this act, on NIST’s research on quantum sensing technology and
how it supports the growth of U.S. businesses and services, includ-
ing whether university-based user facilities focused on quantum
sensing could increase advances.
Cryptographic Module Validation Program [CMVP] Backlog.—
The Committee encourages NIST to continue its ongoing efforts to
streamline the review process and provide updates about planning
for new announcements and future requirements as it continues to
address its CMVP backlog. Additionally, the Committee urges
NIST to consider liaising with or detailing qualified cryptographic
professionals from other parts of the Federal Government. The cur-
rent CMVP backlog poses a potential security risk to Federal Infor-
mation Processing Standards, which will only increase as emerging
quantum computing challenges grow.
Cybersecurity.—The Committee remains concerned about the
number of cyberattacks affecting the Nation and provides an
amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for cybersecurity
research, outreach, industry partnerships, and other activities at
NIST, including the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.
Firmware Resiliency.—The Committee recognizes that enhancing
the private sector’s cybersecurity resilience is a critical component
to protecting national security. Therefore, the Committee rec-
ommends that NIST undertake the development of cybersecurity
guidelines for private companies to implement specific firmware se-
curity. This would include ways to maintain software inventories,
like the Software Bill of Materials, to document all components of
the software in use to enable quick identification of potential
vulnerabilities in their systems.
Gene Synthesis Safety.—The Committee is pleased that NIST en-
tered into a 2-year cooperative research agreement with the non-
profit Engineering Biology Research Consortium to develop screen-
ing and safety tools to defend against the potential misuse of AI
related to nucleic acid synthesis. In developing such screening and
safety tools, the Committee directs NIST to, at a minimum,
prioritize work on tools to guard against any pathogen capable of
potentially causing a pandemic, or any gene(s) specific to potential
pandemic pathogens that either are by themselves hazardous or
could enhance pathogenicity or transmissibility.
Facial Recognition Technologies.—The Committee encourages
NIST to continue to improve and meet the growing demand for the

32
Facial Recognition Vendor Test. The Committee is aware that this
test is an important resource for government, commercial, and aca-
demic developers to assess the quality of their facial recognition
technologies. As more companies and government users invest in
this technology, the test will continue to be a critical step for re-
sponsible use. The Committee encourages NIST to: expand testing
to include a more diverse combination of demographics and envi-
ronmental settings in the test data; develop educational material
and work on image quality standards for data collection; expand
testing to improve enhanced privacy technologies for better tem-
plate protection; and expand existing testing infrastructures in
support of these improvements. The Committee provides an
amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for those pur-
poses.

fiscal year 2024 enacted level for circular economy related research.
In addition, the Committee provides not less than the fiscal year
2024 enacted level for competitive external grants for academic in-
stitutions to investigate plastic and polymeric materials, as well as
novel methods to characterize both known and newly-developed
materials. Such investigations should address ways to increase the
strength of recycled plastics and better understand mechanical
properties, including tensile stress, compressive stress, thermal
properties, and nanostructure of polymeric materials that could
serve as industry standards for recycled plastic products.
Climate and Energy Measurement, Tools, and Testbeds.—The
Committee recognizes the important role that NIST laboratories
play to address climate change through climate measurements and
modeling of greenhouse gas emissions as well as research and tools
to build more resilient communities. The Committee provides an
amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for climate and
energy measurement, tools, and testbeds.
Forward-Looking Building Standards.—The Committee remains
concerned about how climate change will impact the built environ-
ment, and that standards previously set with an assumption of a
stable climate system will expose many Federal and non-Federal
investments to significant, but avoidable, risk. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs NIST to continue to work with NOAA and other ap-
propriate Federal agencies and interested non-Federal parties, as
needed, to identify a consistent and authoritative set of climate in-
formation that emphasizes forward-looking climate data and projec-
tions that should be utilized in the standard-setting process. These
data shall include projections of both chronic climate impacts, such
as sea level rise, and extreme weather events, like hurricanes,
floods, and droughts. This effort shall serve to aid both Federal and
non-Federal bodies to develop standards, building codes, and vol-
untary standards that take into account increasingly extreme
weather events and other climate change challenges. Further, the
Committee directs NIST to provide technical assistance to stand-

33
ards developing organizations regarding use of the identified for-
ward-looking information.
Urban Dome.—The Committee recognizes the value of NIST’s
Greenhouse Gas Measurements Program and Urban Dome Initia-
tive and the importance of accurate measurement science for envi-
ronmental monitoring and human health. These cost-effective capa-
bilities expand and broaden NIST laboratory capabilities for inves-
tigating and developing measurement tools that support inde-
pendent means for determining the accuracy of emissions inventory
data at urban and regional scales. The Committee provides an
amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted amount for the
Greenhouse Gas Measurements Program and Urban Dome Initia-
tive to continue support for the established testbed activities and
to expand sensor network deployments locations.
Wildfire Risk Reduction.—The Committee notes that new homes
continue to be built within the ‘‘wildland-urban interface’’ [WUI]
and that as many as 4.5 million homes are at high or extreme risk
of wildfires. Increased understanding of WUI fire dynamics and
structure ignition mechanisms is critical to improving structure
and community resistance to WUI fires. The Committee encourages
NIST to develop, in coordination with the U.S. Forest Service, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Fire Adminis-
tration, the Office of Wildland Fire on behalf of the Department of
the Interior’s land management agencies, a framework and rec-
ommendations to create greater alignment and support among Fed-
eral agencies for development and implementation of research-
based methods to increase fire safety and build resilient commu-
nities incentivizing projects that increase the resilience of existing
structures, as well as the adaptation of building codes and con-
struction practices to increase ignition resistance of the built envi-
ronment.
Natural Disasters.—The Committee is concerned about increas-
ing costs associated with repairing homes damaged by natural dis-
asters including floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes. The Committee
directs NIST to provide a report estimating the reduction in costs,
and the benefits to housing affordability that could be achieved
through more resilient construction methods.
NIST Center of Excellence and Full-Scale Testing Center for
Building Technologies.—There is a pressing need for more resilient
communities by reducing losses and disruptions due to climate-
driven hazards. Environmental shifts are fueling more intense and
more dangerous storms, and cutting-edge research and testing ca-
pabilities are needed to meet the Nation’s evolving risks. The Com-
mittee directs NIST to develop recommendations, within 180 days
of enactment of this act, on what would be needed to establish a
NIST Center of Excellence and Full-Scale Testing Center for Build-
ing Technologies. The proposed center should support community
hardening in extreme wind, surge, and wave events, and shall be
established at an institution with a multi-hazard research focus to
further accelerate research, adoption of new technologies, and es-
tablishment of national standards and measurements to reduce
losses and disruptions due to environmental-driven and natural
hazards.

34
Composites.—The Committee encourages NIST to work with aca-
demic institutions, in collaboration with State and industry part-
ners, to develop new composite technologies to solve problems in
the manufacturing space and related materials industries. Further,
the Committee urges NIST to work with relevant Federal agencies,
to aggregate existing standards and test methods for the use of
composites and other innovative materials in infrastructure, as
well as to identify barriers to broader market adoption.
Pyrrhotite Testing and Mitigation.—The Committee provides an
amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for NIST to con-
tinue studying and developing a reliable and cost-effective standard
for testing for the presence of excessive amounts of the mineral
pyrrhotite in concrete used in residential foundations and munic-
ipal structures, which can cause premature cracking and structural
failure. In addition to funding widespread sample collection and
studies needed to develop standardized tests, the Committee di-
rects NIST to investigate mitigation strategies for concrete struc-
tures that may not yet have developed cracking but contain
pyrrhotite.
Critical and Emerging Technologies.—The Committee recognizes
NIST’s important role in U.S. engagement on standards develop-
ment across areas of critical and emerging technologies. As our
global competitors increase focus on international standards devel-
opment, it is important for NIST, in partnership with the private
sector, to maintain global leadership. Therefore, the Committee
provides an amount equal to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for
these purposes.
Public Health Risk to First Responders.—The Committee looks
forward to receiving the report on firefighter occupational exposure
to environmental sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(commonly known as ‘‘PFAS’’) as directed in the joint explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 118–42.
UAS Training for First Responders.—The Committee encourages
NIST, in collaboration with the FAA’s Alliance for System Safety
of UAS through Research Excellence [ASSUREd] Safe program and
Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aerial Systems, to help build
a federated ecosystem to teach, train, educate, certify and creden-
tial first responders to employ UAS skills to crises and emergency
management events. The Committee further directs that a focus be
on first responders in underserved communities.
Regenerative Medicine Standards.—The Committee is encouraged
by the work of NIST and the Standards Coordinating Body to de-
velop comprehensive standards for the development and evaluation
of regenerative medicine products to fulfill the regenerative medi-
cine standards provisions enacted under the 21st Century Cures
Act (Public Law 114–255). The Committee recognizes the need to
continue ongoing efforts to develop and maintain standards. The
Committee also understands that additional efforts are needed to
ensure proper use of these standards by educating product devel-
opers and disseminating these standards nationally. The Com-
mittee provides $500,000 to support the development of curricula
in partnership with academic institutions and other stakeholders
such as through establishment of consortia for workforce training
around the use of regenerative medicine standards.

35
RNA Research Standards.—The Committee recognizes the recent
release of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine [NASEM] report ‘‘Charting a Future for Sequencing RNA
and Its Modifications’’ in March 2024. The Committee notes several
types of standards are needed to support research and technology
development for the RNA modifications field, and that the report
indicates NIST is well-suited to take the lead given its mission to
‘‘promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by ad-
vancing measurements in science, standards, and technology to-
ward economic security and improved quality of life.’’ To unlock the
full potential of RNA modifications and address pressing societal
challenges in health, agriculture, and beyond, the Committee en-
courages NIST, in coordination with the National Institutes of
Health, to implement recommendations from the NASEM report
and develop and promote standards to support the field of
epitranscriptomics, and that modified RNA reference materials
should be developed with a focus on making them widely available
and affordable. The Committee requests an update on the develop-
ment and promotion of epitranscriptomics standards in the fiscal
year 2027 congressional budget justification.

Program.
Next Generation Extreme Ultraviolet [EUV] Lithography.—The
Committee recognizes the importance of advancing the develop-
ment of EUV lithography in the United States for national and eco-
nomic security applications, specifically commercializing particle
accelerator driven Free Electron Lasers. Within NIST programs re-
lated to semiconductor research and development, the Committee
directs NIST to explore private sector partnerships aimed at com-
mercializing particle accelerator-driven EUV lithography.
NIST Carbon Dioxide Removal and Utilization Research.—The
committee recommends $7,000,000 for carbon dioxide removal and
utilization research, including $5,000,000 for developing standard
reference materials and standard test procedures for direct air cap-
ture and $2,000,000 for supporting carbonate materials develop-
ment, testing, and certification for construction markets.

[MEP].—The Committee recognizes the importance of the Hollings
Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program [MEP] and con-
tinues to strongly support the program at the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. MEP promotes the critical national needs of small- and
medium-sized enterprises, including by increasing the number of
enterprises that the program assists and by increasing awareness
and usage of existing supplier scouting tools to fill supply chain
gaps and support domestic manufacturing. The Committee directs
the Secretary to continue funding current recipients at no less than
the current amounts for fiscal year 2026. Further, no funds are
provided to execute or plan for a program that reduces the number
of active MEP Centers. The Committee notes that any revamp, in-
cluding the one outlined in the June 2025 renewal documents,
should not proceed without consultation and approval from the
Committee. The Committee encourages NIST to ensure that at
least 85 percent of the funds provided for MEP be allocated directly
to Centers through base awards, competitive or expansion award
pilot programs.

strongly supports activities under Navigation, Observations and
Positioning, including full operational funding for NOAA’s Naviga-
tion Response Teams.
Geospatial Modeling Grants.—The Committee provides
$8,000,000 within Navigation, Observations and Positioning for the
Geospatial Modeling Grants program, for which all funding shall
be distributed externally.
NOAA Center of Excellence for Operational Ocean and Great
Lakes Mapping.—The Committee rejects the proposed termination
of the NOAA Center of Excellence for Operational Ocean and Great
Lakes Mapping and provides $10,000,000. The Center shall con-
tinue to work in unison with and leverage existing capabilities, in-
cluding the Joint Hydrographic Center, and across NOAA line of-
fices, including NOS, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Re-
search [OAR], and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations
[OMAO], to support and grow the Nation’s deep water, shallow
water, and coastal mapping capabilities and data holdings, in part-
nership with industry.
Hydrographic Research and Technology Development.—The Com-
mittee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for
the Joint Hydrographic Center for demonstration, testing, evalua-
tion, and research-to-operations transition of hydrographic tech-
nology. This should include demonstrating the potential of gained
efficiencies from the use of autonomous vessels for the collection of
hydrographic data.
Hydrographic Charting.—The Committee acknowledges the crit-
ical importance of accurate and timely hydrographic surveys to en-
sure safe navigation, support maritime commerce, and enhance the

40
resilience of coastal communities. The Committee strongly encour-
ages accelerated efforts to reduce the backlog, leveraging advanced
technologies and partnerships to enhance survey efficiency. These
efforts will bolster the maritime industry by improving naviga-
tional safety and reliability, while also supporting coastal commu-
nities through enhanced economic opportunities and environmental
protection.
Integrated Ocean Observing System [IOOS].—The Committee
notes the importance of the IOOS network that provides marine in-
formation used in disaster response, weather forecasting and hurri-
cane prediction, water quality forecasting, detection of harmful
algal blooms [HABs], and safe maritime operations. IOOS observa-
tions can also play an important role in ocean planning efforts, in-
cluding proper siting of offshore wind projects. The Committee pro-
vides not less than $43,500,000 for IOOS, which is $1,000,000
above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Committee encour-
ages the IOOS regional associations to consider leveraging existing
capabilities of the commercial sector, including uncrewed systems,
to meet observational needs through commercial data buys.
Disaster Preparedness.—Within the funds provided for Coastal
Science, Assessment, Response and Restoration, the Committee
provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for the
Disaster Preparedness Program. NOAA is encouraged to prepare
for and respond to future disasters, including to conduct a series
of disaster workshops and tabletop exercises using region-specific
multi-stressor scenarios.
Marine Debris.—Within the funding provided, NOAA shall sup-
port competitive extramural funding programs and the programs
authorized in the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act (Public Law 116–224).
NOAA is encouraged to pilot a marine debris innovation program
focused on processing and reuse of marine and coastal plastic waste
including workforce training and industry partners.
The Committee notes that the IIJA provides $150,000,000 over
5 years for marine debris assessment, prevention, mitigation, and
removal, including $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2026.
National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science [NCCOS].—The Com-
mittee provides $55,000,000 for NCCOS and directs NCCOS to con-
tinue efforts related to offshore wind and coastal sustainability and
resilience, including urban and island flooding.
The Committee provides $1,000,000 for NCCOS’s continued col-
laboration on research priorities with NOAA’s Cooperative Institute
for Research to Operations in Hydrology [CIROH].
Harmful Algal Blooms.—Within funding for Competitive Re-
search, the Committee provides up to $14,000,000 to accelerate de-
ployment of effective methods of intervention and mitigation to re-
duce the frequency, severity, and impact of HAB events in marine
and freshwater systems. Of this amount, up to $2,000,000 shall be
used to explore innovative methods to increase monitoring and de-
tection of HABs in freshwater systems by partnering with academic
institutions with expertise in uncrewed systems.
Given the high economic cost related to HAB events relative to
the current research investment in the Gulf of America, the Com-
mittee encourages NOAA to fund long-term HAB research in the

41
Gulf of America and supports the continuance of the annual Gulf
of America Hypoxia Mapping Cruise.
Digital Coast.—The Committee provides $3,500,000 for the im-
plementation of the Digital Coast Act (Public Law 116–223).
BLUE GLOBE Act.—The Committee encourages NOAA to imple-
ment the Bolstering Long-term Understanding and Exploration of
the Great Lakes, Oceans, Bays, and Estuaries [BLUE GLOBE] Act
(title CI of Division J of Public Law 117–263).
Regional Ocean Partnerships [ROPs].—Within funding provided
for Coastal Zone Management and Services, the Committee pro-
vides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for the ROPs,
or their equivalent, to enhance their capacity for sharing and inte-
gration of Federal and non-Federal data to support regional coast-
al, ocean, and Great Lakes management priorities.
Coastal Management Grants.—The Committee provides no less
than $81,500,000 for Coastal Zone Management Grants. To the ex-
tent practicable, NOAA is encouraged to work with States to en-
sure that the program supports Tribal projects and objectives.
National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund [NOCSF].—The
Committee provides $32,000,000 for the NOCSF. In selecting the
areas of focus for the NOCSF, NOAA and the National Fish and
Wildlife Foundation should consider proposals that enhance ocean
and coastal management, bolster coastal infrastructure and resil-
ience, support regional collaborative efforts and partnerships, and
help coastal communities adapt to changing ocean conditions.
In addition, the IIJA provides $492,000,000 over 5 years for the
NOCSF, including $98,400,000 in fiscal year 2026.
Coral Reef Program.—Coral reefs provide substantial economic
benefits by supporting fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection,
buffering communities against devastating coastal storms and hur-
ricanes. Environmentally, they sustain unparalleled biodiversity,
serving as vital habitats for countless marine species. The alarming
decline of coral populations in the United States demands imme-
diate and robust action to reverse this trend and safeguard these
invaluable ecosystems for future generations. Therefore, the Com-
mittee provides no less than $33,500,000 to conduct reef restoration
activities under the Coral Reef Conservation Act, as amended (title
C of division J of Public Law 117–263).
National Estuarine Research Reserve System [NERRS].—The
Committee recognizes that the NERRS sites provide mixed-use
areas that are protected for long-term research, monitoring, edu-
cation, and coastal stewardship and provides $34,000,000 for the
program, an increase of $700,000 above the fiscal year 2024 en-
acted level to accommodate the expansion of the system.
Sanctuaries and Marine Protected Areas.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of Sanctuaries and Marine Protected Areas to
preserve regions for conservation, recreational, ecological, histor-
ical, scientific, cultural, archeological, and educational purposes
and supports the expansion of the network. This includes the con-
servation and long-term preservation of U.S. Civil War heritage
such as the U.S.S. Monitor. The Committee provides $67,000,000
for Sanctuaries and Marine Protected Areas.
Marine National Monuments.—Within funding provided for Sanc-
tuaries and Marine Protected Areas, up to $1,200,000 may be used

42
to support the sanctuary designation process for the
Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument to supplement
and complement existing monument protections, as well as for com-
petitive education grants, and research and management for the
proper care and management of the objects and locations of historic
or scientific interest in existing marine national monuments ad-
ministered by NOS, provided such grants are subject to a 100 per-
cent non-Federal match.
NOAA NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,129,250,000 for
the National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS]. NMFS programs
provide for the management and conservation of the Nation’s living
marine resources and their environment, including fish stocks, ma-
rine mammals, and endangered species.
The administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget request proposes
consolidating the Ecological Services program of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service [FWS] and NMFS’s Office of Protected Resources
[OPR], both of which administer the Endangered Species Act [ESA]
(Public Law 93–205) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act
[MMPA] (Public Law 92–522). This consolidation merges the two
programs into a single entity under the Department of the Interior
[DOI]. However, due to the extremely late submission of the NOAA
congressional budget justification, the Committee lacks the nec-
essary information to evaluate the validity of the proposed consoli-
dation and therefore continues to fund the OPR within NMFS.

Saltonstall-Kennedy [S–K] Grant Program.—The Committee pro-
vides $10,000,000 for the S–K Grant program. Prior to obligating
any funds for the S–K Grant Program, NOAA shall provide the
Committee with a detailed spending plan describing which fish-
eries activities will be funded in each region and how the plan in-
corporates regional priorities. In doing so, NOAA shall consult with
the regional committees authorized under the American Fisheries
Advisory Committee Act (Public Law 117–121) to identify funding
priorities. The spending plan should also include an accounting of
the administration of the regional committees. Within the funds
provided, the Committee encourages NOAA to prioritize support for
applications that improve marketing and development of the sea-
food industry, as was the original intent of the S–K Grant Pro-
gram.
Seafood Trade.—The Committee remains troubled by the lack of
a level playing field for the U.S. seafood industry. The Committee
is concerned that recent surges in crawfish and shrimp imports
have saturated the U.S. market, significantly impacting domestic
producers. Additionally, the Committee is alarmed by ongoing
issues with these imports, including links to illegal, unreported,
and unregulated [IUU] fisheries; forced labor; unauthorized anti-
biotic use; and other fraudulent practices. The Committee directs
NOAA to ensure that its National Seafood Strategy and related
policies or programs prioritize support for U.S. seafood producers
and do not promote the consumption of imported seafood.
Offshore Wind.—The Committee supports the responsible devel-
opment of renewable energy projects and provides not less than the
fiscal year 2024 enacted level across NMFS to address consultation
and permitting, stock assessment, management, and protected re-
sources needs related to the expansion of offshore wind energy
projects.
NMFS Project Consultations.—Within Protected Resources
Science and Management, the Committee provides not less than
the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for NMFS to address the backlog
of consultation requests under the Endangered Species Act [ESA]
(Public Law 93–205) and authorization requests under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act [MMPA] (Public Law 92–522).
North Atlantic Right Whales [NARW].—The Committee provides
not less than $51,000,000, an increase of $4,000,000, within Marine
Mammals, Sea Turtles, and Other Species for NARW-related re-
search, monitoring, and conservation efforts. The Committee sup-
ports the use of supplementary funds previously provided to the
agency for these purposes, including innovative gear research,
acoustic monitoring, and satellite tracking. NOAA shall continue to
support disentanglement, stranding response, and necropsy activi-
ties, and is encouraged to develop alternative NARW models, such
as occupancy or threat-based models, that can be used to validate
or test the sensitivity of the Decision Support Tool. Within funding
provided, NOAA is encouraged to develop and deploy innovative
tags, which may include the use of foam metals, that are bio-
logically compatible with animal tissues and that can attach to the
animals long enough to provide crucial information on migration
and habitat use patterns.

44
Within funding provided, not less than $30,000,000 shall be pro-
vided to States through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Com-
mission to cover costs associated with testing or voluntary imple-
mentation of innovative gear to inform future Atlantic Large Whale
Take Reduction Plan rule development and electronic tracking re-
quirements within the Northeast lobster and Jonah crab fisheries.
Funding may also support broad-scale monitoring efforts to inform
understanding of NARW habitat use, dynamic management, and
the development of alternative distribution and risk models. Fund-
ing to the States shall be proportional to the number of active fed-
erally permitted lobster trap harvesters in each State, and the allo-
cation details shall be developed by the States through the Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission. Not more than 5 percent
shall be used for administrative costs.
Further, NOAA is encouraged to consider revising the Linden
and Pace models and Decision Support Tool using ‘‘most reasonably
certain to occur’’ rather than ‘‘worst case’’ scenarios and assump-
tions to more accurately predict future NARW populations before
issuing any new proposed or final regulations.
NOAA shall continue to work with Canadian officials to develop
risk reduction measures that are comparable in effectiveness for
both vessels and fisheries, and to incorporate Canadian fishery
measures, Canadian vessel restrictions, and U.S. vessel restrictions
into future assessment of overall risk reduction. To improve re-
gional engagement, NOAA is encouraged to include regional man-
agement bodies and pertinent States in bilateral engagements with
Canadian officials regarding coordinated efforts to enhance NARW
recovery.
Real-Time Whale Monitoring Technology.—The Committee be-
lieves that the recovery of endangered large whales, including the
NARW, will require the ability to deliver real-time monitoring of
individual whales to mariners and other vessel operators to avoid
ship strikes. The Committee provides up to $5,000,000 to support
a near real-time monitoring and mitigation pilot program for large
whales as authorized under section 11303 of the James M. Inhofe
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public
Law 117–263). NOAA is also encouraged to work with other Fed-
eral agencies, including the Office of Naval Research, the United
States Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Manage-
ment, as well as industry and academia, to support technology de-
velopment, test and evaluation of whale monitoring technologies
through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program.
Cetacean Desk.—The Committee provides $200,000 for a cetacean
desk within the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service, as authorized
under section 11304 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263).
Protected Species in the Western Pacific.—Within Marine Mam-
mals, Sea Turtles, and Other Species, the Committee provides not
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for Hawaiian monk
seals, Hawaiian sea turtles, and false killer whales. This includes
the amounts made available to support State activities related to
these protected species and for research to mitigate interactions be-
tween fisheries and false killer whales.

45
Prescott Grants.—Within Marine Mammals, Sea Turtles, and
Other Species, the Committee provides $4,500,000 for the John H.
Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance grant program.
Sea Turtle Stranding Response and Rehabilitation.—Within Ma-
rine Mammals, Sea Turtles, and Other Species, the Committee pro-
vides $500,000 above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for NOAA
to provide direct support to institutions and organizations per-
mitted to provide sea turtle stranding response and/or rehabilita-
tion. In doing so, NOAA shall also seek to leverage and strengthen
partnerships with capable university veterinary schools.
Sea Turtle Conservation.—The Committee reminds NOAA of the
provisions in section 609 of Public Law 101–162 that prohibit the
importation of shrimp from nations that have not been certified by
the United States as having sea turtle conservation measures in
place that are comparable in effect to that which the United States
requires of domestic shrimp fishermen. The Committee is con-
cerned that this requirement is not being effectively enforced, plac-
ing global sea turtle populations at significant risk. Within Marine
Mammals, Sea Turtles, and Other Species, the Committee provides
up to $600,000 to cover the costs for NMFS to fully and effectively
enforce this statutory mandate to ensure that no nation or foreign
commercial shrimp fishery that adversely affects sea turtles is cer-
tified under this authority. The Committee expects the agency to
provide a complete description of the utilization of these funds and
the status of the implementation and enforcement of this program
in its 2025 Biennial Report to Congress required under 16 U.S.C.
1826h.
Species Recovery Grants.—The Committee provides $7,250,000,
and directs NMFS to utilize both the ESA Recovery Plan and the
MMPA Take Reduction Plan priorities when evaluating marine
mammal projects.
Atlantic Salmon.—The Committee recognizes the benefits of re-
storing coevolved sea-run fish species in support of recovery of At-
lantic salmon and provides not less than $8,000,000 for Atlantic
Salmon. The Committee encourages NOAA to partner with States
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop fish passage per-
formance standards for sea-run species and prioritize project selec-
tion, funding, and staff resources considering those benefits. The
Committee further directs NOAA to ensure that adequate resources
continue to be provided for State agencies to implement the recov-
ery strategy effectively, including stable staffing levels. Increased
funding provided in fiscal year 2024 and moving forward should be
to assist States with implementation of their recovery strategy.
Pacific Salmon.—The Committee provides $75,750,000 for Pacific
Salmon. Within the funding provided for Pacific Salmon, the Com-
mittee provides $6,000,000 for NOAA to work with partners to ad-
dress the backlog and expedite approval of Hatchery and Genetic
Management Plans and to support the implementation of new
Habitat Conservation Plans and not less than the fiscal year 2024
enacted level is provided for pinniped removals.
Flood Control Projects.—The Committee is concerned with the
high number of levees in need of repair along with the declining
status of Pacific salmon and steelhead across the NMFS West
Coast Region, particularly in the Puget Sound and Columbia Basin

46
watersheds. Within the funding provided for Pacific Salmon,
$375,000 shall be for the NMFS West Coast Region to outline po-
tential solutions and associated costs for developing an ESA pro-
grammatic tool to address levee projects and Pacific salmon and
steelhead recovery needs located in the same river basin.
Further, the Committee directs NMFS to identify existing au-
thorities that could be utilized to develop a levee rehabilitation pro-
gram, as well as barriers to execution of such a program, and rec-
ommend additional authorities and programmatic solutions. Spe-
cifically, the report should include an analysis of the feasibility of
a programmatic ESA consultation on subsets of levee projects, con-
servation actions needed in association with U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers levee projects and an analysis of additional staffing or
training needs necessary to efficiently move projects forward. The
NMFS shall coordinate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Northwestern Division on the development of this report. The
NMFS is directed to brief the Committee within 60 days of enact-
ment of this act on the plan for executing this report.
Northeast Groundfish Research.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the decline of the Northeast multispecies fishery and
the health of fishing stocks in the Gulf of Maine. Within funding
provided for Fisheries and Ecosystem Science Programs and Serv-
ices, the Committee provides $2,500,000 for groundfish research,
with a focus on the effects of changing oceanic conditions and
warming waters on the fishery, including stock health and natural
mortality. NOAA is further encouraged to prioritize research re-
garding relative gear efficiency, stock boundaries, and other topics
that can improve groundfish stock assessments in the next 5 years.
Within the funding provided, $500,000 shall be obligated to con-
tinue ongoing work on implementing the recommendations set
forth in the New England Fishery Management Council’s Fishery
Data for Stock Assessment Working Group Report, and to continue
ongoing work on implementing the recommendations set forth in
the 2020 report of the Groundfish Trawl Task Force, consistent
with prior year direction. This funding is intended to support new
and innovative research, including by the Northeast Fisheries
Science Center, separately by, or in collaboration with, outside
partners such as higher education institutions or State agencies,
and in cooperation with the fishing industry. The Committee di-
rects NMFS to integrate the results of prior year groundfish re-
search projects into stock assessment models and fishery manage-
ment decisions, as appropriate.
Electronic Monitoring and Reporting [EM/ER].—Within funding
for Fisheries and Ecosystem Science Programs and Services, NOAA
shall continue to support the development, testing, and installation
of EM/ER technologies, including development of electronic report-
ing systems for commercial fishermen, image classification efforts
in New England, and improving the National EM image library.
Not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level shall be available,
in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 3701, for collaborative partnerships
that include non-Federal matching funds to implement cost-shared
EM/ER programs that support fisheries conservation and manage-
ment. During the development and implementation of EM/ER pro-
grams, NOAA shall consult directly with industry and work

47
through the Fishery Management Councils to develop appropriate
cost-sharing arrangements that are commensurate with the ex-ves-
sel value of the fishery.
Furthermore, NMFS shall continue to work in fiscal year 2026
with the charter for-hire recreational fishery fleet in the Gulf of
America; the Northeast multispecies groundfish fishery fleet, in-
cluding small vessels within that fleet; the Maine lobster fleet; and
any regional fishery fleet interested in implementing EM/ER tech-
nologies to better track information that is currently collected
through the use of human observers.
Gulf Reef Fish.—Within funding for Fisheries and Ecosystem
Science Programs and Services, the Committee provides not less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for NMFS to support Gulf
reef fish surveys, research, and sampling.
PFAS in Fish.—The Committee is concerned about the con-
centration of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS] detected
in fish tissue. The Committee encourages NMFS to conduct fish tis-
sue sampling and monitoring of PFAS to evaluate the impacts on
aquatic health. This study should specifically look into the sub-le-
thal effects of and the impact of constant low-level exposure to
PFAS in commonly consumed fish.
Fisheries Surveys.—The Committee is concerned that NMFS has
not prioritized and maintained the needed level of fisheries survey
coverage, despite having received more than the requested funding
in previous fiscal years. If additional funding is needed to maintain
historic survey levels, the Committee expects NOAA to include this
amount in the annual budget request. The Committee notes that
any reduction in fisheries survey coverage is fundamentally unac-
ceptable, especially in areas where the distribution of fish stocks
are changing due to climate change. The Committee provides a
total increase of not less than $10,000,000 above the fiscal year
2024 enacted level within Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys and
Assessments and directs NMFS to maintain historical levels of
fisheries survey coverage in fiscal year 2026. The Committee ex-
pects NMFS to contract no fewer than six surveys for Alaskan bot-
tom trawl surveys and cooperative research, including a survey to
capture movement of fish populations out of historic survey areas,
and no fewer than four vessels for West Coast groundfish surveys.
This amount also fully funds both Northeast Area Monitoring and
Assessment Program [NEAMAP] trawl surveys, including the
Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey, as well as the
Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program’s [SEAMAP]
existing surveys and addresses critical data gaps in the bottom
longline and fall trawl surveys in the Gulf Coast States. NOAA is
encouraged to prioritize fishery surveys and fulfill vessel-based
science work for other programs, through private vessel contracts,
public-private partnerships, and platforms other than NOAA re-
search vessels to allow ample time for fishery surveys and assess-
ments performed by the NOAA Fleet.
Fishery Survey Contingency Fund.—The Committee is increas-
ingly concerned that Federal vessel-based fisheries surveys nec-
essary for determining sustainable and optimal harvest rates for
commercial fisheries have been cancelled with increasing frequency
in recent years, without effective contingency plans for covering the

48
resulting data gaps. Furthermore, the Committee is concerned that
the planned service life extensions for each of NOAA’s fishery sur-
vey vessels will impact the agency’s ability to conduct fishery sur-
veys. Therefore, within Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys, and
Assessment the Committee provides $4,000,000 for the Fishery
Survey Contingency Fund. Funding shall be used for fishery data
acquisition from commercially available sources including char-
tering commercial fishing vessels or other private sector vessels
and for data purchases from autonomous systems to inform stock
assessments. NOAA shall identify flexible charter and data pur-
chase agreements in order to provide contingency and augmenta-
tion capacity for NOAA Fleet fishery surveys. NMFS is directed to
provide the Committee, not later than 90 days after enactment of
this act, with a plan for obtaining and incorporating data from this
fund into the stock assessment process.
Industry-Based Fishery Survey Pilot Program.—The Committee
recognizes that an industry-based multispecies bottom trawl survey
[IBS] would create resiliency in survey activities in the Northeast
region and could enhance fishermen’s trust of the data informing
stock assessments. The Committee provides $3,000,000 within
Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys, and Assessments to design
and implement a pilot industry-based fishery survey. This program
will be designed to run in conjunction with and in complement to
NOAA’s established surveys. The IBS should seek to complement
the NOAA Ship Henry B. Bigelow’s work and follow NMFS proto-
cols to the extent practicable.
Cooperative Research.—Depleted fish stocks result in significant
economic losses to our Nation. At a time when fishing opportunities
are constrained by uncertainty in stock assessments and increased
access to healthy stocks depends on better data, the Committee be-
lieves that maintenance of ongoing monitoring programs and sur-
veys is critical. The Committee recognizes the Cooperative Re-
search Program’s important partnerships between the fishing in-
dustry, academia, and State partners, which improves science and
survey enterprise and provides not less than $14,500,000. The
Committee encourages NMFS to continue to prioritize long-time se-
ries surveys that are conducted cooperatively with industry and
States. Further, the Committee directs NMFS to continue to inte-
grate the results into stock assessment models and fishery manage-
ment decisions, as appropriate.
Atlantic Bluefin Tuna.—The Committee recognizes that the suc-
cess of the newly adopted assessment and management frame-
works for Atlantic bluefin tuna is predicated on a greater scientific
understanding of this species. Therefore, the Committee provides
$1,000,000 to support research and data collection for the valida-
tion of proposed new spawning grounds, the application of a
groundbreaking genetic population assessment, and the collection
of necessary biological information from commercial and rec-
reational fishery landings.
Gulf of America Fisheries Research.—The Committee remains
concerned about the stock condition and lack of basic fishery-inde-
pendent data (i.e., biological, life history, movement, and health in-
formation) for many important fish species in the Gulf of America.
Therefore, within funds for Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys,

49
and Assessments, the Committee provides not less than $5,000,000
for NMFS, via a partnership with the Gulf States Marine Fisheries
Commission, to provide no fewer than five grants to academic part-
ners, including consortiums of universities, and other partners to
conduct fishery independent research on trans-boundary, multi-ju-
risdictional fish species in the Gulf of America for which current
data is deficient (e.g., cobia, tripletail, tarpon, red snapper, and
gray triggerfish), including species that are solely managed by the
Gulf States. This data may be used for the management of both
federally- and State-managed fisheries.
Gulf of America Shrimp Fishing Effort.—The Committee remains
concerned that shrimp fishing effort data collection and analysis in
the Gulf of America shrimp fishery will be interrupted by the ter-
mination of 3G cellular transmission service used by NMFS in its
Electronic Logbook [ELB] program. The Committee recognizes that
this scientific data is essential to the annual evaluation of the fish-
ery’s effects on sea turtle and red snapper conservation mandates.
Within the funding provided in Fisheries Data Collections, Sur-
veys, and Assessments, the Committee provides $850,000 for
NMFS, in consultation with the Gulf of America Fishery Manage-
ment Council and shrimp industry stakeholders, to continue the
development and implementation of a newly approved ELB that ar-
chives vessel position and automatically transmits scientific shrimp
fishing effort data via cellular service to NMFS. The Committee
awaits receipt of the report outlining progress made to develop and
implement the new ELB program requested in the joint explana-
tory statement accompanying Public Law 117–103.
Northwest Fisheries Ecosystem Monitoring System.—Within
funds for Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys, and Assessments,
the Committee provides $850,000 to maintain a time-series moni-
toring system of hydrographic and ecological data to inform fishery
management on the Northern California Current.
Chesapeake Bay Atlantic Menhaden Abundance.—The Chesa-
peake Bay is a critical nursery area for Atlantic menhaden and
other commercially and recreationally important species like blue
crab and striped bass. Atlantic menhaden comprise a majority of
the forage base in the Chesapeake Bay and are the primary food
source for other fish, birds, and whales in the region. The Com-
mittee provides not less than $2,500,000 within Fisheries Data Col-
lections, Surveys, and Assessments to collect Atlantic menhaden
abundance data in the Chesapeake Bay in partnership with the At-
lantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and relevant States.
American Lobster and Jonah Crab Research.—The Committee
provides not less than $300,000 within Fisheries Data Collections,
Surveys, and Assessments to support a cooperative research pro-
gram to collect biological, fishery, and environmental data for
American lobster and Jonah crab using modern technology on com-
mercial fishing vessels.
Horseshoe Crab Survey.—The Committee remains concerned
about the ability to estimate the abundance of the mid-Atlantic
horseshoe crab population. Adequate data are required to ensure
State and interstate managers can effectively manage the stock,
which is important to the biomedical and commercial fishing indus-
tries, as well as to the ecology of the mid-Atlantic region. The Com-

50
mittee directs NMFS to continue this important survey to generate
the data necessary to ensure the mid-Atlantic horseshoe crab stock
remains on a sustainable path.
Plankton Recorder Survey.—The Committee notes the continued
importance of understanding the distribution of Calanus
finmarchicus plankton to inform the conservation of the NARW.
Within the amount provided for Fisheries Data Collections, Sur-
veys, and Assessments, the Committee provides not less than
$300,000 for the continuous plankton recorder survey.
Sharks and Rays.—To better protect and rebuild vulnerable and
endangered shark and ray species, the Committee encourages
NMFS to conduct regular assessments of population status and re-
building needs, improve the documentation of relevant species as
bycatch, and ensure transparency and public access for all fisheries
catch information collected.
The Committee directs NOAA to continue to enforce the Shark
Fin Sales Elimination Act, which was enacted as section 5946 of
the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263). The Committee awaits the receipt
of the report describing resource needs to fully implement the law
requested in Senate Report 118–62 and codified in Public Law 118–
42.
Northeast Multispecies Fishery.—The Committee recognizes that
the New England groundfish fisheries management programs con-
tinue to present substantial financial challenges to the participants
as well as to the economic sustainability of those fisheries and fish-
ing communities. Therefore, the Committee provides not less than
the fiscal year 2024 enacted level within Observers and Training
for grants to the fishing industry to fully cover At-Sea Monitoring
industry costs, including all associated sector costs, in the New
England groundfish fishery. Any additional At-Sea Monitoring
costs, including shore side infrastructure, observer training, ob-
server equipment and gear, electronic monitoring, and NOAA sup-
port costs shall be included in the fiscal year 2027 budget request.
NOAA shall ensure the costs and benefits of At-Sea Monitoring are
commensurate with the gross revenues of vessels in the fishery and
is directed to submit a report to the Committee not later than 180
days after the enactment of this act outlining the progress made
to achieve this requirement. Before obligating any of these funds,
NOAA shall provide the Committee with a detailed spending plan.
North Pacific Observer Coverage.—Within Observers and Train-
ing, the Committee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 en-
acted level for the North Pacific Observers Program. Funding shall
offset observer costs normally paid for by harvesters in fisheries
that are undertaking a transition to EM/ER. Additionally, NOAA
is encouraged to identify and implement any efficiencies that would
mitigate the cost burden shouldered by small vessel operators in
the fixed-gear fleet.
Western Pacific Observer Coverage.—The Committee provides not
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for observer coverage
in the Western Pacific.
For-Hire Electronic Monitoring and Reporting Implementation.—
The Committee provides not less than $1,500,000 within Fisheries
Management Programs and Services and $1,500,000 within En-

51
forcement to support the continued, timely implementation of ELBs
for the federally-permitted charter-for-hire sector in the Gulf of
America.
Video Review of Electronic Monitoring Data.—Within funding
provided for Fisheries Management Programs and Services, the
Committee provides not less than $600,000 for the existing video
review of the West Coast groundfish EM data and $500,000 for
video review of the Gulf of Alaska EM data.
Fishery Observers.—The Committee supports the transition to
EM/ER technologies from human fishery observers for At-Sea-Mon-
itoring programs where supported by the regional fishery councils.
The Committee encourages NMFS to clarify that fishery observer
and At-Sea Monitoring programs may utilize their discretionary
funding to augment or replace human observers with cost-effective
observation tools that meet the regulatory needs of the region.
International Fisheries Management Coordination.—The Com-
mittee is aware that conflicting American and Canadian fisheries
management measures in the Gulf of Maine have generated con-
cerns from the domestic fishing and lobster industries, due to dif-
fering conservation regulations. The Committee encourages NOAA
to work with Canadian and State fisheries officials to explore the
possibility of developing an agreement that provides for cooperative
fisheries management of this unique area.
Observer Data Integration.—The Committee provides $500,000
within Fisheries Management Programs and Services to expedite
efforts to integrate At-Sea Monitoring data into stock assessment
models.
Bycatch Reduction.—The development and implementation of
practical bycatch solutions is a priority for U.S. and international
fisheries management and protected species conservation. The
Committee provides not less than $3,125,000, for competitive
grants to non-Federal researchers working with U.S. fishermen on
the development of improved fishing practices and innovative gear
technologies.
Marine Aquaculture.—The Committee recognizes the significant
potential for development of American offshore aquaculture to in-
crease U.S. production of healthful, sustainable, and affordable sea-
food, while expanding the seafood value chain to include traditional
agricultural producers as well. The Office of Aquaculture has per-
formed commendable work to coordinate efforts within NOAA and
across Federal agencies toward a comprehensive approach to aqua-
culture policy and regulation. The Committee provides $5,000,000
for the Cooperative Institute Fostering Aquaculture Research and
Marketing to support the sustainable development of aquaculture
in the United States to address the seafood import deficit and ben-
efit the economy.
NOAA is also encouraged to upgrade equipment and to increase
the amount of staff focused on aquaculture at all NMFS fisheries
science centers, including to return staffing levels to those in fiscal
year 2010 at the Northeast and Northwest Fisheries Science Cen-
ters.
Oyster Aquaculture, Research, and Restoration.—Within NMFS
Aquaculture, the Committee provides not less than the fiscal year
2024 enacted level to support ongoing research in off-bottom East-

52
ern oyster production in coastal areas, particularly in areas where
this method is being exploited for commercial production, including
the Gulf of America, and encourages NMFS to dedicate resources
to support regional partnerships for genetics, disease, and economic
modeling. Further, the Committee encourages NOAA to support
collaborative academic research addressing oyster reefs in the
Northern Gulf Coast to investigate restoration success and close
critical knowledge gaps to oyster farming, restoration, food safety,
and resilience to sustainably strengthen oyster production.
Salmon Management Activities.—Within the amount provided for
Salmon Management Activities, the Committee provides
$41,500,000 to enable NOAA, the Pacific States, and Tribal com-
munities to continue activities in support of the obligations set
forth in the renegotiated annex of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. Be-
fore any of these funds may be obligated, NOAA is directed to pro-
vide the Committee with a detailed spending plan that is reflective
of the funding recommendations produced by the U.S. section of the
Pacific Salmon Commission. In doing so, NOAA is directed to con-
sult with the Pacific States, Tribal communities, and other stake-
holders. Further, NOAA is encouraged to minimize, to the extent
practicable, the amount of funds withheld for administrative ex-
penses.
The Committee also provides $5,000,000 above the fiscal year
2024 enacted level for the operation and maintenance of Mitchell
Act hatcheries and directs NOAA to continue genetic stock identi-
fication for salmon recovery and management. NOAA is directed to
limit the amount of Mitchell Act hatcheries funding withheld for
administrative expenses to 15 percent, with a long-term goal of not
more than 10 percent.
Fishery Councils and Commissions.—The Committee provides
not less than $45,000,000 to support the Regional Fishery Manage-
ment Councils, Interstate Marine Fisheries Commissions, and
International Fisheries Commissions. The Committee recognizes
the important role that regional management plays in sustaining
a balanced ecosystem and healthy fish populations and the advan-
tage that aggregate data can provide in understanding emerging
trends across our Nation’s fisheries. The Committee directs the Re-
gional Councils and Fisheries Commissions to prioritize research
and monitoring of high priority species in the face of changing envi-
ronmental conditions.
Interjurisdictional Fisheries Grants.—The Committee continues
to support Interjurisdictional Fisheries Grants, which support mon-
itoring and assessment programs of States and Interstate Fisheries
Commissions, as well as research to gauge the health of commer-
cially and recreationally important fish stocks. The Committee pro-
vides not less than $3,377,000 for Interjurisdictional Fisheries
Grants.
Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing.—The Committee
notes NOAA’s important role outlined in the National Security
Memorandum on Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated
Fishing and Associated Labor Abuses and directs the agency to
continue to dedicate the necessary resources to combat IUU fishing.
However, the Committee remains concerned that the Seafood Im-
port Monitoring Program [SIMP], as currently structured and im-

53
plemented by NOAA, is insufficient to meaningfully prevent the
entry of IUU seafood into the U.S. market. Despite its intended
purpose, SIMP has failed to deliver adequate traceability and en-
forcement outcomes, and widespread concerns remain regarding its
limited species coverage, inadequate data verification, and lack of
end-to-end supply chain transparency.
Seafood Import Monitoring Program.—The Committee provides
$6,200,000 for the implementation and modernization of SIMP.
The Committee is particularly concerned about the continued im-
portation of seafood products from foreign producers that use anti-
biotics and other chemical compounds banned in the United States.
To address this, NOAA is directed to work closely with the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to develop and implement
testing protocols to detect prohibited substances in imported sea-
food, with a focus on high-risk countries and products. This collabo-
ration should ensure that testing and enforcement mechanisms are
integrated with SIMP data collection and traceability systems. The
Committee believes that effective chain of custody recordkeeping
and aggressive enforcement actions through SIMP is essential for
keeping IUU seafood, including Chinese and Russian banned prod-
ucts, from entering the U.S. marketplace.
The Committee is aware that commercial space-based radio fre-
quency [RF] detection technologies have been successful in tracking
maritime vessels even when vessels turn off their Automatic Iden-
tification System [AIS], which is a common practice among foreign
fleets engaged in IUU fishing. Identifying when and where IUU
fishing may be occurring is critical to NMFS Enforcement’s mission
and can help better allocate limited resources to areas of interest
where illegal fishing is taking place. Therefore, the Committee pro-
vides not less than $750,000 for NMFS to further test and
operationalize U.S. commercial space-based RF data collection ca-
pabilities to track foreign vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities
in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and other remote maritime re-
gions of economic, environmental, and national security signifi-
cance.
Pacific IUU Enforcement.—The Committee notes the threats to
national security and ecosystem integrity posed by Chinese IUU
fishing vessels in the Indo-Pacific region and encourages NMFS to
expand enforcement operations in its Pacific Island Division.
Northeast Lobster Enforcement.—Within Enforcement, the Com-
mittee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for
NMFS, in partnership with the relevant States, Joint Enforcement
Agreement partner agencies, and the Atlantic States Marine Fish-
eries Commission, to continue the pilot cooperative offshore lobster
enforcement program.
European Green Crab.—The Committee remains concerned by
the rapid and growing invasion of European green crab around the
country, including in the Pacific Northwest. The Committee pro-
vides $1,500,000 within Habitat Conservation and Restoration for
management, intervention, and mitigation of invasive European
green crab. The Committee directs NOAA to coordinate with the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and FWS to ensure a comprehensive Fed-
eral approach to addressing the threat posed by European green
crab, mitigate harm, and protect native crab and other shellfish

54
populations. Further, NOAA, in partnership with other relevant
agencies, shall jointly brief the Committee no later than 90 days
after enactment of this act on the collective efforts to address Euro-
pean green crab.
Northwest Straits Initiative.—The Committee provides
$1,000,000 to protect and restore the marine waters, habitats, and
species of the Northwest Straits region to achieve ecosystem health
and sustainable resource use.
Chesapeake Bay Office.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the work being done to restore oysters in the Chesapeake
Bay, the significance of this work for the seafood industry, and the
effects of increased seafood prices in urban communities. Therefore,
the Committee provides $1,500,000 above the fiscal year 2024 en-
acted level within Habitat Conservation and Restoration to support
oyster restoration in the Chesapeake Bay and encourages NMFS to
partner with Historically Black Colleges and Universities with a
proven track record of aquaculture research on this work.
Fishery Disasters.—The Committee believes that the current fish-
ery disaster process has significant deficiencies in terms of effi-
ciency, equity, and reliability. The Committee provides $1,000,000
within for NOAA to contract a study with the National Academy
of Public Administration [NAPA] to investigate the requirements
for establishing a fishery disaster insurance program for seafood
harvesters. The plan shall include a needs assessment with signifi-
cant stakeholder consultation, analysis of alternatives for program
design, and an analysis of legal and regulatory authorities and
gaps.
NOAA OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
The Committee’s recommendation provides $657,053,000 for the
Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. OAR programs pro-
vide environmental research and technology needed to improve
NOAA weather forecasts, climate predictions, and marine services.
To accomplish these goals, OAR supports a network of scientists in
its Federal research laboratories, universities, and joint institutes
and partnership programs.
The budget request proposes eliminating OAR, potentially termi-
nating many of its programs and transferring others to operational
NOAA line offices, such as the National Weather Service and NOS.
While the Committee could be open to realigning some programs
to enhance operational outcomes, the absence of detailed plans
hinders informed decision-making. Consequently, the Committee
maintains funding for OAR programs under their existing struc-
ture.

Climate Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes.—The Com-
mittee strongly supports Climate Laboratories and Cooperative In-
stitutes for their critical role in delivering high-quality weather in-
formation and driving economic benefits across the United States.
These laboratories and Cooperative Institutes, conduct world-class
research that enhances weather forecasting accuracy, improves se-
vere weather preparedness, and supports economic resilience for in-
dustries such as agriculture, transportation, insurance, and energy.
These institutions develop advanced weather models, collect real-
time data, and provide decision-ready information that benefit
farmers optimizing crop yields, logistics companies managing sup-
ply chains, and coastal communities preparing for storm surges as
well as mitigate risks from extreme weather events, including hur-
ricanes, tornadoes, and heatwaves.
The Committee encourages NOAA to develop a Geographic Infor-
mation System-based greenhouse gas emissions tool similar to, or
part of, the Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation Assess-
ment Tool.
Earth’s Radiation Budget.—The Committee provides not less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for OAR to continue atmos-
pheric modeling and assessments and, as practicable, to initiate ob-
servations and monitoring of stratospheric conditions and the
Earth’s radiation budget. This includes the effects of material intro-
duced into the stratosphere due to changes in natural systems, in-
creased air and space traffic, and the assessment of solar radiation
modification. The Committee directs OAR, in coordination with
NASA and the Department of Energy, as appropriate, to advance

56
understanding of the role of atmospheric aerosols in radiative forc-
ing, cloud formation, precipitation dynamics, and extreme weather
events, and to develop plans for sustained, long-term observations
of the stratosphere. NOAA is further encouraged to coordinate with
NASA for long-range, crewed and autonomous platforms for in situ
atmospheric observations.
Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments [RISA] Program.—
The Committee provides no less than fiscal year 2024 enacted level
for the RISA program that supports a network of regional science
hubs across the country that help citizens in different regions pre-
pare for and deal with the impacts from droughts, floods, wildfires,
and other severe weather events. The Committee notes that it is
important for the RISA teams to have a connection to the region
they serve and, to the extent practicable, encourages NOAA to en-
sure that RISA teams are managed, staffed, and based at an insti-
tution located in the region served. NOAA shall reestablish pro-
grams in the Northwest and South Atlantic to ensure maximum
coverage around the Nation.
National Integrated Heat Health Information System
[NIHHIS].—The Committee supports NIHHIS to help improve un-
derstanding of heat risks and encourages OAR, through NIHHIS,
to support focused heat research to translate existing climate serv-
ices and NOAA products necessary to build capacity to mitigate
heat-related hazards, manage risks, advance heat equity, develop
metrics, and promote governance structures, processes, and strate-
gies to advance heat resilience across all U.S. geographies. This
may include scaling-up the heat research capacity of academic in-
stitutions with established leadership in heat research, particularly
those with the demonstrated ability to translate research to deci-
sion-making to advance heat resilience quickly.
Precipitation Prediction Grand Challenge.—In order to better un-
derstand and predict rainfall events, the Committee provides not
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for the Precipitation
Prediction Grand Challenge.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Detection Technologies.—The Com-
mittee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for
a pilot program of instrumentation for observing greenhouse gases,
including methane, and other atmospheric factors deployed on com-
mercial aircraft and to support the evaluation of a sustained ob-
serving network using such platforms. In carrying out this pro-
gram, NOAA is encouraged to coordinate with relevant Federal
agencies and industry stakeholders, and leverage existing Federal
resources including the NWS’s Aircraft-Based Observation Pro-
gram, to the maximum extent practicable.
Tornado Research.—Within the funding provided for Weather
Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes, the Committee provides
not less than $11,000,000 and up to $13,000,000, for the VORTEX–
USA program. The Committee notes the lack of progress on im-
proving tornado forecasts and warnings and directs NOAA to pur-
sue and extend new partnerships, including with the commercial
sector, to test novel and innovative data sources, including commer-
cial radar capabilities, to improve coverage and forecasting skill.
Further, NOAA is encouraged to accelerate coupling of the weather
forecast model with radar observations to add the ability to classify

57
hail size, detect tornado debris, and better determine the type and
intensity of precipitation.
The Committee encourages NOAA to pursue research on near
real-time infrasonic monitoring of hurricanes and tornadoes. Ad-
vanced infrasound signal processing methodologies and studies, de-
ployed through a network of infrasound arrays to detect tornadoes,
have the potential to provide accurate and reliable locations and
warnings of active tornadoes.
Data Assimilation.—The Committee believes that the primary
factor in the United States trailing the European weather models
is the lack of an updated and comprehensive data assimilation ef-
fort. The Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration [JEDI] is
the next generation, unified data assimilation framework under col-
laborative development between NOAA and cross-agency partners
through the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation [JCSDA].
JEDI will allow for a faster development and research-to-operations
of advanced data assimilation and related components to meet the
requirements of NOAA’s Unified Forecast System [UFS]. NOAA,
including through the Environmental Modeling Center, shall de-
velop and transition JEDI into an operational system no later than
18 months of enactment of this act to support real-time cycling in
test mode in parallel with the production global model.
The Committee provides $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2024
enacted level within Weather Laboratories and Cooperative Insti-
tutes to support JEDI development at JCSDA. The Committee di-
rects NOAA to include sufficient funding in their fiscal year 2027
budget request to advance JEDI and maintain access to the intel-
lectual capacity necessary to ensure that NOAA maximizes the
science and predictions derived from its Earth observing systems.
Subseasonal to Seasonal Weather Prediction.—Within funding for
the U.S. Weather Research Program, the Committee provides not
less than $1,000,000 to continue the subseasonal to seasonal re-
search program to seed innovative research testbeds. Such efforts
shall include a pilot project for subseasonal to seasonal precipita-
tion forecasts for water management in the western United States
recommended in NOAA’s report to Congress pursuant to section
201 of the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of
2017 (Public Law 115–25). The pilot project should be carried out
in coordination with the National Weather Service and should be
focused on achieving measurable objectives for operational forecast
improvement, including forecasts of seasonal mountain snowpack
accumulation and total seasonal precipitation.
Fire Weather.—As the Nation combats yet another dangerous
and extreme wildfire season, the Committee notes with urgency the
importance of improving fire weather modeling, prediction, detec-
tion, and decision support tools. The Committee provides not less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level within the U.S. Weather Re-
search Program to continue the collaborative and integrated fire
weather research program, including the Fire Weather Testbed.
Advanced Quantitative Precipitation Information System.—The
Committee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level
within the U.S. Weather Research Program for a regional radar
array demonstration project to enable better forecasting of extreme
West Coast precipitation events, like atmospheric rivers.

58
Meteorological Satellite Studies.—The Committee recognizes the
important research conducted by the Cooperative Institute for Me-
teorological Satellite Studies.
Tropospheric Ozone.—The Committee encourages NOAA, in co-
ordination with NASA, EPA, and other relevant Federal agencies,
to study the formation of tropospheric ozone with to goal of identi-
fying potential mitigation pathways. NOAA is also encouraged to
further understanding of atmospheric oxidation processes that im-
pact the atmospheric lifetime of methane and other air pollutants
to further refine model fidelity and forecast ability.
Light Detection and Ranging [LiDAR] Technology.—The Com-
mittee provides up to $2,000,000 within the U.S. Weather Research
Program to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize advanced,
compact LiDAR systems uniquely tailored to near-surface marine
and atmospheric profiling from UAS and mobile ground-based plat-
forms. This new technology could increase NOAA’s ability to flexi-
bly collect real-time data that fills temporal and spatial gaps left
by existing platforms.
Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Laboratories and Cooperative
Institutes.—The Committee provides not less than $39,500,000, for
laboratories and cooperative institutes. The Committee expects
NOAA to request funding these cooperative institutes at appro-
priate levels in future years, including well-established institutes
focused on: watershed impacts on marine ecosystems; remote sens-
ing; fisheries management; long-term monitoring of oil spill im-
pacts on marine and freshwater ecosystem health; coastal resil-
ience; air and marine autonomy; ocean exploration; tropical storms;
hypoxia and HABs.
Environmental DNA [eDNA].—eDNA is a rapidly emerging tech-
nology that is powerful and cost-effective biological monitoring tool
that has been used to monitor fisheries, invasive species, response
to restoration and biodiversity in many marine areas. Current spe-
cies and habitat assessments conducted with conventional moni-
toring provide a strong basis for understanding coastal structure
and function, but they are often time-consuming, expensive, and
subject to technical and resource limitations. Advances in eDNA
methods and rapid reductions in analytical costs present an oppor-
tunity to harness this new technology and fundamentally improve
our capacity to monitor marine biology to inform and evaluate
management actions. The Committee directs NOAA to work with
university partners to expand the eDNA program including design-
ing and implementing an eDNA-based monitoring program. Meth-
ods used should be standardized, transferable, and repeatable to
provide interoperable, consistent time series data, and to promote
a unified approach to sample and metadata collection and proc-
essing.
Further, the Committee supports the use of genomics research to
uncover novel adaptations in marine life to extreme and dynamic
environments; to develop sustainable strategies in fishing, aqua-
culture, and mining practices; and to provide foundational discov-
eries for biopharmaceuticals.
Ocean Exploration.—The Committee provides not less than
$46,000,000 for Ocean Exploration and directs OAR to continue ef-
forts to map and characterize America’s Exclusive Economic Zone

59
and extended Outer Continental Shelf, including by maximizing
the amount of funding provided for the Ocean Exploration CI.
NOAA is also encouraged to work with the Department of Edu-
cation and other relevant agencies to continue fundamental ocean
exploration in which open source data are collected for the oceano-
graphic community and private industries in real-time through
telepresence technology.
National Sea Grant College Program.—The Committee provides
not less than $80,000,000 for the Sea Grant program, which plays
a vital role to enhance the practical use and conservation of coast-
al, marine, and Great Lakes resources to create a sustainable econ-
omy and environment, while simultaneously providing invaluable
educational opportunities to students.
Coastal Resilience.—NOAA is encouraged to support Sea Grant
coastal resilience activities across all State programs, including re-
cruitment of resilience-focused staff and enhancing research, en-
gagement, decision support, and project implementation. NOAA is
encouraged to prioritize work to enhance the coastal resilience of
remote communities most at-risk for natural disasters and chronic
events, with a priority given to challenges faced by Tribal, indige-
nous, and economically disadvantaged communities.
Young Fishermen’s Development Act.—Within funding for the Sea
Grant program, the Committee provides not less than the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level for training, education, outreach, and tech-
nical assistance for young fishermen as authorized under the
Young Fishermen’s Development Act (Public Law 116–289).
American Lobster Research.—Within funding for the Sea Grant
program, the Committee provides $2,000,000 for partnerships
among State agencies, academia, and industry to address American
lobster research priorities in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and
southern New England. Research and extension activities should
focus on stock, fishery, and socioeconomic resilience in the face of
environmental and management changes, with the purpose of in-
forming stock assessment and future management actions.
Contaminants of Emerging Concern.—The Committee is alarmed
by reports of contaminants of emerging concern that may cause ec-
ological or human health impacts, including PFAS, in coastal and
estuarine waters. The Committee notes that more research is need-
ed to better understand the prevalence, transportation, accumula-
tion, effects, and fate of contaminants of emerging concern within
coastal waters. Therefore, the Committee provides $1,000,000 with-
in the Sea Grant program to partner with State agencies and aca-
demic institutions to research and monitor these emerging contami-
nants.
Sea Grant Aquaculture Research.—The Committee provides not
less than $14,000,000 for aquaculture research. Within the funding
provided, NOAA is encouraged to explore new research topics, in-
cluding engineering of ocean-based infrastructure, and accumula-
tion and metabolization rates of brevetoxins in commonly farmed
shellfish. The Committee further encourages Sea Grant Aqua-
culture to partner with Historically Black Colleges and Universities
that conduct aquaculture research.
Sustained Ocean Observations and Monitoring.—The Committee
provides not less than $52,500,000, and encourages the Global

60
Ocean Monitoring and Observing program to procure subsurface
ocean profile data to improve hurricane intensity prediction, by
working with industry to take advantage of the new profiling floats
sustainable powered by thermal energy conversion.
National Oceanographic Partnership Program [NOPP].—The
Committee provides $2,500,000 for NOPP to continue to facilitate
interagency and public-private partnerships to advance ocean
science research, development, and education. Within the funds
provided, NOAA shall allocate not less than $500,000 to work with
other appropriate Federal agency and industry partners to develop,
test, and evaluate ocean-based carbon dioxide removal technologies.
NOAA NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,253,661,000 for
the National Weather Service [NWS]. NWS programs provide time-
ly and accurate meteorologic, hydrologic, and oceanographic warn-
ings and forecasts to protect life and property and improve the eco-
nomic productivity of the Nation. NWS is also responsible for
issuing operational climate forecasts for the United States. The
Committee has made saving lives and livelihoods through accurate
weather forecasting a priority.

GRAND TOTAL, NWS ............................................................................................................................ 1,253,661
NWS Staffing.—The Committee is deeply concerned about staff-
ing shortages at NWS Weather Forecast Offices [WFO], which jeop-
ardize the ability to maintain 24/7 operational coverage critical for
timely and accurate weather forecasting, warnings, and emergency
response. Insufficient staffing levels risk compromising public safe-
ty and the NWS’s mission to protect lives and property. The Com-
mittee provides an additional $10,000,000 for Analyze, Forecast
and Support and urges the NWS to prioritize recruitment, reten-
tion, and training initiatives to ensure all WFOs are fully staffed.
The Committee directs the NWS to provide a report not later than
90 days after enactment of this act, detailing current staffing lev-
els, vacancy rates, and a comprehensive plan to achieve full staff-
ing, including timelines and resource requirements.
Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System [AWIPS] in the
Cloud.—The Committee supports efforts to modernize AWIPS by
transitioning its infrastructure to a cloud-based environment. This
transition is expected to enhance system scalability, improve oper-
ational efficiency, and ensure robust data access for weather fore-
casting and warning services critical to protecting lives and prop-

61
erty. The Committee encourages NOAA to prioritize the develop-
ment and implementation of a secure, cost-effective, and resilient
cloud architecture for AWIPS. NOAA is directed to provide a report
to the Committee not later than 180 days after enactment of this
act, detailing the progress of the cloud transition, including
timelines, cost estimates, and strategies to mitigate risks associ-
ated with the migration.
Observations.—The Committee provides not less than the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level for the Aircraft Based Observation Pro-
gram and directs NWS to coordinate with and leverage existing ca-
pabilities of the National Mesonet Program to increase the use and
deployment of commercial aviation-based atmospheric data, with
an emphasis on water vapor data for numerical weather prediction
improvement.
National Mesonet Program.—The Committee recommends not
less than $27,000,000 to enable the program to leverage large in-
vestments by other sponsors, to increase the number of observa-
tions, include new types of data, and introduce innovative capabili-
ties to address capacity and geographic coverage gaps. Emphasis
should be placed on the boundary layer of the atmosphere, marine
zones, and select surface-based gap filling networks. Of the funds
provided, up to $1,500,000 may be used for costs associated with
the National Mesonet Program Office
Automated Surface Observing System [ASOS].—The Committee
supports NWS’s ongoing efforts to prolong the service life of ASOS.
NWS is directed to ensure that rural and remote communities who
disproportionately rely on ASOS operability for continued reliable
air service are provided with additional resources, such as trained
human observers, to continue observing capabilities in the event of
an ASOS outage.
Testbed and Training for Next Generation Weather Forecasting.—
The Committee encourages NOAA to partner with a consortium to
establish a testbed for applied research and a training program for
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to provide a
pipeline of talent for the agency. The testbed should utilize cutting-
edge meteorological technology and provide real-time, actionable
data for assimilation into NWS operational numerical weather
models and for applied research at OAR laboratories. In particular,
the research should help improve existing weather models defi-
ciencies in accounting for key physical and microphysical processes.
Space Weather.—The Committee provides not less than the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level to support the space weather prediction
testbed to help drive research to operations to ensure national and
global communities are prepared for space-weather events in fur-
therance of NOAA’s responsibilities under the Promoting Research
and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of
Tomorrow [PROSWIFT] Act (Public Law 116–181).
National Data Buoy Center [NDBC].—The Committee strongly
supports NDBC, which manages multiple platforms supporting
Agency missions. These include the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean
[TAO] array, monitoring ocean temperature changes linked to El
Nin˜o and La Nin˜a; and the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting
of Tsunamis [DART] program for early tsunami detection. NDBC
also operates IOOS, voluntary ship observations, and buoy net-

62
works. To maintain NOAA weather buoys and coastal marine sta-
tions, which enhance environmental model accuracy and protect
lives at sea, the Committee provides an additional $5,000,000 with-
in Observations for NDBC.
Tsunami Warning Program.—The Committee directs NOAA to
ensure continuity of operations between the Tsunami Warning
Centers and provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level for the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program to sup-
port education, awareness, and inundation and evacuation map de-
velopment.
Further, the Committee directs NOAA to assess how well NOAA
Weather Radio coverage extends to populated areas at risk of
tsunamis and, in collaboration with the Federal Communications
Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to
determine how to use the Integrated Public Alert and Warning
System [IPAWS] to deliver tsunami alerts.
Radar Program Office.—The Committee directs NWS to establish
a Radar Program Office to study and develop a plan for the im-
pending recapitalization of the Nation’s weather radar system. The
plan shall include an analysis of technologies, as well as alter-
native architectures, including purchasing radar data as a commer-
cial service.
Office of Water Prediction [OWP].—The Committee provides not
less than fiscal year 2024 enacted level for OWP, which receives
funding across multiple NWS budget lines. The Committee main-
tains the direction carried in previous fiscal years for NWS to con-
tinue to expedite hiring within the National Water Center [NWC]
Water Prediction Operations Division. NWS is encouraged to ini-
tiate Flood Inundation Mapping operations through the NWC.
Hydrology and Water Resource Programs.—The Committee pro-
vides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for NOAA to
support the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hy-
drology [CIROH], including for the Water in the West Initiative.
NOAA is encouraged to leverage the CI expertise to help NOAA as-
sess the most operationally-relevant research. CIROH delivers ex-
pertise and resources in: hydroinformatics and water resources
modeling; geographic information systems and remote sensing, in-
cluding snow depth and soil moisture; coastal inundation modeling
and forecasting; data assimilation; computational science and high-
performance computing; artificial intelligence/machine learning.
Additionally, the CI shall continue to prioritize the cultivation of
the next generation of water resources scientists and engineers who
will be essential to tackle 21st Century water resources grand chal-
lenges.
Operationalizing Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations
[FIRO].—FIRO projects have proven beneficial for improving water
availability, flood risk management, and improved drought resil-
ience. NOAA is encouraged, through CIROH, to establish a FIRO
research-to-operations program involving academic partners, the
NWS Office of Water Prediction, and NWS River Forecast Centers
in support of the Nationwide FIRO Pathfinder project.

NOAA NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA AND
INFORMATION SERVICE
The Committee’s recommendation provides $400,500,000 for Na-
tional Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service
[NESDIS] operations. NESDIS programs operate environmental
polar-orbiting, geostationary, and space weather satellites and col-
lect and archive global environmental data and information for dis-
tribution to users in commerce, industry, agriculture, science, and
engineering, the general public, and Federal, State, and local agen-
cies.
The Committee’s recommendations are displayed in the following
table:
NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICE OPERATIONS, RESEARCH,
AND FACILITIES

U.S. Group on Earth Observations.......................................................................................................... 500
Total, Environmental Satellite Observing Systems........................................................................ 330,500
National Centers for Environmental Information............................................................................................. 70,000
GRAND TOTAL, NESDIS ................................................................................................................... 400,500
Satellite Operations Transfers.—The Committee transfers
$30,465,000 to the Office of Satellite and Product Operations and
National Centers for Environmental Information [NCEI] to move
activities funded within Space Weather Follow On and Geo-
stationary Systems [GOES]-R from Procurement, Acquisition and
Construction to ORF to account for the operational nature of these
satellites.
Commercial Data Buys.—The Committee is concerned that
NESDIS has not fully embraced commercial data purchases in a
manner, scope and scale that will enable sufficient private sector
investment that will ultimately drive innovation and lower cost.
The Committee encourages NOAA to transition more of its pilot
programs into operational data buys and refrain from building sys-
tems that compete directly with industry. NOAA shall report to the
Committee, not later than 90 days of enactment of this act, how
it is complying with section 302 of the Weather Research and Fore-
casting Innovation Act (Public Law 115–25).
Maximizing Data for Assimilation.—Given that only two to three
percent of current satellite data is assimilated into weather models
and given that new observing systems will drastically increase the
amount of observations from space, NOAA is strongly encouraged
to consider a requirement for processing data on orbit in all future
satellite contracts. Not later than 180 days after enactment of this
act, NOAA shall provide a report to the committee assessing U.S.
commercial technologies that can be used to support real-time data
ingest and processing, while also reducing the physical infrastruc-

64
ture and energy costs associated with ingesting and processing
data. NOAA is also encouraged to support a pilot program to test
and evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. commercial database tech-
nologies to address data ingest and processing bottlenecks to ex-
tract the maximum value from its instruments.
National Centers for Environmental Information [NCEI].—The
Committee provides $70,000,000 for NCEI, including not less than
$10,000,000 for Regional Climate Services, and $5,500,000 for
Coastal Data Development. NOAA shall consider the Coastal Data
Development program as the central repository to manage data col-
lections from NOAA uncrewed systems to achieve the Commercial
Engagement Through Ocean Technology [CENOTE] Act (Public
Law 115–394) goals by amplifying the use of data for environ-
mental and economic innovation.
Data Assembly Hub.—The Committee emphasizes the importance
of NOAA leveraging the extensive data gathered from Uncrewed
Systems [UxS] across aerial, surface, and underwater domains. To
enhance data accessibility and promote reusability, sustained sup-
port for the Data Assembly Hub [DAH] rollout is critical. This in-
frastructure maximizes the return on investment for UxS data col-
lection, directly supporting the Blue Economy and the ongoing res-
toration of the Gulf of America. The Committee strongly rec-
ommends that NOAA collaborate with academic and industry part-
ners to secure technical expertise, ensuring a more efficient and ef-
fective DAH implementation.
NEDSIS Data Products.—The Committee is concerned that
NOAA has decommissioned at least 20 datasets, products and cata-
logs during the fiscal year. Neither NOAA nor the Department pro-
vided any advance notification of this action to the Committee. The
Department’s actions raise serious concerns about the accessibility
of publicly-funded data upon which state and city governments,
small business owners, service providers, and researchers rely on
to inform their critical work. Many of these long time series prod-
ucts are relied upon by the scientific community. The Committee
adheres to the principle that publicly-funded data should remain
available to the public. Restoring the webpages and data sets to
their original forms would honor that principle. The Committee di-
rects NOAA to restart these products and not later than 90 days
after enactment of this act to report to the Committee on progress.
Regional Climate Centers.—The Committee provides no less than
$6,100,000 to Regional Climate Centers for collecting and quality-
assuring data nationwide, and disseminating information to diverse
stakeholders, including Federal, State, and local government agen-
cies, farmers, water resource managers, emergency planners, uni-
versities, researchers, businesses, and the public. The funding will
support the development of innovative tools tailored to address re-
gion-specific challenges, such as heat, humidity, precipitation,
drought, floods, wildfires, and other extreme events in rural and
urban environments.
State Climate Offices [SCO].—The Committee recognizes the im-
portant role SCOs play under NOAA’s Regional Climate Services
and other NOAA programs and supports ongoing efforts within
NESDIS to pilot providing SCOs Federal support so that the SCOs
can meet the growing demand by Federal, State, and Tribal users

65
of the SCOs services to track and better understand weather
events.
NOAA MISSION SUPPORT
The Committee’s recommendation provides $373,622,000 for
NOAA’s mission support activities. These programs provide for
overall NOAA management, including staffing of the Under Sec-
retary’s office and services to NOAA field offices, as well as NOAA’s
Education Office.

Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment.—The Committee com-
mends the agency for its efforts to provide employees a workplace
free from sexual assault and sexual harassment, including issuance
of NOAA Administrative Order [NAO] 202–1106 and creation of
the Workplace Violence Prevention and Response Program. The
Committee directs NOAA to continue implementing NAO 202–1106
and expanding services and provides not less than the fiscal year
2024 enacted level for these purposes.
Office of Space Commerce [OSC].—In compliance with Space Pol-
icy Directive 3, the Committee continues to support efforts to tran-
sition non-defense space traffic management and space situational
awareness responsibilities from the Department of Defense to OSC.
The responsibilities of space traffic management and space situa-
tional awareness are inherently governmental. The Committee re-
jects the proposed termination of Traffic Coordination System for
Space [TraCSS] and provides $60,000,000 for OSC to continue ex-
panding the operational capabilities of TraCSS. NOAA is encour-
aged to use and integrate commercially-available capabilities to
support open standards-based, interoperable, data-agnostic com-
puting infrastructure with necessary data, modeling, information,
analytics, services, and user interfaces.
Bay Watershed Education and Training [BWET].—The Com-
mittee recognizes the mental health and educational benefits of

66
field-based offerings for children and young adults, and encourages
NOAA to continue these unique educational opportunities, includ-
ing for underserved communities. In addition, the Committee en-
courages NOAA to expand BWET regional programs to new pri-
ority regions, which may include the Delaware Bay.
National Ocean Sciences Bowl [NOSB].—The Committee is sup-
portive of the NOSB, which has been highly successful in educating
and inspiring the next generation of ocean leaders over the past 25
years. The Committee provides up to $750,000 for the NOSB, and
NOAA is encouraged to include sufficient support as part of the fis-
cal year 2027 budget request.
NOAA OFFICE OF MARINE AND AVIATION OPERATIONS
The Committee’s recommendation provides $363,356,000 for
NOAA’s marine and aviation operations. The OMAO provides air-
craft and marine data acquisition, repair, and maintenance of the

Monitoring of Atmospheric Rivers.—Improving understanding of
atmospheric rivers is critical to prepare for concentrated rain
storms and flooding along the U.S. west coast. Therefore, the Com-
mittee provides $2,500,000 within Aviation Operations and Aircraft
Services to better observe and predict these extreme weather
events.
Autonomous and Uncrewed Technology Operations [AUTO].—The
Committee provides $21,495,000 for AUTO. Not less than
$11,000,000 shall be used for agency-wide data acquisition from
commercially-available, mission-as-a-service uncrewed maritime
systems [UMS] in support of relevant operational missions includ-
ing: (1) hurricane intensity forecasting; (2) ocean monitoring, in-
cluding in-situ observations in support of the NDBC and manage-
ment and enforcement of marine national monuments in the Pa-
cific; (3) acoustic fishery surveys; (4) ocean exploration; and (5) hy-
drographic surveys. Within the funds provided, not less than the
fiscal year 2024 enacted level shall be used to support extramural
partnerships with universities and oceanographic institutions for
UMS research, development, testing, and training, including re-
search to improve precise marine navigation and coastal resilience
through improvements to uncrewed platforms.

not less than $3,000,000 within NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps
to support OMAO’s aviation accession training program, as author-

67
ized in section 105 of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps
Amendments Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–259). The Committee en-
courages NOAA to designate one or more Cooperative Aviation
Centers to facilitate the development and recruitment of aviators
for the Commissioned Officer Corps at higher education institu-
tions that have accredited professional flight and piloting pro-
grams.
NOAA SPECIAL PROJECTS
The Committee’s recommendation provides funding for the
projects listed in the table titled ‘‘Congressionally Directed Spend-
ing’’ at the end of this report in the corresponding amounts, con-
sistent with NOAA’s existing authorities, jurisdictions, and proce-
dures, as appropriate. NOAA shall perform the same level of over-
sight and due diligence regarding these projects as with any other
external partners.

High Performance Computing.—The Committee recognizes
NOAA’s high performance computing needs and its current limita-
tions on providing high-fidelity results in near real-time and pro-
vides $50,000,000. Within funding provided for Research Super-
computing/CCRI, $15,000,000 shall be used to continue the devel-
opment of a dedicated high performance computing facility in col-
laboration with partners that have existing high performance com-
puting expertise and scientific synergies. Further, not less than
$5,000,000 is to develop artificial intelligence systems and optimize
software to support preprocessing of dense observation datasets to
facilitate extraction of the most useful information for inclusion in
data assimilation for model initialization.
NOAA Satellite Reporting.—The Committee directs NOAA to pro-
vide quarterly programmatic and procurement status reports of all
satellites actively orbiting, in standby mode, and under develop-
ment, unless any reprogramming, system failure, construction
delay, or other extraordinary circumstance warrants an immediate
update.
Satellite Procurement.—The Committee appreciates the success
of the partnership between NOAA and NASA on procurement of
Earth observing satellites. Since the Committee codified the
lifecycle cost of the geostationary and polar weather satellites in
2012, the satellites have largely launched on schedule and at cost.
The Committee directs NOAA to continue to use NASA as the pro-
curement agent for acquisition of the current and next generation
Earth observing satellites. NASA can leverage their acquisition and
bona fide need authorities-including bulk purchase of instrument
and incremental funding of contracts-on behalf of NOAA for the
weather and space weather program. To simplify procurements,
NOAA is encouraged to co-locate acquisition staff with NASA at
Goddard Space Flight Center. Further, NOAA should retain gov-
ernment-owned capacity for satellite command and control and
data transmission and processing.

Geostationary Extended Observations [GeoXO].—The Committee
directs NOAA to procure a revised mission architecture that re-
tains continuity of data in geostationary orbit, while modernizing
core weather-monitoring capabilities and maintaining first launch
in 2032. Given rapidly changing weather patterns including severe
weather, the Committee believes the revised mission architecture
must include imaging and sounding as the core instruments for all
satellites with data quality standards that meet or exceed GOES–
R requirements and to consider additional instruments if they can
be accommodated under a lower life cycle cost cap. Before NOAA
terminates any current program elements, the agency must submit
a revised mission architecture, including component costs and
planned launch schedule to the Committee.
Systems/Services Architecture and Engineering.—The Committee
strongly supports the continuation of the commercial data purchase
and commercial weather data pilot programs. The Committee en-
courages NOAA to test hyperspectral sounder data and new capa-
bilities including edge processing on orbit to optimize the use of ex-
isting data to extract more value and retain more information after
downlink.
Within funding provided, NOAA is directed to continue the pilot
program to procure space weather observations consistent with the
PROSWIFT Act (Public Law 116–181) and provides up to
$5,000,000 for these purposes.
NOAA Construction.—NOAA Construction finances construction,
repair, and deferred maintenance for the agency’s highest priority
Federal facilities. The Committee recommendation provides
$64,000,000 for NOAA Construction. The Committee notes with
concern the condition of NOAA’s aging physical research infrastruc-
ture, including several NMFS regional facilities that perform crit-
ical, world-class research and surveys in support of the agency’s
multiple missions. The Committee is particularly concerned that
several key NMFS regional laboratories across the country will
soon be unable to perform basic functions given the significant age
of infrastructure, state of disrepair, and changing physical environ-
ment in which they are located. Therefore, the Committee urges
NOAA to accelerate existing regional facility modernization plan-
ning and analysis efforts. Where appropriate, such efforts should
prioritize the benefits of co-location with existing Federal academic,
university, and nonprofit partners as a means of leveraging exist-
ing relationships and research efforts in an effort to maintain, if
not elevate, the facilities’ capabilities and enhance scientific excel-
lence.
Thirty days before obligating any funds, NOAA shall submit a re-
port detailing how the funds will be expended and an explanation
of why these projects were prioritized. NOAA is also directed to im-
mediately inform the Committee if there are any significant sched-
ule delays or project cost increases.
As part of the fiscal year 2027 budget request, NOAA shall estab-
lish a 5-year budget framework to address regional facility mod-
ernization planning and redevelopment, including in the North-
west. The budget shall be updated annually as additional informa-
tion and funding needs are refined as projects mature from plan-
ning estimates through design phases.

enactment of this act, NOAA shall report to the Committee on the
status of the lease extension and/or re-compete process, including
timing and estimated leasehold improvement costs. Further, not
later than 30 days after enactment of this act, NOAA shall report
to the Committee regarding any leases for NOAA facilities termi-
nated during fiscal year 2025.
Judgment Fund Repayment.—The Committee does not provide
funding for NOAA to make payments to the Department of the
Treasury’s Judgment Fund.
Vessel Recapitalization and Construction.—The Committee pro-
vides $75,000,000 in Vessel Recapitalization and Construction. The
Committee provides funding for the completion of two Class A ves-
sels and the acquisition of two Class B vessels to facilitate the re-
duction of gaps in mission coverage as current ships are decommis-
sioned. The Committee notes that Class C vessels are critical for
conducting fishery surveys, which underpins the sustainable har-
vest of biomass in all U.S. fisheries. Therefore, NOAA is directed
to begin the process of acquiring Class C vessels that are designed
to meet basic fishery survey requirements.
Aircraft Recapitalization and Construction.—The Committee pro-
vides $7,000,000 for Aircraft Recapitalization and Construction,
which includes funds to continue procurement of a second high-alti-
tude jet as authorized under section 413 of the Weather Research
and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017.
Mission Requirement Costs.—NOAA is directed to document
within all of its future budget requests any unfunded mission re-
quirement costs, and particularly those that are necessary to main-
tain the optimal operational tempo of NOAA assets and posture of
NOAA facilities.
PACIFIC COASTAL SALMON RECOVERY FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $65,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 65,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $65,000,000 for the
Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund [PCSRF]. The recommenda-
tion is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Funds are to be
used for conservation and restoration of Pacific salmon populations.
State and local recipients of this funding will provide matching con-
tributions of at least 33 percent of Federal funds. In addition, funds
will be available to Tribes without a matching requirement. Fur-
ther, in order to foster greater equity in the implementation of

71
these funds, NOAA is encouraged to increase the 3 percent restric-
tion on administrative expenses for Tribal consortia implementing
grants from PCSRF to no less than 30 percent. The Committee re-
minds NOAA that Tribal consortia in remote and rural areas often
face the same limitations and challenges as individual Tribes who
are exempted from the 3 percent restriction on administrative
spending, and restriction therefore disproportionately burdens Trib-
al consortia in rural areas.
The Committee notes that the IIJA provides $172,000,000 over
5 years for the PCSRF, including $34,400,000 in fiscal year 2026.
NOAA is directed to report on how its current priorities meet the
intent of the PCSRF to support the recovery and protection of all
declining salmon stocks.
FISHERIES DISASTER ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $300,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 300,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $300,000 for Fish-
eries Disaster Assistance. The recommendation is equal to the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level.
FISHERMEN’S CONTINGENCY FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $349,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 349,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $349,000 for the
Fishermen’s Contingency Fund. The recommendation is equal to
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
FISHERIES FINANCE PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. ¥$12,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. ¥12,000,000
The Committee recommends that direct loans administered
through this account for individual fishing quotas may not exceed
$24,000,000. Traditional direct loans may not exceed $150,000,000,
which is the same as the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee encourages NOAA to facilitate new vessel con-
struction, vessel replacement, and upgrades within the Fisheries
Finance Program using fuel-efficient technology to the greatest ex-
tent practicable.
RECREATIONAL QUOTA ENTITY FUND
The recommendation continues the halibut recreational quota en-
tity as authorized under section 106 of the Driftnet Modernization
and Bycatch Reduction Act (title I of division S of Public Law 117–
328).

DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $94,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 94,500,000

72
The Committee’s recommendation provides $94,500,000 for De-
partmental Management [DM], Salaries and Expenses. The rec-
ommendation is equal to the 2025 enacted level.
Within Departmental Management, the Salaries and Expenses
account provides funding for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and
support staff. Responsibilities involve policy development and im-
plementation affecting U.S. and international activities, as well as
establishing internal goals for operations of the Department.
The Committee is concerned that the Department’s failure to
submit timely fiscal year 2025 spending plans, the partial trans-
mission of the congressional budget justification, and delays in re-
sponsiveness to the Committee have hindered progress on this rec-
ommendation. Therefore, the Committee limits the Department’s
transfer authority. The Committee further directs the Department
to reengage in regular communication with the Committee.
Staffing Levels.—The Committee believes that staffing issues re-
quire the continued attention of the leadership of the Department
and collaboration with the bureaus. Therefore, the Chief Financial
Officer and the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department
shall continue to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on
all DOC human capital issues.
Spending Plans.—Under section 528 of this act, the Department
is required to submit a spending plan within 45 days of the enact-
ment of this act. That plan should describe the PPAs of the Depart-
ment so that the Committee receives detailed descriptions of how
the Department intends to operationalize the funding provided in
annual appropriations bills. The Committee expects to receive a de-
tailed accounting of each bureau’s spending, including mandatory,
reimbursable, fee-funded, or working capital fund spending, par-
ticularly with regard to specific PPAs described in the bill and ac-
companying report. The Department shall continue to work with
the Committee to ensure that its spending plans provide adequate
information for continued oversight of the Department.
Salary Lapse.—The Committee directs DOC to provide a detailed
accounting, as part of the fiscal year 2026 spending plans, identi-
fying the amount of expected salary lapse in fiscal year 2026 and
an explanation of how all accrued salary lapse will be spent for all
DOC bureaus and NOAA line offices that have a greater than 10
percent vacancy rate, as of September 30, 2025. Any of the identi-
fied amounts that cannot be justified as either augmenting staffing
vacancies or supporting mission critical functions will be considered
for rescission in fiscal year 2026.
Working Capital Funds.—For each of the three working capital
funds within DOC, the following is to be provided to the Committee
and the OIG by November 30 of each year: (1) a comparison of the
final budget or spending plan at the project or activity level to the
actual year-end data as of September 30 of the prior fiscal year, in-
cluding detailed narratives for variances greater than 5 percent at
the project or activity level; (2) the initial budget or spending plan
by project or activity for the current fiscal year; and (3) a detailed
schedule of fiscal year-end unobligated and carryover balances by
source funding category and by expiring budget fiscal year, to in-
clude: direct authority, Federal and intragovernmental reimburs-
able authority by trading partner, non-Federal reimbursable au-

73
thority, amounts held for future asset replacement, and other cat-
egories.
Department of Commerce Working Capital Fund.—As part of the
fiscal year 2027 budget request, the Department is directed to pro-
vide justification that clearly articulates why each Advancements
and Reimbursements account and Working Capital Fund project
administered by the Office of Acquisition Management, Office of
Budget, Office of the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Sec-
retary for Administration, and Chief of Staff should continue to be
funded through the Working Capital Fund.
North American Industry Classification System [NAICS].—The
Committee directs DOC, within 180 days of enactment of this act,
to provide a report describing the Department’s efforts to imple-
ment the directives of section 9002 of Public Law 115–334, includ-
ing its contributions to the Interagency Technical Working Group
[ITWG] review of NAICS and the North American Product Classi-
fication System [NAPCS] codes for renewable chemicals and bio-
manufacturers. The Committee also directs the DOC to provide
quarterly updates to the Committee on the Department’s work to
implement the farm bill direction and the ITWG’s recommenda-
tions through the 2027 NAICS and NAPCS revision process.
High Value Assets [HVA].—The Committee remains concerned
that the Department has not fully implemented multifactor au-
thentication [MFA] for its HVAs in accordance with zero trust ar-
chitecture principles. The Department’s Chief Information Officer
is directed by the Committee to ensure all Department Bureaus
have implemented MFA using all three Office of Management and
Budget requirements: phishing-resistant MFA, application-layer
MFA, and modern password policies.
Business Applications Solutions [BAS].—The Committee remains
disappointed in the Department’s rollout of BAS, notably the tran-
sition of NOAA’s financial operations. The Committee understands
that NOAA continues to experience issues around that ability to
pay invoices and reimburse employees for travel expenses, in part
because of problems with data conversion. In addition, the cost of
the contract for BAS has increased and the Department is evalu-
ating another significant cost increase to the BAS contract. This is
not acceptable and the Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committee, 45 days after enactment of this
act, detailing how it has corrected all BAS issues with NOAA,
minimized cost increases to the contract, and has a solid schedule
for the transition of Census and NIST.
Employee Access to High-quality Affordable Child Care.—The
Committee directs the Department to issue a report, within 180
days of the date of enactment of this act, and include in annual
budget justifications thereafter, regarding its efforts to help provide
access to high-quality affordable child care for the children Federal
employees at each bureau. The reports shall detail all current pro-
grams or efforts that assist department or agency employees with
child care, identify programs including for recruitment and reten-
tion-that assist with child care, provide the number of employees
utilizing such programs, and detail associated costs. Additionally,
the Department shall survey employees on the level of interest in
such programs or efforts if they are not currently provided by a de-

74
partment or agency. Where possible, the Department shall identify
whether the lack of access to child care hinders recruitment or re-
tention efforts, provide the geographical locations where such hin-
drance occurs, and identify targeted solutions for such hindrances.
Workforce Development for the Semiconductor Industry.—The
Committee applauds DOC’s ongoing efforts to expand and improve
workforce development for the semiconductor industry, particularly
as NIST continues to implement the CHIPS and Science Act of
2022 (Public Law 117–167). The Committee encourages DOC to
continue to explore partnership opportunities with higher edu-
cation institutions, including community colleges and regional pub-
lic colleges, with an emphasis on advanced precision manufacturing
education, and a commitment to improving the K–12, under-
graduate, graduate and non-college bound pipeline of workers.
RENOVATION AND MODERNIZATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,142,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,142,000
The Committee recommendation provides $1,142,000. This rec-
ommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level, for con-
tinuing renovation activities at the Herbert C. Hoover Building.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $48,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 48,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $48,000,000 for the
OIG. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
In addition to funds provided under this heading, the Committee
recommends a transfer of $2,450,000 from USPTO to the OIG to
support activities associated with carrying out investigations and
audits related to the USPTO. The Committee directs the OIG to
continue to perform strict oversight activities for NOAA vessel and
satellite procurements, cybersecurity, census data collection, and
the Business Applications Solution [BAS] modernization.

TITLE II
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
The Committee recommends a total of $36,920,094,000 for the
Department of Justice [DOJ]. The recommendation is $46,849,000
below the fiscal year 2025 funding level. The Committee’s rec-
ommendation emphasizes key funding priorities in support of the
Department’s critical missions and activities to protect the safety,
security, and rights of our citizens.
Responding to Opioids, Methamphetamine, Synthetic Drugs, and
Substance Abuse in Our Communities.—The Committee continues
its commitment to helping States and local communities in the
fight against opioids, methamphetamine, synthetic drugs, and the
illegal diversion of prescription drugs through comprehensive pro-
grams covering law enforcement, prevention, and treatment. The
Committee provides a total of $574,500,000 in DOJ grant funding
to help State and local partners tackle these epidemics. In addition,
the Committee provides $2,567,000,000 for the Drug Enforcement
Administration [DEA] to sustain its efforts to disrupt and dis-
mantle drug trafficking organizations.
Strengthening Police-Community Relations.—The Committee con-
tinues to recognize and support the important need for lasting col-
laborative relationships between local police and the public. Strong
partnerships between the police and the communities they protect
ensure that citizens’ civil rights are protected, foster ongoing open
communication, improve officer safety, and reduce crime. The Com-
mittee provides $212,500,000 for State and Local Law Enforcement
Assistance and Community Oriented Policing Services [COPS] Of-
fice grant programs related to police-community relations.
Crime Victims Fund.—The Committee renews its concern about
the solvency of the Crime Victims Fund [CVF] and its ability to
continue to support compensation to and services for survivors of
crime in future years. The Committee remains concerned about in-
sufficient deposits, specifically including the lack of predictability
as to when the proceeds from criminal fines, penalties, settlements
and other sources will be deposited in the CVF. It is exceptionally
difficult for the Committee to plan without greater insight into po-
tential future proceeds for the CVF. The Committee directs the De-
partment to submit an updated plan, within 90 days of enactment
of this act, to establish a system to track payments from concluded
cases that may result in deposits into the CVF.
Trafficking in Persons.—The Department shall provide the high-
est practicable levels for the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit
[HTPU], the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], and the U.S.
Attorneys’ Offices [USAO] to investigate and prosecute crimes of
human trafficking. The Committee continues to encourage the
HTPU and Anti-Trafficking Coordination Teams to continue work-
(76)

77
ing with victim service providers and non-governmental organiza-
tions to ensure the prioritization of victim needs as part of the
overall strategy to combat human trafficking and forced labor in
the United States.
The Committee is concerned about the relatively low number of
dedicated FBI agents assigned to human trafficking cases, espe-
cially in rural communities. The Committee continues to expect the
designation of a lead agent in each FBI field office as a point of
contact for slavery and human trafficking investigations, and en-
courages the FBI to assign at least one full-time agent dedicated
to investigating human trafficking and related crimes in each
State. The Committee directs the Executive Office for United
States Attorneys [EOUSA], in consultation with the United States
Attorneys, to provide sufficient support and training and technical
assistance to each Assistant U.S. Attorney designated as the lead
human trafficking prosecutor, consistent with the Trafficking Vic-
tims Protection Act. As communication and coordination across the
Federal Government are critical to supporting survivors of traf-
ficking, the Committee encourages EOUSA, in consultation with
the Department of Homeland Security, to develop a process to en-
able survivors with T-visas to obtain an expedited letter of support
from the DOJ when their criminal cases close, and to submit a re-
port on a plan for ensuring that requests for letters can be proc-
essed in less than 3 months. This plan shall be submitted within
90 days of enactment of this act.
Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation Interagency Coordina-
tion.—The Committee recognizes the benefit of interagency coordi-
nation to combat human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and
child sexual abuse material. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to establish an interagency working group, in coordination
with relevant Federal agencies, to improve coordination and case
de-confliction as well as support to survivors. The joint explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 117–328 directed the Depart-
ment to submit a report on the status of this working group, and
the Committee directs the Department to submit an updated report
within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Domestic Trafficking Victims, Fund Special Assessments.—Sec-
tion 101 of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (Public
Law 114–22) mandated the collection of a $5,000 special assess-
ment from persons convicted of certain Federal offenses related to
human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Funds from this special
assessment are to be deposited into the Domestic Trafficking Vic-
tims’ Fund operated by the Department. The Committee encour-
ages the Attorney General to use funds provided under this bill to
ensure that Assistant U.S. Attorneys are specifically trained on the
mandatory nature and enforcement of this special assessment, in-
cluding the imposition of liens under 18 U.S.C. 3613, to provide ad-
ditional funding, resources, and services for the victims of human
trafficking and law enforcement officials involved in the elimi-
nation of this crime.
Human Trafficking Justice Coordinators.—The Committee appre-
ciates the recent appointment of a National Human Trafficking Co-
ordinator, consistent with the requirements of section 15 of the
Abolish Human Trafficking Act (Public Law 115–392). The Com-

78
mittee directs the Department to continue to comply with all re-
quirements of Public Law 115–392, including the appointment of
human trafficking justice coordinators in each USAO. The Com-
mittee further directs the Department to submit a report, within
90 days of the date of the enactment of this act, on the implemen-
tation of Public Law 115–392 and the National Strategy to Combat
Human Trafficking.
Departmental Efforts to Combat Crimes Against Children.—The
Committee directs the Department to continue submitting a statu-
tory report to Congress every 2 years, consistent with the require-
ments of 34 U.S.C. 21111(b). The Committee further directs the
Department to submit an updated report on staffing and funding
for the office of the National Coordinator for Child Exploitation
Prevention and Interdiction, including staffing, travel, and tem-
porary duty travel expenses, within 120 days of enactment of this
act.
Constitutional Policing.—The Committee directs the Department
to enforce constitutional policing statutes, including 34 U.S.C.
12601, which may require the use of consent decrees as necessary,
where constitutional policing standards are not being upheld.
Enforcement of Federal Hate Crimes Laws.—The Committee re-
mains concerned by the rise in reported incidents of bias-motivated
and hate crimes in the United States in the last several years. The
Committee appreciates the work of the Community Relations Serv-
ice [CRS], the Civil Rights Division [CRT], U.S. Attorneys’ Offices,
and the FBI to enforce the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr.
Hate Crimes Prevention Act (Public Law 111–84). The Department
shall continue to fully and expeditiously implement the COVID–19
Hate Crimes Act (Public Law 117–13), and report to the Committee
within 90 days of enactment of this act, on all actions and expendi-
tures to date to implement this legislation. In light of ongoing
trends regarding hate crimes, the Committee further directs the
Department to continue to prioritize this work and to aggressively
investigate and prosecute these crimes, which affect entire commu-
nities.
Combating Domestic Terrorism.—The Committee remains con-
cerned by the significant threat posed by violent domestic terrorists
and extremists and directs the FBI and the Department to vigor-
ously investigate and prosecute incidents of domestic terrorism.
The Committee appreciates the recognition of this threat through
the formation of the Domestic Terrorism Unit within the National
Security Division and directs the Department to maintain this unit.
The Committee directs the Domestic Terrorism Executive Com-
mittee to continue to meet on a regular basis and coordinate with
United States Attorneys and other key public safety officials across
the country to promote information sharing and ensure an effec-
tive, responsive, and organized joint effort to combat domestic ter-
rorism.
The Committee further directs the Department to review the
anti-terrorism training and resource programs that the Depart-
ment provides to Federal, State, local, and Tribal law enforcement
agencies, and ensure that such programs include training and re-
sources to assist these law enforcement agencies in understanding,
detecting, deterring, and investigating acts of domestic terrorism.

79
The Committee directs the Department to report to the Committee
within 90 days of enactment of this act, on the Department’s as-
sessment of the domestic terrorism threat, and an analysis of inci-
dents or attempted incidents of domestic terrorism that occurred in
the United States during the preceding fiscal year.
Human Rights Crimes.—The Committee remains concerned by
the large number of suspected serious human rights violators from
foreign countries who have found safe haven in the United States.
The Committee directs the Criminal Division [CRM] and USAO to
increase efforts to investigate and prosecute these crimes, including
genocide, torture, use or recruitment of child soldiers, war crimes,
and other crimes committed by human rights violators, particularly
to support the newly-established War Crimes Accountability
Team’s efforts to respond to war crimes and other atrocities com-
mitted during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the added respon-
sibilities of the CRM to prosecute war criminals under the Justice
for Victims of War Crimes Act (Public Law 117–351). For this pur-
pose, the Committee’s recommendation supports continued funding
for CRM and USAO to investigate and prosecute these cases.
The Committee is concerned by the low number of investigations
and prosecutions of human rights violators and directs the Depart-
ment to report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of
this act, on all investigations and prosecutions of human rights of-
fenses and other offenses committed by serious human rights viola-
tors within each of the last five fiscal years, including the efforts
of CRM and USAO to increase the number of prosecutions. The re-
port should also include any organizational or legal impediments to
investigating and prosecuting more human rights violators.
Violence Against Indigenous Women.—In consultation with Tribal
governments, the Department shall assess and update the best
practices for the investigation and prosecution of violence against
Native American and Alaska Native women. Additionally, DOJ
shall provide an update on the review of the sufficiency and
prioritization of its grant programs aimed at survivors of such vio-
lence, including temporary and transitional housing, education, and
workforce development assistance, and shall include the results of
this updated review, along with the plan to communicate such
grant opportunities to Tribal governments and organizations, with
the fiscal year 2026 spending plan. DOJ shall provide Congress
with a report on the usage and implementation of the Tribal set-
aside funding from Public Law 119–4 that supports programs and
initiatives in Indian Country and Alaska Native Villages. The De-
partment is directed to submit a report on the status of imple-
menting the recommendations published in the Government Ac-
countability Office [GAO] report 22–104045, entitled ‘‘Missing or
Murdered Indigenous Women: New Efforts Are Underway but Op-
portunities Exist to Improve the Federal Response’’, within 90 days
of enactment of this act
Combatting Violent Crime in Indian Country.—The Committee
encourages U.S. Attorneys to prioritize efforts to investigate and
prosecute violent crimes against Native Americans and Alaska Na-
tives that occur in Indian Country, to maintain communication
with victims and family members about the status of ongoing in-
vestigations and cases, and to provide as much information as pos-

80
sible on any declinations. The Committee is concerned about the
relatively low number of DOJ and FBI investigative resources in
Indian Country and encourages DOJ and FBI, in consultation with
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and State, local, and Tribal law en-
forcement agencies, to increase resources, including additional FBI
agents, to investigate, respond to, and prevent crimes in Indian
Country. The Committee further encourages the FBI to increase re-
cruitment, retention, and placement efforts in order to fill existing
positions in areas with large land-based Tribes or with high in-
stances of Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons cases.
Zero Trust Architecture.—The Committee continues to support
the Department’s Information Technology Strategic Plan for fiscal
years 2024–2026, particularly as it implements the Office of Man-
agement and Budget’s [OMB] M–22–09 Federal Zero Trust Strat-
egy. The Committee is aware of the ongoing cyber threats nation-
States and other actors pose to the Department and other agencies
and believes that the use of zero trust architecture, among other
protective methods, could mitigate a significant number of these
risks.
Financial Fraud.—The Committee recognizes that older Ameri-
cans are increasingly targeted by criminals seeking to swindle
them out of their hard-earned life savings through an ever-growing
array of financial schemes and scams. The Committee commends
the Department’s work to combat these crimes in recent years, in-
cluding through its dedicated Elder Justice Initiative. The Com-
mittee directs the Attorney General to continue to prioritize De-
partmental resources to ensure that reports of financial fraud, in-
cluding scams against senior citizens, are thoroughly investigated,
with the goal of bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.
McGirt v. Oklahoma.—The Committee directs the Department to
ensure that all McGirt-related needs are addressed and further di-
rects the Department to allocate no less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted levels for these purposes for each component. The Com-
mittee further directs the Department to keep the Committee ap-
prised of all resource requirements relating to McGirt, and, within
90 days of the enactment of this act, to submit a report on the
breakdown of cases per USAO attorney in Oklahoma; estimated
caseloads for the next fiscal year; and how these statistics compare
with other USAOs around the country. The report shall further de-
scribe the number and types of charged cases compared to all refer-
rals received; the jurisdictions from which cases were referred; and
the general reasons for why cases were not accepted.
Reentry Guidance for Prison Education Programs.—The Com-
mittee encourages DOJ, in collaboration with the Department of
Education, to develop and provide technical assistance and guid-
ance to the Bureau of Prisons, State departments of corrections,
and other entities that are responsible for overseeing correctional
facilities on how to support individuals who are preparing to leave
prison, reentering their communities, and either continuing their
education or seeking employment. The Committee directs the De-
partment to provide guidance on best practices in integrating re-
entry planning for participants in prison education programs. This
guidance should address evidence-based strategies to ensure suc-

81
cessful reentry, including by securing employment or continuing
their education.
Election Threats Task Force.—The Committee continues to be
concerned by the rise in threats against election workers, adminis-
trators, officials, and others associated with the electoral process.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to prioritize in-
vestigations into threats made against election workers, adminis-
trators, officials, and volunteers. The Committee also urges DOJ to
address threats of violence against election workers and to ensure
that all election workers are permitted to do their jobs free from
threats and intimidation. In order to improve outreach to election
workers and organizations representing them, the Committee di-
rects the Department to make all policies and procedures related
to submitting threat reports, and understanding what to expect
after filing a report, as well as the rights and protections offered
to election workers, administrators, officials, and volunteers under
current law, publicly available on its website.
Sextortion.—The Committee adopts the language in Senate Re-
port 118–198 under this caption and reiterates any reporting re-
quirements.
COVID–19 Fraud.—The Committee remains appalled by the in-
dividuals who, in a time of grave national crisis, enriched them-
selves through fraud against unemployment insurance and other
pandemic-related aid programs. The Committee commends the De-
partment for prioritizing the investigation and prosecution of such
crimes. Within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this act,
the Criminal Division, the Civil Division, and the Executive Office
for United States Attorneys shall individually report on their re-
spective efforts to address COVID–19 related fraud. This report
shall describe: all relevant metrics, including the number of indict-
ments and convictions, the amounts contemplated by settlements
and judgments, and the amounts of actual recoveries, by fiscal year
and by program; an estimate of the scope of criminal activity, in-
cluding an estimate of the amount of losses to the United States
Government; and a detailed description of each components’ stra-
tegic plan for addressing fraud pandemic-related aid programs,
with specific attention to unemployment insurance fraud.
Investigating and Prosecuting Cyber Crime.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the growing threat of cyber crime that crosses borders and
commends the efforts taken by the Office of International Affairs,
Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and the FBI’s
Cyber Assistant Legal Attache´ [ALATs]. The Committee is encour-
aged by the FBI’s expansion of the Cyber ALAT Program, which
works with international partners to increase investigation effi-
ciencies, enhance evidentiary exchange, and conduct joint cyber op-
erations. In light of the challenges posed by evolving technologies
and strategies, the Committee directs the Department to ensure
adequate resources are available for investigations and prosecu-
tions to keep pace with growing cyber threats in order to build
partner country capacity and successfully prosecute crimes to se-
cure justice for victims and deter future criminal behavior.
Combatting Cargo Theft.—The Committee is concerned with the
alarming rise in supply chain fraud and cargo theft throughout the
railroad, commercial motor vehicle, and intermodal transportation

82
systems. The Committee recognizes that cargo theft offenses are
often associated with organized crime syndicates, drug trafficking,
and illicit finance, and have a significant adverse impact on the
United States economy. The Committee directs the Department to
provide a briefing, within 120 days of the date of enactment of this
act, on plans to establish regional task forces, led by the FBI and
in partnership with Homeland Security Investigations, the Trans-
portation Security Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safe-
ty Administration, and Federal, State, and local enforcement agen-
cies, to investigate and refer related cases for prosecution.
The Committee further directs the Executive Office for United
States Attorneys to submit a report, within 90 days of enactment
of this act, identifying the USAOs with the highest rates of crimes
involving cargo theft, including under sections 659, 1991, and 2117
of title 18, United States Code. The Committee directs those
USAOs with the highest rates of cargo theft, or a significant rail
presence, to assign at least one additional attorney to cargo theft
prosecutions.
Illegal E–Cigarette Coordination & Enforcement.—The Com-
mittee is concerned that the wide availability of unauthorized e-
cigarettes has contributed to millions of children using addictive
vapor products, despite the statutory pre-market authorization re-
quirement. The Department has commenced the first injunctions
against manufacturers of illegal e-cigarettes; however, the Com-
mittee notes this only captures a small fraction of violative prod-
ucts and that there is no safe harbor for an unauthorized e-ciga-
rette with a pending application. The Committee supports the re-
cent multi-agency task force to combat this problem, and directs
the Department, within 90 days of the enactment of this act, to
submit a report detailing the task force’s activities. The report
shall specifically describe the task force’s enforcement activities, in-
cluding the investigation and prosecution of criminal, civil, seizure,
and forfeiture actions, including enforcement actions against unau-
thorized e-cigarette manufacturers with pending applications and
large market shares, and shall assess what additional criminal or
civil authorities may be necessary to address this public health
threat. The Department is further directed to provide a briefing to
the Committee upon submission of the report.
Federal Drug-Free School Zones.—The Committee appreciates
the Department’s clarification that section 531 of this act does not
explicitly preclude the USAOs from enforcing section 860 of title
21, United States Code. The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to continue to work to ensure that areas with young children,
including schools and playgrounds, remain drug-free.
Protecting Veterans’ Benefits.—The Committee adopts the report-
ing requirement in Senate Report 118–198 under this caption.
Voting Rights.—The Attorney General is directed to prioritize re-
sources to enforce the civil provisions of Federal laws that protect
the right to vote, including the Voting Rights Act, the Uniformed
and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, the National Voter
Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Civil Rights
Acts. The Attorney General is further directed to prioritize re-
sources to enforce provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act
[ADA] to ensure disabled Americans can fully exercise their right

83
to vote and that no eligible Americans are denied the right to vote
on the basis of ADA compliance.
Protecting Voting Access.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to include rapidly growing language minority populations
in its priority efforts to enforce the civil provisions of Federal laws
that protect the right to vote. Within 180 days of enactment of this
act, the Committee directs the Department to submit a report de-
tailing the Department’s actions to protect voting access for rapidly
growing language minority populations and any additional re-
sources necessary to accomplish this objective.
Combatting the Continued Methamphetamine Crisis.—The Com-
mittee notes that many communities and families continue to suf-
fer from a longstanding and reemerging methamphetamine crisis.
In many States, particularly in rural areas, methamphetamine-re-
lated deaths outnumber those from heroin. The Committee recog-
nizes the strain methamphetamines place on families, commu-
nities, rural health providers, and law enforcement agencies, in-
cluding the disproportionate burden to Tribal communities. The
Committee continues its commitment to combatting the meth-
amphetamine crisis, including through sustained funding for nu-
merous DOJ grant programs and the DEA.
Illegal Growing Operations.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to submit a report, within 90 days of the enactment of this
act, assessing the proliferation of illegal marijuana growing oper-
ations associated with foreign nationals. The report shall be coordi-
nated among the FBI, DEA, and the Executive Office for United
States Attorneys, and shall specifically assess: (1) the extent of ille-
gal growing operations in the United States that are associated
with foreign nationals; (2) any connections or links to Chinese
transnational criminal organizations and/or the government of the
People’s Republic of China; and (3) the Federal resources that can
be deployed to support State, local, and Tribal law enforcement ef-
forts. The report may be transmitted through classified channels as
necessary and appropriate. The Committee directs the Department,
in coordination with Federal law enforcement partners, to fully
support State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies in their
efforts on this matter.
Personnel.—The Committee is concerned by the reassignment of
personnel across the Department, including at the FBI. The Com-
mittee recognizes that shifting resources in this manner threatens
the Department’s ability to carry out its counterterrorism, counter-
intelligence, and other functions to protect the United States.
Prior Directives and Outstanding Reports.—The joint explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 118–42 adopted language in
Senate Report 118–62 captioned ‘‘Attorney Compensation Com-
parability Study’’, ‘‘Law Enforcement in the United States Ant-
arctic Program [USAP]’’, ‘‘Departmental Aircraft’’, ‘‘Protecting Chil-
dren from Online Predators’’, ‘‘Illegal Gambling’’ (as modified in the
joint explanatory statement), ‘‘National Incident-Based Reporting
System [NIBRS]’’, ‘‘Illegal Streaming Services’’, and ‘‘Wildlife Traf-
ficking’’. The Committee adopts these passages, reiterates any re-
porting requirements, and looks forward to their timely submis-
sion.

84
Departmental Staffing.—The Committee directs GAO to conduct
a comprehensive analysis of the Department’s human capital man-
agement practices, including an analysis of staffing levels over the
previous three fiscal years. The analysis should include (1) the
number of full-time employees in each office of DOJ; (2) the num-
ber of full-time employees who have voluntarily left service includ-
ing whether those employees chose to take a deferred resignation
offer or voluntary early retirement; and (3) the status or elimi-
nation of any DOJ field offices, including offices that have been
closed over the previous three fiscal years. GAO is further directed
to provide a scoping briefing to the Committee within 60 days of
the enactment of this act, and to submit a final report within 18
months of the enactment of this act.
Spending Plan.—In compliance with section 528 of this act, the
Committee directs the Department to submit a spending plan with-
in 45 days of enactment of this act. The Committee notes that the
Department has intentionally delayed or withheld prior-year
spending plans because it is continuing to consider specific, isolated
matters. The Committee directs the Department to submit a sub-
stantially complete spend plan by the statutory deadline, reserving
only those specific, isolated matters that remain under consider-
ation.
JUSTICE OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $142,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 142,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $142,000,000 for Jus-
tice Operations, Management, and Accountability [JOMA] salaries
and expenses. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
The JOMA account provides funding for senior policy officials re-
sponsible for Departmental management and policy development.
The specific offices funded by this account include the immediate
Office of the Attorney General [OAG]; the immediate Office of the
Deputy Attorney General [ODAG]; the immediate Office of the As-
sociate Attorney General; Office of Legal Policy; Office of Public Af-
fairs; Office of Legislative Affairs [OLA]; Office of Professional Re-
sponsibility; and the Justice Management Division [JMD].
Timely Responses to Committee Inquiries and Meeting Report
Deadlines.—The Committee has both budgetary and oversight re-
sponsibilities, and requests for additional information from the
Chairs, Vice Chair, Ranking Member, or their Committee staff to
any Department component should be treated as a priority for the
Department and responded to both courteously and expeditiously.
The Committee again reminds the Department that deadlines di-
rected in Committee reports or explanatory statement language are
not merely suggestions. The Department is to immediately submit
reports that remain outstanding from fiscal year 2024. Efforts
should be immediately undertaken not only to submit these de-
layed reports, but also to ensure that full and complete information
is provided.

85
JUSTICE INFORMATION SHARING TECHNOLOGY
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $38,460,240
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 50,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $50,000,000 for Jus-
tice Information Sharing Technology. The recommendation is
$11,539,760 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION REVIEW
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $844,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 804,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $804,000,000 for the
Executive Office for Immigration Review [EOIR], of which
$10,000,000 is a transfer from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-
tion Services Immigration Examinations Fee account. The rec-
ommendation is $40,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. This account funds EOIR, including the Board of Immigra-
tion Appeals [BIA], immigration judges, and administrative law
judges who decide through administrative hearings whether to
admit or exclude aliens seeking to enter the country and whether
to deport or adjust the status of aliens whose status has been chal-
lenged.
Staffing Levels for Immigration Judges and Support Teams.—
The Committee remains deeply concerned by the extraordinary
backlog of cases in our immigration courts. 3.9 million cases were
pending in fiscal year 2024-almost six times the amount of cases
that were pending in fiscal year 2015. The Committee recognizes
that addressing the backlog will require an IJ corps and associated
support teams that are sufficiently staffed, well-trained, and prop-
erly equipped-whether through information technology, efficient
case management systems, or courtroom space. The Committee has
had substantial engagement with EOIR over many years, seeking
improved clarity and accuracy in EOIR’s estimates for the IJ team
costs module, as well as hiring rates, staffing levels, and workforce
distribution.
The Committee reiterates its longstanding monthly and quar-
terly reporting requirements and directs that EOIR continue to
provide these monthly and quarterly reports at no less than the
level of detail provided in fiscal year 2024. These reports should
further include breakdowns of hiring and separation data, includ-
ing for on-boarding (e.g., advertisement posted, tentative offer,
entry on duty), and cause of separations (e.g., retirement, reduc-
tion-in-force, voluntary early retirement, termination). The Com-
mittee further directs continued submission of the monthly or quar-
terly reports on caseloads, performance measure reporting, infor-
mation technology improvements, expanded courtroom space, and
interpreter resources, and temporary assignments outside of as-
signed locations.
Operational and Adjudicatory Transparency.—To ensure trans-
parency and promote public confidence in the immigration courts,
EOIR is directed to publish all adjudicatory statistics; operational,

86
adjudicatory, and policy documents; court information; and hiring
processes on its public website, and is further directed to update
its website within 30 days in the event of any changes.
Immigration Judge Training.—The Committee directs EOIR to
review its training, to retrain all judges currently on a proba-
tionary period, and to increase the frequency and availability of
training for IJs outside the probationary period. The Committee di-
rects the Department to ensure IJ training emphasizes due process,
humanitarian protections, and cultural sensitivity and includes di-
verse training faculty, including from the private bar, the non-gov-
ernmental organization [NGO] community, and academia.
EOIR Technology Improvements.—The Committee strongly sup-
ports EOIR’s efforts to improve efficiency through information tech-
nology improvements, including implementation of its electronic
case management system [ECAS] and the digitization of older
paper records. EOIR is directed to continue to provide quarterly
updates to the Committee on its ongoing development of the ECAS.
Video Teleconferencing [VTC] Data and Reporting.—The Com-
mittee continues to direct EOIR to collect real-time data indicating
each time a master calendar or individual merits hearing is con-
ducted via VTC, to allow for better statistical data collection and
to help determine whether VTC has an outcome determinative im-
pact. This information is to be provided in the quarterly reports
submitted to the Committee and should include the number and
type of hearings conducted by VTC, including data on appeals cases
related to the use of VTC, and the number of in-person hearing mo-
tions filed. The Committee further directs EOIR to make all poli-
cies and procedures related to EOIR’s use of VTC, including EOIR’s
immigration adjudication centers and temporary facilities, as well
as a list of locations where IJs are stationed and detailed, the cor-
responding docket location, type of docket, and policies for public
and media access for locations using VTC, publicly available on its
website.
Legal Orientation Program [LOP].—The Committee has long sup-
ported the LOP, which, since its inception in 2003, has been oper-
ated by non-profit NGOs with demonstrated immigration law ex-
pertise. LOP does not provide legal representation to individuals in
immigration proceedings; instead, LOP is intended to enhance in-
formed decision-making through basic educational orientation as to
EOIR legal processes. The Committee provides no less than
$29,000,000 for LOP, including the fiscal year 2025 enacted level
for the Immigration Court Helpdesk, and adopts the Committee’s
prior-year direction regarding its operations. The Committee di-
rects EOIR to promptly and consistently facilitate LOP providers’
immigration court records requests on behalf of immigrants who
are detained and pro se nationwide pursuant to EOIR Policy Man-
ual section 1.5(c) and BIA Practice Manual section 1.5(e).
The Committee notes EOIR has provided incomplete, incon-
sistent, and even contradictory information regarding LOP oper-
ations, and has attempted to terminate the program by issuing
stop-work orders to LOP providers despite continued appropria-
tions for LOP in fiscal year 2025. As EOIR has declined to respond
to requests for information from Committee, the Committee directs
EOIR to provide an in-person briefing, within 30 days of the enact-

87
ment of this act, on its implementation of the LOP program and
to provide timely and complete responses to Committee inquiries.
Referral and Review.—EOIR is directed to provide, within 30
days of enactment of this act, a briefing on the Attorney General’s
authorities under the referral and review power. The briefing shall
assess the statutory, regulatory, and procedural framework for the
referral and review power; the history of its application including
frequency and an analysis of the referring entity; and policy consid-
erations that would merit consideration of formal guidelines or reg-
ulations.
Children’s Cases in Immigration Court.—The Committee sup-
ports efforts to improve the fairness and efficiency in immigration
adjudications involving children, given the particular vulnerability
of child respondents. The Committees notes that, to provide guid-
ance on children’s cases and juvenile dockets in immigration court,
on December 21, 2023, the EOIR Director issued Director’s Memo-
randum [DM] 24–01. This memorandum rescinded Operating Poli-
cies and Procedures Memorandum Policy Memorandum [OPPM]
17–03, entitled ‘‘Guidelines for Immigration Court Cases Involving
Juveniles, Including Unaccompanied Alien Children’’. Subse-
quently, on January 29, 2025, the EOIR Director rescinded and
cancelled DM 24–01 and reinstated OPPM 17–03. The Committee
directs EOIR, within 180 days of enactment of this act, to provide
an assessment of the policy and procedural differences between
[DM] 24–01 and [OPPM] 17–03. This assessment shall include the
agency’s view of the merits and faults of each of the differences.
Further, the assessment shall evaluate whether any elements of
[DM] 24–01 that are not currently embodied in [OPPM] 17–03
should be included in current EOIR operating policies and proce-
dures. EOIR is directed to explain why any element from [DM] 24–
01 should or should not be included in current EOIR operating poli-
cies and procedures.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $139,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 139,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $139,000,000 for the
Office of Inspector General [OIG]. The recommendation is equal to
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This account finances the activities of the OIG, including audits,
inspections, investigations, and other reviews of programs and op-
erations of the Department to promote efficiency and effectiveness,
and to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as viola-
tions of ethical standards arising from the conduct of Department
employees in their numerous and diverse activities.
Bureau of Prisons [BOP] Oversight.—Over the last three fiscal
years, the OIG has received more than 27,000 complaints, many in-
volving multiple subjects, regarding waste, fraud, or abuse at the
BOP. The Committee understands that approximately 57 percent of
all OIG investigations involve allegations of BOP misconduct. The
Committee continues to support OIG’s newly established inter-
disciplinary team, which is working to enhance its oversight of the
BOP by, among other things, increasing the number of BOP mis-

88
conduct allegations accepted for investigation; establishing a rou-
tine, unannounced inspection program of BOP facilities; maxi-
mizing information sharing and collaboration; and continuously
identifying, assessing, and tracking significant risks in BOP pro-
grams and operations to assist OIG leadership with identifying
oversight priorities and the most effective use of OIG resources.
Expansion of the OIG’s Unannounced Inspections Program.—The
Committee recognizes the OIG’s responsiveness to the Committee’s
direction to create an interdisciplinary BOP oversight team. The
OIG reports that the BOP oversight team has conducted unan-
nounced inspections of BOP facilities, and those inspections have
resulted in significant findings and recommendations related to the
proper care and custody of inmates at those facilities. The Com-
mittee believes that expanding the OIG’s unannounced inspection
program would produce similar benefits if applied to DOJ’s other
law enforcement components. The Committee directs the OIG to
provide the Committee with an assessment of the potential costs,
staffing needs, and potential oversight benefits of expanding its un-
announced inspection program to other DOJ components.
Review of the FBI Employee Disciplinary Process.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the OIG’s prior oversight work on the FBI’s dis-
ciplinary process. Most recently, the OIG conducted a review of the
FBI’s adjudication process for misconduct investigations and made
recommendations to the FBI to ensure accountability by completing
investigations and adjudications in all misconduct matters, even
where the employee separates during an investigation. The Com-
mittee directs the OIG to continue its oversight of the FBI discipli-
nary process, by assessing three additional topics to promote inter-
nal and public confidence in this process, including: (1) a follow up
on the previous OIG recommendations, including steps taken by
the FBI to ensure that all investigations and adjudications are
completed, even if the employee separates during the investigation;
(2) a comprehensive review of the FBI’s appeal process for mis-
conduct adjudications, to ensure consistency in that process, re-
gardless of the level of the employee appealing the adjudication de-
cision; and (3) the due process that is afforded to FBI and other
DOJ law enforcement personnel after a security clearance is sus-
pended. The OIG shall issue the results of these reviews, which the
Committee expects may be completed in one or more than one re-
port, including any recommendations, within 90 days of the enact-
ment of this act, as OIG determines is appropriate and practicable.
Presidential Nominating Convention [PNC] Security Grants.—
Consistent with longstanding practice, OIG is directed to conduct
audits of the fiscal year 2024 PNC program. The audits shall in-
clude an evaluation of the Office of Justice Program’s standards for
determining allowable expenses, and the sufficiency of the nexus
between allowable expenses and (1) the statutory authority for the
program, and (2) the Department’s criminal justice and law en-
forcement missions.
Immigration Court Bond Grant Rates.—The Committee notes
that detained noncitizens seeking release on bond have differing
outcomes across immigration courts, with some immigration courts
having a lower rate of granting bond than others. Moreover, the
levels at which bonds are set vary broadly. The Committee directs

89
OIG to conduct a review of the grant rates for bond in recent years;
to identify any factors that correlate with the differences in the
granting of bond motions; and, when they are granted, the dif-
ferences in the dollar amounts for which bond is set, across all im-
migration courts.
OIG Review of Implementation of the Direct Appropriation to
BOP.—The Committee directs OIG to undertake a review of BOP
implementation of section 100056 of Public Law 119–21, which pro-
vided $5,000,000,000 to the BOP for fiscal year 2025, to remain
available through fiscal year 2029. To facilitate the OIG’s review,
not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this act, the
BOP shall provide the OIG and the appropriate committees with
a spend plan, detailing the BOP’s plan to utilize the funding pro-
vided in section 100056 for salaries and benefits for BOP personnel
and maintenance and repairs to BOP facilities, broken out by fiscal
year. The OIG’s review shall: (1) specifically consider whether the
BOP’s spend plan indicates that the money provided in section
100056 will be used only for its intended purposes; (2) identify
risks in the spend plan and subsequent implementation of Section
100056, with recommendations to address such risks; (3) address
any other issues the OIG determines appropriate to consider in the
review; and (4) provide a report, or multiple reports (as the OIG
determines to be appropriate), to the Committee to enhance the
Committee’s understanding of BOP’s efforts to implement section
100056 in a sound and responsible manner.
UNITED STATES PAROLE COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,500,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $13,500,000 for the
United States Parole Commission. The recommendation is
$500,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
LEGAL ACTIVITIES
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, GENERAL LEGAL ACTIVITIES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,090,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,028,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,028,000,000 for
General Legal Activities salaries and expenses. The recommenda-
tion is $62,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This account funds the establishment of litigation policy, conduct
of litigation, and various other legal responsibilities through the
Office of the Solicitor General, the Tax Division, CRM, the Civil Di-
vision, the Environment and Natural Resources Division [ENRD],
CRT, the Office of Legal Counsel, INTERPOL Washington, the Of-
fice of Pardon Attorney, and the Office for Access to Justice.
INTERPOL Washington.—The Department’s fiscal year 2025
spending plan proposes to merge INTERPOL Washington into the
United States Marshals Service. While INTERPOL Washington

90
faces operational and administrative challenges, particularly with
respect to information technology, such a consequential reorganiza-
tion requires additional consultations between the Department and
the Committee. The Committee’s recommendation for General
Legal Activities maintains INTERPOL Washington as an inde-
pendent component funded through the General Legal Activities
appropriations account. The Committee has provided no-year au-
thority in the amount of $900,000 to ensure sufficient resources are
available for INTERPOL Washington’s increasing dues payments
and to help the Department better manage fluctuations in currency
exchange rates.
The Committee supports INTERPOL Washington’s recent efforts
to hire additional investigative analysts and law enforcement per-
sonnel in order to support the growing case workload and requests
from international partners. In addition, the Committee continues
to support INTERPOL Washington’s long overdue IT moderniza-
tion efforts. Should additional funding be needed, the Department
is encouraged to submit a reprogramming request in order to com-
plete this project. The Department is further directed to support
additional secondments of DOJ law enforcement, legal, and other
analytical personnel to INTERPOL General Secretariat.
Civil Rights.—The Committee’s recommendation supports DOJ’s
efforts to enforce civil rights laws; expand its capacity to prosecute
and provide litigation support for human trafficking, hate crimes,
and unsolved civil rights era crimes; carry out its responsibilities
associated with the civil rights of institutionalized persons and the
access rights of the disabled; investigate and prosecute police mis-
conduct; and enhance the enforcement of fair housing and fair lend-
ing laws.
Civil Rights Violations in State and Local Prisons and Jails.—
The Committee continues to be concerned by reports of civil rights
violations in State and local prisons and jails and directs CRT to
increase efforts to investigate and address violations of the Civil
Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (Public Law 96–247) in
State and local prisons and jails. The Committee directs CRT to
use such sums as necessary from amounts appropriated in fiscal
year 2026 to address such issues in State and local prisons and
jails.
Animal Welfare Act Enforcement.—The Committee supports the
Memorandum of Understanding issued on March 8, 2024, between
DOJ and the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] and their
joint commitment to enforcing the Animal Welfare Act [AWA]. The
Department is directed to continue coordinating and collaborating
with USDA on AWA enforcement cases to ensure the DOJ receives
necessary information regarding AWA violators, who have multiple
citations for conduct that seriously or adversely affects the health
or well-being of an animal, in a timely manner. The Department
shall report to the Committee, within 90 days of enactment of this
act, on its AWA enforcement actions.
International Trade Crimes.—The Committee is concerned with
the rise in international trade crimes, including violations of law
undertaken in furtherance of the evasion of duties, tariffs, restric-
tions, or requirements imposed by the Uyghur Forced Labor Pre-
vention Act, the Tariff Act of 1930, the Trade Expansion Act of

91
1962, and the Trade Act of 1974. The Committee strongly supports
the Criminal Division’s efforts with respect to the detection, inves-
tigation, and prosecution of trade-related crimes, and directs the
Division to provide dedicated resources for these efforts. The focus
of these efforts should be enhancing nationwide responses to trans-
shipment and other trade-related crimes; assisting other Federal
agencies and State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies with
trade-related prosecutions; and collaborating with international
and private sector partners to detect, investigate, and prosecute
transshipment and trade-related crimes. The Committee directs the
Division to submit a report, within 60 days of the enactment of this
act, on the implementation of this directive.
THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT

The Committee’s recommendation provides $22,700,000 for legal
costs, to be derived from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust
Fund. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
This account covers the Department’s expenses associated with
litigating cases under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of
1986 (Public Law 99–660).
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, ANTITRUST DIVISION

UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,611,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,611,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $2,611,000,000 for
the Executive Office for United States Attorneys [EOUSA] and the
94 USAOs. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
As in past years, the Committee directs the United States Attor-
neys to focus their efforts on those crimes where the unique re-
sources, expertise, or jurisdiction of the Federal Government can be
most effective.
Civil Rights Prosecutions.—The Committee’s recommendation
provides the highest practicable level for continued civil rights en-
forcement that will advance both criminal and civil litigation, in-
cluding the prosecution of sex and labor trafficking.
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons [MMIP] Prosecu-
tions.—The Committee encourages DOJ to continue allocating addi-

92
tional resources to address the crisis of Missing and Murdered In-
digenous Persons, and further directs DOJ to continue to increase
resources and improve coordination to investigate, respond to, and
prevent crimes in order to promote public safety in Tribal commu-
nities. The Committee further recommends the Department ensure
sufficient resources are made available to sustain this work.
Report on Declinations.—The Committee directs EOUSA to sub-
mit a report, within 1 year of the enactment of this act, assessing
each USAO that declined to prosecute more than forty percent of
all cases or declined to prosecute more than thirty percent of all
felony cases in fiscal year 2024 or 2025. The report should assess:
(1) the total number of all cases that the office declined to pros-
ecute; (2) the total number of all felony cases that the office de-
clined to prosecute; (3) considerations in the USAO’s decision to de-
cline to prosecute; and (4) as practicable, the number of cases in-
volving plea agreements in which the defendant’s sentencing rec-
ommendation by the USAO was less than 50 percent of the min-
imum sentence for the principal offense for which the defendant
was arrested.
UNITED STATES TRUSTEE SYSTEM FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $245,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 220,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $220,000,000 for the
United States Trustee System Fund. The recommendation is
$25,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The appro-
priation is offset by $205,000,000 in fee collections.
The United States Trustee Program [USTP], authorized by 28
U.S.C. 581 et seq., is the component of the Department with re-
sponsibility for protecting the integrity of the bankruptcy system
by overseeing case administration and litigation to enforce the
bankruptcy laws.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, FOREIGN CLAIMS SETTLEMENT COMMISSION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,504,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,504,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $2,504,000 for the
Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The recommendation is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission settles claims of
American citizens arising from nationalization, expropriation, or
other takings of their properties and interests by foreign govern-
ments.
FEES AND EXPENSES OF WITNESSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $270,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 320,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $320,000,000 for fees
and expenses of witnesses. The recommendation is $50,000,000
above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This appropriation, which is considered mandatory for
scorekeeping purposes, provides for fees and expenses of witnesses
who appear on behalf of the Government in cases in which the

93
United States is a party, including fact and expert witnesses. These
funds are also used for mental competency examinations and wit-
ness and informant protection. The Committee includes bill lan-
guage prohibiting the Department from transferring funds out of
this account.
The Committee expects that no funds will be expended for expert
witness services, including the payment of fees and expenses of ex-
pert witnesses, from any other DOJ accounts but Fees and Ex-
penses of Witnesses.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $24,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 22,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $22,000,000 for CRS.
The recommendation is $2,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
Established by Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public
Law 88–352), CRS provides assistance to communities and persons
in the prevention and resolution of disagreements arising from dis-
criminatory practices. The CRS is encouraged to partner with and
support community-based organizations when possible in order to
better support community-based peacebuilding and violence pre-
vention efforts.
Hate Crimes Prevention.—Within the recommendation, the Com-
mittee provides no less than the fiscal year 2024 level to handle the
workload and responsibilities stemming from passage of the Mat-
thew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act
[HCPA] (Public Law 111–84). The HCPA expanded CRS’s mandate,
requiring that CRS help communities prevent and respond to vio-
lent hate crimes committed on the basis of gender, gender identity,
sexual orientation, religion, and disability, in addition to race,
color, and national origin. This funding will maximize the CRS cri-
sis response nationwide and enable CRS to fulfill both its original
mandate and expanded mandate under the HCPA.
ASSETS FORFEITURE FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $20,514,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 20,514,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $20,514,000 for the
Assets Forfeiture Fund [AFF]. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level
UNITED STATES MARSHALS SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,692,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,712,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,712,000,000 for
United States Marshals Service [USMS] salaries and expenses. The
recommendation is $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. The Committee directs USMS to prioritize its core missions,

94
which are supporting the Federal justice system by providing for
the security of Federal court facilities and the safety of judges and
other court personnel; apprehending criminals; exercising custody
of Federal prisoners and providing for their security and transpor-
tation to correctional facilities; executing Federal court orders; seiz-
ing assets gained by illegal means and providing for the custody,
management, and disposal of forfeited assets; assuring the safety
of endangered government witnesses and their families; and col-
lecting and disbursing funds. The USMS shall report to the Com-
mittee, within 30 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly
thereafter, on the total resources utilized for activities outside of
these core missions.
In addition to receiving direct appropriations, the Committee is
aware that USMS also receives funding from the Department’s
AFF to augment salaries and expenses that are intended to admin-
ister directly AFF-related activities like the management and sale
of forfeited assets. The Committee directs the Department to con-
tinue to provide quarterly reports on USMS’s use of AFF funding,
as directed in Senate Report 116–127 and adopted by Public Law
116–93.
Judicial Security.—Over the last four fiscal years, Congress has
made critical investments in judicial security, including the re-
placement of outdated home intrusion detections systems, estab-
lishment of an open-source intelligence office within the USMS Ju-
dicial Security Division, and additional staffing. Given the ever-
changing threat landscape, the Committee directs USMS to provide
quarterly reports on the cost of protective details, threat assess-
ments and intelligence, and other needs required to protect the
Federal judiciary. For fiscal year 2026, the funding in the rec-
ommendation above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level shall be only
for the USMS Judicial and Courthouse Security program.
In May 2022, the Marshal of the Supreme Court requested the
temporary assistance of the Department to secure the residences of
all nine United States Supreme Court Justices. The Attorney Gen-
eral complied with the request and ordered the USMS to provide
security at each residence 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
Support from the USMS to the Supreme Court Police [SCP] has
been necessary on a temporary basis, but USMS is not perma-
nently staffed for this residential security mission and continued
redirection of USMS base resources will continue to strain critical
USMS missions nationwide. USMS shall transition this residential
security mission to the SCP by the end of fiscal year 2026.
CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 12,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $12,000,000 for con-
struction in space controlled, occupied, or utilized by USMS in Fed-
eral courthouses and buildings, including but not limited to the cre-
ation, renovation, and expansion of prisoner movement areas, ele-
vators, and other law enforcement and court security support
space. The recommendation is $3,000,000 below the fiscal year
2025 enacted level.

95
FEDERAL PRISONER DETENTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,236,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,236,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $2,236,000,000 for
Federal Prisoner Detention. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $128,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 122,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $122,000,000 for the
National Security Division [NSD]. The recommendation is
$6,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The NSD coordinates the Department’s national security and
counterterrorism missions through law enforcement investigations
and prosecutions, and handles counterespionage cases. The NSD
works in coordination with the FBI, the Intelligence Community,
and USAO. Its primary function is to prevent acts of terrorism and
espionage from being perpetrated in the United States by foreign
powers.
ORGANIZED CRIME DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $547,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 537,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $537,000,000 for
Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement. The recommendation is
$10,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement account funds the
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces [OCDETF] pro-
gram. The mission of the OCDETF program is to ensure a coordi-
nated, multi-agency, intelligence-based, and prosecutor-led ap-
proach to identifying, disrupting, and dismantling those drug traf-
ficking and money-laundering organizations primarily responsible
for the Nation’s illicit drug supply and drug-related violence.
The President’s budget request for fiscal year 2026 proposes the
dissolution of the OCDETF program, and notes that the resources
previously appropriated to OCDETF are requested to be directly
appropriated to its partner DOJ components—DEA, FBI, USMS,
U.S. Attorneys, CRM, and NSD. The OCDETF appropriations ac-
count is primarily a reimbursement account and its elimination is
infeasible without further consultations between the Committee
and the Department. The Committee’s recommendation continues
to support the OCDETF program and the standalone appropria-
tions account.

96
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $10,643,713,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 10,643,713,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $10,643,713,000 for
the FBI salaries and expenses. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Criminal Justice Information Services [CJIS].—The Committee
provides no less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level for the
NICS Section. The Committee supports the full budget request for
CJIS, including the technical adjustment for implementation of
Public Law 117–159.
Swatting.—The Committee is concerned about the increase in
swatting incidents and understands that State and local law en-
forcement are the front-line responders to these dangerous inci-
dents. However, the Committee is encouraged to learn about the
FBI’s increased outreach to their State and local law enforcement
partners and the FBI’s newly-created national online database to
facilitate information sharing pertaining to swatting incidents. The
Committee directs the FBI to continue to support State and local
partners as much as possible in swatting incidents, including pro-
viding resources sufficient to support the National online database
and by preserving information, identifying common traits or pat-
terns, and assessing where the attacks appear to be related.
Human Rights Violations.—The Committee directs the FBI to in-
crease its efforts to investigate and support the Department’s
criminal prosecution of serious human rights crimes, including
genocide, torture, use or recruitment of child soldiers, war crimes,
and other crimes committed by serious human rights violators.
This is especially relevant given the War Crimes Accountability
Team’s efforts to respond to war crimes and other atrocities com-
mitted during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the added statutory
responsibilities of the Criminal Division to prosecute war criminals
under the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act of 2022. The Com-
mittee recommends funding at no less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
The Committee directs the FBI to continue this effort through
the International Human Rights Unit [IHRU], which the FBI shall
not dissolve and shall not merge with or assign duties to any other
office, and which shall continue to fully cooperate with and partici-
pate in the Human Rights Violator and War Crimes Center
[HRVWCC]. The Committee is concerned that the FBI’s proposed
realignment of personnel from the HRVWCC to another unit would
diminish the FBI’s ability to adequately pursue human rights viola-
tors and upset the delicate relationship the FBI has created be-
tween investigators and NGOs focused on identifying and assisting
victims of these atrocities.
The Committee is concerned by the attempted downsizing of the
IHRU and supports increasing the number of cases investigated
and prosecuted, growing the number of investigators and prosecu-
tors educated and trained to address the threat, and engaging more
with affected communities throughout the Nation. The Committee
also encourages the FBI to utilize its civil rights program coordina-

97
tors in the field to engage with partners in USAO, NGOs, and local
communities to create a better understanding of the threat, drive
prosecutions, and encourage reporting of international human
rights violators. The Committee further directs the IHRU to pro-
vide training to all FBI field offices on how to detect and inves-
tigate crimes committed by serious human rights violators, and to
report to the Committees on Appropriations and the Judiciary,
within 90 days of enactment of this act, on the IHRU’s efforts to
increase the number of human rights investigations and provide
training to all field offices and opportunities for community engage-
ments, including the numbers for each.
Hate Crimes Reporting.—The joint explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328 directed the FBI to submit a report
on its continued efforts to ensure that all Federal, State, and local
law enforcement agencies fully report hate crimes statistics, as re-
quired by the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–
275, as amended) and the HCPA. The Committee acknowledges re-
ceipt of the FBI’s 2023 report in response to this directive but finds
that it does not fully address key concerns, particularly with re-
spect to jurisdictions that report zero hate crimes. The Committee
therefore directs the FBI to submit a supplemental report on its
ongoing efforts to ensure comprehensive participation in hate
crimes reporting by all Federal, State, and local law enforcement
agencies. This report should include a detailed assessment of juris-
dictions that affirmatively report zero hate crimes, an evaluation of
the accuracy of such reporting, and an identification of factors that
contribute to underreporting or nonreporting. The report should
also outline current and planned efforts to increase awareness of
reporting obligations, address known gaps in participation, and
overcome challenges to the full nationwide implementation of
NIBRS. Additionally, the FBI shall detail its ongoing outreach and
training on hate crimes reporting, including the number and scope
of trainings conducted, and strategies to ensure victims feel secure
reporting hate crimes to law enforcement. The Committee con-
tinues to urge State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies to
consider the cost of participation in the FBI’s Hate Crime Statistics
Act program as an extraordinary expense under the HCPA.
National Bioforensic Analysis Center.—The Committee recognizes
the need to maintain operations at the National Bioforensic Anal-
ysis Center [NBFAC]. The Committee supports the bioforensic
analysis and investigations performed at NBFAC and appreciates
that the NBFAC currently operates under a cost-sharing memo-
randum with the DHS, for the FBI to maintain ongoing operations
at this facility. The Committee provides $21,840,000 for the FBI’s
role at the NBFAC.
Combatting Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.—The Com-
mittee has long expressed serious concern about the sufficiency of
efforts to combat modern slavery and human trafficking, particu-
larly in rural areas. The Committee directs the FBI to allocate ad-
ditional staff dedicated to human trafficking at its field offices with
the largest geographic areas of responsibility.
Transnational Repression.—Within the funds provided, the Com-
mittee directs the FBI to ensure its tip lines and electronic threat
intake portals are staffed by people with the cultural and linguistic

98
ability to communicate effectively with diaspora and exile commu-
nities and knowledge of the tactics of transnational repression. The
FBI should ensure that the tip line, to the maximum extent prac-
ticable, protects the confidentiality of the identifying information of
individuals who may report potential transnational repression.
Within the funds provided, the Committee directs the FBI to pro-
vide specialized training to FBI employees on how to identify dif-
ferent tactics of transnational repression in physical and nonphys-
ical forms, which governments are known to employ transnational
repression most frequently, which communities and locations in the
United States are most vulnerable to transnational repression,
tools of digital surveillance and other cyber tools used to carry out
transnational repression activities, applicable espionage and for-
eign agent laws, and efforts by foreign governments to exploit the
U.S. immigration system for repressive ends.
The Committee directs the FBI to submit a report within 120
days of enactment of this act regarding the FBI’s activities related
to combatting transnational repression, including (1) policy and
programmatic-related initiatives the FBI has instituted to address
transnational repression, including related costs; (2) metrics that
detail how successful the FBI has been in addressing transnational
repression; and (3) what further programs and resources the FBI
may need to successfully address transnational repression tactics
against American nationals.
Respect for Child Survivors Act.—The Committee directs the FBI
to submit a report on the status of the implementation of the Re-
spect for Child Survivors Act (Public Law 117–354), including its
plans and protocols to use and coordinate with children’s advocacy
center-based multidisciplinary teams when interviewing all wit-
nesses covered by the act. The report shall be submitted within 180
days of the enactment of this act.
Foreign Acquisition of U.S. Farmland.—The Committee is aware
of the growing acquisition of U.S. farmland by foreign nationals
from adversarial nation States. The Committee directs the FBI to
submit a report, within 180 days of the enactment of this act, as-
sessing the scope and context of such purchases, and any associ-
ated threats. The report may be transmitted through classified
channels, as necessary and appropriate.
FBI Translators.—The Committee directs the FBI to submit a re-
port, within 90 days of enactment of this act, on the barriers the
FBI faces in hiring and retaining translators who are fluent in Chi-
nese languages. The report should include how many translators
are currently on staff, how many are required to meet the needs
of the FBI, where current translators are stationed, what recruit-
ment efforts the FBI employs to hire translators, and what addi-
tional resources the FBI requires to meet the current need.
Aircraft Usage.—The Committee directs the FBI to report to this
Committee, within 30 days of enactment of this act, on the use of
government-owned aircraft by DOJ required use travelers. Such re-
port shall describe the official and non-official purposes, as rel-
evant, of each such use, the cost associated with each such use, and
the amount of reimbursement paid by the required use traveler.
Operation Not Forgotten.—The Committee directs the FBI and
DOJ to partner with the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] to address

99
unresolved crimes in Indian Country, and to report on progress in
resolving criminal cases in Indian Country to the Committee. The
Committee also remains concerned about the number of FBI per-
sonnel deployed to work on Indian Country cases, and directs DOJ
to include the number of DOJ personnel assigned to Indian Coun-
try cases, facilities, and operations in its annual report to Congress
to comply with Public Law 111–211 (25 U.S.C. 2809).
Threats to State Judges.—The FBI Office of Partner Engagement
[OPE] plays a central role in sharing information with law enforce-
ment partners, notably through its fusion center engagement pro-
gram. Most State and major urban area fusion centers were estab-
lished in the years following the September 11, 2001, attacks in an
effort to enhance communication, cooperation and information
sharing between State, local and Federal law enforcement agencies,
including the FBI. The Committee is aware of increased abuse and
threats against State judges and judicial personnel. Moreover, the
families of judges and judicial personnel face abuse and threats
with much of the vitriol coming online. The Committee believes
that the FBI can help States and localities in finding and neutral-
izing threats against State judges. Therefore, the Committee urges
the FBI to increase its work with fusion centers on collecting and
disseminating threat information against State judges and State
judicial branch personnel.
CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $30,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides for FBI construction.
The recommendation is $15,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,567,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,567,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides total resources of
$2,567,000,000 for the DEA salaries and expenses. In addition,
$669,660,000 is derived from the DEA’s Diversion Control Fee Ac-
count. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
The Committee directs DEA to prioritize its core missions, which
are to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the
United States and bring to the criminal and civil justice system of
the United States or any other competent jurisdiction those organi-
zations and principal members of organizations involved in the
growing, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances ap-
pearing in or destined for illicit traffic in the United States; and
to support non-enforcement programs aimed at reducing the avail-
ability of illicit controlled substances on the domestic and inter-
national markets. The DEA shall report to the Committee, within
30 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, on the
total resources utilized for activities outside of these core missions.

100
The Committee strongly supports DEA’s efforts to reverse the
significant decline in special agent employment levels to ensure the
DEA has the personnel necessary to combat the ongoing meth-
amphetamine and opioid crises. The Committee encourages the
DEA to assign agents to the geographic areas that are most broad-
ly impacted by methamphetamines and opioids.
Social Media Platforms.—The Committee is aware that online
drug sales pose a growing threat to Americans of all ages, but par-
ticularly teens. The Committee adopts and reiterates the directive
under this heading in Senate Report 118–62, as adopted into the
joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–42. The
Committee looks forward to the timely submission of this report.
Fentanyl Analogues.—Given the worsening opioid epidemic, the
Committee encourages DEA to continue its efforts to test and
schedule fentanyl-related substances to advance the scientific and
medical research of these dangerous substances. The DEA shall re-
port, and make available for public comment, the scientific and
medical evaluation provided by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services as part of any proposed rule in the Federal Register relat-
ing to the scheduling of a fentanyl-related substance. The DEA
shall include all pharmacological data that it considered, as well as
information related to the identification and testing of the sub-
stance that is the subject of the proposed rule. The Department
shall report to the Committee on Appropriations, within 90 days of
enactment of this act, the status of studies and scheduling rec-
ommendations for all fentanyl analogues it has identified.
Fentanyl Tracking.—The Committee directs the DEA to use the
provided funding to develop a comprehensive fentanyl tracking sys-
tem, which includes documentation of seizure location, chemical
composition, probable or known manufacturing location, and prob-
able or known point of entry into the U.S., if applicable. The DEA
shall report back to the Committee on these efforts within 90 days
of the enactment of this act.
DEA Suspicious Orders Report System [SORS].—The Committee
directs DEA to take further action to remove barriers to access for
opioid use disorder medications. DEA must clarify the difference
between suspicious orders of opioids and suspicious orders of
buprenorphine on SORS. DEA should also work with other Federal
regulators, including the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices [HHS] and FDA, to ensure these barriers are removed after
necessary clarifications are made..
Xylazine.—The FDA and DEA have issued warnings regarding
the risks of the human consumption of xylazine, a sedative used in
veterinary medicine and in farming. Media reports indicate the in-
creased use of the drug, by itself or in combination with other sub-
stances, is resulting in worsening addiction and is causing physical
wounds to those who use illicit opioids. The DEA shall report to the
Committees on Appropriations and the Judiciary, within 90 days of
enactment of this act, on the prevalence of xylazine in drug sei-
zures, information about known distribution networks for the drug,
and potential harm-reduction strategies.
Tribal Consultation.—Prior to the finalization of the Proposed
Rule for Telemedicine Prescribing of Controlled Substances When
the Practitioner and the Patient Have Not Had a Prior In-Person

101
Medical Evaluation (88 Fed. Reg. 12875), the Committee directs
DEA to engage in meaningful Tribal consultation with federally
recognized Tribes affected by the proposed rulemaking, as required
by the DOJ Tribal Consultation Policy, Executive Order 13175, Ex-
ecutive Order 13604, and a November 30, 2022, Presidential
Memorandum mandating executive agency consultation with In-
dian nations and Tribes.
Insomnia Pharmaceuticals.—The Committee supports DEA’s ef-
forts, in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration
[FDA], to ensure the availability of non-addictive treatments for in-
somnia, particularly for high-risk populations like servicemembers,
veterans, and first responders. The Committee encourages DEA to
request FDA to begin its required Eight-Factor Analysis, to run
concurrently with DEA’s own analysis. A concurrent analysis would
allow DEA, with FDA, to reach a conclusion sooner, particularly as
by law, DEA is bound by an HHS decision to deschedule. The Com-
mittee directs DEA to provide a briefing, within 60 days of the en-
actment of this act, on the status of any scientific and medical eval-
uation that may be in progress under the provisions of section 811
of title 21, United States Code.
BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,625,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,625,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $1,625,000,000 for
ATF salaries and expenses. The recommendation is equal to the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee’s recommendation sup-
ports the full operational funding for ATF’s crime gun intelligence
capabilities, including its correlation centers, and its forensic
science and scientific research laboratories.
The Department’s fiscal year 2026 budget request proposes to
eliminate ATF as a separate component, with its functions merged
into DEA. The Committee has not been apprised as to how such
a proposal can be executed under current law and believes a reor-
ganization of this magnitude requires consideration by the Commit-
tees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate. Accordingly, the Committee recommendation for ATF does not
provide funding for the merger of ATF into DEA.
The Committee directs ATF to prioritize its core missions, which
are reducing the illegal use of firearms and illegal firearms traf-
ficking; reducing the illegal use and storage of explosives, acts of
arson and bombings, acts of terrorism, and the illegal diversion of
alcohol and tobacco products; and regulating lawful commerce in
firearms and explosives. The ATF shall report to the Committee,
within 30 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter,
on the total resources utilized for activities outside of these core
missions.
Combating Gun Violence and Enforcing Existing Gun Laws.—
The Committee’s recommendation maintains ATF’s ability to en-
force existing firearms laws and perform regulatory oversight and
training, including through the National Integrated Ballistics Infor-
mation Network [NIBIN]. This funding will enable ATF to continue

102
to collect, report, and share ballistic intelligence with Federal,
State, local, and Tribal law enforcement partners to identify, tar-
get, and disrupt violent criminals, including serial shooters. Funds
will support work with State and local law enforcement agencies
and laboratories to collect ballistic hit information to provide leads
to Crime Gun Intelligence Groups for investigations and document
successful prosecutions as a result of NIBIN.
Crime Gun Intelligence Centers [CGICs].—The Committee appre-
ciates ATF’s efforts with the CGIC program, an interagency col-
laboration focused on the immediate collection, management, and
analysis of crime gun evidence in real time, in an effort to identify
shooters, disrupt criminal activity, and prevent future violence.
There are currently more than 55 CGIC sites across the country,
and the Committee encourages the ATF to work with additional
high-risk areas to identify solutions and metrics to demonstrate
meaningful reductions in illegal gun trafficking and related violent
crime.
NIBIN Expansion.—The Committee supports efforts to expand
the use of NIBIN and to ensure all law enforcement agencies have
access to NIBIN’s correlation services, including through the
NIBIN National Correlation and Training Center [NNCTC]. The
Committee appreciates the investments being made by State and
local partners to collect and share ballistics evidence across geo-
graphically separated law enforcement jurisdictions and encourages
ATF to continue to build on these investments and consider addi-
tional service models to offer departments, including Tribal law en-
forcement agencies, access to NIBIN. The Committee further di-
rects that ATF examine ways to expand access to NIBIN to State
and local agencies in the New England and southwest border re-
gions.
Training Law Enforcement Partners.—The Committee expects
ATF to continue to provide training to local and State law enforce-
ment agencies on submitting trace requests of firearms recovered
in criminal investigations to ATF. Firearm tracing provides critical
information to assist law enforcement agencies investigate and
solve firearms crimes. The Committee supports the ongoing efforts
of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to solve vio-
lent crimes and urges ATF to provide all possible training opportu-
nities in support of these efforts.
Preventing Firearm Straw Purchases.—The Committee notes that
preventing firearms purchases by prohibited persons is critical to
ATF’s efforts to prevent violent crime and protect public safety.
ATF has initiated a public awareness campaign to reduce firearm
straw purchases at the retail level, and to educate would-be straw
purchasers of the penalties of knowingly participating in an illegal
firearm purchase. The Committee expects continued funding of this
initiative, as authorized under the Bipartisan Safer Communities
Act (Public Law 117–159).
Combatting Federal Firearms Licensee [FFL] Theft.—The Com-
mittee recognizes that firearms stolen from FFLs are a continued
threat to public safety. As every retail store has unique characteris-
tics, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to help prevent thefts. The
Committee supports ATF’s collaboration with industry, through ini-
tiatives such as Operation Secure Store, to engage with FFLs

103
through retailer store security seminars and store security audits
to help them make well-informed security-related decisions. As a
result of these initiatives, dozens of firearms stores have improved
security and countless thefts have been prevented. Within the
funds provided, the Committee encourages the continued collabo-
rative efforts between ATF and the firearm industry to enhance
public safety.
National Services Center.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the ATF’s National Services Center [NSC], which houses
several mission-critical functions, including the National Tracing
Center [NTC], the Firearms and Ammunition Technology Division
[FATD], and the National Firearms Act [NFA] Division, among oth-
ers. The Committee directs the ATF to submit a report to this
Committee, within 120 days of enactment of this act, on the needs,
including occupational hazards and risks as well as impact on
ATF’s mission, associated with the current Martinsburg facilities,
and the cost and feasibility of constructing a new physical struc-
ture or expanding existing spaces versus continuing repairs over a
10-year period.
FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,392,588,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,392,588,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $8,392,588,000 for
BOP salaries and expenses. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee reminds the Depart-
ment and BOP that all reports, including those required on a quar-
terly basis, are to be submitted in a timely manner.
The Committee directs BOP to prioritize its core missions, which
are to ensure that individuals in its custody are always accounted
for, treated humanely and with dignity, and returned to their com-
munities with the training and skills they need to be productive,
law-abiding citizens. The BOP shall report to the Committee, with-
in 30 days of enactment of this act, and quarterly thereafter, on the
total resources utilized for activities outside of these core missions.
Staffing Shortages.—The Committee continues to be displeased
with BOP’s staffing shortages, which were only exacerbated during
the COVID–19 pandemic. The Committee remains concerned about
the lack of locality pay and wage increases for Bureau employees,
which has negatively impacted the retention rate of correctional of-
ficers and other staff working at BOP institutions. Within 120 days
of enactment of this act, the BOP must provide the Committee with
a report detailing its employee retention methods and benefits pro-
vided to Bureau employees as well as the rate at which these bene-
fits have maintained parity with other Federal agencies and infla-
tion.
Hiring and Staffing Reports.—The Committee directs BOP to
submit quarterly hiring and staffing reports, including correctional
officer to inmate ratios from Pay Period 26–2016 to the present for
the OPM position classification standard Correctional Officer Series

104
GS–0007, broken out by region; institution, to include an additional
subset for each facility within an institutional complex; and secu-
rity level, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act. For
further transparency, this data is also directed to be published on
BOP’s website.
As BOP previously notified the Committee that it does not cur-
rently record staffing by shift (i.e., morning watch, day watch, and
evening watch), the Bureau shall start recording this data and in-
clude these metrics in this report by the end of the current fiscal
year. For any institution with a staffing ratio greater than 15:1 and
in which there has been an incident involving deadly force, BOP
shall provide a separate, detailed explanation of the role staffing
may or may not have played in the incident along with a corrective
plan to ensure it will not happen again.
The Committee continues to be concerned about the significant
number of vacancies in BOP institutions, creating an extremely
dangerous environment for both staff and incarcerated persons.
The Committee directs the Department to immediately improve
hiring policies and ensure BOP is able to promptly fill existing and
future vacancies and staff its 122 Federal facilities across the
United States at January 2016 levels. The Committee again directs
BOP to provide a report, within 90 days of enactment of this act,
to the Committee regarding the number of vacancies at each facil-
ity further detailed by job title, job series, and General Schedule
level as well as the number of applicants going through the hiring
process for each vacant position. If there are expedited hiring ef-
forts the Department can make to ensure BOP is properly staffed,
the Committee directs the Department to do so, and to include
these measures and their results in the aforementioned report.
The Committee notes that retention incentive pay increases are
useful tools to protect, recruit, and retain talented staff. The Com-
mittee supports the use of recruitment and retention bonuses and
rejects any further position eliminations.
First Step Act [FSA] Staffing.—The staffing for many inmate pro-
grams have either had key positions removed from current staffing
complements or have been slow to fill vacancies. The programs im-
pacted are also needed to successfully implement the First Step Act
of 2018 (Public Law 115–391) including, but not limited to, drug
treatment, psychology, religious services, vocational services, and
education services. The Committee continues to direct BOP to hire
additional programming staff to successfully provide these key pro-
grams and ensure that each facility has a Special Education Teach-
er on staff. The Committee also directs the BOP to hire a Special
Populations Manager at each of the BOP institutions to ensure
that additional FSA programming can be provided. Positions that
are vital to the FSA should be added to institution staffing require-
ments and not taken from existing staffing complements.
Staffing at High Security Institutions.—The Committee is con-
cerned about reports of significant upticks in violence among in-
mates and against correctional officers at high security institutions.
The Committee previously directed BOP to ensure at least two cor-
rectional officers are on duty for each housing unit for all three
shifts at all high-security institutions, to include United States
Penitentiaries and Administrative and Federal Detention Centers

105
as well as Witness Security Program units and units housing high
security pretrial inmates. BOP is directed to continue to submit
quarterly reports to the Committee showing compliance with this
directive and to provide a cost estimate and strategic plan for im-
plementation for medium security institutions that currently do not
have a second officer for all three shifts.
Augmentation.—BOP reports that there is a higher incidence of
serious assaults by inmates on staff at high and medium security
institutions than at the lower security facilities, yet to meet staff-
ing needs, BOP routinely uses a process called ‘‘augmentation,’’
whereby a non-custodial employee is assigned custodial responsibil-
ities. The continued use of augmentation stretches correctional fa-
cility staff too thin, leading to unsafe conditions for both staff and
inmates.
The Committee has expressed its concerns about the practice of
augmentation since fiscal year 2017 and once again directs BOP to
curtail its overreliance on augmentation, particularly in housing
units, a directive issued again as part of Senate Report 116–127
and adopted by Public Law 116–93. BOP should focus on hiring ad-
ditional full-time correctional staff before continuing to augment
existing staff. BOP is further directed to submit quarterly reports
to the Committee on the use of augmentation broken out by region,
institution, and security level each time this practice is employed.
As part of the quarterly report, BOP is required to also submit the
number of hours, and subsequent cost, of overtime recorded at each
institution. In addition, for each Federal correctional facility at
which two or more Federal inmates have died in one calendar year,
BOP shall submit to the Committee a detailed report describing
each incident and the role augmentation may have played in exac-
erbating the inherent dangers.
In addition to officer and inmate safety concerns, the Committee
also notes that augmenting staff means that critical programs and
services required for inmates under the FSA are imperiled when
those who provide counseling, education, and other programs to in-
mates are being pulled from their original duties to work in the
cellblock. BOP is directed to ensure that non-custody correctional
employees must spend at least 90 percent of their work week or
pay period in their primary positions.
Direct Hire Authority.—The Committee is aware that BOP has
requested OPM to delegate direct hiring authority to BOP facilities.
To ensure the safety of staff and inmates, the Committee once
again encourages BOP to continue to work with OPM to provide
this authority for BOP facilities and to ensure a prompt and effi-
cient hiring process if the authority is granted.
The Committee also directs the BOP to review the current pay
scale of BOP’s Correctional Officers as compared with other DOJ
law enforcement components and comparable State and local cor-
rectional agencies. This review should analyze opportunities to con-
vert the pay band to a higher scale and the resource requirements
to do so. The review should be conducted in consultation with the
Department’s JMD. The Committee directs this review to be sub-
mitted within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Overtime Pay Rate.—BOP shall ensure that every bargaining
unit Primary Law Enforcement position is being properly paid

106
overtime at the full overtime rate under the Fair Labor Standards
Act (29 U.S.C. 203). This includes, but is not limited to, the posi-
tions of all nursing staff, teachers, Special Education Teachers, Re-
ligious Services, and Psychology Services. All of these positions are
considered Primary Law Enforcement positions and work with
thousands of offenders in extremely hazardous environments. Each
of the positions listed work in a correctional environment, and any
overtime accrued would be performed in the duties providing a safe
and secure correctional environment.
FSA Implementation.—The Committee directs the Department of
Justice and BOP to fully and expeditiously implement the FSA.
The Committee is concerned that the Department has not met sev-
eral reporting deadlines and not fully implemented several provi-
sions of the act. The Committee directs the Department to expedi-
tiously expand programming and file all required reports no later
than the deadlines established by the act. The Department shall
report to the Committees on Appropriations and the Judiciary of
the House and the Senate, within 90 days of enactment of this act,
and every 90 days thereafter, on all actions and expenditures to
implement the FSA including activities and expenditures to imple-
ment, review, validate, and maintain the risk and needs assess-
ment system and to evaluate and provide evidence-based recidi-
vism reduction [EBRR] programs and productive activities [PA].
The Committee directs BOP to immediately take steps to ensure
compliance with FSA requirements, and to ensure that all those in-
carcerated in BOP facilities have access to robust programming op-
portunities, including third-party faith-based programs. The Com-
mittee further directs BOP to submit a report, within 30 days of
the enactment of this act, on such efforts. The report shall identify
which approved EBRR programs and PAs are faith-based.
The Committee reminds BOP that Congress intended for the
FSA to expand BOP partnerships with external organizations. This
specifically involves the opportunity for third-party partners to pro-
vide EBRR Programming and PAs, including faith-based programs,
taught from a specific faith tradition-within Federal prisons. Fur-
ther, the Committee reminds BOP that the FSA reflects a singular
definition for EBRRs and PAs, regardless of whether the program
is internal or external and does not require a third-party review of
external program’s evidence. BOP is directed to submit a report to
the Committee, within 90 days of the enactment of this act, on the
following: (1) an account of whether each approved EBRR and PA
is an internal BOP program, a contracted BOP program, or an ex-
ternal third-party program; (2) any difference in the criteria and
evaluation process for suitability of an internal BOP program, a
contracted BOP program, or an external third-party program as an
EBRR or PAs; (3) the number of external faith-based programs
that applied to qualify as an EBRR and PAs since the FSA was en-
acted, including the number that have been denied, the number
that are still pending, and the names of any accepted applicants
and whether any are taught from a specific faith tradition; (4) ac-
tions BOP has taken to promote the opportunity for submissions of
external programs for consideration as EBRRs and PAs; and (5) list
and describe what program providers make up the ‘‘faith-based re-
cidivism-reduction partnerships’’ noted in the Bureau of Justice

107
Statistics reporting on FSA implementation. The report shall also
include efforts to fill all vacant programming and other dedicated
FSA positions, efforts to improve transparency regarding EBRR
credit calculation, the EBRR programming currently available at
each BOP facility, the associated hours of EBRR credit participants
earn for participation in each program, and the need for and avail-
ability of medication-assisted treatment at each BOP facility.
Compassionate Release.—The Committee requests an updated re-
port on BOP’s compassionate release and home confinement efforts,
containing the information required by Senate Report 116–127 and
codified in Public Law 116–93, as well as including information on
the expansion of these programs per the authority provided under
Public Law 116–136.
Restrictive Housing.—The Committee remains concerned about
the growth in the restricted housing population in BOP institu-
tions. In 2012, approximately 7.8 percent of Federal inmates in
BOP facilities were held in some form of restricted housing. In
2014, that number had dropped to approximately 6.5 percent. Un-
fortunately, the restricted housing rate has returned to 2012 levels,
with approximately 7.3 percent of the Federal prison population
currently placed in restricted housing, including special housing
units, special management units, and the ADX Supermax facility.
The Committee directs BOP to reduce significantly the number of
Federal inmates in restricted housing, including by opening transi-
tion units and other specialized units for populations often sent to
restricted housing and working with regional directors and war-
dens to address the widespread reliance on restricted housing.
The Committee urges the Director of the BOP to fully implement
all the 2014 and 2016 restrictive housing reports recommendations.
A recent GAO Report, ‘‘Bureau of Prisons: Additional Actions Need-
ed to Improve Restrictive Housing Practices’’ (GAO–24–105737),
found that the BOP has failed to implement 54 of the 87 rec-
ommendations from two prior studies in 2014 and 2016 on improv-
ing restrictive housing practices. Within 180 days of enactment of
this act, and continuing semi-annually thereafter, the Committee
directs the BOP to submit a report outlining what steps the BOP
has taken to implement the 2014 and 2016 restrictive housing rec-
ommendations, the timeframe for completing the remaining rec-
ommendations, and in instances where the Bureau does not concur
with the recommendation or deems it impractical, it should docu-
ment its rationale and any alternate steps it plans to take.
Contraband Cell Phones in BOP Facilities.—In an August 2022
report, BOP observed that ‘‘[c]ontraband cellphones remain a sig-
nificant correctional security and public safety concern for the BOP
as well as for State and local correctional agencies across the coun-
try.’’ Since fiscal year 2020, the Committee has provided substan-
tial resources for BOP to pilot and outfit its facilities with managed
access system and micro-jamming solution cellphone interdiction
technologies. The Committee directs BOP to submit, within 90 days
of the date of the enactment of this act, an updated report on the
deployment of these technologies. The report shall identify the
number of contraband devices confiscated through the use of each
technology, and shall describe the long-term funding requirements
for full deployment. The report should further provide all available

108
data on the number of contraband cell phones delivered by drones,
and any actions being taken to address this method of delivery.
Camera System Upgrades.—The Committee supports continued
upgrades to security cameras that will help to better protect the
safety, wellbeing and civil rights of those incarcerated and BOP
employees, including correctional officers, medical personnel and
other professional staff.
Residential Reentry Centers [RRCs].—The Committee maintains
its concerns and expectations regarding RRCs as outlined in Senate
Report 116–127 and adopted by Public Law 116–93, including the
direction requiring BOP to alert the Committee before adopting
any significant change in policy or practice involving RRCs or other
recidivism-reduction measures. The Committee directs BOP to re-
frain from canceling or modifying any existing contracts for RRCs
if another BOP-contracted RRC facility does not exist within 100
miles of the existing RRC. In instances where RRC contracts are
expiring, the Committee directs BOP to take interim and emer-
gency measures to prevent facility closures and the interruption of
services, including by expediting solicitations and re-solicitations
for existing services. The Committee encourages BOP to begin or
continue the development of and planning for the operation of an
RRC in each State that does not currently have such a facility.
Extreme Weather Plans.—Recent examples of BOP’s responses to
extreme weather events-including extreme heat or cold-raise con-
cerns about unsafe conditions for inmates, correctional officers, and
institution staff. The Committee continues to direct BOP to issue
clear and consistent policies and guidance across all BOP facilities
regarding preparations for and responses to extreme weather
events, including by establishing temperature thresholds for health
and safety at BOP facilities.
Strengthening Collaboration to Ensure Effective Treatment Serv-
ices.—The Committee recognizes the importance of rehabilitation
and successfully enabling reentry of incarcerated people into their
communities, including providing mental health, substance misuse
and other behavioral health support to individuals leaving the cus-
tody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and entering the Federal Ju-
diciary’s Probation and Pretrial Services program for a term of
court-ordered post-release supervision. Creating a continuum of
care can help certain offenders adhere to and continue engagement
with their behavioral health treatment plans, obtain gainful em-
ployment, and avoid committing future crimes. The Committee is
aware that there is continuum of care collaboration between the
Federal Judiciary’s Probation and Pretrial Services program and
the Federal Bureau of Prisons but encourages both entities to
strengthen that collaboration to included better information shar-
ing, including electronic data sharing, on the treatment needs of in-
dividuals coming out of Federal prison.
RRC ID Data Collection.—A recent GAO report, ‘‘Bureau of Pris-
ons: Opportunities Exist to Better Assist Incarcerated People with
Obtaining ID Documents Prior to Release’’ (GAO 22–105302) found
that the BOP does not collect ID-related data from inmates once
they are transferred to RRCs. The Committee directs the Bureau
to make changes to the Statement of Work for RRCs to ensure that
in future or renegotiated contracts, the RRCs are required to collect

109
and regularly report data to BOP on the number of people obtain-
ing ID documents while residing at RRCs, and to report on these
efforts no later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
The Committee further directs the BOP, in the above-referenced
report, to assess the feasibility of entering into memoranda of un-
derstanding with additional State departments of motor vehicles to
expand innovative services at BOP facilities, in order to provide
state-issued photo ID processing services for those individuals with
proper supporting documents.
Establishment of Ombudsman Office.—The Committee directs
the Department, within 90 days of enactment of this act, to report
to the Committee on plans that it has developed and steps that it
has taken to establish an Ombudsman’s office to receive complaints
from incarcerated persons, family advocates, representatives of in-
carcerated persons, Bureau of Prisons staff, a representative of
staff, a Member of Congress, or a member of the judicial branch of
the Federal Government, pursuant to the Federal Prison Oversight
Act. The Committee further directs the Department, within 90 days
of enactment of this act, to provide to the Committee a proposed
spending plan, detailing BOP’s plan to establish the Ombudsman
office and inspections regime, as required by the Federal Prison
Oversight Act.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $179,762,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 179,762,000
This Committee’s recommendation includes $179,762,000 for the
construction, acquisition, modernization, maintenance, and repair
of prison and detention facilities housing Federal inmates. The rec-
ommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. BOP
shall proceed with ongoing planned and associated new construc-
tion efforts for BOP operated facilities to meet projected capacity
requirements, as identified in its monthly status of construction re-
ports to the Committee. BOP is directed to continue to provide such
reports on a monthly basis, along with notifications and expla-
nations of any deviation from construction and activation sched-
ules, and any planned adjustments or corrective actions. Within the
amount provided, $150,000,000 shall be for the continued develop-
ment and planning of a BOP and DOJ correctional officer and law
enforcement officer training facility. The Committee reiterates the
directive for the Department to provide a spending plan, pro-
spectus, and schedule, and looks forward to its submission. Con-
sistent with that effort, the Committee further directs the Depart-
ment to engage in request for information and request for proposal
efforts to develop a contract for formal project management, plan-
ning, and design support that takes into account site selection, en-
vironmental impact, and other requirements for timely and effec-
tive implementation.
FEDERAL PRISON INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED
(LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,700,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,700,000

110
The Committee’s recommendation provides a limitation on the
administrative expenses of $2,700,000 for the Federal Prison In-
dustries, Inc. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES
In total, the Committee recommends $3,695,113,000 for State
and local law enforcement and crime prevention grant programs,
including: $3,493,113,000 in discretionary appropriations and
$202,000,000 in mandatory appropriations. The total is $69,889,000
below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Management and Administration [M&A] Expenses.—The Depart-
ment shall, in preparing its fiscal year 2026 spending plan, assess
M&A expenses compared to program funding. The Committee di-
rects the Department to ensure that its assessment methodology is
equitable and that the assessment reflects a fair representation of
the share of each program devoted to common M&A costs. The
Committee also directs grant offices to minimize administrative
spending to maximize the amount of funding that can be used for
grants or training and technical assistance. The Committee reiter-
ates the direction provided in Senate Report 113–78 that the De-
partment shall detail, as part of its budget submission for fiscal
year 2025 and future years, the actual costs for each grant office
with respect to training, technical assistance, research and statis-
tics, and peer review for the prior fiscal year, along with estimates
of planned expenditures by each grant office in each of these cat-
egories for the current year and the budget year.
Grant Funding Set-Asides.—The Committee notes the significant
number of reductions in grant funding for various permissible pur-
poses, including training and technical assistance; research, eval-
uation, and statistics activities; and peer review; with set-asides
ranging anywhere from 2 percent to 10 percent of total grant fund-
ing provided. The Committee directs the Department to continue
providing a comprehensive report, concurrently with the spending
plan, that details the total amount provided for each grant program
in this act, the specific reductions taken, the purpose for those re-
ductions, and the final use of those resources, including any trans-
fers that may occur among Office of Justice Programs [OJP], Office
on Violence Against Women [OVW], and COPS. The Committee ex-
pects that the report will provide a complete analysis of the final
amounts externally awarded and the amounts retained internally
for other purposes.
Grant Funds for Rural Areas.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the needs of rural areas, especially those communities
with high crime rates. The Committee wants to ensure that the
challenges encountered by the residents of these areas are being
addressed through the equitable allocation of grant funding. The
Committee reminds the Department to consider the unique needs
of rural communities when making grant awards through the nu-
merous programs funded by this bill.
Tribal Grants and Victim Assistance.—The Committee provides a
total of $117,000,000 in discretionary grant funding for Tribes as
follows: $48,000,000 within OJP for Tribal assistance; $16,000,000
for a Tribal youth program within the Office of Juvenile Justice

111
and Delinquency Prevention [OJJDP]; $34,000,000 for Tribal re-
sources and $4,000,000 for a Tribal Access Program within the
COPS Office; and $12,000,000 for a special Tribal criminal jurisdic-
tion program and $3,000,000 for a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney
on Tribal land program within the OVW. In addition, a total of
$65,893,535 is provided to Tribal governments and coalitions
through OVW programmatic statutory set-asides and another
$95,000,000 is provided to Tribal governments and Tribal coalitions
in CVF funding.
For Tribal assistance grants within OJP, funding is to be used
to support efforts to help Tribes improve the capacity of their crimi-
nal and civil justice systems. OJP is expected to consult closely
with Tribal stakeholders in determining how Tribal assistance
funds will be awarded for detention facilities, including outdated
detention facilities that are unfit for detention purposes and be-
yond rehabilitation; courts; alcohol and substance abuse programs;
civil and criminal legal assistance; and other priorities. The Com-
mittee directs OJP to submit, as part of the Department’s spending
plan for fiscal year 2026, a plan for the use of these funds that is
informed by such consultation.
In addition, the bill includes a 5 percent set-aside for Tribes
within the CVF. OVC is directed to consult closely with Tribal
stakeholders to improve services for Tribal victims of crime, to in-
clude expanded purpose areas described in the OVC final rule ef-
fective August 8, 2016. OVC shall continue to follow direction pro-
vided by the Committee in Senate Report 115–275 and adopted by
Public Law 116–6 regarding grant application requirements, ac-
countability, and assistance.
The Committee directs the Department to give Tribes maximum
flexibility in the use of funds and the definition of victim services,
in order to best meet the unique needs of victims in Tribal commu-
nities. The Committee also directs the Department to streamline
administrative requirements as much as possible to increase acces-
sibility for those most in need in Indian Country.
STOP School Violence Act.—A total of $195,000,000 is provided
for the STOP School Violence Act (division S of title V of Public
Law 115–141) grant program for fiscal year 2025. Of this amount,
$60,000,000 is derived from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
and $135,000,000 is provided for in this act. Of the amount pro-
vided for in this act, $82,000,000 is provided to the Bureau of Jus-
tice Assistance [BJA] for evidence-based school safety programs
outlined in the act and $53,000,000 is provided to the COPS Office
for a competitive grant program as outlined in the act. The Com-
mittee directs BJA to prioritize evidence-based programming to
train students and school personnel on the warning signs of inter-
personal violence and suicide, to prevent the root causes of student
violence, and to deliver mental health crisis intervention, as per-
mitted under the act. The Committee directs the offices to work
with other Federal agencies to notify States, localities, tribes, and
school districts of funding availability upon release, increase train-
ing and technical assistance for school district applicants, and pro-
vide microgrants for school districts, including rural, Tribal, and
low-resourced schools. The Committee directs BJA to prioritize ap-
plicants from rural and low-resourced school districts and appli-

112
cants incorporating crisis centers and evidence-based trainings for
students and staff within their anonymous reporting systems. The
Committee encourages BJA and the COPS Office to prioritize appli-
cations that promote the use of mental health professionals and re-
sources in their school safety plans.
National Sexual Assault Hotline.—The Committee urges OVC to
fully support the National Sexual Assault Hotline, as authorized by
the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, as
amended (34 U.S.C. 20985(d)).
OVC Center for Victims of Crime Act [VOCA] Administrators.—
The Committee directs OVC to continue to provide peer-to-peer
training on Federal grants management, administration and strat-
egies to increase access to services and compensation for VOCA vic-
tim assistance and victim compensation grantees and subgrantees.
Shelter for Victims and their Companion Animals.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of providing shelter and transi-
tional housing to victims of domestic violence and their companion
animals and encourages the Department to continue providing ro-
bust funding for grants under the Emergency Transitional Pet
Shelter and Housing Assistance Grant Program, as authorized by
section 12502 of Public Law 115–334. The Committee directs OVC
to continue to coordinate with the Departments of Agriculture,
Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services
to efficiently implement this program.
Support for Child Advocacy Centers.—The Committee commends
OVC and OJJDP for its enhanced support of CACs through solicita-
tion OJJDP–2020–17712. The Committee directs the offices to sus-
tain this funding through continuation awards, in order to avoid
the severe consequences of a break in critical services.
DOJ Grant Oversight.—The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to review its multi-year grant award processes and protocols
to ensure grantees have fully complied with the rules of year-one
funding before year-two funding is disbursed in multi-year grant
awards. In addition, the Committee supports the Department’s ef-
forts to create a high-risk designation for grantees, so as to in-
crease fiscal responsibility throughout the grant making process.
The Committee recommends that the Department promptly com-
plete and publish an internal review of the program, to inform ef-
forts to implement a high-risk grantee designation in other Federal
agencies. The Committee directs OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office
to submit an annual report on grant programs that have not re-
ceived a sufficient number of qualified applicants.

(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $713,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 720,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $720,000,000 for
OVW grants. The recommendation is $7,000,000 above the fiscal
year 2025. Resources are provided to the OVW to respond to the

113
needs of all victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating vio-
lence, and stalking, including, but not limited to, Native women,
immigrants, LGBTQ victims, college students, youths, and public
housing residents. To minimize fraud, waste, and abuse in these
programs, OVW is encouraged to implement any open rec-
ommendations of the Department’s OIG with respect to the recipi-
ents of grants under these programs.
The table below displays the Committee’s recommendations for
the programs under this office.

Access to Sexual Assault Nurse Exams.—The Committee’s rec-
ommendation includes $12,000,000 for grants for regional sexual
assault nurse examiner [SANE] training, salaries for SANEs and
sexual assault forensic examiners [SAFEs], and technical assist-
ance and resources to increase access to SANEs and SAFEs, as au-
thorized by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of
2022 (division W of Public Law 117–103). The Committee encour-
ages the Department to prioritize areas where nationwide gaps
exist in the availability and quality of post-sexual assault medical
forensic care, including rural, Tribal, underserved communities,
and urban areas that lack full-time coverage. The Committee di-
rects OVW to collaborate with the Office for Victims of Crime to
implement this program in coordination with other funding oppor-

114
tunities designed to enhance the quality and availability of post-
sexual assault medical forensic care, to include multidisciplinary
settings responding to the abuse of both children and adolescents.
Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights.—The Committee again
provides $10,000,000 as part of the STOP grants for the recently
enacted Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, a new and con-
sequential grant program that incentivizes States to codify and
standardize survivor rights. The Committee notes the Department’s
lower request due to a limited number of States applying and
qualifying for the awards. Accordingly, the Committee continues to
direct the Department to submit a report to the Committee, within
120 days of enactment of this act, detailing any applicants deemed
by OVW as ineligible for this funding, the reasons for the ineligi-
bility, and suggested legislative changes that could increase state
eligibility.
Statutory Set-Asides.—The underlying statutes for several grant
programs, including STOP and Sexual Assault Services Program
[SASP], outline set-asides for Tribal governments and coalitions,
culturally specific community-based organizations, and organiza-
tions providing services to underserved populations. These set-
asides would provide a total of $89,578,535 for fiscal year 2026,
with $65,893,535 for Tribal governments and coalitions,
$17,375,000 for culturally specific organizations, and $6,310,000 to
meet the needs of underserved populations. The Committee expects
OVW to ensure that the full amounts provided for in the author-
izing statutes are released to these groups expeditiously.
Rural Victims.—Victims of sexual assault living in rural commu-
nities may be reluctant to report to law enforcement. The Com-
mittee encourages the OVW to implement projects that reduce bar-
riers to the reporting of crime in rural areas, colonias, and per-
sistent poverty counties and directs the OVW to submit a report to
the Committee not later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
Violence Against Middle Eastern and North African Women.—
The Committee directs the Department to develop best practices, in
consultation with Middle Eastern and North African [MENA] com-
munity-based organizations, for the investigation and prosecution
of violence against MENA women. The Committee further directs
the Department’s Office on Violence Against Women to review the
sufficiency of its Culturally Specific Services and Underserved Pop-
ulations programs with regard to MENA survivors of sexual and
gender-based violence, including the quality and cultural com-
petency of its temporary and transitional housing, education, and
workforce development assistance, and whether additional re-
sources are needed to provide MENA survivors with equitable ac-
cess to services. The Department shall report to the Committee on
these directives within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Trauma-Informed Investigations.—OVW published the Frame-
work for Prosecutors to Strengthen our National Response to Sex-
ual Assault and Domestic Violence Involving Adult Victims [Pros-
ecutor’s Framework] in May 2024. OVW stressed the need for pros-
ecutors ‘‘to build provable cases in a trauma-informed manner that
treats victims with humanity and ensures due process for defend-
ants.’’ The Committee notes the importance of those investigating
and prosecuting alleged sexual assault and domestic violence

115
crimes understanding that survivors do not respond to these crimes
in any one way and that trauma-informed questioning is necessary
to help ensure that justice is done. OVW has encouraged the grant-
ees of the STOP formula grant program and prosecutors broadly to
use the Prosecutor’s Framework. The Committee directs OVW to
provide a report to the Committee, within 180 days of enactment
of this act, on its efforts to encourage grantees in the aforemen-
tioned programs to implement the guidance.
OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS
The OJP is responsible for providing leadership, coordination,
and assistance to its Federal, State, local, and Tribal partners to
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the U.S. justice system
in preventing, controlling, and responding to crime. As most of the
responsibility for crime control and prevention falls to law enforce-
ment officers in States, cities, and other localities, the Federal Gov-
ernment is effective in these areas only to the extent that it can
enter into successful partnerships with these jurisdictions. There-
fore, OJP is tasked with administering grants; collecting statistical
data and conducting analyses; identifying emerging criminal justice
issues; developing and testing promising and innovative approaches
to address these issues; evaluating program results; and dissemi-
nating these findings and other information to State, local, and
Tribal governments.
RESEARCH, EVALUATION AND STATISTICS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $65,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 60,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $60,000,000 for the
Research, Evaluation and Statistics account. The recommendation
is $5,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Funding in this account provides assistance in the areas of re-
search, evaluation, statistics, hate crimes, DNA and forensics,
criminal background checks, and gun safety technology, among oth-
ers.

forcement Activities, a plan for the use of all funding administered
by the National Institute of Justice [NIJ] and the Bureau of Justice
Statistics [BJS], respectively, for approval by the Committee prior
to the obligation of any such funds.

116

to continue the established public-private partnership with re-
search and correctional institutions to collect and evaluate data,
and continue to advance the research on the impact of correctional
education on recidivism.
Report on Forensic Laboratory Resource Requirements.—The
Committee adopts and re-iterates the directive under this heading
in Senate Report 118–62, as adopted into the joint explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 118–42. The Committee looks
forward to the timely submission of this study.
Human Trafficking Study.—NIJ is directed to provide a briefing,
within 30 days of the date of the enactment of this act, on the sta-
tus of the study required by Section 20 of the Abolish Human Traf-
ficking Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–392) and its estimated comple-
tion date.

Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.—The
Committee recommends $569,146,000 for Byrne-JAG. Funding is
not available for luxury items, real estate, or construction projects.
The Department should expect State, local, and Tribal governments
to target funding to programs and activities that conform to evi-
dence-based strategic plans developed through broad stakeholder
involvement. The Committee directs the Department to make tech-
nical assistance available to State, local, and Tribal governments
for the development or update of such plans. Funding is authorized
for law enforcement programs including those that promote data
interoperability among disparate law enforcement entities; prosecu-
tion and court programs; prevention and education programs; cor-
rections programs; drug treatment and enforcement programs;
planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs; and
crime victim and witness programs, other than compensation.
Combatting Violence and Hate Crimes at Houses of Worship and
Faith-Based Organizations.—The Committee remains concerned
with the rise in religiously-motivated violence across the United
States, including targeted acts of violence directed at houses of
worship, faith-based community centers, and other religious insti-

118
tutions. In response to these threats, the Committee directs the De-
partment to prioritize funding allocated under 34 U.S.C. 10157(b)
to support State and local law enforcement agencies seeking to en-
hance security measures for at-risk religious institutions and to ad-
dress the precipitous increases in hate crimes targeting individuals
on the basis of religion. The Committee further directs the Depart-
ment to submit a report, within 6 months of the enactment of this
act, describing the implementation of this directive.
Byrne-JAG and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.—In addi-
tion to the funding provided in this act, the Committee notes that
an additional $150,000,000 will be released to State, local, and
Tribal governments this fiscal year under the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act [BCSA]. Government agencies and law enforce-
ment can use BCSA funding for the following purposes, including,
but not limited to: extreme risk protection order programs, drug
courts, mental health courts, and veterans courts.
Preventing Violence Against Law Enforcement Officer Resilience
and Survivability [VALOR] Initiative.—The Committee’s rec-
ommendation provides $13,000,000 within Byrne-JAG for the
VALOR Initiative. The Committee expects Federal law enforcement
agencies to continue to expand on efforts to provide local police
with information as to whether a suspect has a violent history, to
the extent that transfer of such information is allowable and avail-
able via Federal law enforcement databases, in an effort to prevent
officer deaths. The Committee notes that an additional $12,000,000
is provided under the COPS heading for Protecting Our Lives by
Initiating COPS Expansion Act (Public Law 114–199) programs,
which help to provide active shooter training programs for State
and local law enforcement officers.
Law Enforcement Officer De-escalation Training.—The Com-
mittee recommends $8,000,000 for a competitive grant program to
support training and related initiatives (with a particular emphasis
on de-escalation practices) that help improve responses to individ-
uals with mental illness, intellectual disabilities, or developmental
disabilities and others who come into contact with law enforcement
or correctional officers, including for purposes described in the Law
Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act of 2022 (Public Law 117–
325).
National Missing and Unidentified Persons System [NamUS].—
The Committee strongly supports the mission of NamUS, in par-
ticular its efforts to identify unidentified children. The Committee
encourages OJP to support partnerships, such as Project 525, that
work collaboratively towards resolving longstanding cases involving
minors.
Prison Rape Elimination Act [PREA] Audit Quality Initiative.—
Facility audits are a key component in helping agencies move their
sexual abuse prevention and response policies from written docu-
ments to everyday practices. Congress enhanced the audit process
in 2018 to ensure greater oversight of the audit process and im-
proved audits, but many of these changes have not been fully im-
plemented by the PREA Management Office. The Committee sup-
ports the Department providing the necessary resources to carry
out this work.

119
Project Safe Neighborhoods [PSN].—PSN is a nationwide initia-
tive that brings together Federal, State, local, Tribal, and terri-
torial law enforcement officials, prosecutors, community-based part-
ners, and other stakeholders to identify the most pressing violent
crime problems in a community and develop comprehensive solu-
tions to address them. PSN is coordinated by the U.S. Attorneys’
Offices in the 94 Federal judicial districts throughout the 50 States
and U.S. territories. OJP is encouraged to highlight ways PSN
funding can reduce gun violence, including through automated bal-
listics imaging triage technology. This technology can improve gun
crime arrest rates by enabling law enforcement entities to imme-
diately scan ballistics evidence, quickly access crime gun intel-
ligence, and streamline evidence submission to NIBIN.
The Committee notes the continued importance of PSN funds
being used only for the purposes set forth in 34 U.S.C. 60703. The
Committee further notes that PSN funds shall be locally controlled
to address problems that are identified locally. The Committee di-
rects DOJ to submit a report to this Committee, within 180 days
of enactment of this act, that details for each area in which the
PSN Block Grant Program operates: (1) how the area spent funds
under the PSN Block Grant Program; (2) the community outreach
efforts performed in the area; and (3) the number and a description
of the violent crime offenses committed in the area, including mur-
der, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated as-
sault.
Capital Litigation Improvement and Wrongful Conviction Re-
view.—The Committee recognizes the need for legal representation
and investigation services for individuals with post-conviction
claims of innocence.
Given the urgent need to identify and remediate wrongful convic-
tions, the Committee directs that at least 50 percent of the
$12,000,000 appropriated to the Capital Litigation Improvement
and Wrongful Conviction Review grant programs shall be used to
support Wrongful Conviction Review grantees providing high qual-
ity and efficient post-conviction representation for defendants in
post-conviction claims of innocence. Wrongful Conviction Review
grantees shall be nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher
education, and/or State or local public defender offices that have in-
house post-conviction representation programs that show demon-
strable experience and competence in litigating post-conviction
claims of innocence. Grant funds shall support grantee provision of
post-conviction legal representation of innocence claims; case re-
view, evaluation, and management; experts; potentially exonerative
forensic testing; and investigation services related to supporting
these post-conviction innocence claims.
National Center on Restorative Justice.—Of the $3,000,000 pro-
vided for this program, no less than $2,500,000 shall be used to
continue a partnership with an accredited university of higher edu-
cation and/or law school for the purposes of supporting a National
Center on Restorative Justice to educate and train the next genera-
tion of justice leaders. The Center shall expand its partnerships
with practitioners and facilitators to increase access and types of
restorative justice training and education opportunities available
across the country and continue to support research focusing on

120
how best to provide direct services to address social inequities, such
as simultaneous access to substance abuse treatment and higher
education. Further, the Center will expand educational opportuni-
ties for those under sentence and in a court-supervised substance
abuse program, and, through research and evaluation, the Center
will disseminate reports on the impact of attitudes, recidivism, and
costs of the educational initiatives. Up to $500,000 may be used to
support microgrants to innovative restorative justice projects in
communities across the country.
Forensic Ballistics and Higher Education.—Subject to approval
from ATF, educational institutions can join NIBIN in collaboration
with local law enforcement agencies. Through the use of ballistics
identification equipment, these NIBIN initiatives can provide stu-
dents with hands-on training in the processing of firearms evidence
used to generate actionable crime gun intelligence. The Committee
provides $1,500,000 for a competitive grant program for univer-
sities and technical colleges, to acquire ballistics identification
equipment and support forensic ballistics programs.
Rural Violent Crime Initiative.—State, local, and Tribal law en-
forcement agencies in rural areas face unique challenges, including
limited financial and technological resources, and the need to cover
large, remote areas with smaller staff. Violent crime, including
drug- and human-trafficking, continues to grow in these locations.
The Committee provides $7,000,000 for a Rural Violent Crime Re-
duction Initiative for Law Enforcement Agencies, with grants to be
awarded on a competitive basis to small law enforcement agencies
in rural locations. Grants are to support improved training and
technology, expanded community-based crime prevention programs,
and partnerships with victim service providers. This initiative is in-
tended to improve communication and collaboration among State,
local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies with the communities
they serve, to address the unique criminal justice challenges in
rural areas. Of the total amount provided, no less than $4,000,000
shall be for a microgrant program with streamlined application and
reporting requirements.
Uses of Byrne-JAG Funds.—The Committee continues to recog-
nize that novel equipment and technologies can improve public
safety and public trust in criminal justice institutions. OJP is
urged to promote awareness, through Statements on the OJP
website, in ‘‘FAQs’’ and seminars, and in solicitation documents,
that Byrne-JAG funds may be used for managed access systems
and other cell phone mitigation technologies; fentanyl and meth-
amphetamine detection equipment, including handheld instru-
ments; drug detection canines; license plate readers; and hiring
and training of cybercrime analysts and investigators.
Grants to Combat Human Trafficking.—The Committee’s rec-
ommendation provides $88,000,000 for services and task force ac-
tivities for U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nation-
als who are victims of trafficking, as authorized by Public Law
106–386 and amended by Public Law 113–4, of which no less than
$22,000,000 is for the Enhanced Collaborative Model to Combat
Human Trafficking Task Force Program. The Committee urges
that human trafficking task forces funded under this grant pro-
gram take affirmative measures to emphasize the investigation and

121
prosecution of persons who patronize or solicit children for sex as
a human trafficking demand reduction strategy. OJP shall consult
with stakeholder groups in determining the overall allocation of
Victims of Trafficking funding and shall provide a plan to the Com-
mittee for the use of these funds as part of the Department’s fiscal
year 2026 spending plan.
The Committee notes that funding provided in this program may
be used for victims of sex and labor trafficking who are minors, as
authorized under the Violence Against Women Act of 2013. Child
trafficking victims require specialized care, and these resources can
be used for items like residential care, emergency social services,
mental health counseling, and legal services. This funding level
also includes $10,000,000 for the Minor Victims of Trafficking
Grant program, of which $5,000,000 is for victim services grants for
sex-trafficked minors, as authorized by Public Law 113–4, with the
remaining $5,000,000 for victim services grants for labor-trafficked
minors. The Committee encourages OJP to give an affirmative pref-
erence to applicants for grants that treat minors engaged in com-
mercial sex acts as victims of a severe form of trafficking in per-
sons, and discourages the charging of such individuals for prostitu-
tion or a sex trafficking offense. The Committee encourages DOJ to
work in close coordination with the Department of Health and
Human Services to encourage collaboration and reduce duplication
of effort.
Internet of Things Capabilities Database.—The growing use of
Internet of Things devices requires understanding of existing capa-
bilities of such devices for training on options and best practices for
handling of evidence to meet judicial standards and privacy con-
cerns. To meet this need, $2,000,000 shall be dedicated for a sepa-
rate competitive grant program in order to provide four awards of
not less than $500,000 each for institutions of higher learning that
provide training in computer forensics and digital investigation to
develop a database on Internet of Things device capabilities and to
build and execute training modules for law enforcement.
Patrick Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program.—
Within the $30,000,000 provided for bulletproof vests, $1,500,000 is
to be transferred directly to the NIST Office of Law Enforcement
Standards to continue supporting ballistic- and stab-resistant ma-
terial compliance testing programs. The Committee expects OJP to
continue strengthening internal controls to manage the Patrick
Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. Improving
grantee accountability in the timely use of Federal funds to pur-
chase body armor will help every police officer who needs a vest to
get one, thus saving officers’ lives.
National Instant Criminal Background Check System Initiative
Grants.—A total of $127,000,000 is provided for this program, of
which $40,000,000 is derived from the BSCA and $87,000,000 is de-
rived from funding in this act. Funding provided in this act will be
used to continue to improve the submission of State criminal and
mental health records to NICS. This investment will strengthen
the National background check system by assisting States in find-
ing ways to make more records available in the NICS system, espe-
cially mental health records, thereby addressing gaps in Federal
and State records currently available in NICS. Those gaps signifi-

122
cantly hinder the ability of NICS to quickly confirm whether a pro-
spective purchaser is prohibited from acquiring a firearm. The
Committee expects OJP to track whether grant recipients are sub-
mitting data in a timely manner into the NICS system.
The Fix NICS Act allows the Attorney General to waive the Na-
tional Criminal History Improvement Program match for States
that are in compliance with the implementation plan required
under Section 107 of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of
2007 (Public Law 110–180). The Committee directs the Department
to remind States of the possibility of this waiver in guidance or
technical assistance regarding this grant program.
The Committee is aware that many State laws and policies pro-
vide for the expungement or sealing of certain criminal records,
making it possible for people with past convictions to access em-
ployment and housing, or exercise their social and civic rights.
However, many States do not have the resources for appropriate
technology to implement such policies effectively. The Committee
urges the Department to ensure that grants made under the Na-
tional Criminal History Improvement Program [NCHIP] can be
made available for supporting States in the planning and the im-
plementation of records systems that allow for the efficient
expungement or sealing of qualifying criminal history records with-
out requiring those eligible to apply.
The Committee encourages the Department to consider length-
ening the period of performance for NCHIP, the NICS Act Record
Improvement Program, and NCHIP Supplemental Funding grant-
ees to enable comprehensive system upgrades that are necessary to
ensure improved functioning of the background check process and
maximum contribution of relevant records to the system.
Paul Coverdell Forensic Science.—The recommendation provides
a total of $35,000,000, of which $17,000,000 is to target specifically
the challenges the opioid and synthetic drug epidemic has brought
to the forensics community.
DNA Backlog and Crime Lab Improvements.—The Committee
continues its strong support for DNA backlog and crime lab im-
provements by recommending $148,000,000 to strengthen and im-
prove Federal and State DNA collection and analysis systems that
can be used to accelerate the prosecution of the guilty while simul-
taneously protecting the innocent from wrongful prosecution. With-
in the funds provided, $120,000,000 is for Debbie Smith DNA Back-
log Reduction grants, $14,000,000 is for Kirk Bloodsworth Post-
Conviction DNA Testing grants, $4,000,000 is for Sexual Assault
Forensic Exam Program grants, and $10,000,000 is for other State
and local forensic activities. An additional $12,000,000 is provided
for Access to Sexual Assault Nurse Examinations grants under the
Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs.
The Committee expects that the OJP will make funding for DNA
analysis and capacity enhancement a priority in order to meet the
purposes of the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. The
Committee directs the Department to submit, as part of its fiscal
year 2026 spending plan, a detailed description of the DNA-related
and forensic programs, including a description of the alignment of
appropriated funds with the authorized purposes of the Debbie
Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. Consistent with the Justice

123
Served Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–257), the Committee expects
that not less than 5 percent, but not more than 7 percent, of
amounts for the program shall be provided for grants for prosecu-
tors to increase the capacity of State and local prosecution offices
to address cold cases involving violent crime, where suspects have
been identified through DNA evidence.
The Committee appreciates the Department’s publication of data
and metrics on the effectiveness of this program. For example,
more than half of all matches made on the Combined DNA Index
System [CODIS] are attributable to cases and offender samples
processed through this Federal grant program. The Committee en-
courages the Department to continue to track and annually report
such metrics related to how this program contributes to the num-
ber of cases and offender samples submitted to CODIS, as well as
to the related number of CODIS matches.
DNA-related and Forensics Programs.—The Committee continues
to direct the Department to allocate funds for DNA-related and
forensics programs in compliance with all relevant requirements,
including the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 (Public
Law 114–235), the Justice Served Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–
257), and appropriations directives.
Sexual Assault Kit Initiative.—The Committee’s recommendation
includes $51,500,000 to continue a competitive grant program
started in fiscal year 2015 as part of the initiative to reduce the
backlog of rape kits at law enforcement agencies. OJP shall provide
competitively awarded grants with a comprehensive community-
based approach to addressing the resolution of cases in the backlog.
The Committee believes it is important for the Department to
maximize the results of investments in sexual assault kit [SAK]
testing through continued research to identify best practices for
State, local, and Tribal jurisdictions in handling the myriad issues
that arise from perpetrator identification-such as victim notifica-
tion, investigation, prosecution, documentation, forensic advance-
ments, inter-jurisdiction sharing, and tracking. The Committee fur-
ther believes it is critically important to fund efforts to support
cross-jurisdiction and cross-site data sharing to identify and pursue
repeat offenders operating in multiple jurisdictions. Finally, the
Committee believes that further work to validate the extensive cost
savings that result from the prevention of future offenses as a re-
sult of SAK testing is needed. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to support efforts that advance these objectives; and further
directs BJA to issue a report, within 1 year of the enactment of this
act, on the number of partially tested kits.
Second Chance Act [SCA] Grants.—The recommendation pro-
vides $116,000,000 for SCA grants. The Committee expects that
SCA funding will support grants that foster the implementation of
strategies that have been proven to reduce recidivism and ensure
adults released from prisons and jails safely and successfully reen-
ter their communities. The SCA supports activities such as employ-
ment assistance, substance abuse treatment including MAT op-
tions, housing, local transportation, mentoring, family program-
ming, and victim support. SCA grants will also support demonstra-
tion projects designed to test the impact of new strategies and
frameworks. Of the amounts provided in this section, $10,000,000

124
is provided for the purposes of the Crisis Stabilization and Commu-
nity Reentry Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–281), which also address-
es the mental health and substance use disorder needs of individ-
uals who are recently released from correctional facilities.
When awarding SCA grants, the Committee directs OJP to con-
sider the impact of reentry of prisoners on communities in which
a disproportionate number of individuals reside upon release from
incarceration. OJP shall assess the reentry burdens borne by local
communities and local law enforcement agencies; review the re-
sources available in such communities to support successful reentry
and the extent to which those resources are used effectively; and
make recommendations to strengthen the resources in such com-
munities which are available to support successful reentry and to
lessen the burden placed on such communities by the need to sup-
port reentry.
Project HOPE Institute.—The Committee recognizes the success
of Project HOPE. The Committee provides $5,000,000 for Project
HOPE, of which not less than $500,000 shall be directed to con-
tinue the Project HOPE Institute to provide training, technical as-
sistance, and best practices for jurisdictions replicating the HOPE
model. The Committee directs BJA to award grants to support both
existing Project HOPE models and new jurisdictions.
Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act.—The Com-
mittee directs BJA to ensure that the program includes grants for
peer support specialists and peer-led mental health education
classes or support groups for justice-involved individuals and fami-
lies commensurate with community needs.
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act [CARA] Programs.—
The Committee provides a total of $418,000,000 for CARA pro-
grams, including $89,000,000 for drug courts; $34,000,000 for vet-
erans treatment courts; $35,000,000 for Residential Substance
Abuse Treatment, including access to any of the three MAT op-
tions; $35,000,000 for prescription drug monitoring; $40,000,000 for
the Mentally Ill Offender Act; and $185,000,000 for the Com-
prehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Use Disorder Pro-
gram [COSSUP].
The Committee directs that funding for COSSUP programs focus
on prevention and education efforts, effective responses to those af-
fected by substance abuse, and services for treatment and recovery
from addiction. Of the $185,000,000 for COSSUP, not less than
$11,000,000 shall be made available for additional replication sites
employing the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion [LEAD] model,
with applicants demonstrating a plan for sustainability of LEAD-
model diversion programs; no less than $5,500,000 shall be made
available for education and prevention programs to connect law en-
forcement agencies with K–12 students; and not less than
$11,000,000 shall be made available for embedding social services
with law enforcement in order to rapidly respond to drug overdoses
where children are impacted.
The Committee supports specialized residential substance abuse
treatment programs for inmates with co-occurring mental health
and substance abuse disorders or challenges. Given the strong
nexus between substance abuse and mental illness in our prisons
and jails, the Committee encourages the Attorney General to en-

125
sure that funds provided for residential substance abuse treatment
for State prisoners are being used to treat underlying mental
health disorders, in addition to substance abuse disorders.
The Committee recognizes the importance of drug courts and the
vital role that they serve in reducing crime among people with a
substance use or mental health disorder. In recent years, drug
courts have been on the front lines of the opioid epidemic and have
become important resources for law enforcement and other commu-
nity stakeholders affected by opioid addiction. The Committee ap-
plauds efforts already undertaken in communities across the coun-
try to utilize drug courts. The Committee encourages Federal agen-
cies to continue to work with State and local governments and com-
munities to support drug courts.
The Committee supports the ability of drug courts to address of-
fenders with co-occurring substance abuse and mental health prob-
lems, and supports court ordered assisted outpatient treatment
programs for individuals struggling with mental illness. Within the
funding provided for drug courts, the Committee encourages OJP
to give attention to States and localities that have the highest con-
centrations of opioid-related cases, and to prioritize assistance to
underserved areas whose criminal defendants currently have rel-
atively little opportunity to access drug courts. The Committee en-
courages OJP to coordinate, as appropriate, with other Federal
agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services,
as it implements these activities in order to avoid duplication.
The Committee supports the work of mental health courts across
the country. The Committee is concerned, however, by the high
rates of re-incarceration among individuals with serious mental ill-
ness due to the inadequate access to care for or management of
their illness and directs that the Department include appropriate
long-acting medications, including injectable anti-psychotic medica-
tion, as an allowable expense to improve treatment adherence and
reduce risk for relapse and re-incarceration.
Veterans Treatment Courts.—The Committee continues to strong-
ly support veterans treatment courts [VTCs]. An evaluation of
VTCs funded by BJA found limitations in access to VTCs due to
challenges in identifying veterans and also emphasized that vet-
erans’ needs vary from other drug courts. The Committee supports
the Department’s efforts to offer a broader range of tools to address
program needs. The joint explanatory statement accompanying
Public Law 118–42 directed BJA to submit a report, within 180
days of the enactment of that law, on the establishment of a Na-
tional Center for Veterans Justice, designed to continuously en-
hance coordination of data, best practices, original research, and
technical assistance to further evidence-based practices for justice-
involved veteran interventions. The Committee appreciates the
submission of this report and provides $5,000,000 for the establish-
ment of the Center. The Committee directs BJA to provide a brief-
ing on the establishment of the Center within 30 days of the enact-
ment of this act, and to coordinate with the Veterans Justice Com-
mission on the structure, staffing, programming, and funding of the
Center.
BJA is encouraged to prioritize VTC grants to rural and low-in-
come areas with high rates of substance abuse and veteran home-

126
lessness. BJA is directed to submit a report, within 90 days of the
enactment of this act, detailing the geographic distribution of appli-
cants, award recipients, and award funding levels, over fiscal years
2019 to 2025.
Keep Young Athletes Safe Act.—The Committee again provides
funding of $2,500,000 for a competitive grant program to safeguard
young athletes against abuse in sports, including emotional, phys-
ical, and sexual abuse. The Committee directs that funding be
prioritized for curriculum development and training for abuse pre-
vention education in youth athletic programs and for investigation
and resolution of sexual abuse claims. The Committee further di-
rects that the Department explore opportunities for supporting an
athlete survivor leadership network to better incorporate survivors’
lived experiences are incorporated as part of new curriculum, train-
ing materials, and technical assistance, including a better under-
standing of how and when to report. Any recommendations regard-
ing youth athletes stemming from the work and reporting by the
Commission on the State of U.S. Olympics and Paralympics shall
be incorporated into this program.
Justice Reinvestment Initiative [JRI].—The Committee provides
$32,000,000 for the JRI, which provides assistance to States to
identify local issues arising in criminal justice systems and to de-
velop data-driven and research-backed responses. Jurisdictions
may use the JRI to reduce recidivism; control the size of corrections
populations, either incarcerated or on community supervision; re-
duce crime; and create budgetary solutions to better balance correc-
tional costs within a State’s budget. Justice reinvestment is used
to implement data-driven strategies to improve public safety by re-
ducing corrections spending and reinvesting those savings in efforts
to decrease crime and strengthen neighborhoods. Funding may be
used to provide technical assistance to States with existing justice
reinvestment programs to further such programs; provide technical
assistance to additional States to expand the justice reinvestment
initiative to those jurisdictions; or provide funding to States with
existing justice reinvestment initiatives to expand or enhance the
State’s self-identified justice reinvestment initiative goals. Justice
reinvestment funds shall not be restricted by Federal agencies for
use on specific programs or policy initiatives, and States shall be
permitted to establish their own priorities within the justice rein-
vestment framework.
Addressing Hate Crimes.—The Committee provides a total of
$35,000,000 to address hate crimes in our communities. Of this
amount, $17,000,000 is for Hate Crime Prevention Act grants au-
thorized under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate
Crimes Prevention Act (section 4704 of Public Law 111–84). The
Committee continues to urge the Department and grant recipients
to prioritize efforts to identify, investigate, report on, and prevent
hate crimes that occur online or are related to bias-motivated har-
assment and criminal activity occurring online. The Committee
also provides $9,000,000 for grants authorized under the Jabara-
Heyer NO HATE Crime Act, and $9,000,000 for grants provided
under the Community-Based Approaches to Advancing Justice pro-
gram.

127
Community-Based Approaches to Advancing Justice.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of community-based organizations
in conflict resolution and empowering communities to combat hate
crimes and incidents, as Congress has directed for the last two fis-
cal years. These organizations provide direct assistance to targeted
communities, train individuals on techniques to de-escalate dan-
gerous situations, and provide timely statistical information on
hate crimes to their communities. The Committee continues to pro-
vide funding for grants to these organizations to advance justice
within their communities.
Community Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative
[CVIPI].—The Committee strongly supports continued funding for
CVIPI, a proven, evidence-based strategy that reduces violence and
saves lives. A total of $105,000,000 is provided for CVIPI in fiscal
year 2026. This includes $50,000,000 from the BSCA and
$55,000,000 in this act. This grant program supports communities
in developing comprehensive, evidence-based violence intervention
and prevention programs, including efforts to address gang and
gun violence, based on partnerships between community residents,
law enforcement, local government agencies, and other community
stakeholders. Awards should be prioritized for communities with
the highest number of homicides and the highest number of homi-
cides per capita. The Committee directs OJP to prioritize that these
grants be made to community-based violence intervention programs
to the fullest extent possible and also track and publish informa-
tion on this funding, including the number of awards made and a
description of the use of funding for each project and the number
of grant applications received.
The Committee recognizes the importance of also providing effec-
tive training for law enforcement to advance public safety using
community violence intervention initiatives. The Committee en-
courages OJP to develop a grant opportunity for an accredited re-
search university that has demonstrated it can deliver two evi-
dence-based complementary educational programs that address
both the needs of next generation community violence intervention
leaders and law enforcement.
Human Trafficking Victim Services.—The Committee recognizes
the critical importance of continued robust Federal support for life-
saving victim services for sex and labor trafficking survivors. Fed-
erally funded victim services stabilize and encourage survivors to
report trafficking crimes and to participate as effective witnesses in
related investigations and prosecutions. The Committee remains
committed to ensuring adequate Federal resources are available to
support victims of human trafficking, regardless of immigration
status, as authorized under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act
(22 U.S.C. 7105(b)(1)(B)(i)). Therefore, the Committee directs DOJ
to provide uninterrupted Federal resources for comprehensive serv-
ices for human trafficking survivors.
Byrne Discretionary Grants.—The Committee provides
$152,146,000 for Byrne discretionary grants to prevent crime, im-
prove the criminal justice system, provide victim services, and
other related activities. The Committee directs OJP to provide the
funding for the projects listed in the table titled, ‘‘Congressionally

128
Directed Spending’’ at the end of this report in the corresponding
amounts.
JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $375,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 380,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $380,000,000 for ju-
venile justice programs. The recommendation is $5,000,000 above
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee strongly supports a comprehensive approach of
substantial funding for a robust portfolio of programs that work to
improve the lives of the youth in our communities. Title II State
Formula and Title V Juvenile Delinquency Prevention grants are
the backbone of programs assisting State and local agencies in pre-
venting juvenile delinquency and ensuring that youth who are in
contact with the juvenile justice system are treated fairly. Com-
bined with other critical programs like youth mentoring, the Com-
mittee believes that a balanced level of programming is the way to
best help at-risk and vulnerable youth and their families.
The Committee encourages OJJDP to review its suite of grant
programs in order to offer services and programs for children and
youth who have experienced complex trauma.
The Committee’s recommendations are displayed in the following

ming requirements of section 505 of this act.
Victims of Child Abuse Act.—The Committee’s recommendation
provides $43,000,000 for the various programs authorized under
the Victims of Child Abuse Act (Public Law 101–647) and directs
OJJDP to ensure that not less than 90 percent of the grants
awarded are for the purposes of developing and maintaining child
advocacy centers [CAC], including training and accreditation. The
Committee further directs OJJDP to ensure the funds intended to
support local CACs are used efficiently with the highest percentage

129
possible of Federal funding expended for local CAC organizational
capacity, which is essential for the effective support of imple-
menting the multidisciplinary response to child abuse investiga-
tion, prosecution, and intervention services.
The Committee continues to support efforts by CACs to use their
unique model and expertise to help military installations address
cases of child abuse, and again provides $1,000,000 from within the
funds provided to continue to support a pilot project to identify, de-
velop, and operationalize best practices. As this effort has been
funded since fiscal year 2017, the Committee directs OJJDP to re-
port on the status of this pilot, including the locations of CACs and
military installations working together, the number of children
served through these partnerships, and lessons learned from this
pilot program.
The Committee further directs OJJDP to coordinate with the De-
partment of Defense on the implementation of recommendations
made in GAO’s report on ‘‘Increased Guidance and Collaboration
Needed to Improve DoD’s Tracking and Response to Child Abuse’’
(GAO–20–110), including national agreements between CACs and
each military service.
Youth Mentoring Grants.—To support the critical work of na-
tional, regional, and local organizations in nurturing and men-
toring at-risk children and youth, the Committee recommends
$105,000,000 for competitive, peer-reviewed youth mentoring
grants, of which $16,500,000 is for helping youth impacted by sub-
stance abuse, including opioids and methamphetamine. The Com-
mittee expects that the OJJDP will take all steps necessary to en-
sure fairness and objectivity in the award of these and future com-
petitive grants. The Committee expects OJP to maintain OJJDP’s
expanded eligibility for local mentoring programs, particularly in
rural areas, unaffiliated with national mentoring organizations.
The Committee further expects OJP and OJJDP to collaborate with
mentoring stakeholders to expand youth mentoring services in
rural areas inordinately affected by substance abuse, particularly
heroin and opioids, and that are considered at-risk.
Arts in Juvenile Justice.—Of the funds provided for Title V Juve-
nile Delinquency Prevention, $2,000,000 shall be directed to the
Arts in the Juvenile Justice Demonstration Program as described
in fiscal year 2025. The Committee encourages OJJDP to prioritize
applications with arts partners who have prior experience in serv-
ing youth who are engaged, or at risk of engaging, in the juvenile
justice system as well as partnerships developed through authentic
collaboration with young people who have lived expertise or experi-
ence. The Committee directs OJJDP to provide a report, not later
than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act, on the use
of funds, grant recipients, and project purposes for fiscal year 2025
as well as plans for fiscal year 2026 funds including expansion of
the program and creation of best practices to replicate these kinds
of partnerships.
Girls in the Juvenile Justice System.—Girls in the United States
with a history of sexual and physical abuse, school failure, sub-
stance dependency, and involvement in the welfare system, and
who live in impoverished communities or are experiencing home-
lessness, face unique and complex risks. The Committee provides

130
$4,500,000 for the ‘‘Girls in the Justice System’’ grant program,
which will enable organizations, including nonprofit entities, with
a successful track record of administering prevention and early
intervention programs for girls who are most likely to end up in
the juvenile justice system, at a local or State level, to replicate
these programs at a national level. Funding for this program will
further support prevention and early intervention strategies and
curricula throughout the country, and place vulnerable girls on a
path toward success, stability, and long-term contribution to soci-
ety.
Children Exposed to Violence.—According to DOJ, nearly two-
thirds of children in the United States have been exposed to vio-
lence, which can impact development, health, and educational out-
comes, and perpetuate the cycle of violence and substance misuse.
The Committee provides $9,000,000 for grants to help children ex-
posed to violence through direct supportive services for them and
their families; training and capacity building for communities to
build sustainable partnerships to prevent and help children cope
with exposure; State and local policy reform to heal from trauma
through supportive services for the children and their families;
training and awareness-raising for communities on how to prevent
and help children heal from violence; State and policy reform; and
technical assistance for child and family-serving systems and orga-
nizations to help them better recognize and help families at risk for
violence.
Missing and Exploited Children Programs.—The Committee rec-
ommends $105,000,000 for OJJDP’s Missing and Exploited Chil-
dren Programs in order to support law enforcement agencies and
other national organizations that report and investigate missing
children cases and also investigate those who exploit children both
with and without an online nexus. The Committee directs OJP to
provide a plan for the use of these funds as part of the Depart-
ment’s spending plan for fiscal year 2026, which shall include in-
vestments in authorized national programs that serve as a resource
center and clearinghouse on missing and exploited children, task
force grants, and administrative costs for the Internet Crimes
Against Children [ICAC] program. The Committee directs OJJDP
to continue to ensure that all grantees report regularly on these
programs.
Within funds provided, the Committee directs that the Missing
and Exploited Children programs, including the requirements of 34
U.S.C. 11293(b) and the AMBER Alert program, are to be funded
at no less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted levels. The Committee
continues to recognize the diverse and unique challenges, identified
in the report to Congress directed by the Ashlynne Mike AMBER
Alert in Indian Country Act (Public Law 115–166), for the integra-
tion of State AMBER Alert communications plans and Tribal sys-
tems. Of the funds provided for AMBER Alert activities, $1,000,000
shall be directed to addressing State/Tribal integration consistent
with the findings of the report directed by Public Law 115–166.
The Committee addressed the increased tips of online child sex-
ual exploitation and abuse reported to the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children’s [NCMEC] CyberTipline in Senate
Report 116–127, as adopted by Public Law 116–93, and continues

131
the direction that OJJDP continue to provide for the development
of IT solutions to address both duplicative tips and law enforce-
ment deconfliction, so as to ensure that only high-quality informa-
tion is being provided to law enforcement agencies, including ICAC
task forces.
The Committee directs that within the funds provided,
$3,000,000 be for a competitive grant award program to increase
the technological investigative capacity, and associated training of
law enforcement, to support the development, refinement, and ad-
vancement of widely used investigative tools, methods, and tech-
nologies that address child sexual abuse material [CSAM], exploi-
tation, and sex trafficking, as previously directed in fiscal years
2018 through 2024. The Committee also directs that OJJDP ex-
pand efforts to provide advanced skills training for ICAC officers.
Advanced ICAC Skills Training.—The Committee directs that
within the funds provided, no less than $1,000,000 be provided to
maintain, strengthen, and enhance the ICAC Child Online Protec-
tion System [ICACCOPS] investigative tools that address CSAM,
exploitation, and sex trafficking. The funding provided will signifi-
cantly upgrade hardware, software, and other critical infrastruc-
ture components. These upgrades will increase investigative capac-
ity and effectiveness to keep pace with the evolving threat of tech-
nology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse. The Com-
mittee directs OJJDP to identify and provide a report on specific,
long-term objectives associated with this funding within 90 days of
enactment of this act.
The Committee also directs the Department to prioritize ex-
panded training on and use of the ICACCOPS program across Fed-
eral, State, local, Tribal, and military law enforcement agencies.
The Committee further directs the Department to coordinate with
the Department of Defense on the implementation of section 550D
of Public Law 116–92.
Statute of Limitations.—The Committee is aware that statutes of
limitation laws have prevented survivors of child sexual abuse,
child exploitation, and child sex trafficking from seeking justice
when their trauma causes them to delay disclosure of their abuse
until later in life. The Department is encouraged to explore ways
of supporting and encouraging States to review, pursue and revise,
or continue reviewing, pursuing and revising, civil and criminal
statutes of limitations laws and avenues for reviving time-barred
civil claims for child sexual abuse, child exploitation, and child sex
trafficking for adults who were a child at the time of the sexual
abuse claim in question.
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS BENEFITS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $274,800,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 236,800,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $236,800,000 for pub-
lic safety officers benefits. The recommendation is $38,000,000
below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The recommendation re-
flects a reduction of $38,000,000 in the Congressional Budget Of-
fice’s estimate of the payments for death benefits, which are scored

132
as mandatory. This program provides a one-time death benefit pay-
ment to eligible survivors of Federal, State, and local public safety
officers whose death was the direct and proximate result of a trau-
matic injury sustained in the line of duty or certain eligible heart
attacks or strokes. Within funds provided, $202,000,000 is for
death benefits for survivors.
The Committee also recommends $34,800,000, as requested, for
disability benefits for injured officers and education benefits for the
families of officers who have been permanently disabled or killed
in the line of duty.

COPS Hiring Program.—The Committee recommends
$206,000,000 for COPS Hiring grants to help State, local, or Tribal
law enforcement agencies create and preserve police officer posi-
tions and to increase community policing capacity and crime pre-
vention efforts. Hiring grants will have an award cap of $125,000
and require grantees to provide a 25 percent local match. The Com-
mittee encourages the COPS Office to focus on efforts to train and
increase the capacity of law enforcement agencies, executives, and
managers serving rural communities to enhance the use of commu-
nity policing practices and innovations in policing to expand the ef-
fectiveness of limited resources.

133
Tribal Access Program.—The Committee directs the COPS Office
to provide a briefing, within 30 days of enactment of this act, on
participation levels in the Tribal Access Program, as well as its au-
diting and compliance review processes.
Additional Technical Assistance.—The Committee urges the
COPS Office to provide increased technical assistance to applicants
who have not previously received COPS grants or otherwise indi-
cate that they are newly establishing community-oriented policing
programs.
Grants for Small and Rural Communities.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of the COPS Office in helping to staff and
equip State, local, and Tribal law enforcement officers. However,
the Committee is concerned about the administrative difficulties
faced by small and understaffed departments, especially in rural
communities, when applying for Federal grants. The Committee di-
rects the Department to review and improve the application re-
quirements for COPS Hiring Grants and other COPS Office grants
so that more small and understaffed departments can apply for and
utilize the funding. The Committee directs the COPS Office to sub-
mit a report, with 180 days of the enactment of this act, assessing
these efforts and describing the actions it has taken.
Addressing Racial, Ethnic, and Demographic Gaps in Law En-
forcement.—The Committee is concerned about racial, ethnic, and
demographic gaps in law enforcement agencies. In fiscal year 2024,
the Committee directed the COPS Hiring Program to give addi-
tional consideration to applicants that commit to recruiting officers
from the communities in which they will serve. The Committee
continues to support this effort.
Community Policing Development, Training and Technical Assist-
ance.—The Community Policing Development [CPD] program as-
sists State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies with the im-
plementation of community policing strategies. Programs funded by
CPD provide guidance on promising practices, develop and test in-
novative strategies, build knowledge about effective practices and
outcomes, and support new, creative approaches to preventing
crime and promoting safe communities. The Committee provides
$25,000,000 for CPD.
De-escalation Training.—The Committee provides $20,000,000
for de-escalation training programs and implementation of the Law
Enforcement De-escalation Training Act (Public Law 117–325). The
Committee directs the COPS Office to submit a report, within 60
days of the date of enactment of this act, describing initial imple-
mentation of that act in fiscal year 2024, program changes con-
templated for fiscal year 2026, and resources requirements for con-
tinued implementation in fiscal year 2027.
Collaborative Reform Model.—The Committee provides
$7,500,000 for the continuation of the Collaborative Reform Model,
which assists local law enforcement agencies to identify problems
and develop solutions to some of the most critical issues facing law
enforcement today, such as use of force, fair and impartial policing,
and improved accountability. Grant funding is to only be used to
assist law enforcement agencies that choose to engage in the col-
laborative reform process with the Department.

134
Regional Information Sharing Systems [RISS] Program.—The
Committee provides $44,000,000 for the RISS Program, to be ad-
ministered through grants. The Committee directs that the Depart-
ment assess no more than 4 percent of the total appropriation for
the RISS program for management and administration purposes,
so as to ensure sufficient funding is available for law enforcement.
Anti-Methamphetamine Task Forces.—The Committee’s rec-
ommendation provides $16,000,000 for the COPS Office to make
competitive grants to law enforcement agencies in States with high
seizures of precursor chemicals, finished methamphetamine, lab-
oratories, and laboratory dump seizures. These funds shall be uti-
lized for investigative purposes to locate or investigate illicit activi-
ties such as precursor diversion, laboratories, or methamphetamine
traffickers.
Anti-Heroin Task Forces.—The Committee reiterates concerns
over the dramatic rise of heroin use, deaths, and related crime in
the United States. The need for additional resources and training
to address these challenges is apparent, and the Committee created
the anti-heroin task force program within the COPS Office in fiscal
year 2015, continually providing funding in succeeding fiscal years.
The Committee provides $35,000,000 for the COPS Office to make
competitive grants to law enforcement agencies in States with high
per capita levels of primary treatment admissions for heroin,
fentanyl, and other opioids. These funds shall be utilized for drug
enforcement, including investigations and activities related to the
distribution of heroin or unlawful diversion and distribution of pre-
scription opioids, and for securing equipment commonly used in
opioid investigations. The Committee directs that funding can be
used for existing positions supported by prior Anti-Heroin Task
Force awards. Priority shall be given to drug task forces managed
and operated by the State that serve a majority of counties in the
State.
Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Grants.—The
Committee strongly supports efforts to protect the mental health
and well-being of law enforcement officers. Unfortunately, the
stress of officers’ work and stigma associated with seeking assist-
ance for emotional and mental health issues has led to an increase
in suicides for officers across the country. To address this concern,
$10,000,000 is provided for Law Enforcement Mental Health and
Wellness Act Program grants which shall be distributed as a com-
petitive grant program for State and local law enforcement agen-
cies to provide better training on officer emotional and mental
health, implement suicide prevention programming, and help offi-
cers seek assistance in receiving support services.
School Resource Officers.—The placement of law enforcement of-
ficers in schools can promote school safety and reduce the risk of
violence, but may also carry a risk that these officers could con-
tribute to a ‘‘school-to-prison pipeline’’ process where students are
arrested or cited for minor, non-violent behavioral violations and
then sent to the juvenile court system. This ultimately can lead to
academic failure and greater recidivism rates for these students,
and wastes community resources. The Committee directs that the
COPS Office continue to implement requirements and procedures
regarding written memoranda of understanding and training re-

135
quirements, including clear definitions of officers’ roles and respon-
sibilities on campus, for any COPS Hiring grant funds used to hire
school-based law enforcement officers.
POLICE Act.—The COPS Office’s Preparing for Active Shooter
Situations [PASS] program has supported training for more than
130,000 law enforcement first responders in a response protocol
adopted by the FBI as the National standard for special agent tac-
tical instructors. Many State and local police departments have
also adopted this response protocol as a standard for active shooter
response, ensuring law enforcement officers arriving on the scene
understand how others are trained to respond. The Committee en-
courages the Department to ensure that grants authorized under
the POLICE Act may be made available for primary schools, sec-
ondary schools, and college campuses, and that such training is an
integrated training with campus police officers and local law en-
forcement. The Committee further encourages the continued devel-
opment of e-learning resources to supplement in-person training.
COPS Law Enforcement Technology.—The Committee provides
$133,167,000 for grants for State, local, Tribal, territorial, and
other entities to develop and acquire effective equipment, tech-
nologies, and interoperable communications that assist in the pre-
vention of and response to crime. The Committee directs the COPS
Office to ensure that all equipment funded under this program
meets the requirements of NIST’s Office of Law Enforcement
Standards. The Committee directs the COPS Office to provide the
funding for the projects listed in the table titled, ‘‘Congressionally
Directed Spending’’ at the end of this report in the corresponding
amounts.

TITLE III
SCIENCE
OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,965,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,965,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $7,965,000 for the Of-
fice of Science and Technology Policy [OSTP]. The recommendation
is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
OSTP was created by the National Science and Technology Pol-
icy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–282)
and coordinates science and technology policy for the White House.
OSTP provides scientific and technological information, analyses,
and advice for the President and the executive branch; participates
in the formulation, coordination, and implementation of national
and international policies and programs that involve science and
technology; maintains and promotes the health and vitality of U.S.
science and technology infrastructure; reviews and analyzes, with
the Office of Management and Budget, the research and develop-
ment budgets for all Federal agencies; and coordinates research
and development efforts of the Federal Government to maximize
the return on the public’s investment in science and technology and
to ensure Federal resources are used efficiently and appropriately.
The Committee expects OSTP to be at the forefront of promoting
American competitiveness through scientific research and tech-
nology development.
Right to License and Copyright Articles.—Researchers should
have the right to choose how and where they publish or commu-
nicate their research, and should not be forced to disseminate their
research in ways or under licenses that could harm its integrity or
lead to its modification without their express consent. The Com-
mittee is concerned that in implementing OSTP’s August 2022
Memorandum to Executive Departments and Agencies titled, ‘‘En-
suring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to federally Funded
Research’’ agencies may be violating this principle. OSTP is encour-
aged to clarify its guidance to agencies and instruct them not to
limit grant recipients’ ability to copyright, freely license, or control
their works.
Sequencing RNA.—The Committee recognizes the release of the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report
‘‘Charting a Future for Sequencing RNA and Its Modifications’’ in
March 2024. The Committee notes that a number of the report’s
recommendations will require a unified strategy across the Federal
Government to unlock the full potential of RNA modifications and
address pressing societal challenges in health, agriculture, and be-
yond. The Committee supports these efforts and directs OSTP to
(137)

138
develop a coordinated plan for the relevant Federal agencies to im-
plement the report’s recommendations, which shall include collabo-
rating with industry and academic institutions, and to provide an
update as part of the fiscal year 2027 budget request.
Permanent Standard Time.—The Committee is aware of growing
interest in eliminating the twice-annual time change. The Com-
mittee encourages OSTP to coordinate an assessment of the impact
of permanent standard time on agricultural practices, human
health, and economic productivity.
NATIONAL SPACE COUNCIL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,965,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,965,000
The Committee provides $1,965,000 for the National Space Coun-
cil. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
The National Space Council provides advice and assistance to the
President on national space policy and strategy. The Council re-
views U.S. Government space policy, including long-range goals;
develops strategies for national space activities; and develops rec-
ommendations for the President on space policy and space-related
issues. The National Space Council’s additional roles are to monitor
and coordinate implementation of the Nation’s objectives in space
by executive departments and agencies; foster close coordination,
cooperation, and technology and information exchange among the
civil, national security, and commercial space sectors; and facilitate
resolution of differences concerning major space and space-related
policy issues.
The Committee directs the National Space Council to provide the
Committee with quarterly briefings on its activities, including its
current assessment of current and emerging threats to maintaining
U.S. leadership in space-based activities by the Federal Govern-
ment, industry, and academia and any associated plans and poli-
cies to maintain that leadership.

The Committee’s recommendation provides $24,899,679,000 for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA]. The
recommendation is $61,352,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
NASA was established by the National Aeronautics and Space
Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–568) to conduct space and aeronautical
research and development and to conduct flight activities for peace-
ful purposes. NASA’s unique mission of exploration, discovery, and
innovation is intended to preserve the United States’ role as both
a world leader in aviation and as the pre-eminent space-faring na-
tion. It is NASA’s mission to advance human and robotic explo-
ration, use, and development of space; advance and communicate
scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the Moon, the
solar system, and the universe; and research, develop, verify, and
transfer advanced aeronautics and space technologies.
The bill continues investments in human spaceflight that will en-
able travel to the Moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA-devel-
oped crew and launch vehicles; build a Gateway, landers, space
suits, and other infrastructure for Moon landings; enable the bur-
geoning domestic launch industry that is bringing cargo and crew
to the International Space Station and encouraging the develop-
ment of new destinations in low-Earth orbit [LEO]; and support
NASA’s science and technology programs. These elements should
be viewed as complementary pieces of a balanced whole. NASA is
the American people’s space agency. In advancing the U.S. national
interest, NASA should seek, to the extent practicable, to retain
public ownership of technologies, scientific data, and discoveries
made using public funds.
For Science, the Committee’s recommendation strives to keep
NASA’s near-term launches on track to continue progress in explor-
ing our solar system and the universe, understanding the Sun, and
observing our changing planet. The Committee expects NASA to
continue making progress on the recommendations of the National
Academies’ decadal surveys, now and in the future.
For Exploration and Space Operations, the Committee’s rec-
ommendation maintains support for ongoing activities in LEO, for
the production of the vehicles that will take U.S. astronauts to the
Moon and Mars, and for the continued development of systems that
will enable human exploration of space.
NASA is directed to continue providing the Committee with a
quarterly launch schedule, by mission, which describes the risks
associated with launch delays due to problems with the launch ve-
hicle, impacts of launch delays to other missions in the launch

140
queue, and a budget estimate of the anticipated carrying costs for
missed launch windows. Due to disruption of NASA activities and
missions, NASA shall also include any adjustments to launch win-
dows for delayed missions. This launch schedule should also be
made available for the public on the NASA website.
The Committee urges NASA to enhance oversight and account-
ability, as its acquisition management remains on GAO’s High Risk
List. To achieve its ambitious science and exploration goals, NASA
must address cost growth and schedule delays by prioritizing ade-
quate early funding for technology development and project man-
agement. NASA is directed to cooperate fully with GAO, providing
timely program data for reports to Congress after the annual budg-
et submission and semiannually thereafter. NASA shall also
promptly address GAO recommendations to mitigate performance
delays and cost overruns.
The Committee understands that NASA projects undergo major
reviews in addition to regular oversight throughout the year. When
one of these reviews results in changing the cost profile of a project
in the current or budget request year, the Committee expects to be
informed in a timely fashion so that its actions can consider the
most recent NASA analysis and expectation.
The Federal funding priorities for NASA set forth in this bill and
explanatory statement should not be interpreted as suggestions.
They are equivalent to any statutory requirement levied upon
NASA in this act. The Committee articulates the funding levels of
programs, where appropriate, in the form of tables and, if nec-
essary, supplements with explanatory statement language.

The Committee provides $7,300,000,000 for Science, which is
$34,200,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Science
account encompasses: Earth Science, Planetary Science, Astro-
physics, Heliophysics, and Biological and Physical Science. This
funding supports NASA programs that seek to answer fundamental
questions concerning the ways in which Earth is changing; the
comparison of Earth with other planets in the solar system and
around other stars; the connections between the Sun and Earth;
and the origin and evolution of planetary systems, the galaxy, and
the universe, including the origin and distribution of life in the uni-
verse. These objectives are assisted by input from the scientific
community through decadal surveys and are achieved through or-
bital and suborbital experiments, robotic flight missions, ground-
based scientific research and data analysis, and the development of
new technologies for future missions. NASA shall continue its
progress toward implementing the recommendations of decadal
surveys in Earth Science, Heliophysics, Planetary Science, Astro-
physics, and Biological and Physical Sciences.
The Committee rejects the mission terminations proposed in the
fiscal year 2026 budget request for Earth Science, Planetary
Science, Astrophysics, and Heliophysics. The Committee is con-
cerned by the plan to end 55 missions across Science, which was
driven by budget pressure rather than scientific value. The oper-
ating missions that are providing valuable scientific data should
undergo the Senior Review process. Meanwhile, missions that are
at the end of development and have been confirmed should proceed
to launch at the earliest possible date. The Committee is open to
collaborating with NASA to implement Senior Review findings.
However, mission cancellations without clear justifications may
hinder scientific progress and U.S. leadership in space.
Further, the Committee affirms the importance of NASA uphold-
ing its commitments to our international partners and expects fu-
ture budget requests to sustain funding to fulfill these commit-
ments, including for missions such as Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna and Rosalind Franklin ExoMars Rover.
Life Cycle Costs.—The Committee agrees that NASA ought to
strictly control development costs of NASA missions. However, the
Committee notes that it generally regards the development costs as
occurring through Phase D and not into Phase E. Operation of
NASA missions far beyond their originally planned life is some-
thing to celebrate, and NASA’s Senior Review process ensures that
agency operations funds are spent on scientifically productive mis-
sions.
Earth Science.—The Committee recommendation provides
$200,400,000 for Earth Venture Class Missions to support missions
under development while maintaining the cadence of future mis-
sions. Consistent with the National Academies’ Decadal Survey for
Earth Science and Applications from Space, the Committee ac-
knowledges the vital role of the Venture Class Missions program
in supporting the development of novel remote sensing technologies
and sustaining the scientific workforce. Further, the Committee
supports the competition selection of Earth System Explorers for
implementation.

142
The Committee notes that NASA supports airborne science plat-
forms for observing stratospheric conditions and the Earth’s radi-
ation budget, including the impact of the introduction of material
into the stratosphere from changes in natural systems, increased
air and space traffic, and solar radiation modification, and for cali-
brating and enhancing the value of NASA’s satellite and Earth
Sciences programs. Further, Earth Science missions could help to
understand the efficacy of carbon dioxide removal proposals, includ-
ing to track carbon stocks and carbon cycling in aboveground bio-
mass and coastal marine ecosystems.
Geosynchronous Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer
[GLIMR].—The Committee provides $7,000,000 to complete GLIMR
instrument delivery and mission requirements and directs NASA to
work with the commercial space industry to secure launch services
for the mission for a launch not later than the end of fiscal year
2027.
Landsat Next.—The Committee recognizes the critical impor-
tance of the Landsat program in providing continuous, high-qual-
ity, and accessible Earth observation data for scientific research,
environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster re-
sponse. The committee provides $183,000,000 for the Landsat Next
Mission and encourages NASA to maintain the current superspec-
tral three-satellite constellation architecture, with a launch target
by the end of 2031, to ensure uninterrupted continuity of the
Landsat data record.
Earth System Observatory.—The Committee underscores the im-
portance of addressing the high-priority Earth observation needs
outlined in the decadal survey, together with our international
partners. Therefore, the Committee rejects the proposed termi-
nation of the Earth System Observatory missions and supports
NASA recompeting these as cost-capped missions.
Earth System Modeling.—As part of NASA’s Earth system mod-
eling efforts, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies [GISS] plays
a critical role in advancing Federal research. Its contributions have
enhanced our understanding of historical climate patterns, sup-
ported assessments of current water resources and food security,
and improved predictions of extreme weather events. These models
provide substantial value to taxpayers by delivering reliable, long-
term data that inform decision-making across key sectors such as
agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and parametric insurance-
strengthening resilience, promoting economic stability, and improv-
ing risk management.
To sustain these capabilities, the Committee provides no less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for earth system modeling,
including GISS. Not later than 120 days after enactment of this
act, NASA shall submit to the Committees a comprehensive plan
for establishing the Integrated Earth System Modeling Institute,
that will leverage expertise across all NASA centers, including
GISS, to ensure continued modeling excellence, efficient use of re-
sources, and delivery of actionable insights.
Cryospheric Science.—The Committee encourages NASA to
strengthen its commitment to cryospheric sciences through sus-
tained support for ongoing missions, such as NASA–ISRO Syn-
thetic Aperture Radar [NISAR] and Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation

143
Satellite-2 [ICESat-2], and by advancing the development of future
missions critical to understanding polar dynamics, including the
Surface Deformation and Change [SDC] mission. Additionally, the
Committee recommends that the National Academies initiate stud-
ies for potential cryospheric science missions to be included in the
upcoming Decadal Survey for Earth Science, such as a successor to
ICESat-2, which is approaching the end of its observational phase.
Terra, Aqua, and Aura.—The Committee recognizes that the
2023 Senior Review for Operating Missions makes clear that the
Terra, Aqua, and Aura missions provide irreplaceable data to the
scientific community and that each spacecraft is nearing the end of
its design life. The Committee rejects the proposed termination of
these missions, provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level, and directs NASA to continue operating them as long as they
maintain scientific productivity. In addition, not later than 120
days after enactment of this act, NASA shall provide the Com-
mittee a transition plan to ensure the continuity of data between
the Terra, Aqua, and Aura missions and successor missions or fol-
low-on data sources for instruments, including a replacement for
the Microwave Limb Sounder.

quisition of commercial data sets for the scientific research and ap-
plications community, including through on-demand tasking of var-
ious data types, quantities, and qualities to meet research require-
ments.
Planetary Science.—The Committee is increasingly concerned
over the delays in announcements of opportunities in the New
Frontiers and Discovery programs and the NASA directed delays
on launches for missions in these programs. The objective of these
programs was to provide regular access to space for the planetary
science community for top priorities from the Planetary decadal
survey in the case of the New Frontiers program or more innova-
tive, high-value science from Discovery class missions. The Com-
mittee is concerned about the expected reductions to the scientific
community and workforce due to the irregular pace of missions in
these programs, which threaten U.S. leadership and innovation in
these fields. The Committee directs NASA to issue the Announce-
ment of Opportunity for the fifth New Frontiers mission and the
next Discovery mission no later than early 2026 and to return to
the launch cadence envisioned for these programs of a New Fron-
tiers launch every 5 years and a Discovery mission launch every
3 years.
High End Computing Capability.—The Committee accepts the
proposal to consolidate NASA’s High End Computing Capability
within Planetary Science. As a result, the recommendation trans-
fers $50,000,000 from Earth Science Research to Planetary Science
Research. In addition, the Committee supports the integration of
AI capability into NASA’s existing High End Computing program
and recognizes that this capability will likely lead to increased de-
mand for computing resources. Additional computing resources

144
may be necessary to enhance support for emerging technologies
and workflows and ensure NASA’s leadership in scientific and tech-
nological innovation and, if appropriate, the Committee expects
NASA to request additional resources as part of the fiscal year
2027 budget request.

Astrophysics Research program in supporting the development of
novel astrophysics observation technologies that lay the foundation
for future mission architectures. Additionally, a strong research
program maximizes the scientific value of space-based missions by
ensuring that the data collected through such observations can con-
tinue to provide new insights into the mechanisms behind
cosmological phenomena. The Committee also understands that
supporting these activities through extramural grant funding con-
tributes to the long-term viability of the U.S. astrophysics commu-
nity. As such, the Committee recommends $300,400,000 for Astro-
physics Research.

supports the timely development and launch of the Nancy Grace
Roman Space Telescope and provides $300,000,000 for the mission.
Recognizing the telescope’s transformative potential to survey bil-
lions of galaxies, detect thousands of exoplanets, and probe the
universe’s large-scale structure with a field of view 100-times larg-
er than the Hubble Space Telescope, the Committee encourages
NASA to prioritize the completion of all necessary integration, test-
ing, and assembly processes to enable a launch at the earliest fea-
sible date.
Habitable Worlds Observatory.—The Committee supports the
Habitable Worlds Observatory as recommended by the Decadal
Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics, ‘‘Pathways to Discovery in
Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s’’ [Astro2020]. In order to
cement continued American leadership in astronomy, the Com-
mittee provides $150,000,000 for the Habitable Worlds Observ-
atory. The funding should be used to increase the technical readi-
ness level of the coronagraph, ultra-stable segmented telescope,
and astrophysics instrument subsystems; finalize architectures;
construct hardware testbeds; and begin development of the observ-
atory with a target launch date in the mid to late 2030s. In addi-
tion, the Committee directs NASA to establish the Habitable
Worlds Observatory Project Office at Goddard Space Flight Center
to leverage existing expertise in astrophysics and segmented mirror
technology.
Astrophysics Explorer.—The Committee is encouraged by NASA’s
commitment to accelerate the cadence of Astrophysics Explorer
missions and to continue a new line of small Pioneer-class missions
that leverage advancements in low-cost platforms such as CubeSats
and balloons to support groundbreaking science. Such activities can
improve scientific understanding while simultaneously developing
the scientific workforce through increased research opportunities
for students and faculty. Therefore, the Committee provides
$230,700,000 for the Astrophysics Explorer program to meet these
needs.
Heliophysics.—The Committee provides $887,300,000 for
Heliophysics and recognizes that a greater understanding of our
Sun and the accompanying technologies developed for that purpose
will help to mitigate the hazards that solar activity poses to
ground- and space-based platforms that strengthen our National
security, economic competitiveness, and scientific prowess. The
Committee also notes that the priorities outlined below are guided
by the recommendations of the National Academies’ 2024 Decadal

147
Committee is increasingly concerned on the lengthening windows
between selections for the Heliophysics Explorer program and the
impacts this is having on the field and expects NASA to maintain
the cadence for the program.
Geospace Dynamics Constellation [GDC].—The Committee notes
that the GDC mission is a top priority of the two most recent
Heliophysics decadal surveys to improve understanding of the vari-
ability of the space weather environment surrounding Earth. The
Committee is encouraged by NASA’s efforts to reformulate the
GDC mission to address budgetary constraints while preserving its
core scientific objectives. To ensure the mission’s success, the Com-
mittee directs NASA to prioritize a cost-effective, streamlined ap-
proach, leveraging commercial partnerships, innovative spacecraft
designs, and existing technologies where feasible. Therefore, within
LWS, the recommendation provides $100,000,000 for the GDC mis-
sion with the goal of achieving a trailblazer launch in 2027, fol-
lowed by subsequent launches. Not later than 90 days after the en-
actment of this act, NASA shall provide the Committee with an up-
dated schedule and budget profile for GDC, including a plan to in-
corporate the Dynamic Neutral Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling
[DYNAMIC] mission and/or science goals.

Mapping and Acceleration Probe [IMAP] operations and maintain
operations for other ongoing missions, including the
Magnetospheric Multiscale [MMS] mission at $26,000,000. The
Committee directs NASA to maintain operations and scientific
analysis for MMS at a level that will achieve the phase two objec-
tive of night side reconnection events.
Space Weather.—In response to the National Space Weather
Strategy and Action Plan and the recommendations of the 2024
Heliophysics decadal survey, the Committee provides $47,500,000
for Space Weather. The Committee notes the relevance of NASA
Space Weather activities to safeguarding human health against ra-
diation during long-duration deep space exploration activities.
NASA should coordinate with NOAA, NSF, and the Department of
Defense to ensure that NASA is focused on research and technology
that enables other agencies to dramatically improve their oper-
ational space weather assets and the forecasts they generate using
data from those assets, including current and future ground-based
telescopes and instruments, such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar
Telescope.
Biological and Physical Science.—Biological sciences are integral
to future crewed Moon, Mars, and long-duration Low Earth Orbit
[LEO] missions. The Committee directs NASA to continue research
into understanding the effects of living and working in low- and
micro-gravity environments on humans and other living organisms.
The recommendation provides $90,000,000 for Biological and Phys-
ical Science, including $4,000,000 to continue the consortium estab-
lished in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law

GRAND TOTAL, Exploration.............................................................................................................. 7,783,000
The Committee provides $7,783,000,000 for Exploration, which is
$116,800,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Explo-
ration account funds the capabilities required to develop, dem-
onstrate, and deploy the transportation, life support, and surface
systems that will enable sustained human presence beyond LEO
and throughout the solar system. The Committee believes the Na-
tion deserves a safe and robust human spaceflight program to ex-
plore beyond LEO, including the establishment of a sustainable
lunar presence, and ensuring U.S. leadership in space.
The Committee remains committed to returning astronauts to
the Moon in 2027. However, spacecraft development and launch
delays are eroding confidence that the United States will be the
next nation to land humans on the lunar surface. In order to en-
sure a successful program with an enduring lunar capacity, the
Committee encourages NASA to take all actions necessary, includ-
ing enhancement or augmentation of its current architecture to en-
sure the quickest and safest return of Astronauts to the moon. The
Committee provides additional funding to afford NASA the flexi-
bility to accelerate the development of a Human Landing System
[HLS].
Human Landing System.—The Committee provides
$2,092,000,000 to fund the development of two independent HLS
vehicles, the execution of all contracted HLS missions, and the ad-
aptation of these crewed landers into heavy cargo landing services.
This investment aims to enable sustainable human exploration of
the Moon and lay the groundwork for future Mars missions. NASA
is encouraged to modify existing crewed lunar landing system con-
tracts as needed to support earlier landing opportunities. Addition-
ally, NASA shall facilitate accelerated schedules for lunar landing
systems by providing dedicated test facility resources, personnel,
and other appropriate support.
To ensure affordability and redundancy, the Committee empha-
sizes fostering competition among industry partners. For long-term
deep space exploration, including Mars, NASA is directed to lever-

152
age existing contracts and investments to develop robust deep
space capabilities. NASA shall pursue a regular schedule of human
and heavy cargo lunar missions to build infrastructure and exper-
tise, enhancing lunar exploration and scientific objectives.
Space Launch System [SLS].—The Committee provides
$1,307,600,000 for the SLS and rejects the proposed termination
following Artemis III and directs NASA to include an SLS option
in all free and open competitions for future Artemis launch serv-
ices. The Committee instructs NASA to maintain sufficient funding
for the acquisition of spare parts and long-lead hardware to ensure
a consistent annual launch schedule for the SLS and Orion space-
craft. This schedule is critical to prevent interruptions in the
United States’ capacity to execute human missions beyond LEO
and must be sustained until a commercially developed, human-
rated launch vehicle and crew vehicle are proven operational.
Orion Spacecraft.—The Committee provides $1,420,800,000 for
the Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle. The Committee rejects the
proposed termination of the Orion program after Artemis III and
directs NASA to evaluate the reusability of the Orion capsule and
weigh the status of commercial vehicle providers to support fre-
quent and consistent launch cadence for the future Artemis mis-
sions.
Gateway.—The Lunar Gateway, scheduled for launch in 2027, is
expected to play a major role in the Artemis program, serving as
a space station around the Moon used for critical communications,
scientific research, and as an astronaut habitation module. The
Committee recognizes the Habitation and Logistics Outpost
[HALO] module as a cornerstone of Gateway, essential for enabling
sustained human presence around the Moon and serving as a test-
ing platform for future Mars exploration systems. Given Gateway’s
critical role in advancing the U.S. mission to return to the Moon,
establish a pathway to Mars, and maintain strategic leadership in
lunar exploration, the Committee opposes the proposed termination
of the Gateway program and provides $100,000,000 for its contin-
ued development.
Exploration Extravehicular Activity [xEVA] Spacesuits.—The
Committee provides not less than $575,000,000 for the xEVA and
Human Surface Mobility program to maintain schedule for the
International Space Station and Artemis missions. NASA shall
only procure EVA spacesuits and services for NASA and inter-
national partner astronauts for Low Earth Orbit, Artemis and deep
space missions that meet the strict safety and mission criteria re-
quired under the xEVA program. Further, the Committee expects
that the HLS, Gateway, and Lunar Terrain Vehicle development
teams are coordinating with the xEVA program to ensure compat-
ibility. NASA is encouraged to explore competition within the
xEVA program to ensure redundancy and affordability.
Mars Exploration.—The Committee affirms that landing Amer-
ican astronauts on Mars has long been a central objective of
NASA’s human exploration program. The Committee strongly sup-
ports NASA’s renewed commitment to accelerate progress toward
this goal while reducing costs through the use of commercial inno-
vation, fixed-price development partnerships, and follow-on pro-
curement of commercial services. The ability to launch from Earth

153
and deliver large payloads to the Martian surface is essential for
enabling both crewed and robotic missions. Therefore, NASA shall
prioritize and expedite the development of commercial systems ca-
pable of performing entry, descent, and landing of human-class
cargo-and eventually crew-on Mars. Of the funds provided for Mars
exploration, priority shall be given to advancing these capabilities,
with the aim of launching an initial system demonstration during
the 2026 Earth-Mars transfer window.
Fission Surface Power [FSP].—The Committee continues its
strong support for Fission Power Systems. The Artemis Program
will need nuclear power to be successful in completely meeting all
of its Moon to Mars objectives and to compete with other nations
that are rapidly pursuing similar technological advancements. The
Committee supports designing, building, and testing the first ever
space FSP for deployment to and demonstration on the lunar sur-
face. Therefore, the Committee provides not less than the fiscal
year 2024 enacted level for the developmental of FSP.

Grand Total, Space Operations ........................................................................................................ 4,314,000
The Committee provides $4,314,000,000 for Space Operations,
which is $94,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The
Space Operations account supports the International Space Station
[ISS] and the supporting functions required to conduct operations
in space up to the full requested level. The ISS is a complex of re-
search laboratories in LEO in which American and international
partner astronauts conduct unique scientific and technological in-
vestigations in a microgravity environment. The Committee rejects
the proposed reduction in the ISS to minimal operations and di-
rects NASA to maintain the fullest possible use of ISS through end
of life.
International Space Station.—The ISS remains a critical plat-
form for scientific research, technological development, and inter-
national collaboration in low Earth orbit. The Committee urges
NASA to prioritize full utilization of the ISS’s capabilities, includ-
ing expanded opportunities for commercial partnerships, scientific
experiments, and crewed missions, to ensure the greatest return on
investment for the American taxpayer. The Committee directs
NASA to sustain the skilled workforce critical to ISS operations,
ensuring the safety and success of our continuous human presence
and missions in LEO.

154
Space Transportation.—The Committee fully funds the crew and
cargo programs at $1,816,000,000 and strongly supports continued,
regular access to the ISS and notes that this access supports na-
tional capabilities in Earth orbit and is vital to retaining U.S. lead-
ership in space. NASA shall maintain a regular cadence of not less
than two crew rotation missions per year and four cargo missions
per year on U.S. vehicle systems while the ISS is operational.
Suborbital Crew.—The Committee directs NASA to qualify U.S.
commercial suborbital vehicles and procure flights for NASA sub-
orbital crew. NASA must utilize Federal Aviation Administration
[FAA] safety regulations and licensing requirements to ensure safe-
ty and coordinate efforts to protect public health and safety. Addi-
tionally, NASA shall develop a qualification process with a clear
roadmap, enabling operators to complete the review within a rea-
sonable timeframe.
ISS Deorbit Vehicle.—The Committee provides sufficient funding
within Space Transportation to support NASA’s efforts to develop
and procure a deorbit vehicle to ensure the safe and controlled
deorbit of the ISS at the end of its useful life. The Committee notes
that the procurement of the deorbit vehicle should not result in a
reduction in support for other activities on the ISS.
Space Communications.—The Committee recognizes the critical
role of NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation [SCaN] pro-
gram in enabling safe, reliable, and high-capacity communications
and data relay for current and future science, exploration, and com-
mercial missions. The Committee provides $50,000,000 above the
fiscal year 2024 enacted level for the modernization of NASA’s com-
munications architecture, including upgrades to the Near Space
Network and Deep Space Network [DSN], adoption of commercial
services where appropriate, and the continued development and
demonstration of next-generation technologies such as optical com-
munications and interoperable systems.
The Committee encourages NASA to prioritize system resiliency,
cybersecurity, and capacity improvements to meet growing mission
demands and avoid potential bottlenecks that could jeopardize mis-
sion timelines or data return. NASA is directed to provide the Com-
mittee, not later than 180 days of enactment of this act, a report
detailing its long-term communications strategy, including pro-
jected network capacity needs, integration of commercial capabili-
ties, and required investments through the end of the decade.
21st Century Launch Complex.—The Committee notes that main-
taining multiple launch sites contributes to assured access to the
ISS for NASA, researchers, and industry. The recommendation in-
cludes up to $20,000,000 for NASA-owned launch facilities to fill
critical maintenance, capacity, and range safety gaps, including
$6,000,000 to upgrade the Bermuda Tracking and Telemetry Sta-
tion in order to support remote operation for government and com-
mercial launch users at the Wallops Flight Facility launch complex.
Rocket Propulsion Test Program and Testing Infrastructure.—The
Committee rejects the proposed termination of the Rocket Propul-
sion Test program and provides $48,200,000 to ensure that test in-
frastructure remains adequate to support the SLS and other pro-
pulsion development programs. In managing the program and its
infrastructure, NASA should prioritize facility and fixed infrastruc-

155
ture improvements specific to infrastructure that is shared among
users of the facility in a continued effort to attract and facilitate
commercial partnerships at NASA’s test centers.
Commercial LEO Development.—The Committee supports main-
taining the ISS as long as it can be operated safely. However, it
is anticipated that current commercial efforts to develop viable al-
ternatives will allow NASA to meet anticipated mission require-
ments using free-flying space stations in LEO before the end of the
decade. To that end, the Committee provides $250,000,000 for
NASA’s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations [CLD] program,
which is critical to fostering the development of commercial space
stations that will succeed the ISS. The CLD program is designed
to establish sustained U.S. access to LEO without requiring pro-
longed, direct NASA operation and funding, while strengthening
the Nation’s leadership in the emerging LEO economy.

156
to evaluate program performance, augment base grants, and com-
petitively respond to local, regional, and national needs.
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
[EPSCoR].—The Committee provides $26,000,000 for the NASA
EPSCoR Program and directs that no more than 10 percent shall
be used for administrative costs.
Minority University Research and Education Project [MUREP].—
The Committee continues to encourage MUREP to support pro-
grams that connect science, indigenous culture, and community, in-
cluding the integration of indigenous practices, at minority-serving
higher education institutions, including Alaska Native and Native
Hawaiian-Serving Institutions and American Indian Tribal Col-
leges and Universities. The academic institution or institutions
should be located in a State or States where the need for such in-
digenous-academic collaboration is present.
Competitive Program.—The Committee provides up to $5,000,000
within Next Gen STEM for the Teams Engaging Affiliate Museums
and Informal Institutions [TEAM II] program, also known as Com-
petitive Program for Science, Museums, Planetariums, and NASA
Visitors Centers. This competitive grant program supports inter-
active exhibits, professional development activities, and commu-
nity-based programs to engage students, teachers, and the public
in STEM.
SAFETY, SECURITY, AND MISSION SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,092,327,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,107,079,000
The Committee provides $3,107,079,000 for Safety, Security, and
Mission Services, which is $14,752,000 above the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. The Safety, Security, and Mission Services account
funds agency management, including NASA headquarters and each
of the nine NASA field centers, as well as the design and execution
of non-programmatic Construction of Facilities and Environmental
Compliance and Restoration activities.
Workforce Succession Planning.—The Committee directs NASA
to prioritize strengthening its civil service technical workforce to
meet strategic mission needs across all centers. NASA should in-
vest in recruiting and retaining the next generation of diverse sci-
entists and engineers and manage workforce transitions as retire-
ments increase. The agency is encouraged to use its Flexibility Act
authorities to convert term hires to permanent status and promote
knowledge transfer through mentorships and technical achieve-
ment-based career advancement.
Independent Verification and Validation [IV&V] Program.—
Given the anticipated increase of human space flight and activities
in orbit, the Committee rejects the proposed reduction to NASA’s
Independent Verification and Validation program. The IV&V pro-
gram provides rigorous, independent assessments of mission-crit-
ical software to identify and mitigate potential risks. Its work sup-
ports both human and robotic spaceflight programs, including the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites [GOES], the
ISS, the JWST, and the Commercial Crew Program.
NASA Special Projects.—The Committee directs NASA to provide
the funding for the projects listed in the table titled, ‘‘Congression-

157
ally Directed Spending’’ at the end of this report in the cor-
responding amounts. The agreement further directs NASA to per-
form the same level of oversight and due diligence as with any
other external partners.
CONSTRUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND RESTORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $300,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 275,000,000
The Committee provides $275,000,000 for Construction and Envi-
ronmental Compliance and Restoration, which is $25,000,000 below
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Construction and Environ-
mental Compliance and Restoration account provides for design
and execution of programmatic, discrete and minor revitalization,
construction of facilities projects, facility demolition projects, and
environmental compliance and restoration activities.
Unmet Construction Needs.—The Committee is disappointed at
the gulf between the amounts NASA requested for this account and
the cost of the projects identified as shovel ready and needed.
NASA is directed to include no fewer than the top 10 construction
projects that are needed but unfunded in its fiscal year 2027 budg-
et request, including any unmet construction due to aging build-
ings.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $47,600,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 47,600,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $47,600,000 for the
Office of Inspector General, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. The Office is responsible for promoting efficiency and
preventing and detecting crime, fraud, waste, and mismanagement.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Committee includes bill language regarding the availability
of funds for certain prizes. NASA is reminded that under the au-
thority provided in section 20144 of title 52, United States Code,
no prize may be announced until the funds needed to pay it have
been appropriated or committed to in writing by a private source.
NASA is directed to provide any written notification under sub-
section (h) (4) of that section to the Committee.
The Committee also includes bill language regarding transfers of
funds between accounts and the NASA spending plan for fiscal
year 2026.
The Committee also includes bill language creating a NASA Non-
recurring Expenses Fund.
The Committee also includes bill language to extend the avail-
ability of certain funds.
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,060,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 9,000,000,000

158
The Committee’s recommendation provides $9,000,000,000 for
the National Science Foundation [NSF]. The recommendation is
$60,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
NSF was established as an independent agency by the National
Science Foundation Act of 1950 (Public Law 81–507) and is author-
ized to support research and education programs that promote the
progress of science and engineering in the United States. The
Foundation supports research and education in all major scientific
and engineering disciplines through grants, cooperative agree-
ments, contracts, and other forms of assistance in all parts of the
United States. NSF also supports unique, large-scale domestic and
international research facilities.
RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,176,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,176,500,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $7,176,500,000 for
Research and Related Activities [R&RA]. The recommendation is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The R&RA appropriation funds scientific discovery, trains a dy-
namic workforce, and supports broadly accessible state-of-the-art
tools and facilities. Research activities contribute to the achieve-
ment of these outcomes through expansion of the knowledge base;
integration of research and education; stimulation of knowledge
transfer among academia and the public and private sectors, and
international activities; and bring the perspectives of many sci-
entific disciplines to bear on complex problems important to the
Nation. NSF’s discipline-oriented R&RA account includes Biological
Sciences; Computer and Information Science and Engineering; En-
gineering; Geosciences; Mathematical and Physical Sciences; Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences; Technology, Innovation and
Partnerships; Office of International Science and Engineering; Of-
fice of Polar Programs; Integrative Activities; and the U.S. Arctic
Research Commission. All of these disciplines are part of a bal-
anced whole.
The Committee’s fiscal year 2026 recommendation supports Fed-
eral long-term basic and translational research that has the poten-
tial to transform our economy and way of life. Private industry,
foundations, and non-profits bring additional expertise, resources,
and capacity to NSF-funded research. This can further accelerate
discovery and translation of research into products and services,
enhance the preparation of the future workforce to benefit society,
and grow the American economy. The Committee strongly encour-
ages NSF to leverage the Nation’s research communities through
partnerships and collaboration to make available infrastructure,
expertise, and financial resources to the U.S. scientific and engi-
neering research and education enterprise.
Technology, Innovation and Partnerships [TIP].—The Committee
recognizes NSF’s critical role in driving U.S. scientific and techno-
logical innovation and supports the TIP Directorate authorized
under the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation
Act (division B of Public Law 117–167). The directorate is a cross-
cutting platform to advance science and engineering research lead-
ing to breakthrough technologies, to find solutions to national and

159
societal challenges, to strengthen U.S. global competitiveness, and
to provide training opportunities for the development of a diverse
STEM workforce. As NSF works to incorporate the goals of TIP
into its research portfolio, NSF is reminded that the success of TIP
will be enhanced through investing in the necessary foundational
basic research provided by scientific disciplines across the research
spectrum.
Regional Innovation Engines [NSF Engines].—As part of the TIP
Directorate, the Committee provides up to $200,000,000 for the Re-
gional Innovation Engines, authorized under section 10388 of Pub-
lic Law 117–167, to create regional-scale innovation ecosystems
throughout the United States and help spur economic growth by
bringing together the science and technology research enterprise
and regional-level resources to promote long-term national competi-
tiveness. The Committee directs NSF to award at least 20 percent
of NSF Engines to institutions in EPSCoR States.
Scientific Facilities and Instrumentation.—A critical component
of the Nation’s scientific enterprise is the infrastructure that sup-
ports researchers in discovery science. The Committee strongly
supports NSF’s role in building and operating groundbreaking re-
search facilities, especially in areas that maintain or enhance U.S.
leadership in key disciplines. Investments to advance the frontiers
of research and education in science and engineering are critical to
the Nation’s innovation enterprise. The Committee expects NSF to
fully fund its U.S. scientific research facilities and instruments to
adequately support scientists and students engaged in sustained,
cutting-edge research.
As major research facilities transition from construction, funded
in the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction ac-
count, to science operations and maintenance, funded in R&RA, it
is necessary for NSF to accommodate this shift without impacting
the existing scientific activities. The Committee notes that as a re-
sult of the National Science Board’s ‘‘Study of Operations and
Maintenance Costs for NSF Facilities’’ the agency created the Fa-
cility Operation Transition pilot to enable this shift. The Com-
mittee expects that as major research facilities, such as the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory, move from construction into science oper-
ations NSF will continue to use the Facility Operation Transition
to allow the ongoing operations and maintenance costs to gradually
be absorbed into the managing division or directorate. Further, as
part of the fiscal year 2027 budget request, NSF shall provide a 5-
year operations and maintenance budget outlook for facilities that
have recently graduated from the Major Research Equipment and
Facilities Construction account.
The recommendation includes full operational funding for the
National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, the Na-
tional Radio Astronomy Observatories, the National Solar Observ-
atory [NSO], and the University-National Oceanographic Labora-
tory System.
Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope [DKIST].—The Committee pro-
vides not less than the fiscal year 2024 funding level for DKIST op-
erations. DKIST is the largest and most advanced solar telescope
on the planet and is a valuable resource for research and edu-
cational programs in solar physics. The Committee recognizes the

160
value of DKIST’s operations and does not support a reduction in its
observing time. As such, the Committee expects NSF to respect the
conclusion of the bottom-up operations and maintenance cost anal-
ysis and include the recommended amount in the fiscal year 2027
budget request to enable DKIST to operate seven days a week.
Astronomy.—The Committee expects NSF to provide appropriate
levels of support for operating its current facilities, developing in-
strumentation, and preparing for investments in future world-class
scientific research facilities. The National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine [NAS] Decadal Survey on Astronomy
and Astrophysics 2020 [Astro2020] outlines a comprehensive re-
search strategy and vision to maintain U.S. science and technology
leadership at the frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics for
ground-based instruments and observatories. The Committee there-
fore provides $50,000,000 for NSF to support the development of
next generation astronomy facilities recommended in Astro2020.
The Committee remains strongly supportive of a two-hemisphere,
U.S. Extremely Large Telescope [USELT] program with a robust
user support system and data archive to ensure broad U.S. commu-
nity access. This is consistent with the direction in division C of the
joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–42 and
Astro2020. NSF shall immediately advance both USELTs into final
design review, at no cost to the Federal Government. Further,
NSF, within the construct of the National Science Board approval
process, is encouraged to advance the design of these Astro2020
priority projects during fiscal year 2026 so that appropriate Major
Research Equipment and Facilities Construction funds can be in-
cluded in the fiscal year 2027 budget request. The U.S. ground-
based astronomy program has been the leader in this critical basic
science for more than a century, and the NSF has helped ensure
open access to scientists regardless of their academic institution af-
filiation. The USELT program will provide unprecedented opportu-
nities for scientific discovery and represents the only major science
program undertaken by the Federal Government with a 50 percent
cost share by non-Federal partners, including major U.S. allies. Not
later than 90 days after enactment of this act, NSF shall brief the
Committee about how the Foundation intends to implement this
congressional direction.
Solar Astronomy.—The Committee commends NSF’s ongoing ef-
forts to partner with academic institutions and the NSO to operate
the Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope [DST]. The Committee directs
NSF to continue working with the NSO and the academic commu-
nity to ensure DST and its associated instrumentation remain
available for continued research and educational programs.
Green Bank Observatory [GBO].—The Committee continues to
support NSF’s effort to develop multi-agency plans at GBO and
provides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level to support
operations and maintenance at GBO through multi-agency plans,
or directly through the Foundation. The Committee also supports
efforts to develop new radar capabilities at GBO in partnership
with other agencies such as NASA, the Department of Defense, and
industry.
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory [LIGO].—
The Committee rejects the proposal to close one LIGO detector,

161
which would completely undermine Nobel Prize-winning observa-
tions into gravitational waves. The Committee directs NSF to con-
tinue operating both LIGO facilities and provides not less than
$49,000,000. Further, the Committee supports the Foundation’s ef-
forts to invest in infrastructure and improve observational capabili-
ties at both LIGO facilities, including technology development for
the next generation gravitational wave detection network, as rec-
ommended in Astro2020 and in the recent report of the Advisory
Committee for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
Not later than 90 days after enactment of this act, NSF is directed
to brief the Committee regarding the plan to develop next genera-
tion gravitational wave detection network.
Neutrino Research.—The Committee is aware of the many impor-
tant scientific contributions being made by the South Pole neutrino
observatory IceCube, the current upgrade underway, and the initial
planning for the next generation facility IceCube-Gen2 as rec-
ommended in Astro2020 and the Particle Physics Project
Prioritization Panel. NSF should consider development activities
for IceCube-Gen2 and ensure an appropriate transition between
the IceCube upgrade and IceCube-Gen2 projects to leverage lessons
learned and knowledge transfer from one project to another to pro-
tect the specialized Antarctic workforce needed for both the up-
grade and construction projects. The Committee provides not less
than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for IceCube operations and
maintenance.
Earth-Systems Science.—The Committee strongly supports efforts
in Earth systems research and modeling, vital for understanding
interconnected physical, biological, and chemical processes shaping
our planet. These efforts are essential for advancing knowledge of
ecosystems, natural resources, and environmental dynamics to in-
form evidence-based policy decisions. The Committee encourages
NSF to prioritize investments in interdisciplinary research, ad-
vanced computational tools, data integration, and workforce devel-
opment to enhance the accuracy and impact of Earth-system stud-
ies and models.
Clean Energy.—The Committee encourages NSF, in collaboration
with the Department of Energy, to support meritorious research
into carbon dioxide removal technologies, such as: direct air cap-
ture, including early-stage application of sorbents, solvents, mem-
branes, and related components; terrestrial and biological carbon
removal; carbon mineralization; and ocean-based carbon removal.
Arctic Research.—The Committee supports NSF’s intention to
build upon the Navigating the New Arctic Big Idea and to expand
its support of research and infrastructure in the North Atlantic sec-
tor of the Arctic, which is critical for understanding how Arctic
warming will affect the environmental and socio-economic condi-
tions of communities along the eastern coast of North America.
This includes observations of emerging toxins and pathogens in the
Arctic and supports the continued funding of long-term observa-
tions during this critical time of Arctic warming, including atmos-
phere and snow observations at Summit Station and projects ob-
serving permafrost thaw and microbiomes. In addition, to maxi-
mize investments, the Committee encourages NSF to develop new
multinational partnerships to support research teams that address

162
pan-Arctic and global concerns linked to Arctic change. Further,
NSF should enhance support for Arctic-related student programs
aimed at broadening participation, including graduate dissertation
fellowships and the Research Experience for Undergraduate pro-
grams.
Permafrost Research.—The Committee encourages NSF, in co-
ordination with NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Department of Energy, and other relevant Federal agencies, to im-
prove existing government efforts to improve Earth system models
to better account for physical biogeochemical, and ecological
changes in permafrost regions, including extreme events such as
abrupt thaw processes, wildland fires, and floods.
EPSCoR.—In recognition that the success of our Nation’s re-
search enterprise relies on success in every State, the Committee
reinforces the requirements codified under section 10325 of Public
Law 117–167 that, to the maximum extent practicable, 17 percent
of NSF research funding and 20 percent of scholarship funding go
to EPSCoR States in fiscal year 2026. To help achieve these tar-
gets, the agreement provides not less than $255,000,000 for the
EPSCoR program. Within the amount provided, no more than 5
percent shall be used for administration and other overhead costs.
NSF is encouraged to support projects in EPSCoR States across all
funding initiatives and centers, including Regional Innovation En-
gines, Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure awards, and Science and
Technology Centers.
Further, the Committee directs NSF to support the existing ju-
risdiction EPSCoR offices, providing up to $750,000 annually per
State office. The State office will be responsible for supporting NSF
and EPSCoR grant applications, ensuring the continuity of
EPSCoR programs across their jurisdictions and working with the
jurisdictional steering committees on statewide plans and vetting
EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems [E–
CORE] and EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence [E–
RISE] submissions, to ensure they holistically benefit the research
goals and priorities of the entire jurisdiction. To ensure a smooth
transition from the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement
Program Track-1 program to the new E–CORE and E–RISE pro-
grams, the Committee encourages NSF to consider raising the max-
imum funding available for an E–CORE to $3,500,000 annually
and requiring that all E–CORE and E–RISE submissions from a
jurisdiction be submitted through the jurisdictional EPSCoR office.
NSF shall provide increased technical assistance to EPSCoR juris-
dictions that receive declinations and are encouraged to submit re-
vised proposals. NSF is also directed to more directly engage with
the EPSCoR community as the agency continues to implement the
‘‘Envisioning the Future of NSF EPSCoR’’ report, including regard-
ing how to achieve the NSF-wide funding targets included in Public
Law 117–167.
Technical Assistance and Outreach to HBCUs and MSIs.—The
Committee recognizes the important role that Historically Black
Colleges and Universities [HBCUs] and Minority-Serving Institu-
tions [MSIs] play in advancing scientific research and innovation.
To ensure that these institutions have access to the resources and
support needed to participate in federally-funded research, NSF is

163
directed to conduct technical assistance and outreach to applicants
from HBCUs and MSIs, including through maintaining the Grow-
ing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Equity and Di-
versity [GRANTED] program, in fulfillment of section 10524 of
Public Law 117–167. The Committee directs NSF to submit a re-
port on agency efforts to increase outreach and support for HBCUs
and MSIs not later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
Leverage the Power of Biology.—The Committee supports NSF’s
funding for research in genomics and biodiversity, and directs NSF
to continue to advance plant genomics research programs, to fur-
ther its work in crop-based genomics research, and to maintain a
focus on research related to crops of economic importance and other
elements of the bioeconomy.
VORTEX–SE.—NSF has been working in conjunction with
NOAA to build a full research campaign to study the unique char-
acteristics of tornadoes in the southeastern United States. The
Committee expects that future budget requests for VORTEX–SE
will include adequate budgetary resources for associated research
and instrumentation that will maximize the scientific return of this
ongoing research. As part of VORTEX–SE, the Committee encour-
ages NSF to look beyond its traditional research disciplines and
programs and to utilize collaborative opportunities for co-funding
grants that enhance understanding of the fundamental natural
processes and hazards of tornadoes in the southeast and to improve
models of these seasonal extreme events.
Quantum Science.—The Committee supports continued invest-
ment in quantum science as fundamental, transformative research
that can position the United States as a leader in emerging fields
of economic and scientific importance. The recommendation pro-
vides not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for quantum
information science research to support basic interdisciplinary
quantum information science and engineering research and human
resources development in all aspects of quantum information
science and engineering. Within the amount provided, the Com-
mittee recommendation includes $185,000,000 for activities author-
ized under section 301 of the National Quantum Initiative Act
(Public Law 115–368), and $50,000,000 for National Quantum In-
formation Science Research Centers, as authorized in section 302
of that act.
The Committee also encourages NSF to partner with institutions
of higher education, industry, and other Federal agencies in order
to develop the next generation of quantum computing workforce.
Such efforts could include quantum computing-related grants and
interdisciplinary research initiatives related to workforce develop-
ment activities.
Artificial Intelligence [AI].—The Committee believes it is impor-
tant to maintain leadership in AI and commends NSF for its sig-
nificant investments in this area. The application of AI and ma-
chine learning tools in research offers the potential to gain new un-
derstandings and accelerate discoveries. The Committee provides
not less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for AI research. Re-
searchers need to understand the appropriate uses of advanced
computing tools to target scarce compute resources toward appro-
priate research questions and computer scientists and program-

164
mers need use-specific training to optimize the use of advanced
computing tools in health research and other complex fields. The
Committee encourages NSF to develop effective AI education and
training pathways for the research workforce, including trainees
and senior scientists, to ensure the U.S. research workforce re-
mains at the forefront of scientific discovery. Further, the Com-
mittee encourages NSF to continue its efforts in workforce develop-
ment for AI and other emerging technologies, including education
programs for non-computer science students, with focused outreach
to community colleges, HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions,
Tribal Colleges and Universities, and MSIs.
National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource [NAIRR].—The
Committee commends NSF on the launch of the NAIRR pilot, in
collaboration with the Department of Energy and industry part-
ners, to provide needed access to computing resources to enable AI
innovation by researchers. The Committee provides $30,000,000 for
the NAIRR pilot and looks forward to seeing its continued evo-
lution. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this act, NSF
shall provide the Committee with a briefing regarding the progress
of the pilot, planning and needs for full realization of the NAIRR
as outlined in ‘‘Strengthening and Democratizing the U.S. Artificial
Intelligence Innovation Ecosystem’’ report, and budget expectations
for future years. NSF is encouraged to collaborate with community
organizations and open science institutions to ensure maximum
utilization of the resource.
Transparency, Interpretability, and Explainability of AI.—The
Committee encourages NSF to fund meritorious research and de-
velop technical methods and techniques to improve the trans-
parency, interpretability, and explainability of AI to better under-
stand why and how models arrive at their decisions, recommenda-
tions, and other outputs. NSF is encouraged to consider this as
part of the pilot program for Research in Rapidly Evolving, High
Priority Topics as authorized under section 5401 of the National
Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–283).
Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure.—The recommendation pro-
vides $50,000,000 for the Mid-scale Research Infrastructure pro-
gram and encourages the Foundation to make no fewer than two
mid-scale awards to EPSCoR States.
HBCUs Excellence in Research.—The Committee supports the
HBCUs Excellence in Research program, and the recommendation
includes $25,000,000 for the program. The program helps to ad-
dress NSF’s previously troubling track record of only providing sub-
stantial research funding to a small number of HBCUs. NSF is en-
couraged to support HBCUs with a Carnegie classification of R2 to
achieve the highest ranking.
Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences [SBE].—The Com-
mittee supports the SBE Directorate and recognizes the funda-
mental importance of the research it supports in advancing sci-
entific understanding of public health, defense and security, edu-
cation and learning, and the interface between humans and tech-
nology. The Committee provides not less than the fiscal year 2024
enacted level for the SBE Directorate. The SBE Directorate funds
more than half of our Nation’s university-based behavioral science
research but remains the smallest of NSF directorates. The Com-

165
mittee believes that behavioral science provides evidence-based un-
derstanding of human behavior and recognizes the SBE Direc-
torate’s unique role in funding this research and encourages NSF
to continue its support of these programs.
NSF is encouraged to support broad-based research in the SBE
Directorate to develop and publish recommendations, including
from researchers in the social sciences and ethics and technical
subject matter experts, on concrete and practical guidelines for how
organizations will and should deploy AI systems and identify limi-
tations and concerns about specific deployment of AI systems in
settings.
Research Security.—The Committee notes the importance placed
on research security in subtitle D of Public Law 117–167 and sup-
ports the continued implementation of the various provisions. The
Committee further supports NSF’s initiative to create clear guide-
lines that inform researchers and universities on disclosure re-
quirements pertaining to research security. NSF is encouraged to
continue to engage university and affinity groups to listen to any
community concerns and share information about NSF’s policies
and processes. NSF is further encouraged to explore ways to assist
less-resourced institutions on disclosure requirements and inter-
national talent retention.
National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics
[NCSES].—The Committee supports the work of the NCSES, and
encourages the NCSES to identify, compile, and analyze existing
nationwide data and conduct survey research to better understand
the National cyber workforce and to support additional NCSES per-
sonnel to ensure adequate staffing for this research.
Combating Sexual Harassment in Science.—The Committee
strongly supports NSF actions to combat sexual harassment in
science, including the implementation of the Combating Sexual
Harassment in Science subtitle of title V of Public Law 117–167.
The Committee encourages NSF to work in partnership with stake-
holders from across the science ecosystem with experience in field
safety and the prevention of sexual harassment in science as they
support this important work.
Entrepreneurial Fellowships.—The Committee supports the En-
trepreneurial Fellowships program within the TIP Directorate, as
authorized under section 10392 of Public Law 117–167. These
immersive fellowships provide scientists with training, lab space,
industry connections, and other resources to translate emerging
technologies from lab to market in areas key to global competitive-
ness.
Sub-Seafloor Sampling Program [S3P].—The NSF’s S3P is a fol-
low-on to the International Ocean Discovery Program. The S3P pro-
gram is the latest iteration of a scientific ocean drilling program
that NSF has supported for more than 50 years. Scientists have
collected more than 475 kilometers of core samples from expedi-
tions across the globe, representing a unique a valuable resource
for researchers and industry. The Committee supports the newly
awarded Scientific Ocean Drilling Coordinating Office and encour-
ages NSF to support a robust strategy to acquire new samples and
maximize the scientific utilization of current and future earth core
samples, including working with the current U.S. repository for sci-

166
entific ocean drilling cores on a long-term plan to build out analyt-
ical capabilities and educational outreach for the earth science com-
munity.
Uncrewed Aircraft System Technologies.—The Committee encour-
ages NSF to consider supporting meritorious uncrewed aircraft sys-
tem technologies research activities as authorized under section
10352 of Public Law 117–167, including a prize competition and
support for undergraduate and graduate curriculum development.
Wildland Fire Research.—The Committee supports NSF’s recent
efforts to advance interdisciplinary wildland fire science through
funding for initial ideation and development of partnerships. The
Committee encourages NSF to build upon this initiative by sup-
porting collaborative research grants in wildfire science, including
by leveraging NSF-supported environmental data infrastructure for
wildfire science and by partnering with other Federal programs
and agencies such as the Joint Fire Science Program and NOAA.
NSF is encouraged to consider the recommendations included in
the final report of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management
Commission, which highlighted the need for new mechanisms to
support research on scientific innovation and technology develop-
ment related to wildfires, post-fire monitoring and recovery, and
watershed health-related fire research.
The Committee encourages NSF to work with NAS to study pre-
dictive wildfire models. The study could focus on developing a sys-
tem-of-systems engineering framework, exploring robust sensor
technologies across land, air and space, and establishing a roadmap
for the maturation of timely predictive and decision support models
for a nationwide wildfire intelligence system.
Mathematical Sciences Research Institutes.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the importance of the NSF Mathematical Sciences Re-
search Institutes across the country, which provide important basic
research in multiple fields. The NSF is directed to continue sup-
porting this program.
Research Experiences for Undergraduates [REU].—The Com-
mittee was dismayed to hear about the cancellation of numerous
REU programs during 2025. The Committee is strongly supportive
of the REU Sties and Supplements program, as authorized by sec-
tion 514 of the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully
Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science [COM-
PETES] Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–358), and
provides not less fiscal year 2024 enacted level.
NSF Faculty Early Career Development [CAREER] Program.—
The Committee expects NSF to continue to fund the CAREER Pro-
gram, which provides financial support to early-career faculty who
have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and
education and to lead advances in the mission of their department
or organization.
MAJOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $234,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 350,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $350,000,000 for
Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction [MREFC].

167
The recommendation is $116,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
The MREFC appropriation supports the acquisition, procure-
ment, construction, and commissioning of unique national research
platforms and facilities as well as major research equipment.
Projects supported by this appropriation push the boundaries of
technology and offer expanded opportunities for the science and en-
gineering community. Preliminary design and development activi-
ties, ongoing operations, and maintenance costs of the facilities are
provided through the R&RA appropriation account.
The Committee’s recommendation supports the continued con-
struction of the Antarctic Infrastructure Recapitalization and the
Leadership-Class Computing Facility. The Committee encourages
NSF and the National Science Board to continue planning and
budgeting for the next generation of major facilities needed to en-
sure the United States maintains its scientific leadership.
The recommendation provides $90,000,000 for Mid-scale Re-
search Infrastructure. The Committee continues to support invest-
ments in Mid-scale Research Infrastructure, including the procure-
ment of larger mid-scale instrumentation under the MREFC ac-
count. Using MREFC for larger mid-scale projects will allow these
projects to benefit from the oversight that all MREFC projects un-
dergo. NSF is encouraged to award at least one mid-scale project
led by an institution in an EPSCoR State.
The Committee encourages GAO to continue its annual review of
programs funded within MREFC so that GAO can report to Con-
gress shortly after each annual budget submission of the President
and semiannually thereafter on the status of large-scale NSF
projects and activities based on its review of this information.
Antarctic Research Infrastructure.—The Committee is concerned
about pausing Antarctic field research and delaying the Fourth
Generation Ground Cosmic Microwave Background [CMB–S4] and
IceCube-Gen2 due to infrastructure challenges. Despite significant
support for Antarctic infrastructure upgrades at McMurdo, Amund-
sen-Scott, and Palmer Stations, the modernization effort is years
behind schedule, potentially extending another decade. These
delays risk U.S. leadership in Antarctic research, partner support
for new facilities, and progress in understanding critical Antarctic
changes. The Committee is also concerned about the lack of com-
munity and stakeholder consultation in these decisions. NSF is di-
rected to request sufficient resources to support concurrent infra-
structure upgrades, ongoing research, and major facility planning,
and to submit a comprehensive plan within 180 days, detailing
timelines, milestones, and funding needs for Antarctic upgrades,
research vessel deployment, and South Pole physics experiments.
Study on NSF Research Infrastructure.—The National Science
Board’s Vision 2030 States that research infrastructure ‘‘symbolizes
a nation’s commitment to S[cience] & E[ngineering], since it rep-
resents a significant long-term undertaking.’’ Within 30 days of en-
actment of this act, NSF shall update and make public the plan re-
quired under 42 U.S.C. 1862n–4 and shall contract with the Na-
tional Academies to report on NSF’s plans to strengthen research
infrastructure. The report shall analyze whether NSF is providing
the major research facilities to ensure the United States can con-

168
duct world-leading scientific research, how the NSF responds to
international partner interest in major facility construction part-
nerships, the adequacy of NSF’s capability to join existing partner-
ships, and recommendations for the current NSF process for invest-
ing in design and operation of billion-dollar class major facilities
could be improved, including new funding mechanisms. The report
shall be released not later than 270 days after the enactment of
this act.

fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The STEM Education appropriation supports a comprehensive
set of programs across all levels of education in STEM including ac-
tivities that unite school districts with institutions of higher learn-
ing to improve pre-college education. Other pre-college activities in-
clude the development of the next generation of STEM education
leaders, instructional materials, and the STEM instructional work-
force. Undergraduate activities support curriculum, laboratory, and
instructional improvement; expand the STEM talent pool; attract
STEM participants to teaching; augment advanced technological
education at 2-year colleges; and develop dissemination tools. Grad-
uate support is directed to research and teaching fellowships, in-
ternships, and instructional workforce improvement by linking
precollege education systems with higher education. Programs also
seek to broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in the
STEM enterprise and promote informal science education.
NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.—The Committee
supports the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, which
provides a stipend and cost-of-living allowance to graduate stu-
dents who are pursuing full-time, research-based masters and doc-
toral degrees in STEM education. The Committee provides suffi-
cient funding to support 2,000 new fellowships in fiscal year 2026.

169
Advanced Technological Education.—The Committee provides
$75,000,000 for Advanced Technological Education.
Broadening Participation.—The Committee recognizes that the
future of U.S. economic competitiveness and our Nation’s ability to
address national, economic, and health security threats depends on
sustaining a robust STEM workforce. As the demographics of our
Nation evolve, ensuring individuals from underrepresented commu-
nities across the country can enter and sustain a career as part of
the STEM workforce is essential to securing the workforce going
forward. The Committee is deeply concerned that entrenched finan-
cial barriers are increasingly deterring students, particularly those
from underrepresented communities, from pursuing STEM careers.
The Committee encourages NSF to evaluate the adequacy of com-
pensation for trainees and early career researchers supported
through fellowships, training grants, and research awards. NSF is
also encouraged continue supporting the recruitment, retention,
and advancement of underrepresented faculty at U.S. institutions
of higher education through relevant existing programs. The Com-
mittee continues to support the Broadening Participation in STEM
programs.
Informal Science Education.—The Committee maintains its
strong support for NSF’s informal science education program and
provides not less than $60,000,000 for Advancing Informal STEM
Learning. The Committee encourages NSF to coordinate and pro-
vide necessary support for investments in summer and both in- and
out-of-school time STEM education programs across Federal agen-
cies, including support for extracurricular STEM programs. The Di-
rectorate for STEM Education is further encouraged to continue its
NSF-wide efforts to support informal STEM education programs
and program providers, including support for high-quality profes-
sional development, and leveraging the research directorates to
support activities that match their respective content areas.
NSF is further encouraged to provide technical assistance to fed-
erally-funded STEM researchers and professionals who wish to en-
gage with afterschool, summer and other out-of-school time pro-
grams. This guidance should, at a minimum, include examples of
partnerships between programs and institutions; a resource for lo-
cating potential programs; and guidance on how to ensure an effec-
tive and productive partnership and measure appropriate out-
comes.
Hands-on and Experiential Learning Opportunities.—Developing
a robust, talented, and diverse homegrown workforce, particularly
in the fields of STEM, is critical to the success of the U.S. innova-
tion economy. The Committee directs NSF to provide grants to sup-
port the development of hands-on learning opportunities in STEM
education as authorized under section 10311 of Public Law 117–
167, including via afterschool activities and innovative learning op-
portunities such as robotics competitions. It is highly recommended
that any NSF grant recipient working with afterschool, summer,
and other out-of-school time programs have a plan for professional
development and longer-term sustainability beyond their specified
grant periods, such as through educator training and robust part-
nerships.

170
Transformative Education Research and Translation.—The Com-
mittee encourages NSF to establish a program for Centers for
Transformative Education Research and Translation as authorized
under section 10395 of Public Law 117–167. These centers could in-
strument large-scale digital learning platforms, enable multi-stake-
holder partnerships of institutions of higher education and State
and local education agencies to support collaborative research and
translation in K–12 STEM education innovation, and accelerate
STEM learning outcomes of students from underserved regions and
students of color. The Committee encourages NSF to collaborate
with the Department of Education and consider how these centers
could inform teacher professional learning and development in all
STEM disciplines, identify key metrics for scaling and sustaining
innovations, and establish practice-initiated partnerships.
National STEM Teacher Corps.—In order to prepare the future
STEM workforce and to create a scientifically literate public, the
Committee appreciates the importance of supporting and recog-
nizing outstanding STEM teachers in our Nation’s classrooms, re-
warding them for their accomplishments, and creating rewarding
career paths to which all STEM teachers can aspire. Therefore, the
Committee provides $25,000,000 for the National STEM Teacher
Corps pilot program authorized under section 10311 of Public Law
117–167.
CyberCorps: Scholarships for Service.—The Committee provides
$63,000,000 for the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program.
NSF is encouraged to increase the number of scholarships awarded
at participating institutions and to increase the number of institu-
tions that receive grants to participate in the program.
Enhancing Graduate Education and Training.—The Committee
supports measures that improve graduate student advising and
mentorship and funding mechanisms. The Committee recognizes
the importance of these matters to increase talent retention and
international competitiveness, including through the Innovations
for Graduate Education Program. The Committee encourages NSF
to develop methods that enhance graduate education, to set clear
mentorship standards in federally funded projects, and to study the
impact of funding models on graduate student productivity and
outcomes.
CREATING HELPFUL INCENTIVES TO PRODUCE SEMICONDUCTORS
[CHIPS] FOR AMERICA WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION FUND
Division A of Public Law 117–167 established the CHIPS for
America Workforce and Education Fund.
Microelectronics and Semiconductors Research and Talent Devel-
opment.—The Committee recognizes the efforts by NSF and the De-
partment of Commerce to build a skilled workforce to support
microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing. The Committee
seeks to ensure that research and development funding for the
microelectronics and semiconductors ecosystem aligns with NSF’s
goal of cultivating talent nationwide. To achieve this, the Com-
mittee encourages NSF to collaborate with HBCUs, MSIs, commu-
nity colleges, master’s degree-level institutions, and predominantly
undergraduate institutions with existing or emerging capacity in
microelectronics and semiconductors research. These partnerships

171
aim to significantly enhance these institutions’ capabilities and in-
crease the number of graduates from these programs.
The Committee allocates the funds according to the amounts list-
ed in the following table.

salaries, benefits, travel, training, rent, advisory and assistance
services, communications and utilities expenses, supplies, equip-
ment, and other operating expenses necessary for management of
NSF’s research and education activities.
The Committee continues to believe that NSF should include cri-
teria that evaluate how a grant proposal will advance our Nation’s
national security and economic interests, as well as promote the
progress of science and innovation in the United States.
The Committee reiterates its long-standing requirement that
NSF submit reprogrammings when initiating new programs or ac-
tivities of more than $500,000 or when reorganizing components.
The Committee expects to be notified of reprogramming actions,
which involve less than the above-mentioned amount if such ac-
tions would have the effect of changing the agency’s funding re-
quirements in future years, or if programs or projects specifically
cited in the Committee’s explanatory statement are affected.
Tribal Approval.—The Committee directs NSF to update its Pro-
posal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide to more thoroughly
address issues relating to the scope of Native-owned lands covered
by the policy, Tribal delegation of authority to Tribal organizations
to issue approvals, and the appropriate scope of subsistence re-
sources considered in the Guide, after conducting a thorough con-
sultation with Tribal nations, Alaska Native corporations, and Na-
tive Hawaiian organizations, and by inviting comments from other

vide basic legal services to disadvantaged individuals and the re-
strictions on the use of LSC funds.
LSC funds cannot be used to engage in litigation and related ac-
tivities with respect to a variety of matters including: (1) redis-

176
tricting; (2) class action suits; (3) representation of undocumented
immigrants; (4) political activities; (5) abortion; (6) prisoner litiga-
tion; (7) welfare reform; (8) representation of charged drug dealers
during eviction proceedings; and (9) solicitation of clients. The ex-
ception to the restrictions occurs in a case where there is imminent
threat of physical harm to the client or prospective client.
The Committee’s recommendation permits LSC recipients to op-
erate with boards of directors that have as few as 33 percent attor-
neys without requiring appointment by bar associations. LSC re-
cipients operating in rural areas, where there are not as many at-
torneys available or willing to serve on boards, stand to benefit
most from the flexibility that this provision provides. This provision
also improves the ability of LSC recipients to have fiscal experts,
community representatives, and others with diverse skills and per-
spectives on their governing bodies.
MARINE MAMMAL COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,500,000
The Committee provides $4,500,000 for the Marine Mammal
Commission. The recommendation is equal the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
The Marine Mammal Commission and its Committee of Scientific
Advisors on Marine Mammals provide oversight and recommend
actions on domestic and international topics to advance policies and
provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (Public
Law 92–522, as amended). The Commission provides precise, up-to-
date scientific information to Congress on issues related to the
safety of marine mammals.
OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $59,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 65,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $65,000,000 for the
Office of the United States Trade Representative [USTR] salaries
and expenses. The recommendation is $6,000,000 above the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. USTR is responsible for developing and
leading international negotiations for the U.S. on policies regarding
international trade, direct investment, and commodities. Its areas
of responsibility include all matters relating to the World Trade Or-
ganization; trade, commodity, and direct investment matters dealt
with by certain international institutions; industrial, agricultural,
and services trade policy; and trade-related protection of intellec-
tual property and the environment.
Within funds provided, the Committee continues to support
USTR’s accepting full financial responsibilities of the Interagency
Center on Trade Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement
(formerly named the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center) in fis-
cal year 2026.

177
Economy Act Transfers.—USTR is directed to continue isolating
Economy Act payments as individual transfers and to submit docu-
mentation of and justification for all Economy Act transfers, re-
gardless of amount, to and from other Federal agencies, to the
Committee not less than 15 days before such transfers of sums are
made.
Travel.—USTR is directed to provide monthly travel reports de-
tailing all trips outside of the United States, including the purposes
and costs of such trips. Additionally, USTR shall continue to pro-
vide the Committee with quarterly reports outlining the status of
ongoing trade negotiations, enforcement activities, and objectives
achieved for existing trade agreements.
USMCA.—The Committee directs USTR to provide quarterly ex-
penditure reports, by object class, no later than 30 days after the
end of each fiscal quarter, for funding provided to USTR by title
IX of the USMCA Implementation Act (Public Law 116–113). Fur-
ther, as the review period for the USMCA approaches in summer
2026, the Committee urges USTR to pursue changes that would
prohibit the People’s Republic of China from taking advantage of
the agreement, improve the agreement’s labor standards, and on-
shore additional manufacturing jobs. The Committee directs USTR
to consult will all relevant Congressional Committees during the
review period to ensure bipartisan, bicameral support from Con-
gress.
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.—The Committee notes the
ongoing interagency work to negotiate the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework. The Committee encourages USTR to secure commit-
ments that strengthen supply chain security for critical minerals,
pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients among na-
tions party to the agreement.
Annual Trade Agenda.—The Committee requests the President’s
Trade Policy Agenda submitted during fiscal year 2026 include an
explanation of how the administration’s trade policy objectives and
priorities support and advance the objectives of the National De-
fense Strategy and the National Security Strategy.
Examining Unfair Chinese Trade Practices.—The Committee rec-
ognizes that non-allied nations are becoming large exporters of
electric vehicles worldwide and is concerned that electric vehicles
from such countries will soon flood the U.S. market. Some Chinese
automakers are seeking to establish manufacturing plants in Mex-
ico and other strategic locations to sidestep U.S. tariffs. The Com-
mittee directs USTR, in consultation with other relevant depart-
ments and agencies, to examine non-allied nations’ non-market
policies and practices related but not limited to electric vehicles, in-
cluding industrial targeting, non-market excess capacity, direct
subsidies, low interest loans, loan forgiveness, targeted regulations,
and licensing arrangements, as well as policies that prevent U.S
auto manufacturers from competing in their markets on a level
playing field, and report its findings to this Committee within 180
days of enactment of this act.
Trade and Agricultural Exports.—The Committee supports ef-
forts to reduce foreign tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers for U.S.
agricultural exports, including the strong enforcement of trade
rules and regulations. However, the Committee is concerned that

178
trade actions resulting in decreased foreign market access for U.S.
agricultural products due to retaliation threaten to harm our Na-
tion’s farmers and ranchers. The Committee urges USTR and the
Secretary of Commerce to fully evaluate and consider the impact
foreign tariffs and other retaliatory actions have on U.S. farmers
and ranchers when negotiating with trade partners and in making
trade-related decisions.
U.S European Union [EU] Trade and Technology Council
[TTC].—The Committee recognizes the importance of the TTC as a
forum for promoting U.S. and EU competitiveness and prosperity
through increasing transatlantic trade, investment, and engage-
ment on matters related to critical and emerging technology. The
Committee awaits receipt of the joint report on the U.S. TTC, as
directed by the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public
Law 118–42.
Chief Innovation and Intellectual Property Negotiator.—The Com-
mittee notes that certain trading practices may affect prices of
pharmaceuticals for American consumers, potentially depriving
them of innovative drugs produced by U.S. manufacturers. The
Committee directs USTR to brief the Committee, within 30 days of
enactment of this act, on its implementation of section 3 of the Ex-
ecutive Order 14297.
Abraham Accords Trade Cooperations.—The Trade Policy Agenda
submitted during fiscal year 2026 shall include a plan to strength-
en and expand the Abraham Accords through the use of existing
Free Trade Agreements, Trade and Investment Framework Agree-
ments, Foreign Trade Zones, and Qualified Industrial Zones.
Tariff Negotiations.—The Committee is aware of public reports
that dozens of countries have been in contact with the United
States regarding trade negotiations but is concerned that the ad-
ministration has not shared which countries have solicited negotia-
tions, commenced negotiations, or both, with the United States.
USTR is directed to brief the Committee, within 45 days of enact-
ment of this act, on which countries have solicited negotiations re-
garding tariffs, detailed information on any agreements reached in
response, and the status of active negotiations.
TRADE ENFORCEMENT TRUST FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $15,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $15,000,000 for the
Trade Enforcement Trust Fund as authorized under the Trade Fa-
cilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–
125). The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
Trade Enforcement Trust Fund.—The Committee supports efforts
to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and to increase com-
pliance of U.S. trade partners. The Committee directs USTR, as
part of its fiscal year 2026 spending plan, to provide a breakdown
of expenses for the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund’s activities.

179
STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,640,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,640,000
The Committee’s recommendation provides $7,640,000 for the
State Justice Institute [SJI]. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
SJI was created in 1984 to further the development and adoption
of improved judicial administration in State courts.
Legal Deserts.—The Committee is concerned that many areas of
the country have too few practicing attorneys to ensure that liti-
gants in these areas can retain counsel without taking burdensome
steps. The American Bar Association [ABA] has referred to these
areas as ‘‘legal deserts.’’ Using 2020 data, the ABA found that
1,300 counties in the United States have fewer than 1 attorney per
1,000 residents, and many have no attorneys. As a result, many
litigants appear in court without representation. Legal deserts may
hit juveniles hardest because they are among the most vulnerable
participants in the legal system. The Committee urges SJI to ex-
amine the issues related to legal deserts and to prepare a report,
within 180 days of enactment of this act, with recommendations to
address legal deserts.

TITLE V
GENERAL PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSIONS OF FUNDS)
The Committee recommends the following general provisions for
the departments, agencies, offices, and commissions funded in the
accompanying act. Similar provisions were carried in the fiscal year
2025 act.
Section 501 prohibits the use of appropriations for certain pub-
licity and propaganda purposes.
Section 502 prohibits any appropriations contained in this bill
from remaining available for obligation beyond the current fiscal
year unless expressly provided.
Section 503 limits funds for certain consulting purposes.
Section 504 provides that, should any provision of the bill be held
to be invalid, the remainder of the act would not be affected.
Section 505 stipulates the policy and procedures by which fund-
ing available to the agencies funded under this bill may be repro-
grammed for other purposes.
Section 506 provides for a penalty for persons found to have
falsely mislabeled products.
Section 507 requires agencies to provide quarterly reports to the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees regarding unobli-

Section 509 limits funds for the sale or export of tobacco or to-
bacco products.
Section 510 stipulates obligation of receipts and the use of cer-
tain funds for victim services available under the Crime Victims
Fund.
Of the funds set aside for Indian Tribes, the Committee expects
that the Office for Victims of Crime [OVC] will award such funds
to Indian Tribes that have not been designated high-risk grantees
by the DOJ and that comply with grant application requirements.
OVC is expected to provide instructional model grant applications
and other guidance to aid Tribes in preparing grant applications.
Grant-receiving Tribes will need to certify that grant funds will not
be used to supplant funds otherwise available for Tribal victim as-
sistance so that OVC can ensure grant accountability and that
grants are being used effectively to improve services for Tribal vic-
tims of crime.
Section 511 prohibits the use of DOJ funds for programs that dis-
criminate against, denigrate, or otherwise undermine the religious
beliefs of students participating in such programs.
Section 512 limits transfers of funds between agencies.
(180)

181
Section 513 requires the Inspectors General of the Departments
of Commerce and Justice, NASA, NSF, and LSC to conduct reviews
of activities funded in this bill and requires certifications regarding

sia, Iran, and North Korea.
Section 515 prohibits the use of funds to support or justify the
use of torture.

$5,000,000 unless the prospective contractor or grantee has cer-
tified in writing that he or she has filed all Federal tax returns,
has not been convicted of a criminal offense under the IRS Code
of 1986, and has no unpaid Federal tax assessment.
Section 521 specifies rescissions of prior appropriations.
Section 522 prohibits the use of funds to purchase first class or
premium airline travel in contravention of current regulations.

undisbursed balances.
Section 525 requires, when practicable, the use of funds in this

Section 526 prohibits the use of funds by NASA, OSTP, or the
National Space Council to engage in bilateral activities with China
or a Chinese-owned company or effectuate the hosting of official
Chinese visitors at certain facilities unless the activities are au-
thorized by subsequent legislation or NASA, OSTP, or the National
Space Council have made a certification pursuant to subsections (c)
and (d) of this section.
Section 527 prohibits the use of funds to establish or maintain
a computer network that does not block pornography, except for
law enforcement purposes.
Section 528 requires departments and agencies funded in this
bill to submit spending plans to the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees within 45 days of enactment of this act.
Section 529 prohibits funds to pay for award or incentive fees for
contractors with below satisfactory performance or performance
that fails to meet the basic requirements of the contract. The Com-

182
mittee directs any head of any executive branch department, agen-
cy, board, commission, or office funded by this bill to require that
all contracts within their purview that provide award fees to link
such fees to successful acquisition outcomes, specifying the terms
of cost, schedule, and performance.
Section 530 prohibits the use of funds by the Department of Jus-
tice or the Drug Enforcement Administration in contravention of a

ary 1, 2011, on the basis that the shotgun was not particularly
suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.
Section 537 prohibits the use of funds to implement the Arms
Trade Treaty until the Senate approves a resolution of ratification
for the Treaty.
Section 538 includes language regarding detainees held at Guan-
tanamo Bay.
Section 539 includes language regarding facilities for housing de-
tainees held at Guantanamo Bay.
Section 540 provides that the Department of Commerce and De-
partment of Justice may utilize funding to provide payments pur-
suant to section 901(i)(2) of title IX of division J of the Further
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.
Section 541 sets certain requirements for the allocations of funds
related to the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (Public Law 117–
167).
Section 542 is a new provision regarding indirect costs.

183
COMPLIANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 7, RULE XVI OF THE
STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE
Rule XVI, paragraph 7 requires that every report on a general
appropriation bill filed by the Committee must identify items of ap-
propriation not made to carry out the provisions of an existing law,
a treaty stipulation, or an act or resolution previously passed by
the Senate during that session.
The Committee recommends funding for the following programs
or activities that currently lack an authorization for fiscal year
2026, either in whole or in part, and therefore fall under this rule:

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process. For each
item, a Member is required to provide a certification that neither
the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has a pecuniary
interest in such congressionally directed spending item. Such cer-
tifications are available to the public on the website of the Senate
Committee on Appropriations (https://www.appropriations.senate.
gov/congressionally-directed-spending requests). Following is a list
of congressionally directed spending items included in the Senate
recommendation discussed in this report, along with the name of
each Senator who submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdic-
tion for each item so identified. Neither the Committee rec-
ommendation nor this report contains any limited tax benefits or
limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.
