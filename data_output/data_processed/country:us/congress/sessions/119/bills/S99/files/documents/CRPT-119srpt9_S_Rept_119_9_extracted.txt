STRENGTHENING SUPPORT FOR AMERICAN
MANUFACTURING ACT
MARCH31, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 99]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 99) to require the Secretary of Com-
merce to produce a report that provides recommendations to im-
prove the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of Department of
Commerce programs related to supply chain resilience and manu-
facturing and industrial innovation, and for other purposes, having
considered the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment
and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manu-
facturing Act, is to require the Secretary of Commerce to produce
a report that provides recommendations to improve the effective-
ness, efficiency, and impact of Department of Commerce programs
related to supply chain resilience and manufacturing and industrial
innovation, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
While policymakers in the 2010s began raising concerns around
maintaining the United States’ competitive edge, especially
through innovation in advanced manufacturing technologies, the
COVID–19 pandemic laid bare that U.S. domestic manufacturing
faces several challenges, including heavy reliance on global supply
chains, labor shortages, high production costs, and outdated infra-

structure. Congress has acknowledged this reliance represents an
economic security liability for the country. Globalization and the
drive to provide low-priced goods to American consumers contrib-
uted to offshoring beginning in the 1990s, making the United
States vulnerable to disruptions from events like pandemics or geo-
political tensions.
Manufacturers in the United States account for a little over 10
percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), employing about 12
million employees throughout the United States.1 In 2017, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office released a report identifying 58 pro-
grams across 11 different Federal agencies that serve U.S. manu-
facturing, most housed within the Department of Commerce. Sen-
ators have expressed concern that the high number of programs
may present a barrier to manufacturers knowing about and access-
ing the resources these programs provide.2
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 99 would commission a report produced by the National Acad-
emy of Public Administration (NAPA) that would do the following:
• Identify offices and bureaus of the Department of Commerce
with responsibilities related to critical supply chain resilience
and manufacturing and industrial innovation.
• Identify the duties, responsibilities, programs, and expertise of
these offices and bureaus.
• Identify and assess the purpose, statutory authority, effective-
ness, efficiency, and limitations of each covered office and bu-
reau.
• Identify gaps between offices with duplicative duties, respon-
sibilities, programs, and expertise.
• Provide recommendations, including potential legislative ac-
tion, to improve the offices’ and bureaus’ work and coordination
with other offices.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 99 was introduced on January 15, 2025, by Senator Peters (for
himself and Senator Blackburn) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On Feb-
ruary 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and,
by voice vote, ordered S. 99 reported favorably without amendment.
118th Congress
S. 2116, the Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing
Act, was introduced on June 22, 2023, by Senator Peters (for him-
self and Senator Blackburn) and was referred to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On July 27,
2023, the Committee met in an open Executive Session and, by
voice vote, ordered S. 2116 reported favorably with an amendment
(in the nature of a substitute). On April 30, 2024, S. 2116 passed
the Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent, and that

H.R. 8657, a House companion bill to S. 2116, was introduced on
June 7, 2024, by Representative Higgins and was referred to the
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representa-
tives.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.
S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-

mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-
facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included
in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.

S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in

Section 4:
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticker issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-
funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would
occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most

6
ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited
from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs and revenues: David
Hughes; Mandates: Grace Watson and Rachel Austin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 99, as reported, would not create any new programs or impose
any new regulatory requirements, and, therefore, would not subject
any individuals or businesses to new regulations.

Economic Impact
S. 99, as reported, is not expected to have a negative impact on
the Nation’s economy.
Privacy
S. 99, as reported, would have no impact on the personal privacy
of individuals.
Paperwork
The legislation would not increase paperwork requirements for
private individuals or businesses. The bill would require one report
from the Federal Government. The report would be from the Sec-
retary of the Department of Commerce, contracted through NAPA,
within 1 year after the enactment of this legislation, on rec-
ommendations to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact
of the offices and bureaus of the Department of Commerce with re-
sponsibilities related to critical supply chain resilience and manu-
facturing industrial innovation. Within 180 days after the Sec-
retary produces the report, the Secretary shall submit the report,
along with recommendations for potential legislative action, to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
Representatives.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 5:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 6:
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act’’.

Section 7:
Section 2. Definitions
This section would define the terms, ‘‘appropriate committees of
Congress’’, ‘‘covered offices and bureaus’’, ‘‘critical supply chain’’,
‘‘critical supply chain resilience’’, ‘‘manufacturing and industrial in-
novation’’, and ‘‘Secretary’’.

Section 8:
Section 3. Study relating to manufacturing programs of the Depart-
ment of Commerce
This section would require NAPA, through a contract with the
Secretary of Commerce’s office, to produce a report that would
identify offices and bureaus of the Department of Commerce en-
gaged in issues related to critical supply chain resilience and man-
ufacturing, and outline recommendations to improve those offices’
and bureaus’ effectiveness.
No later than 180 days after the Secretary of Commerce produces
the report, the Secretary would be required to submit the report,
along with recommendations for potential legislative action, to the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

bill was received in the House and held at the desk on May 1,
2024.
H.R. 8657, a House companion bill to S. 2116, was introduced on
June 7, 2024, by Representative Higgins and was referred to the
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representa-
tives.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.
S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-

mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-
facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included
in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.

S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticker issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-
funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would
occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most

ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited
from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs and revenues: David
Hughes; Mandates: Grace Watson and Rachel Austin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

Economic Impact
S. 99, as reported, is not expected to have a negative impact on
the Nation’s economy.
Privacy
S. 99, as reported, would have no impact on the personal privacy
of individuals.
Paperwork
The legislation would not increase paperwork requirements for
private individuals or businesses. The bill would require one report
from the Federal Government. The report would be from the Sec-
retary of the Department of Commerce, contracted through NAPA,
within 1 year after the enactment of this legislation, on rec-
ommendations to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact
of the offices and bureaus of the Department of Commerce with re-
sponsibilities related to critical supply chain resilience and manu-
facturing industrial innovation. Within 180 days after the Sec-
retary produces the report, the Secretary shall submit the report,
along with recommendations for potential legislative action, to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
Representatives.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act’’.
Section 2. Definitions
This section would define the terms, ‘‘appropriate committees of
Congress’’, ‘‘covered offices and bureaus’’, ‘‘critical supply chain’’,
‘‘critical supply chain resilience’’, ‘‘manufacturing and industrial in-
novation’’, and ‘‘Secretary’’.
Section 3. Study relating to manufacturing programs of the Depart-
ment of Commerce
This section would require NAPA, through a contract with the
Secretary of Commerce’s office, to produce a report that would
identify offices and bureaus of the Department of Commerce en-
gaged in issues related to critical supply chain resilience and man-
ufacturing, and outline recommendations to improve those offices’
and bureaus’ effectiveness.
No later than 180 days after the Secretary of Commerce produces
the report, the Secretary would be required to submit the report,
along with recommendations for potential legislative action, to the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
