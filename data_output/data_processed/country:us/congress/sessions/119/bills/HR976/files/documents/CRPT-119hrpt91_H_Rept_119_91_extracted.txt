Section 3:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘1071 Repeal to Protect Small Business Lending
Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as added by section
1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, im-
poses data collection and reporting requirements on financial institutions re-
garding small business loans.
(2) These requirements have resulted in increased compliance costs for finan-
cial institutions, potentially reducing access to credit for small businesses.
(3) The regulatory burdens created by these requirements disproportionately
impact smaller financial institutions, such as community banks and credit
unions, which are critical to small business lending.
(4) Repealing these requirements will reduce regulatory barriers and support
greater access to credit for small businesses.
SEC. 3. REPEAL OF THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C.
1691c–2) is repealed.

AMENDMENTS.—The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection

(B) by striking section 1071.
(2) EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT AMENDMENTS.—The Equal Credit Oppor-
tunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.) is amended—

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 4, 2025, by Representative Williams,
H.R. 976, the 1071 Repeal to Protect Small Business Lending Act,
would repeal Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act that mandates the collection and re-
porting of demographic data on small business loan applicants.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Dodd-Frank Section 1071 amended the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act to require financial institutions to collect and report specific
data about small business credit applications, including whether
the applicant is a women-owned or minority-owned business. The
provision was described as promoting transparency in small busi-
ness lending and ensuring that businesses, particularly those
owned by minorities and women, have equal access to credit. How-
ever, the broad mandate in Section 1071 has led to concerns from
lenders of all sizes about their ability to continue providing access
to small business credit at all.
Under the law, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) was given the authority to collect and analyze this data.

Section 5:
Section 1071 allows the CFPB to request ‘‘any additional data that
the Bureau determines would aid in fulfilling the purposes of this

Section 6:
section,’’1 granting the agency considerable discretion to expand
data collection beyond the original scope. This opens the door for
the agency to impose diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) meas-
ures on lenders, who could face enforcement actions for noncompli-
ance. Further, Section 1071 requires that this data be made public,
raising significant privacy concerns, especially without strong data
protections in place.
The broad data collection mandate will create significant burdens
for small community lenders, leading to higher administrative and
compliance costs and a reduction in available credit for Main Street
businesses. The highly customized nature of small business lending
means that aggregated data is often meaningless without proper
context, further diminishing its value and increasing its oppor-
tunity to be abused by groups seeking to ‘‘name and shame’’ lend-
ers. As demonstrated by former CFPB Director Chopra’s finalized
Small Business Lending Rule, the CFPB leadership can exploit this
expansive authority to push a broader political agenda, to the det-
riment of small businesses and lenders trying to support local
economies.2
Shortly after the rule was finalized, the Texas Bankers Associa-
tion filed a lawsuit against the CFPB, arguing that the CFPB ex-
ceeded its authority and acted in a manner that is arbitrary and
capricious. In March 2025, a Fifth Circuit panel granted a stay on
the rule’s implementation pending the outcome of the appeal.3

mittee on Financial Services.
RELATED HEARINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following hearing was used to develop H.R.
976:
The Full Committee held a hearing on February 5, 2025, titled
‘‘Make Community Banking Great Again.’’ A discussion draft
version of the bill was considered in this hearing. The following
witnesses testified: Cathy Owen, Executive Chairman, Eagle Bank
& Trust Company, Little Rock, AR; Susannah Marshall, Bank
Commissioner, Arkansas State Bank Department, Little Rock, AR;
Rebecca Romero Rainey, President & CEO, Independent Commu-
nity Bankers of America, Washington, D.C.; Patrick J. Kennedy Jr.,
Founding Partner, Kennedy Sutherland, LLP, San Antonio, TX;
Mitria Spotser, Vice President, Federal Policy, Center for Respon-
sible Lending, Washington, D.C.
The Committee on Financial Services met in open session on
April 2, 2025, to consider, among others, H.R. 976.
COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.
On April 2, 2025, H.R. 976, as amended, was ordered to be re-
ported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 27 yeas and
22 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–061).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
976:
• Representative Williams (R–TX) offered an amendment in
the nature of a substitute, which made minor edits and tech-
nical changes. The amendment was adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Nydia Velazquez (D–NY) offered an
amendment (No. 37) that would delay the implementation of
the bill until the CFPB Director certifies that small business
lending has become more transparent; large lenders are pro-
viding small businesses disclosures similar to consumer loans;
and no lenders include confessions of judgement as a small
business loan requirement. This amendment creates new au-
thority for the CFPB over small business lending. The amend-
ment was defeated in a recorded vote of 22 yeas and 27 nays,
a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–060).

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 976 is to repeal Section 1071
of the Dodd-Frank Act to mandate the collection and reporting of
demographic data on small business loan applicants.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 976. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of House rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the
cost estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 16:
§701. Prohibited discrimination; reasons for adverse action
(a) It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against
any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction—
(1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex
or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capac-
ity to contract);
(2) because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from
any public assistance program; or
(3) because the applicant has in good faith exercised any
right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
(b) It shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this title
for a creditor—
(1) to make an inquiry of marital status if such inquiry is for
the purpose of ascertaining the creditor’s rights and remedies
applicable to the particular extension of credit and not to dis-
criminate in a determination of credit-worthiness;
(2) to make an inquiry of the applicant’s age or of whether
the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance pro-
gram if such inquiry is for the purpose of determining the
amount and probable continuance of income levels, credit his-
tory, or other pertinent element of credit-worthiness as pro-
vided in regulations of the Board;
(3) to use any empirically derived credit system which con-
siders age if such system is demonstrably and statistically
sound in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, except
that in the operation of such system the age of an elderly ap-
plicant may not be assigned a negative factor or value; or
(4) to make an inquiry or to consider the age of an elderly
applicant when the age of such applicant is to be used by the
creditor in the extension of credit in favor of such applicantø;
or¿.
ø(5) to make an inquiry under section 704B, in accordance
with the requirements of that section.¿
(c) It is not a violation of this section for a creditor to refuse to
extend credit offered pursuant to—
(1) any credit assistance program expressly authorized by
law for an economically disadvantaged class of persons;
(2) any credit assistance program administered by a non-
profit organization for its members or an economically dis-
advantaged class of persons; or
(3) any special purpose credit program offered by a profit-
making organization to meet special social needs which meets
standards prescribed in regulations by the Board;
if such refusal is required by or made pursuant to such program.

(d)(1) Within thirty days (or such longer reasonable time as spec-
ified in regulations of the Bureau for any class of credit trans-
action) after receipt of a completed application for credit, a creditor
shall notify the applicant of its action on the application.
(2) Each applicant against whom adverse action is taken shall be
entitled to a statement of reasons for such action from the creditor.
A creditor satisfies this obligation by—
(A) providing statements of reasons in writing as a matter
of course to applicants against whom adverse action is taken;
or
(B) giving written notification of adverse action which dis-
closes (i) the applicant’s right to a statement of reasons within
thirty days after receipt by the creditor of a request made
within sixty days after such notification, and (ii) the identity
of the person or office from which such statement may be ob-
tained. Such statement may be given orally, if the written noti-
fication advises the applicant of his right to have the statement
of reasons confirmed in writing on written request.
(3) A statement of reasons meets the requirements of this section
only if it contains the specific reasons for the adverse action taken.
(4) Where a creditor has been requested by a third party to make
a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly to an applicant,
the notification and statement of reasons required by this sub-

Section 17:
section may be made directly by such creditor, or indirectly through
the third party, provided in either case that the identity of the
creditor is disclosed.
(5) The requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) may be satis-
fied by verbal statements or notifications in the case of any creditor
who did not act on more than one hundred and fifty applications
during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the
adverse action is taken, as determined under regulations of the
Board.
(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘adverse action’’
means a denial or revocation of credit, a change in the terms of an
existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substan-
tially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. Such
term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under
an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinquent
or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would ex-
ceed a previously established credit limit.
(e) COPIES FURNISHED TO APPLICANTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Each creditor shall furnish to an applicant
a copy of any and all written appraisals and valuations devel-
oped in connection with the applicant’s application for a loan
that is secured or would have been secured by a first lien on
a dwelling promptly upon completion, but in no case later than
3 days prior to the closing of the loan, whether the creditor
grants or denies the applicant’s request for credit or the appli-
cation is incomplete or withdrawn.
(2) WAIVER.—The applicant may waive the 3 day require-
ment provided for in paragraph (1), except where otherwise re-
quired in law.
(3) REIMBURSEMENT.—The applicant may be required to pay
a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the
appraisal, except where otherwise required in law.

the creditor shall notify an applicant in writing of the right to
receive a copy of each written appraisal and valuation under
this subsection.
(6) VALUATION DEFINED.—For purposes of this subsection,
the term ‘‘valuation’’ shall include any estimate of the value of
a dwelling developed in connection with a creditor’s decision to
provide credit, including those values developed pursuant to a
policy of a government sponsored enterprise or by an auto-
mated valuation model, a broker price opinion, or other meth-
odology or mechanism.

quest under subsection (b) in connection with such application.

cial institution, or any affiliate of a financial institution, in-
volved in making any determination concerning an application
for credit should have access to any information provided by
the applicant pursuant to a request under subsection (b), the
financial institution shall provide notice to the applicant of the
access of the underwriter to such information, along with no-
tice that the financial institution may not discriminate on the
basis of such information.

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 976 would repeal Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). This
provision requires lenders to collect and report small business lend-
ing data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
similar to how lenders have collected and reported mortgage loan
data for decades under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA). This approach promotes transparency in a manner that
would help reduce lending costs, expand credit availability, and
prevent discrimination for entrepreneurs across the country. The
CFPB issued a final rule in 2023 implementing Section 1071 pursu-
ant to a court-supervised settlement, and exempted community fi-
nancial institutions that provide little to no small business loans.
Republicans passed a Congressional Review Act resolution that
would have rescinded CFPB’s rule, however President Biden vetoed
the measure.
In March 2023, the CFPB finalized a rule implementing Section
1071 of Dodd-Frank,1 aimed at increasing transparency in small
business lending, promoting competition among lenders that would
drive down costs for borrowers, and providing new lending opportu-
nities for small businesses, especially women-owned, LGBTQ-
owned businesses and businesses owned by people of color. CFPB’s

Section 22:
Section 1071 rule requires lenders to collect and report information
about the small business credit applications they receive, including
geographic and demographic data (that’s self-reported by business
owners on a voluntary basis), lending decisions, and the price of
credit. The rule would work in tandem with the Community Rein-
vestment Act, which requires certain financial institutions to meet
the needs of the communities they serve. The increased trans-
parency will benefit small businesses, family farms, financial insti-
tutions, and the broader economy.
Arguably, had CFPB’s Section 1071 rulemaking been in place be-
fore the pandemic, policymakers would have been able to not only
design relief programs that were better targeted, but also to better
monitor which small businesses were receiving support and which
were left out of programs like the Paycheck Protection Program
(PPP). Industry studies also affirm how important fair lending
rules are to the nation’s economic virtuality. For instance, one
Citigroup study estimates that fair access to lending for Black-
owned small businesses alone would have resulted in $650 billion
in additional business revenue per year, as well as created an addi-
tional 6.1 million jobs per year.2 Moreover, the CFPB conducted a
pilot study in 2024 where they found that Black-owned small busi-
nesses received disparate treatment compared to White-owned

small businesses by the same bank, finding that Black participants
received less encouragement to apply for a loan and were more
likely to be steered into alternative credit products, like a home eq-
uity credit product where the owner’s personal residence would be
at risk if they default on the loan.3
Since its finalization, Section 1071 has come under attack both
in district courts and Congress. In May 2023, plaintiffs filed a law-
suit in a Texas federal district court challenging the validity of the
rule and a motion seeking a preliminary injunction.4 However,
community lenders5 and small business advocates alike have un-
derlined the importance of CFPB’s small lending rules in creating
a more transparent and fairer marketplace for lenders and small
businesses. It is also likely that rules shining a light on small busi-
ness lending will likely result in increased lending to underserved
businesses, including farms, as was observed in the implementa-
tion of similar sunshine statutes like HMDA. In fact, changes to
HMDA data in 1990 and 1993 corresponded with a 70% increase
in conventional home purchase lending to Black borrowers, and a
48% increase in lending to Latinx borrowers, from 1993 to 1995.6
Rep. Nydia Vela´zquez, Ranking Member of the House Small
Business Committee, offered an amendment that would stipulate
the bill only takes effect after the CFPB Director certifies that the
small business lending market is competitive, transparent, and
fair, and that small business lenders are providing Truth In Lend-
ing Act (TILA) type disclosures to prospective borrowers, and that
lenders are not burying predatory confessions of judgement provi-
sions in small business loan contracts. Republicans rejected the
amendment in a party-line vote.
More than 150 civil rights, consumer, small business, lending, re-
ligious, and community organizations have strongly opposed efforts,
like H.R. 976, to repeal and undermine Section 1071 of Dodd-
Frank.7 This includes National Community Reinvestment Coali-

1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, im-
poses data collection and reporting requirements on financial institutions re-
garding small business loans.
(2) These requirements have resulted in increased compliance costs for finan-
cial institutions, potentially reducing access to credit for small businesses.
(3) The regulatory burdens created by these requirements disproportionately
impact smaller financial institutions, such as community banks and credit
unions, which are critical to small business lending.
(4) Repealing these requirements will reduce regulatory barriers and support
greater access to credit for small businesses.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 4, 2025, by Representative Williams,
H.R. 976, the 1071 Repeal to Protect Small Business Lending Act,
would repeal Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act that mandates the collection and re-
porting of demographic data on small business loan applicants.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Dodd-Frank Section 1071 amended the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act to require financial institutions to collect and report specific
data about small business credit applications, including whether
the applicant is a women-owned or minority-owned business. The
provision was described as promoting transparency in small busi-
ness lending and ensuring that businesses, particularly those
owned by minorities and women, have equal access to credit. How-
ever, the broad mandate in Section 1071 has led to concerns from
lenders of all sizes about their ability to continue providing access
to small business credit at all.
Under the law, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) was given the authority to collect and analyze this data.
Section 1071 allows the CFPB to request ‘‘any additional data that
the Bureau determines would aid in fulfilling the purposes of this

section,’’1 granting the agency considerable discretion to expand
data collection beyond the original scope. This opens the door for
the agency to impose diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) meas-
ures on lenders, who could face enforcement actions for noncompli-
ance. Further, Section 1071 requires that this data be made public,
raising significant privacy concerns, especially without strong data
protections in place.
The broad data collection mandate will create significant burdens
for small community lenders, leading to higher administrative and
compliance costs and a reduction in available credit for Main Street
businesses. The highly customized nature of small business lending
means that aggregated data is often meaningless without proper
context, further diminishing its value and increasing its oppor-
tunity to be abused by groups seeking to ‘‘name and shame’’ lend-
ers. As demonstrated by former CFPB Director Chopra’s finalized
Small Business Lending Rule, the CFPB leadership can exploit this
expansive authority to push a broader political agenda, to the det-
riment of small businesses and lenders trying to support local
economies.2
Shortly after the rule was finalized, the Texas Bankers Associa-
tion filed a lawsuit against the CFPB, arguing that the CFPB ex-
ceeded its authority and acted in a manner that is arbitrary and
capricious. In March 2025, a Fifth Circuit panel granted a stay on
the rule’s implementation pending the outcome of the appeal.3

mittee on Financial Services.
RELATED HEARINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following hearing was used to develop H.R.
976:
The Full Committee held a hearing on February 5, 2025, titled
‘‘Make Community Banking Great Again.’’ A discussion draft
version of the bill was considered in this hearing. The following
witnesses testified: Cathy Owen, Executive Chairman, Eagle Bank
& Trust Company, Little Rock, AR; Susannah Marshall, Bank
Commissioner, Arkansas State Bank Department, Little Rock, AR;
Rebecca Romero Rainey, President & CEO, Independent Commu-
nity Bankers of America, Washington, D.C.; Patrick J. Kennedy Jr.,
Founding Partner, Kennedy Sutherland, LLP, San Antonio, TX;
Mitria Spotser, Vice President, Federal Policy, Center for Respon-
sible Lending, Washington, D.C.
The Committee on Financial Services met in open session on
April 2, 2025, to consider, among others, H.R. 976.
COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.
On April 2, 2025, H.R. 976, as amended, was ordered to be re-
ported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 27 yeas and
22 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–061).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
976:
• Representative Williams (R–TX) offered an amendment in
the nature of a substitute, which made minor edits and tech-
nical changes. The amendment was adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Nydia Velazquez (D–NY) offered an
amendment (No. 37) that would delay the implementation of
the bill until the CFPB Director certifies that small business
lending has become more transparent; large lenders are pro-
viding small businesses disclosures similar to consumer loans;
and no lenders include confessions of judgement as a small
business loan requirement. This amendment creates new au-
thority for the CFPB over small business lending. The amend-
ment was defeated in a recorded vote of 22 yeas and 27 nays,
a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–060).

COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 976. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of House rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the
cost estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘1071 Repeal to Protect
Small Business Lending Act.’’
Section 2. Findings
Section 2 sets forth the following findings:
• Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as
added by section 1071 of the Dodd Frank Act, imposes data col-
lection and reporting requirements on financial institutions re-
garding small business loans;
• These requirements have resulted in increased compliance
costs for financial institutions, potentially reducing access to
credit for small businesses;
• The regulatory burdens created by these requirements dis-
proportionately impact smaller financial institutions, such as
community banks and credit unions, which are critical to small
business lending; and
• Repealing these requirements will reduce regulatory bar-
riers and support greater access to credit for small businesses.

§701. Prohibited discrimination; reasons for adverse action
(a) It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against
any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction—
(1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex
or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capac-
ity to contract);
(2) because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from
any public assistance program; or
(3) because the applicant has in good faith exercised any
right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
(b) It shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this title
for a creditor—
(1) to make an inquiry of marital status if such inquiry is for
the purpose of ascertaining the creditor’s rights and remedies
applicable to the particular extension of credit and not to dis-
criminate in a determination of credit-worthiness;
(2) to make an inquiry of the applicant’s age or of whether
the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance pro-
gram if such inquiry is for the purpose of determining the
amount and probable continuance of income levels, credit his-
tory, or other pertinent element of credit-worthiness as pro-
vided in regulations of the Board;
(3) to use any empirically derived credit system which con-
siders age if such system is demonstrably and statistically
sound in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, except
that in the operation of such system the age of an elderly ap-
plicant may not be assigned a negative factor or value; or
(4) to make an inquiry or to consider the age of an elderly
applicant when the age of such applicant is to be used by the
creditor in the extension of credit in favor of such applicantø;
or¿.
ø(5) to make an inquiry under section 704B, in accordance
with the requirements of that section.¿

profit organization for its members or an economically dis-
advantaged class of persons; or

making organization to meet special social needs which meets
standards prescribed in regulations by the Board;

(d)(1) Within thirty days (or such longer reasonable time as spec-
ified in regulations of the Bureau for any class of credit trans-
action) after receipt of a completed application for credit, a creditor
shall notify the applicant of its action on the application.
(2) Each applicant against whom adverse action is taken shall be
entitled to a statement of reasons for such action from the creditor.
A creditor satisfies this obligation by—
(A) providing statements of reasons in writing as a matter
of course to applicants against whom adverse action is taken;
or
(B) giving written notification of adverse action which dis-
closes (i) the applicant’s right to a statement of reasons within
thirty days after receipt by the creditor of a request made
within sixty days after such notification, and (ii) the identity
of the person or office from which such statement may be ob-
tained. Such statement may be given orally, if the written noti-
fication advises the applicant of his right to have the statement
of reasons confirmed in writing on written request.
(3) A statement of reasons meets the requirements of this section
only if it contains the specific reasons for the adverse action taken.
(4) Where a creditor has been requested by a third party to make
a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly to an applicant,
the notification and statement of reasons required by this sub-
section may be made directly by such creditor, or indirectly through
the third party, provided in either case that the identity of the
creditor is disclosed.
(5) The requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) may be satis-
fied by verbal statements or notifications in the case of any creditor
who did not act on more than one hundred and fifty applications
during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the
adverse action is taken, as determined under regulations of the
Board.
(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘adverse action’’
means a denial or revocation of credit, a change in the terms of an
existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substan-
tially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. Such
term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under
an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinquent
or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would ex-
ceed a previously established credit limit.
(e) COPIES FURNISHED TO APPLICANTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Each creditor shall furnish to an applicant
a copy of any and all written appraisals and valuations devel-
oped in connection with the applicant’s application for a loan
that is secured or would have been secured by a first lien on
a dwelling promptly upon completion, but in no case later than
3 days prior to the closing of the loan, whether the creditor
grants or denies the applicant’s request for credit or the appli-
cation is incomplete or withdrawn.
(2) WAIVER.—The applicant may waive the 3 day require-
ment provided for in paragraph (1), except where otherwise re-
quired in law.
(3) REIMBURSEMENT.—The applicant may be required to pay
a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the
appraisal, except where otherwise required in law.

the term ‘‘valuation’’ shall include any estimate of the value of
a dwelling developed in connection with a creditor’s decision to

mated valuation model, a broker price opinion, or other meth-
odology or mechanism.

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 976 would repeal Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). This
provision requires lenders to collect and report small business lend-
ing data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
similar to how lenders have collected and reported mortgage loan
data for decades under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA). This approach promotes transparency in a manner that
would help reduce lending costs, expand credit availability, and
prevent discrimination for entrepreneurs across the country. The
CFPB issued a final rule in 2023 implementing Section 1071 pursu-
ant to a court-supervised settlement, and exempted community fi-
nancial institutions that provide little to no small business loans.
Republicans passed a Congressional Review Act resolution that
would have rescinded CFPB’s rule, however President Biden vetoed
the measure.
In March 2023, the CFPB finalized a rule implementing Section
1071 of Dodd-Frank,1 aimed at increasing transparency in small
business lending, promoting competition among lenders that would
drive down costs for borrowers, and providing new lending opportu-
nities for small businesses, especially women-owned, LGBTQ-
owned businesses and businesses owned by people of color. CFPB’s
Section 1071 rule requires lenders to collect and report information
about the small business credit applications they receive, including
geographic and demographic data (that’s self-reported by business
owners on a voluntary basis), lending decisions, and the price of
credit. The rule would work in tandem with the Community Rein-
vestment Act, which requires certain financial institutions to meet
the needs of the communities they serve. The increased trans-
parency will benefit small businesses, family farms, financial insti-
tutions, and the broader economy.
Arguably, had CFPB’s Section 1071 rulemaking been in place be-
fore the pandemic, policymakers would have been able to not only
design relief programs that were better targeted, but also to better
monitor which small businesses were receiving support and which
were left out of programs like the Paycheck Protection Program
(PPP). Industry studies also affirm how important fair lending
rules are to the nation’s economic virtuality. For instance, one
Citigroup study estimates that fair access to lending for Black-
owned small businesses alone would have resulted in $650 billion
in additional business revenue per year, as well as created an addi-
tional 6.1 million jobs per year.2 Moreover, the CFPB conducted a
pilot study in 2024 where they found that Black-owned small busi-
nesses received disparate treatment compared to White-owned

small businesses by the same bank, finding that Black participants
received less encouragement to apply for a loan and were more
likely to be steered into alternative credit products, like a home eq-
uity credit product where the owner’s personal residence would be
at risk if they default on the loan.3
Since its finalization, Section 1071 has come under attack both
in district courts and Congress. In May 2023, plaintiffs filed a law-
suit in a Texas federal district court challenging the validity of the
rule and a motion seeking a preliminary injunction.4 However,
community lenders5 and small business advocates alike have un-
derlined the importance of CFPB’s small lending rules in creating
a more transparent and fairer marketplace for lenders and small
businesses. It is also likely that rules shining a light on small busi-
ness lending will likely result in increased lending to underserved
businesses, including farms, as was observed in the implementa-
tion of similar sunshine statutes like HMDA. In fact, changes to
HMDA data in 1990 and 1993 corresponded with a 70% increase
in conventional home purchase lending to Black borrowers, and a
48% increase in lending to Latinx borrowers, from 1993 to 1995.6
Rep. Nydia Vela´zquez, Ranking Member of the House Small
Business Committee, offered an amendment that would stipulate
the bill only takes effect after the CFPB Director certifies that the
small business lending market is competitive, transparent, and
fair, and that small business lenders are providing Truth In Lend-
ing Act (TILA) type disclosures to prospective borrowers, and that
lenders are not burying predatory confessions of judgement provi-
sions in small business loan contracts. Republicans rejected the
amendment in a party-line vote.
More than 150 civil rights, consumer, small business, lending, re-
ligious, and community organizations have strongly opposed efforts,
like H.R. 976, to repeal and undermine Section 1071 of Dodd-
Frank.7 This includes National Community Reinvestment Coali-
