I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 998, the ‘‘Internal Revenue Service Math and Tax-
payer Help Act,’’ as amended, was ordered reported by the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means on February 12, 2025.
The provision establishes rules for the content required in a no-
tice of math or clerical error, to ensure that the recipient will un-
derstand the nature of the error identified by the IRS and how to
seek an abatement of the additional tax if the taxpayer believes the
IRS is in error. In addition, it requires that the IRS issue notices
of abatements when it reverses the math error assessment on tax-
payer request and prescribes specific rules for such notices. Within
180 days of enactment, the Secretary is required to establish new
rules and guidance on how to seek abatement of a tax assessment
made under math error authority. Finally, the provision requires
that the IRS conduct a pilot program to evaluate the effectiveness
of issuing such notices of math error by certified or registered mail,
with or without confirmation of receipt, to report to Congress on
the results of that program, and to make recommendations on how
to further improve taxpayer response to notices.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Each year, the IRS sends millions of ‘‘math error’’ notices to tax-
payers that propose to adjust their tax liabilities.1 These math
error notices often do not explain the reasons for the adjustments,
and some are never received by the taxpayer due to lost mail.2 The
IRS is not currently required to inform taxpayers that they must
dispute the adjustments within 60 days if they disagree or gen-

erally forfeit their right to do so.3 Many taxpayers do not under-
stand that the failure to respond to an IRS math error notice with-
in 60 days means they have conceded the adjustment and have for-
feited their right to challenge the IRS’s position in Tax Court.4
The Committee on Ways and Means is committed to leveling the
playing field for taxpayers by ensuring that they are notified of any
adjustments to their tax return and giving them enough time to
challenge the adjustment, if necessary. Taxpayers deserve full
transparency and an ability to challenge the IRS when they exer-
cise their math error authority.

II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
A. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE MATH ERROR AND TAXPAYER
HELP ACT (SEC. 2 OF THE BILL AND SEC. 6213(b)5 OF THE CODE)
PRESENT LAW
In general
The Federal income tax system relies upon self-reporting and as-
sessment. A taxpayer is expected to prepare a report of his or her
liability6 and submit it to the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’)
with any payment due. The Code provides general authority for the
IRS to assess all taxes shown on returns, including assessment of
tax computed by the taxpayer,7 other than certain Federal unem-
ployment tax and estimated income taxes.8 The assessment is re-
quired to be made by recording the liability in the ‘‘office of the

Secretary’’ in a manner determined under regulations.9 In addition,
the IRS may make supplemental assessments within the limita-
tions period whenever it determines that an assessment was imper-
fect or incomplete.10
The authority of the IRS to assess additional tax is generally
subject to certain restrictions on assessment known as deficiency
procedures.11 These deficiency procedures generally ensure a tax-
payer access to administrative review and a pre-payment judicial
forum (i.e., the United States Tax Court) for reviewing disputed ad-
justments proposed by the IRS. A deficiency of tax is the amount
by which the liability determined under the Code exceeds the sum
of certain taxes12 assessed for a period (including amounts shown
on a return), after reduction for any rebates of tax.
Math error exception to restrictions on assessments
There are several exceptions to the restrictions on assessment of
tax.13 One of the principal exceptions is the IRS’s authority to
make a summary assessment of tax without issuance of a notice of
deficiency if the error is a result of a mathematical or clerical error,
generally referred to as math error authority. Purely mathematical
or clerical issues are often identified early in the processing of a re-
turn, prior to issuance of any refund rather than as a result of an
examination of a return. Other grounds for math error authority
may be identified after initial processing, including in the course of
an examination of other issues subject to the general restrictions
on assessment.
Definition of math error
The definition of mathematical or clerical errors is not limited to
math, clerical, or transcription errors. It addresses over 20 cat-
egories of errors,14 many of which relate to rules regarding refund-
able credits.15 Since 2015, the math error authority covers situa-
tions for which a taxpayer claiming certain refundable credits ei-
ther is subject to a multi-year ban against claiming such credits as
a consequence of having made a prior fraudulent or reckless claim
or, in the case of taxpayer who has made prior improper claims,
omits information required by the Secretary to demonstrate eligi-
bility for the credit.16 In 2020 and 2021, math error authority was
expanded to cover certain errors related to valid taxpayer identi-
fication numbers and reconciliation of advance payments with re-
spect to the 2020 recovery rebate credit, 2020 additional recovery

10Sec. 6204.
11Secs. 6211 through 6215.
12The taxes to which deficiency procedures apply are income, estate and gift and excise taxes
arising under chapters 41, 42, or 44. Secs. 6211 and 6213.
13Section 6213 provides that a taxpayer may waive the restrictions on assessment, permits
immediate assessment to reflect payments of tax remitted to the IRS and to correct amounts
credited or applied as a result of claims for carrybacks under section 1341(b), and requires as-
sessment of amounts ordered as criminal restitution. Assessment is also permitted in certain
circumstances in which collection of the tax would be in jeopardy. Secs. 6851, 6852, and 6861.

credit, the child tax credit, the American opportunity tax credit, recovery rebate credits, and
various energy-related credits.

rebate credit, and 2021 recovery rebate credit.17 In 2022, math
error authority was again expanded to apply to errors in docu-
menting energy related credits, including omission of product or ve-
hicle identification numbers.18
Notice of math error assessment and request for abatement
If a mistake on the return is of a type that is within the meaning
of mathematical or clerical error, the IRS immediately assesses the
additional tax due as a result of correcting the mistake and sends
notice to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of the assessment.
The statute is silent as to the level of detail required in the notice.
Math error authority may be used to deny an improperly claimed
credit, either during initial processing of a return on which the
credit is claimed or in an examination of the return after the re-
fund has been issued, and to assess immediately any additional tax
due as a result without issuing a notice of deficiency. The issuance
of a notice of math error begins a 60-day period within which the
taxpayer may submit a request for abatement of the math error ad-
justment. If a taxpayer timely submits a request, the statute di-
rects the IRS to abate the assessment. The IRS may then refer the
unresolved issue for examination under the deficiency procedures.19
REASONS FOR CHANGE
Under present law, the IRS is not required to send notices of its
exercise of math error authority by certified or registered mail, un-
like the requirements applicable to notices of deficiency following
an examination, which must be sent to the last known address of
the taxpayer, by certified mail (registered mail if the address is
outside the United States). As a result, the IRS has developed form
letters intended to inform the taxpayer of the nature of the prob-
lem, which sometimes include preprinted lists of potential bases on
which an assessment is made. Furthermore, many taxpayers are
not aware of their right to right to question the assessment by
seeking an abatement. Even for those who are aware of the right
to do so, the lack of clarity in some form letters used by the IRS
have prevented taxpayers from understanding the nature of the
error they may have made on a return and how to refute it.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
The provision amends the statute authorizing use of math error
assessment authority. It prescribes specific procedures and content
for notices of math or clerical error, requires the IRS to update pro-
cedures on how to request abatement and, upon determination of
an abatement, to issue a notice of abatement to the taxpayer. In
addition, the provision requires implementation of a pilot program
to explore use of certified or registered mail for issuance of math
error notices.

Notice of math or clerical error
With respect to the issuance of a notice of math or clerical as-
sessment, the provision requires that the IRS send such notice to
the taxpayer’s last known address and describe the math or clerical
error in plain language. The due date for submission of a request
for abatement must be included in 14-point font, boldface, next to
the address of the taxpayer on the first page of the notice. The no-
tice must include the telephone number for the automated phone
transcript service, as well as an itemized computation of adjust-
ments.
With respect to the description of the math error adjustment, the
IRS must include the type of error, the section of the Code to which
the error relates, and the line on the return on which the error was
made. In identifying the type of error, the notice may not rely on
a list of multiple categories of math errors in the alternative. In-
stead, it must identify the specific type of math error authority re-
lied upon for each specific error on the return.
The itemized computation of the adjustments must address all
changes to any component of the computation of taxable income
and tax liability or tax due. These items include adjusted gross in-
come, taxable income, itemized or standard deductions, credits
(whether or not refundable), losses, and other items specifically
listed in the provision.
Abatement process
The IRS is directed to prescribe procedures that permit tax-
payers to request abatement in writing, electronically, by tele-
phone, or in person. Such procedures are to be issued no later than
180 days after date of enactment.
If an abatement is made after a notice of math error, a notice
of abatement sent to the taxpayer’s last known address is required.
Such notice must include a plain language description of the abate-
ment as well as an itemized computation of any adjustments made
to the items that were included in the notice of math or clerical
error.
Pilot program and report to Congress
The provision requires that the Secretary, in cooperation with
the National Taxpayer Advocate, conduct a study of the effective-
ness of use of certified or registered mail, with e-signature con-
firmation of receipt and report the results to Congress. The study
is to include issuance of trial notices in an amount which is a sta-
tistically significant portion of all such notices. The program must
be implemented no later than 18 months after date of enactment.
For each type of math error authority relied upon in the notices,
the report shall include information on the number and dollar
amounts of notices under the trial, as well as similar information
on the number and dollar amount of abatements under the trial
and the pilot program effect on taxpayer responsiveness. The report
is to include conclusions about the effectiveness of using certified
or registered mail, with or without confirmation of receipt, as well
as any recommendations on how to improve taxpayer response
rates.

House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the bill does
not authorize funding, so no statement of general performance
goals and objectives is required.
C. APPLICABILITY OF HOUSE RULE XXI, CLAUSE 5(b)
Rule XXI 5(b) of the Rules of the House of Representatives pro-
vides, in part, that ‘‘A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or con-
ference report carrying a Federal income tax rate increase may not
be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a
vote of not less than three-fifths of the Members voting, a quorum
being present.’’ The Committee has carefully reviewed the bill, and
states that the bill does not provide such a Federal income tax rate
increase.
D. INFORMATION RELATING TO UNFUNDED MANDATES
This information is provided in accordance with section 423 of
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. No. 104–4).

With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the bill, and states that the provisions of the bill do not
contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited
tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
F. DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision
of the bill establishes or reauthorizes: (1) a program of the Federal
Government known to be duplicative of another Federal program;
(2) a program included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139; or (3) a program related to a program identified in
the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, published
pursuant to the Federal Program Information Act (Pub. L. No. 95–
220, as amended by Pub. L. No. 98–169).
G. TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Reform and Re-
structuring Act of 1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the Inter-
nal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a
tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all
legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the
House Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of con-
ference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indi-
rectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has widespread ap-
plicability to individuals or small businesses.
The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has determined
that there are no provisions that are of widespread applicability to
individuals or small businesses.

SEC. 6213. RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO DEFICIENCIES; PETITION
TO TAX COURT.
(a) TIME FOR FILING PETITION AND RESTRICTION ON ASSESS-
MENT.—Within 90 days, or 150 days if the notice is addressed to
a person outside the United States, after the notice of deficiency
authorized in section 6212 is mailed (not counting Saturday, Sun-
day, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the last day),
the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redeter-
mination of the deficiency. Except as otherwise provided in section
6851, 6852, or 6861 no assessment of a deficiency in respect of any
tax imposed by subtitle A, or B, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 and no
levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun,
or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer,
nor until the expiration of such 90-day or 150-day period, as the
case may be, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court,
until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. Notwith-
standing the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such as-
sessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the
time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding
in the proper court, including the Tax Court, and a refund may be
ordered by such court of any amount collected within the period
during which the Secretary is prohibited from collecting by levy or
through a proceeding in court under the provisions of this sub-
section. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction to enjoin any ac-
tion or proceeding or order any refund under this subsection unless
a timely petition for a redetermination of the deficiency has been
filed and then only in respect of the deficiency that is the subject
of such petition. Any petition filed with the Tax Court on or before
the last date specified for filing such petition by the Secretary in
the notice of deficiency shall be treated as timely filed.

sessment and collection until notice of the deficiency has
been mailed), or of section 6212(c)(1) (restricting further
deficiency letters), or of section 6512(a) (prohibiting credits
or refunds after petition to the Tax Court), and the tax-
payer shall have no right to file a petition with the Tax
Court based on such notice, nor shall such assessment or

notice pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), in bold, font
size 14, and immediately next to the taxpayer’s ad-
dress on page 1 of the notice.
(ii) NO LISTS OF POTENTIAL ERRORS.—A notice which
provides multiple potential or alternative errors which
may be applicable to the return shall not be sufficiently
specific for purposes of clause (i)(II); however, if mul-
tiple specific errors apply to the return all such errors
should be listed.
(2) ABATEMENT OF ASSESSMENT OF MATHEMATICAL OR CLER-
ICAL ERRORS.—
(A) REQUEST FOR ABATEMENT.—Notwithstanding section
6404(b), a taxpayer may file with the Secretary within 60
days after notice is sent under paragraph (1) a request for
an abatement of any assessment specified in such notice,
and upon receipt of such request, the Secretary shall abate
the assessment. Any reassessment of the tax with respect
to which an abatement is made under this subparagraph
shall be subject to the deficiency procedures prescribed by
this subchapter.
(B) STAY OF COLLECTION.—In the case of any assessment
referred to in paragraph (1), notwithstanding paragraph
(1), no levy or proceeding in court for the collection of such
assessment shall be made, begun, or prosecuted during the
period in which such assessment may be abated under this
paragraph.
(C) NOTICE.—Upon determination of an abatement pur-
suant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall send notice
to the taxpayer of such abatement which—
(i) is sent to the taxpayer’s last known address,
(ii) describes the abatement in comprehensive, plain
language, and
(iii) provides an itemized computation of any adjust-
ments to be made to the items described in the notice
of mathematical or clerical error, including any
changes to any item described in paragraph
(1)(B)(i)(III).
(3) ASSESSMENTS ARISING OUT OF TENTATIVE CARRYBACK OR
REFUND ADJUSTMENTS.—If the Secretary determines that the
amount applied, credited, or refunded under section 6411 is in
excess of the overassessment attributable to the carryback or
the amount described in section 1341(b)(1) with respect to
which such amount was applied, credited, or refunded, he may
assess without regard to the provisions of paragraph (2) the
amount of the excess as a deficiency as if it were due to a
mathematical or clerical error appearing on the return.
(4) ASSESSMENT OF AMOUNT PAID.—Any amount paid as a
tax or in respect of a tax may be assessed upon the receipt of
such payment notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a).
In any case where such amount is paid after the mailing of a
notice of deficiency under section 6212, such payment shall not
deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over such deficiency de-
termined under section 6211 without regard to such assess-
ment.

sessment and collection until notice of the deficiency has

ciency letters), or section 6512(a) (prohibiting credits or re-

the Secretary.

waive the restrictions provided in subsection (a) on the assessment
and collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency.

tion in the Tax Court with respect to such deficiency, and for
60 days thereafter.

poses of the second and third sentences of subsection (a), the
filing of a proof of claim or request for payment (or the taking

States Code shall not be treated as action prohibited by such
second sentence.
