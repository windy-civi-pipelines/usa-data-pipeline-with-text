PURPOSE
The stated purpose of H. Res. 237 is to request the President and
direct the Secretary of Education to transmit certain documents to
the U.S. House of Representatives relating to the Department of
Education’s (the Department) reduction in force and other
downsizing measures. The Committee believes H. Res. 237 was in-
troduced in an attempt to upend the Majority’s agenda, occupy the
Department in unnecessary and overly burdensome production re-
quests, and stop the efforts of this Administration to reassign the
Department’s main functions to other agencies and return edu-
cation to the states as much as possible. As such, the Committee
reported H. Res. 237 adversely to the House with the recommenda-
tion that it do not pass.

Legislative Action
On March 21, 2025, H. Res. 237 was introduced by Ranking
Member Bobby Scott (D–VA). The bill was referred solely to the
Committee on Education and Workforce. On April 9, 2025, the
Committee considered H. Res. 237 in legislative session and re-
ported it adversely, as amended, to the House of Representatives
by a recorded vote of 18–12. The Committee considered the fol-
lowing amendment to H. Res. 237:
1. Representative Onder offered an Amendment in the Na-
ture of a Substitute that made two minor technical edits. The
amendment was adopted by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Resolutions of inquiry are a legitimate tool of Congress to de-
mand information from the Executive Branch, particularly when
the Executive Branch has not been forthcoming. Committee Repub-
licans offered multiple resolutions of inquiry during the 117th Con-
gress attempting to uncover information about the Biden-Harris
administration’s illegal student loan schemes and collusion with
teachers unions during COVID to keep students locked out of their
school buildings.1 Republicans offered those resolutions after mul-
tiple efforts to acquire that information from the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration through hearings2 and other ordinary oversight activi-
ties.3 In one of those cases, Committee Republicans patiently wait-
ed through more than a year of stonewalling by the Biden-Harris
administration before forcing a vote on a resolution of inquiry.4
By contrast, the Trump administration has been forthcoming
with information. Despite this transparency, the minority has still
skipped all the ordinary oversight steps. This reveals that H. Res.
237 is a political exercise, not a genuine effort to gather informa-
tion.

What’s more, the minority argues that the presence of the De-
partment of Education (Department) is critical to the success of
students and families. They also sought to argue that the Trump
administration’s actions to reduce the size and scope of the Depart-
ment have left the agency unable to fulfill its Constitutional obliga-
tions to faithfully execute the laws for which it has responsibility.
Neither is true.
The Department of Education Has Not Improved Education
Since the Department of Education was created, K–12 per pupil
spending in the United States has ballooned from just under
$2,300 per student to more than $15,600.5 That is an increase of
245 percent when adjusted for inflation. Unfortunately, improve-
ments in student achievement have not accompanied all the addi-
tional spending. According to the National Assessment of Edu-
cational Progress, 13-year-olds are reading at about the same level
now as they were in 1971.6 Only 30 percent of American eighth
graders are proficient in reading, and only 28 percent are proficient
in math.78 Between 2019 and 2023, the decline of U.S. eighth grad-
ers on an international math assessment was among the highest
among tested countries.9
Unfortunately, we’re doing no better in postsecondary education.
Right now, cumulative student loan debt is over $1.6 trillion.10 In-
creases in tuition and fees have continually outpaced inflation, and
results are abysmal.11 The national six-year graduation rate for
colleges and universities is just over 60 percent.12 Rather than re-
forming the failing status quo, the Biden-Harris administration
doubled down, proposing about $1 trillion in new spending to shift
student loan balances from college graduates to taxpayers, many of
whom didn’t go to college or have already fulfilled their loan repay-
ment obligations.13
Committee Republicans believe that, after four and a half dec-
ades of failure, it is time to try a different approach. Rather than
trying to control education from Washington, DC, states and local
communities should be given more power. Rather than continuing
to trust the ineffective education system, we should trust students
and families.

The Department of Education is Fulfilling Its Responsibilities
The minority also argued that the Trump administration is fail-
ing to fulfill its responsibilities to faithfully execute the laws under
its jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the Biden-Harris administration
showed us just what failure to faithfully implement laws looks like.
To cite just a few examples, the Biden-Harris administration de-
stroyed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and the col-
lege dreams of low-income students;14 they failed to enforce Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act when antisemitic harassment and dis-
crimination exploded on college campuses;15 and then attempted to
impose rules under Title IX undermining the rights of women and
girls that were judged by a federal court to ‘‘exceed the Depart-
ment’s authority under Title IX, violate the Constitution, and [be]
the result of arbitrary and capricious agency action.’’16 Yet, despite
these glaring failures, the minority seemed disinterested in notic-
ing or calling out these serious failures of the Biden-Harris admin-
istration to faithfully execute the laws under its jurisdiction.
Far from following in this path of failure, the Trump administra-
tion is fulfilling its responsibilities. Just in the weeks leading up
to the Committee’s consideration of H. Res. 237, the Trump admin-
istration’s Department took action under the laws laid out in the
resolution, including:
• Announcing a negotiated rulemaking process under the
Higher Education Act to begin the effort to fix what the Biden-
Harris administration broke in the student loan programs.17
• Putting out guidance regarding states’ and school districts’
obligations under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA);18
• Launching investigations into states’ and school districts’
violations of FERPA;19
• Taking steps to ensure state and school district compliance
with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act;20

• Taking aggressive action to protect women and girls from
discrimination in violation of Title IX;21 and
• Holding Harvard accountable for its failure to protect Jew-
ish students from harassment and discrimination.22
While the Biden-Harris administration neglected these laws or
intentionally misconstrued them to pursue political ends, the
Trump administration is aggressively enforcing them even as it
makes the important case that these responsibilities could better
be handled by other agencies and the states.
CONCLUSION
The debate over this resolution was fundamentally a debate
about competing visions for education. Committee Republicans be-
lieve in an education system that does not trap students into fail-
ing schools; that allows all parents—not just the wealthy and well-
connected—to exercise school choice for their children; that makes
college available for all who want it but where multiple pathways
to successful careers and lives are also available and respected;
that sees parents as partners rather than enemies.
The Trump administration shares this vision. It wants to elimi-
nate bureaucracy where it impedes educational achievement.
Where federal guardrails are needed, for example to protect the
civil rights of students, the Trump administration wants to stream-
line bureaucracy so that the federal government can best fulfill its
responsibilities.
Unfortunately, the minority’s vision is to maintain the status quo
that has failed so many students. By rejecting this resolution, the
Committee demonstrates it rejects an education system that puts
systems before students and families. Dispensing with this resolu-
tion will make it easier for Congress and the Trump administration
to continue the important work of fixing what the Biden- Harris
administration broke and trusting states, students, and families
with education decisions.
SUMMARY
H. Res. 237 demands from President Trump and Secretary of

the House of Representatives relating to the downsizing measures
at the Department of Education. H. Res. 237 is applicable to the
Department of Education’s downsizing measures and therefore does
not apply to the Legislative Branch.
UNFUNDED MANDATE STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344 (as amended
by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee traditionally adopts as its own
the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. However, a cost es-
timate was not made available to the Committee in time for the fil-
ing of this report.
EARMARK STATEMENT
H. Res. 237 does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9 of
House rule XXI.
ROLL CALL VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes

MINORITY VIEWS
Introduction
President Trump ran for re-election in part on a promise to shut
down the U.S. Department of Education (Department).1 A bi-par-
tisan consensus of legal scholars agrees this is an act the President
does not have the power to do.2 Nevertheless, his Administration
is attempting to abolish the Department, with little apparent re-
gard for the statutory duties Congress has placed on the Depart-
ment and its officers.
On March 21, 2025, Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–VA) intro-
duced H. Res. 237 in the House with all Democratic Members of
the Committee on Education & Workforce as original co-sponsors.
This resolution of inquiry (ROI) directs the President and the Sec-
retary of Education (Secretary) to provide to the Congress all docu-
ments in their possession related to plans to shut down or dras-
tically reduce in size the U.S. Department of Education. Rather
than let this resolution come to the floor for consideration by the
full House, the Majority chose to report it out of Committee ad-
versely, destroying nearly any chance it will be considered further.
Our colleagues in the Majority have wasted no opportunity lauding
themselves as champions of accountability and transparency. In
killing H. Res. 237, their actions speak louder than their empty
words.
The Administration’s Dubious Dismantling of the Department of
Education
The Department of Education was created by an Act of Congress,
the Department of Education Organization Act, (the DEOA) and it
would take an Act of Congress to abolish it.3 The DEOA establishes
most of the offices at the Department, and the leadership of those
offices.4 The DEOA does not contemplate most staff positions be-
yond the direct leadership of these offices, giving the Department
wide discretion over staff and organization. However, most edu-
cation laws vest the Department with authority over certain areas

and place duties upon the Secretary and other officials.5 In addi-
tion, there are laws that place specific requirements on certain of-
fices at ED—for example, the Office for Federal Student Aid is a
‘‘performance-based organization’’ per the Higher Education Act.6
Neither the lack of legal authority nor the statutory require-
ments Congress has placed on the Department have stopped the
President and his Administration from attempting to dismantle it.
Committee Democrats, acting in concert with House and Senate
Democrats, have asked the Administration to provide information
about their actions. These requests range from simple inquiries for
credible statistical information about the nature of their actions, to
requests to review analysis we have been assured the Department
made regarding its ability to function within the law. Throughout
this process, the administration has not been transparent, forcing
Democrats to use H. Res. 237 in attempt to gather necessary infor-
mation about the Department’s actions.
Democratic Attempts to Seek Information as Administration Guts
Department
Prior to the President’s inauguration there were 4,133 employees
at the Department.7 On January 28, the U.S. Office of Personnel
and Management (OPM) sent a blast email to nearly all federal
employees presenting them with an option to resign by February
6, 2025 in exchange for a continuation of pay and benefits through
September 2025.8 The offer was made with the understanding that
layoffs would be occurring in the Executive Branch and there was
no guarantee of such a generous severance package in a general
layoff.9 This program, termed the ‘‘Deferred Resignation Program’’
and commonly referred to as the ‘‘Fork in the Road’’, was accepted
by approximately 75,000 federal employees, including approxi-
mately 259 Department employees (6.2% of the 4,133 Department
employees prior to President Trump’s 2025 inauguration).10 In Feb-
ruary, the Department was authorized by OPM to offer Voluntary
Separation Incentive Payments (VSIP), lump-sum payments of up
to $25,000 an agency that is downsizing or restructuring can make
as an incentive for employees to voluntarily separate.11 313 em-
ployees (7.6% of pre-Trump ED) took the VSIP offer. Notwith-
standing the question of whether the President has the power to
take these actions, Committee Democrats have concerns about the
5E.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Act §606, 20 U.S.C. §1405 (‘‘The Secretary shall
ensure that each recipient of assistance under this title makes positive efforts to employ and
advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities in programs assisted under this
title.’’) (emphasis added).
6Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. §1018 (‘‘There is established in the Department a
Performance-Based Organization (hereafter referred to as the ‘‘PBO’’) which shall be a discrete
management unit responsible for managing the administrative and oversight functions sup-
porting the programs authorized under title IV of this Act, as specified in subsection
(b).’’)(emphasis added).

efficacy and logic behind them, especially in the wake of subse-
quent actions taken at the Department.
On February 2, the Committee learned via media reports that
Department employees were being placed on administrative leave
based on their attendance at trainings on diversity mandated by
Department leadership during the first Trump administration.12
The surreal decision of the current administration to punish em-
ployees for acting in accordance with decisions made by an earlier
iteration of the same administration called into question whether
the Department was doing adequate analysis before making deci-
sions. On February 5, Ranking Member Scott joined with House
Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D–CT),
and Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Com-
mittee Ranking Member Bernie Sanders (I–VT), Senate Appropria-
tions Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray (D–WA), and Sen-
ate Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Ranking
Member Tammy Baldwin (D–WI), inquiring in part about these De-
partment employees who have been placed on administrative
leave.13 To date, Ranking Member Scott has not received a re-
sponse to this inquiry.
In early February, the Committee heard rumors, unsubstantiated
via communication from the Department that the Department,
seemingly at the behest of the U.S. Department of Government Ef-
ficiency Service (DOGE), was cancelling contracts for ongoing fed-
eral research at the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). These
rumors were finally confirmed in press reports later that month.14
IES is established in the DEOA, and the Education Sciences Re-
form Act (ESRA) and other statutes place significant responsibil-
ities on it.15 Ranking Member Scott and 12 other Committee Demo-
crats joined a host of other Members and Senators again asking the
Acting Secretary for details including: which offices or staff at the
Department made these decisions, what analysis determined what
contracts were cancelled, and which contracts covered the ‘‘statu-
tory functions’’ of IES.16 The Department’s final response in rela-
tion to this request was received nine days after H. Res. 237 was
marked up and was unresponsive to the majority of questions
posed in the request.

On March 3, the Honorable Linda McMahon was confirmed U.S.
Secretary of Education by a 51–45 vote of the Senate.17 That same
day the Secretary sent a memo to all Department employees enti-
tled ‘‘Our Department’s Final Mission.’’18 Her message stated in
part,
The Department of Education’s role in this new era of ac-
countability is to restore the rightful role of state oversight
in education and to end the overreach from Washington.
This restoration will profoundly impact staff, budgets, and
agency operations here at the Department. In coming
months, we will partner with Congress and other federal
agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the
expectations of the President and the American people.19
The ‘‘Final Mission’’ is constructed around two false premises.
The first is apparent, that the Department can be dissolved unilat-
erally by the Chief Executive. While the memo begrudgingly admits
that there is a role for Congress to play in ‘‘the path forward’’,20
this admission has not been followed by detailed information on
such ‘‘mission’’. This point was made clear at the markup hearing
by Representative Jahana Hayes (D–CT). In defending H. Res. 237,
Rep. Hayes made the point that if the Department shared its plans
and vision for the Department with Congress, there was a consider-
able chance that some Committee Democrats, would agree with
portions of the plan. But, in the absence of any information regard-
ing the plans for the Department, the only thing she and Com-
mittee Democrats are left to deduce is there is no plan or one that
fails to live up to the statutory requirements on the Department.
The second, and arguably more pernicious false premise in the
‘‘Final Mission’’ memo is the framing that the President and Sec-
retary are merely acting to send education ‘‘back to the states’’.
Elevating this as the main principle guiding the restructuring of
the Department is a dead giveaway that the actions being taken
are politically motivated. This is because states are, have been, and
always will be, the main operators of and decisionmakers in public
education in America, regardless of conservative claims to the con-
trary.
The federal government plays a limited, but crucial, role in sup-
porting American educational systems. The Department’s mission
is to promote student achievement and global competitiveness by
fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access to high-
quality learning opportunities. The Department does this by pro-
viding funding, guidance, and supports to states and local govern-
ments, educational institutions, and individuals to expand edu-
cational opportunity and attainment, and providing important pro-
tections to all students in pursuing a high-quality education. It re-
mains to be seen how the Department will be able to continue this

mission in the wake of recent actions, which makes H. Res. 237 so
critical.
Most Americans believe that all students deserve opportunity, re-
sources, and support to reach their full potential no matter where
they live, the color of their skin, or how much their family earns.
Public schools and the Department exist because students, with
and without disabilities, in every state and neighborhood have the
right to an education that imparts academic lessons, life skills, and
a lifelong love of learning. Parents and educators know that Amer-
ica’s students need more opportunities to succeed, and we need to
strengthen our public schools where 90 percent of students—and 95
percent of students with disabilities—learn. Students across the
country benefit from programs run by the Department, especially
lower-income students and their families in rural, suburban, and
urban communities, students and families who qualify for federal
grants or loans to receive career training or attend 2- and 4-year
colleges, and students with disabilities. H. Res. 237 is necessary to
show how the Department is planning (or not planning) to address
these gaps we know exist in education.
This fundamental disconnect between the actual role the Depart-
ment plays in education and how Republicans characterize its role
was on full display during the markup of H. Res. 237. In a pas-
sionate speech, Representative Michael Rulli (R–OH) claimed that
the ‘‘hundreds of billions of dollars that have been thrown at the
Department of Education’’ are not getting to local school districts
and is instead being spent for ‘‘admin process’’ and ‘‘philosophy that
the Department of Education does in Washington, DC’’.21 He also
held up declines in scores on the National Assessment of Edu-
cational Progress (NAEP) from 2019–2023 as an indictment of the
Department, and suggested a dissolution of the Department and
sending $4 to $5 million dollars to every school district would be
a better use of funds.
We must first address the logical inconsistencies in the speech
itself. Half of the speech argued that increases in education spend-
ing are not resulting in better education, for example highlighting
discrepancies between school systems in his district that received
‘‘$8,000 to $9,000 per student’’ with ones that received upwards of
‘‘$30,000 per student’’.22 But the speech concluded arguing how
beneficial it would be to send Department dollars (at his estimate
approximately $4–$5 million per district) directly to school dis-
tricts. If you accept the premise that more money per student does
not increase educational outcomes, it would be hard to see the
value in sending additional money directly to districts.
However, concerns raised over federal education dollars flowing
to local school districts seemed less an indictment of actions taken
by the Department, but ones taken by the state of Ohio. Rep. Rulli
referred to the ‘‘home rule law’’ in Ohio.23 Whatever strictures the
state of Ohio places on cities and townships in how it can spend
its funds are problems internal to the state and have nothing to do
with the Department. And again, if the flow of money to local dis-

tricts was the concern, it seems to belie his argument that edu-
cation before the Department—his harkening to ‘‘200 years where
local one-room schoolhouses were able to educate kids in this coun-
try’’—seems to be a red herring.24 Similarly, the invocation of
NAEP score decline from 2019–2023 to prove any point beside the
fact that the pandemic was especially damaging to education is dis-
ingenuous.
But finally, Rep. Rulli was simply flat out wrong when it comes
to the money going to his district from the Department. During her
speech on H. Res. 237, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) provided
detailed statistics the $1,592 per student attending public schools
that went to Ohio’s 6th Congressional District, including:
• $1,592 per student attending public schools (9% Ohio’s
sixth congressional district’s public schools support);
• $160.9 million for K–12 resources and staffing in public
schools;
• $36.1 million authorized under Title I of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act; and
• $28.8 million in Special Education Grants25
Based on obvious fundamental misunderstandings about the role
of the Department, and the Administration’s ability to unilaterally
dismantle it, on March 6, Ranking Member Scott again joined with
Representative DeLauro and Senators Sanders, Murray, and Bald-
win in a letter reiterating previous information requests around
Department employees placed on leave or laid off and conveying
concerns actions being taken could be ‘‘a series of steps intended
to illegally terminate the Department.’’26 To date Ranking Member
Scott has not received a response.
On March 11, 2005 the Department announced it was com-
mencing a Reduction in Force (RIF) action that would impact near-
ly 50% of the ED workforce.27 Despite requests, the Department
has still not sent Committee Democrats a definitive list of the posi-
tions that were reduced at the Department, or the staffing levels
in the offices of the Department. We have had to rely on informa-
tion gathered by external organizations.28 Such information sug-
gests that the majority of cuts were made in the Department’s Of-
fice for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Office of Federal Student Aid
(FSA), two of the offices with arguably the most crucial federally-
mandated role in education. On March 20, Ranking Member Scott
and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Ranking
Member Gerry Connolly (D–VA) sent a letter to Secretary McMa-
hon with further requests for information around the reduction in
force and its relation to the statutory responsibilities of the Depart-
ment, reiterating requests Committee Staff made when the RIF

was first announced.29 To date the Committee has not received a
response.
The RIF announcement was followed just nine days later by
President Trump issuing Executive Order 14242, Improving Edu-
cation Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities,
which directs the Secretary to ‘‘take all necessary steps to facilitate
the closure of the Department of Education and return education
authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective
and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on
which Americans rely.’’30
Resolutions of Inquiry and Their Role in Oversight
The last time the Committee considered any ROIs was the 117th
Congress, when Republicans were in the minority. Their usage was
patently a political stunt. Unlike the 117th Congress, the issue at
question in H. Res. 237 is not ‘‘in dispute’’. In 2022, the Repub-
licans sought information about topics that were either open legal
questions at the time, or the brain children of far-right conspiracy
theories. Here it is indisputable that the President has ordered the
Secretary of Education ‘‘to the maximum extent appropriate and
permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure
of the Department of Education.’’31 H. Res. 237 simply seeks to get
documentation to show how the Government is taking these steps
within the confines of the law.
Second, the majority claims that this request is not timely and
that their ROIs were filed only after months of not having their in-
quiries answered by the Department. During markup, Rep. Robert
Onder (R–MO) made this very point suggesting Committee Demo-
crats had not gone through the necessary oversight steps before in-
troducing H. Res. 237. However, currently the Trump Administra-
tion, with the help of unelected billionaires is dismantling the De-
partment, and other institutions of the federal government, at
breakneck speed, with little to no Congressional oversight. H. Res.
237 is necessary now because in another 5–6 months the Depart-
ment may be reduced to a point where the initial analyses we re-
quested cannot help us make informed decisions on how to proceed
based on the current status of ED, or the documents may simply
no longer exist.
Conclusion
By reporting H. Res. 237 out of Committee, the majority has ef-
fectively killed it. It remains to be seen if the Department will ever
share details of its plans with Committee Democrats. The details
of how the Department plans to ensure it can still faithfully exe-
cute the laws Congress has charged it with may never see the light
of day. The oversight aegis of the Committee rests with the Major-
ity, which heralds its dedication to transparency and accountability
