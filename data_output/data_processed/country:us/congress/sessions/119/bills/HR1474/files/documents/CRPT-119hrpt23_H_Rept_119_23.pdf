SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘International Nuclear Energy Financing Act of
2025’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Nuclear power is an emissions-free energy source that produces approxi-
mately 30 percent of the world’s low-carbon electricity. In 2021, 33 countries op-
erated nuclear power plants.
(2) The People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation have sought
to export nuclear reactors to Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, Africa, and South
Asia. According to a 2017 study by Columbia University’s Center on Global En-
ergy Policy, Chinese and Russian nuclear reactors are associated with higher
safety risk than Western nuclear reactors. In addition, financial and operational
support for nuclear power can extend over decades, allowing Beijing and Mos-
cow to secure long-term influence in both advanced and developing economies.
(3) The Russian Federation is currently building 21 reactors outside its bor-
ders, while the People’s Republic of China is assembling more than a third of
reactors under construction globally. According to research published in Nature
Energy in February 2023, when the Russian Federation launched its invasion
of Ukraine in 2022, Russian state-owned nuclear operator Rosatom ‘‘boasted as
many as 73 different projects in 29 countries. The projects were at very dif-
ferent stages of development from power plants in operation; through construc-
tion of reactors ongoing, contracted, ordered or planned; to involvement in
tenders, invitations to partnerships or officially published proposals. On top of
that, Russian companies have bilateral agreements or memoranda of under-
standing (MoUs) with 13 countries for services or general joint development of
nuclear energy.’’.
(4) In its report, ‘‘International Status and Prospects for Nuclear Power 2021’’,
the International Atomic Energy Agency wrote, ‘‘A total of 28 countries have ex-
pressed interest in nuclear power and are considering, planning or actively
working to include it into their energy mix. Another 24 Member States partici-
pate in the Agency’s nuclear infrastructure related activities or are involved in
energy planning projects through the technical cooperation programme. Ten to
twelve embarking Member States plan to operate NPPs [nuclear power plants]
by 2030 2035, representing a potential increase of nearly 30% in the number
of operating countries. Several embarking countries have also expressed interest
in SMRs [small modular reactors] technology, in particular Estonia, Ghana, Jor-
dan, Kenya, Poland, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, as well as expanding countries
such as South Africa.’’.
(5) On December 2, 2023, the United States, alongside more than 20 other
countries, pledged to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and support the fi-
nancing of nuclear energy through the World Bank and regional development
banks, so as to ‘‘encourage the inclusion of nuclear energy in their organiza-
tions’’ energy lending policies as needed, and to actively support nuclear power
when they have such a mandate’’.
SEC. 3. MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANK SUPPORT FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY.
Title XV of the International Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262o et seq.)
is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘SEC. 1506. MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANK SUPPORT FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY.
‘‘The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director
at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, and, as the Secretary finds appropriate, any
other multilateral development bank (as defined in section 1307(g)) to use the voice,
vote, and influence of the United States to advocate for—
‘‘(1) the removal of prohibitions at the respective bank against financial and
technical assistance for the generation and distribution of nuclear energy, to the
extent that the prohibitions apply to nuclear technologies that meet or exceed
the quality standards prevalent in the United States or a country allied with
the United States; and

‘‘(2) increased internal capacity-building at the respective bank for the pur-
pose of assessing—
‘‘(A) the potential role of nuclear energy in the energy systems of client
countries; and
‘‘(B) the delivery of financial and technical assistance described in para-
graph (1) to the countries.’’.
SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF NUCLEAR ENERGY ASSISTANCE TRUST FUNDS.
Title XV of the International Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262o et seq.)
is further amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘SEC. 1507. ESTABLISHMENT OF NUCLEAR ENERGY ASSISTANCE TRUST FUNDS.
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States
Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Euro-
pean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and, as the Secretary deems appro-
priate, other international financial institutions (as defined in section 1701(c)(2)) to
use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to establish at each such in-
stitution a trust fund to be known as the ‘Nuclear Energy Assistance Trust Fund’
that meets the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
‘‘(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of such a trust fund shall be the following:
‘‘(1) To provide financial and technical assistance to support the generation
and distribution of nuclear energy in borrowing countries.
‘‘(2) To ensure that the international financial institution makes financing
available on competitive terms, including for the purpose of countering credit
extended by the government of a country that is not a member of the OECD
Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits.
‘‘(3) To exclusively support the adoption of nuclear energy technologies that
meet or exceed the quality standards prevalent in the United States or a coun-
try allied with the United States.
‘‘(4) To strengthen the capacity of the international financial institution to as-
sess, implement, and evaluate nuclear energy projects.
‘‘(c) USE OF TRUST FUND REVENUES.—The revenues of such a trust fund shall be
made available for activities for the purposes described in subsection (b), or the
United States share of the revenues shall be remitted to the general fund of the
Treasury, as the Secretary finds appropriate.
‘‘(d) RULE OF INTERPRETATION.—This section shall not be interpreted to affect the
ability of the United States Governor of, or the United States Executive Director at,
an international financial institution (as so defined) to encourage the provision of
financial or technical assistance from non-trust fund resources of the institution to
support the generation or distribution of nuclear energy.’’.
SEC. 5. INCLUSION IN ANNUAL REPORT.
During the 7-year period that begins with the date of enactment of this Act, the
Chairman of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Finan-
cial Policies shall include in the annual report required by section 1701 of the Inter-
national Financial Institutions Act a description of any progress made—
(1) to promote multilateral development bank (as defined in such section) as-
sistance for nuclear energy; and
(2) to establish a trust fund pursuant to section 1507 of such Act or, as the
case may be, a summary of the activities of any such trust fund.
SEC. 6. SUNSET.
This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall have no force or effect be-
ginning 10 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 21, 2025, by Representative French Hill,
H.R. 1474, the International Nuclear Energy Financing Act of 2025,
requires the United States Executive Director at the World Bank
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to ad-
vocate for the removal of prohibitions against nuclear energy fi-
nancing, permits U.S. representatives at other international finan-
cial institutions to seek similar policy changes, and requires the
Treasury Secretary to advocate for the establishment of a nuclear
energy assistance trust fund at the Bank to support financial and
technical assistance for nuclear projects.

BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Taken together, the multilateral development banks can commit
over $100 billion in annual financing. Nuclear energy should be a
part of an ‘‘all-of-the-above’’ approach to energy and national secu-
rity.
During the World Climate Action Summit of the 28th Conference
of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate
Change in 2023 (COP28), the U.S. was one of 20 countries that
joined a declaration to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.1 At
the COP29 U.N. Climate Change Conference in November 2024,
six more countries joined the declaration to triple global nuclear
energy capacity by 2050, making for a total of 31 nations endorsing
this cause.2 The COP pledges include a commitment from the
United States to invite the international financial institutions to
consider nuclear energy financing. The European Bank for Recon-
struction and Development has announced that it will revisit its
no-financing stance based on borrowing countries’ needs, but a pro-
hibition is still in place at the World Bank. Due to advocacy from
the Financial Services Committee, the Treasury Department has
begun to more explicitly express openness toward nuclear financing
on the board of the Bank. H.R. 1474 is necessary to solidify the
U.S.’s position on this issue.
The World Bank last considered a nuclear energy project more
than 60 years ago, and other multilateral development banks have
followed its lead on supporting new nuclear power generation. At
a time when the United States already finances nuclear energy
abroad through the Export-Import Bank, it makes sense for the
World Bank and other international financial institutions to em-
brace this clean energy source. H.R. 1474 lays the groundwork for
financing by proposing a trust fund at the Bank in order to deliver
new resources for nuclear projects. The trust fund would also fi-
nance technical assistance in borrowing countries as they explore
the potential for nuclear power.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION

resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1474. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is provided here-
in.

H.R. 1474 would require the Department of the Treasury to ad-
vocate for multilateral development banks to provide technical and
financial assistance to promote the use of nuclear energy in foreign
countries. Under the bill, the Administration would report on the
effectiveness of those efforts as part of an existing annual report.
On the basis of information about similar diplomatic efforts and
reporting requirements, CBO estimates that implementing the bill
would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Such
spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Sunita D’Monte. The
estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Di-
rector of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.

DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
The following is a section-by-section analysis of H.R. 1474, the
International Nuclear Energy Financing Act of 2025:
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides that the short title is ‘‘International Nuclear
Energy Financing Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
• Nuclear power is an emissions-free energy source that pro-
duces approximately 30 percent of the world’s low-carbon elec-
tricity. In 2021, 33 countries operated nuclear power plants.
• The People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federa-
tion have sought to export nuclear reactors, reports have con-
cluded that Chinese and Russian nuclear reactors are associ-
ated with higher safety risk than Western nuclear reactors,
and financial and operational support for nuclear power can
extend over decades, allowing Beijing and Moscow to secure
long-term influence in both advanced and developing econo-
mies.
• The Russian Federation is currently building 21 reactors
outside its borders, while the People’s Republic of China is as-
sembling more than a third of reactors under construction
globally.
• In its report, ‘‘International Status and Prospects for Nu-
clear Power 2021’’, the International Atomic Energy Agency
found 28 countries have expressed interest in nuclear power
and are considering, planning or actively working to include it
into their energy mix; another 24 Member States participate in
the Agency’s nuclear infrastructure related activities or are in-
volved in energy planning projects through the technical co-
operation program; ten to twelve embarking Member States
plan to operate nuclear power plants by 2030–2035, rep-
resenting a potential increase of nearly 30 percent in the num-
ber of operating countries; and several embarking countries
have also expressed interest in small modular reactors tech-
nology.
• On December 2, 2023, the United States, alongside more
than 20 other countries, pledged to triple nuclear energy capac-
ity by 2050 and support the financing of nuclear energy
through the World Bank and regional development banks to
encourage the inclusion of nuclear energy in their organiza-
tions’ energy lending policies as needed, and to actively support
nuclear power.

Section 3. Multilateral development bank support for Nuclear En-
ergy
• Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to re-
quire the Secretary of Treasury to instruct the United States
Executive Director at the International Bank for Reconstruc-
tion and Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, and, as the Secretary finds appropriate, any
other defined multilateral development bank to use the voice,
vote, and influence of the United States to advocate for—
—the removal of prohibitions at the respective banks
against financial and technical assistance for the genera-
tion and distribution of nuclear energy; and
—increased internal capacity-building at the respective
banks for the purpose of assessing—
D the potential role of nuclear energy in the energy
systems of client countries; and
D the delivery of financial and technical assistance
described in the bill to the countries.
Section 4. Establishment of Nuclear Energy Assistance Trust Funds
• Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to re-
quire the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would attempt to require the multilateral development
banks (MDBs) to reverse their longstanding prohibitions on public
subsidies for nuclear energy. The MDBs do not currently fund
these nuclear power generation projects because of both unique
safety and national security concerns, and requiring them to fund
these projects would come at the expense of readily available alter-
native forms of energy generation and over the objections of local
communities around the world.
As history has shown, accidents at nuclear plants can cause dan-
gerous levels of radiation to be released in nearby communities.
For example, in 2011, an earthquake cut off external power to Ja-
pan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors and the subsequent tsu-
nami disabled backup diesel generators. The damage to three of the
reactor cores contaminated a wide area surrounding the plant,
forced the evacuation of nearly half a million residents, and led to
Japan reducing its use of nuclear power.1 The accident sparked
protests in other nations considering nuclear power generation
projects.2
There are also substantial risks associated with the storage of
spent nuclear fuel, the major component of the radioactive waste
produced by nuclear reactors. According to the U.S. Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission, waste from nuclear reactors is a long-term
problem because ‘‘they produce fatal radiation doses during short
periods of direct exposure. For example, 10 years after removal
from a reactor, the surface dose rate for a typical spent fuel assem-
bly exceeds 10,000 rem/hour—far greater than the fatal whole-body
dose for humans of about 500 rem received all at once. If isotopes
from these high-level wastes get into groundwater or rivers, they
may enter food chains. The dose produced through this indirect ex-
posure would be much smaller than a direct-exposure dose, but a
much larger population could be exposed.’’3 Even the wealthiest of
nations, like those in the European Union, have trouble with find-
ing permanent sites to store their nuclear waste.4
Further, traditionally, the poorest neighborhoods and commu-
nities of color suffer disproportionate effects of nuclear waste, con-
struction, and testing.5 For example, in completing the Manhattan
Project, the U.S. displaced American Indian and non-Indian resi-
dents off of their Washington-state land, with wholly insufficient
compensation for the forced move.6 When the U.S. Army was en-

gaging in radiation testing in the 1950s and 1960s, residents of St.
Louis’ Black public housing complex, Pruitt-Igoe Housing, were un-
wittingly subjected to toxic spraying in their community.7 The
same disparities continue to exist today in the U.S. as new sites
for construction and waste are contemplated. One study found that
African-American populations were found in disproportionately
greater numbers to live within a 50-mile radius of nuclear plants
than white populations who were more likely to live beyond the 50-
mile mark.8 There are, thus, ongoing concerns that these ‘‘nuclear
frontline communities’’9 may be determined by which communities
are the least capable of fighting back against the risks associated
with those decisions.10 This concern extends to developing coun-
tries, sometimes desperate for foreign investment dollars, which
may be more vulnerable to requests from wealthier nations to ac-
cept imported radioactive waste for storage, thus dumping this
dangerous remnant of the power generation process on the poorest
of global communities.
Importantly, spent fuel can also be reprocessed into weapons-us-
able plutonium.11 ‘‘Dirty bombs’’ and other unauthorized uses of
nuclear waste can lead to illness, death, environmental damage,
and other significant and long-term socio-economic costs.12 As stat-
ed by the author of the World Nuclear Waste Report, ‘‘We are talk-
ing about time frames that are beyond the human scale of what we
can think of. We still don’t know where to put the waste safely in
a way that nobody will get harmed, that it is not vulnerable to ter-
rorist attacks, that it is not being stolen to build nuclear bombs.’’13
Notably, while the bill does require that its newly established
Trust Fund, ‘‘support the adoption of nuclear energy technologies
that meet or exceed the quality standards prevalent in the United
States or a country allied with the United States,’’ the current ad-
ministration is already working to gut those standards. In his first
month in office, President Trump declared, via executive order,14
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will no longer be viewed
by his Administration as an independent agency.15 This is despite
being established as such by Congress to ensure the safe use of ra-
dioactive materials for civilian purposes, while protecting people
and the environment, free from political and industry influence.16
Demonstrating the importance of this independence was the
Fukushima accident’s investigation report, which determined, ‘‘The
TEPCO Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident was the result of

collusion between the government, the regulators and TEPCO, and
the lack of governance by said parties.’’17 The Trump Administra-
tion rush towards a ‘‘long-awaited nuclear renaissance,’’18 has also
resulted in two other executive orders designed to reverse agency
actions which ‘‘impose an undue burden on the identification, de-
velopment or use of . . . nuclear energy resources’’19 and to facili-
tate the movement and use of uranium for the generation of nu-
clear power.20 We know, too, that Trump, Elon Musk, and their
‘‘Department of Government Efficiency’’ have haphazardly fired or
urged nuclear scientists and safety staff to resign,21 closed a nu-
clear waste disposal office,22 and illegally dismissed the Congres-
sionally mandated Inspector Generals at the Departments of En-
ergy and Interior as well as the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy.23
Finally, the price tag for the construction of a new nuclear power
plant is upwards of tens of billions of dollars,24 a significant portion
of which comes from the plant’s construction.25 Some of the con-
struction cost is due to the timeline: It can take decades to develop
nuclear power projects26 and further costs can accrue from unex-
pected lengthy delays in a project’s financing.27 There are notable
nuclear power projects in the U.S. that have experienced signifi-
cant time and cost overruns.28 The two newest Vogtle plant reac-
tors, for example, were started in Georgia in 2009 and expected to
come online by 2017 at a cost of $14 billion.29 The project was not
completed, however, until 2024 and cost close to $35 billion.30
Given these considerations, financially constrained MDBs must
make choices regarding which energy infrastructure projects to
prioritize, especially if funding nuclear energy projects might re-
quire a reduction in funding renewable energy projects, such as
solar and wind-powered options. Support for such projects could
also curtail funding opportunities in other sectors addressed by the
MDBs, such as nutrition, education, healthcare, and sanitation.
During the markup, Rep. Casten (D–IL) proposed an amendment
that would mandate that the MDBs prioritize financial and tech-
nical assistance to the development of zero-emission energy sources
and infrastructure, including nuclear, hydroelectricity, solar, wind,

Waters (D–CA) proposed an amendment that would delay the fi-
nancing of nuclear energy financial and technical assistance at
each MDB until they individually adopt policies that: 1) obtain the
consent of local communities and civil society organizations prior to
providing nuclear financing; 2) require a comprehensive plan ad-
