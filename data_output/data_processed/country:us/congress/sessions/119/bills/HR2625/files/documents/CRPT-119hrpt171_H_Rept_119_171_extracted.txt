terminology within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vet-
erans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program. Specifically,
this bill would amend ‘‘employment handicap’’ language to ‘‘employ-
ment barrier’’ in the VR&E program.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

Section 3:
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Employment and Readi-
ness Yield Act’’ or the ‘‘VERY Act of 2025.’’

Section 4:
Section 2: Update Of Certain Terminology Regarding Veteran Em-
ployment
Chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code, provides the statutory
guidance governing the VA VR&E program. The VR&E program
has seen a 46% increase in applicants after the implementation of
the PACT Act [P.L. 117–168]. Many veterans with service-con-
nected disabilities take advantage of this program after they tran-
sition out of the military. The purpose of the VR&E Program is to
assist veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabil-
ities to obtain and maintain suitable employment and/or achieve
independent daily living.
The programs cover short and long-term education or training,
resume development, and employment services at institutions of
higher learning, certificates, and licenses for education, and entre-
preneur options. Family members of veterans with severe service-
connected disabilities may also be eligible for education and career
counseling.
The term ‘‘employment handicap’’ within the VR&E handbook, is
considered outdated in the context of the VR&E program. This is
because the term ‘handicap’ has a negative connotation in the dis-
ability community as it implies limitations or incapacity.1 This is
an important distinction as the severity of a veteran’s employment
handicap is critical to determining their eligibility for VR&E.
The Committee believes implementing this change in the statute
would rightfully remove the term ‘handicap’ and replace it with a
broader term that would not unintentionally restrict a veteran’s ca-
pabilities, independence, and opportunities to access the VA VR&E
program. Further, the Committee believes that this change would
honor and respect the sacrifices made by our nation’s veterans and
could encourage more service-disabled veterans to participate in
the VR&E program.

COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion, a quorum being present, and ordered H.R. 2625, to be re-
ported favorably to the House of Representatives by voice vote.
A motion by Ranking Member Takano to report H.R. 2625 favor-
ably to the House of Representatives was agreed to by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
In compliance with clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, no recorded votes were taken on amend-
ments or in connection with ordering H.R. 2625 reported to the
House.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 2625 are to provide modern terminology changes
to the Veterans Readiness and Employment handbook.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 2625 does not contain any Congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9 of rule
XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the Congressional Budget Of-
fice cost estimate on this measure.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1458,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

H.R. 2625 would replace the term ‘‘employment handicap’’ with
‘‘employment barrier’’ in title 38 of the U.S. Code, which governs
veterans’ benefits.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers programs
that offer vocational rehabilitation assistance to veterans with
service-connected disabilities that limit their ability to find employ-
ment. That limitation is referred to as a ‘‘handicap’’ under current
law. Much of VA’s recently published materials concerning the vo-
cational rehabilitation program have already replaced references to
‘‘handicap’’ with ‘‘barrier’’ or similar terms. CBO expects that the
costs to update any additional material would be less than
$500,000 over the 2025–2035 period; any spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Paul B.A. Holland. The
estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Di-
rector of Budget Analysis.

Director, Congressional Budget Office.

STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
2625 would establish or reauthorize a program of the Federal Gov-
ernment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, a
program that was included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 7:

ment

this section, a rehabilitation program may not be afforded to a vet-
eran under this chapter after the end of the twelve-year period be-
ginning on the date of such veteran’s discharge or release from ac-
tive military, naval, air, or space service.
(b)(1) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a vet-
eran has been prevented from participating in a vocational reha-
bilitation program under this chapter within the period of eligi-
bility prescribed in subsection (a) of this section because a medical
condition of such veteran made it infeasible for such veteran to
participate in such a program, the twelve-year period of eligibility
shall not run during the period of time that such veteran was so
prevented from participating in such a program, and such period
of eligibility shall again begin to run on the first day following such
veteran’s recovery from such condition on which it is reasonably
feasible, as determined under regulations which the Secretary shall
prescribe, for such veteran to participate in such a program.
(2) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter within the period of eligibility pre-
scribed in subsection (a) of this section because—
(A) such veteran had not met the requirement of a discharge
or release from active military, naval, air, or space service

thority, or (ii) the Secretary determined, under regulations pre-
scribed by the Secretary, that such discharge or release was
under conditions other than dishonorable, or

the twelve-year period of eligibility shall not run during the period
of time that such veteran was so prevented from participating in
such a program.
(3) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter within the period of eligibility pre-
scribed in subsection (a) of this section because such veteran had
not established the existence of a service-connected disability rated
at 10 percent or more, the twelve-year period of eligibility shall not
run during the period such veteran was so prevented from partici-
pating in such a program.
(c) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
is in need of services to overcome a serious øemployment handicap¿
employment barrier, such veteran may be afforded a vocational re-
habilitation program after the expiration of the period of eligibility
otherwise applicable to such veteran if the Secretary also deter-
mines, on the basis of such veteran’s current øemployment handi-
cap¿ employment barrier and need for such services, that an exten-
sion of the applicable period of eligibility is necessary for such vet-
eran and—
(1) that such veteran had not previously been rehabilitated
to the point of employability;
(2) that such veteran had previously been rehabilitated to
the point of employability but (A) the need for such services
had arisen out of a worsening of such veteran’s service-con-
nected disability that precludes such veteran from performing
the duties of the occupation for which such veteran was pre-
viously trained in a vocational rehabilitation program under
this chapter, or (B) the occupation for which such veteran had
been so trained is not suitable in view of such veteran’s current
øemployment handicap¿ employment barrier and capabilities;
or
(3) under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe,
that an extension of the period of eligibility of such veteran is
necessary to accomplish the purposes of a rehabilitation pro-
gram for such veteran.
(d) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran’s disability or disabilities are so severe that the achievement
of a vocational goal currently is not reasonably feasible, such vet-
eran may be afforded a program of independent living services and
assistance in accordance with the provisions of section 3120 of this
title after the expiration of the period of eligibility otherwise appli-
cable to such veteran if the Secretary also determines that an ex-
tension of the period of eligibility of such veteran is necessary for
such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living.
(e)(1) The limitation in subsection (a) shall not apply to a reha-
bilitation program described in paragraph (2).
(2) A rehabilitation program described in this paragraph is a re-
habilitation program pursued by a veteran under section 3102(b) of
this title.
(f) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran was prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter within the period of eligibility oth-
erwise prescribed in this section as a result of being ordered to
serve on active duty under section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d),

charged or released from active military, naval, or air service on or

(h)(1) In the case of a veteran who is eligible for a vocational re-
habilitation program under this chapter and who is prevented from
participating in the vocational rehabilitation program within the
period of eligibility prescribed in subsection (a) because of a covered
reason, as determined by the Secretary, such period of eligibility—
(A) shall not run during the period the veteran is so pre-
vented from participating in such program; and
(B) shall again begin running on a date determined by the
Secretary that is—
(i) not earlier than the first day after the veteran is able
to resume participation in a vocational rehabilitation pro-
gram under this chapter; and
(ii) not later than 90 days after that day.
(2) In this subsection, a covered reason is—
(A) the temporary or permanent closure of an educational in-
stitution by reason of an emergency situation; or
(B) another reason that prevents the veteran from partici-
pating in the vocational rehabilitation program, as determined
by the Secretary.
(h) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran

tion program under this chapter within the 12-year period of eligi-
bility prescribed in subsection (a) due to an emergency situation,
such 12-year period—
(1) shall not run during the period the individual is so pre-
vented from participating such program; and
(2) shall again begin running on the first day after the indi-
vidual is able to resume participation in such program.

requirement under the preceding sentence to the extent the Sec-
retary determines appropriate.
(c)(1) The Secretary shall have the authority to administer this
chapter by prioritizing the provision of services under this chapter
based on need, as determined by the Secretary, including with re-
spect to providing priority for services under subsection (a)(12) to
veterans with the most severe service-connected disabilities who re-
quire homebound training or self-employment, or both homebound

the type of program that the veteran was pursuing, for two addi-
tional months, if the Secretary determines that the veteran is nega-
tively affected by the emergency situation.

Section 17:

3106(c) of this title may not exceed twelve months, except that such
period may be extended for additional periods of up to six months
each if the Secretary determines before granting any such exten-

extension, a determination can be made whether the achievement
of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible in the case of such vet-
eran.
(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) and in sub-

Section 18:
section (c), the period of a vocational rehabilitation program for a
veteran under this chapter following a determination of the current

forty-eight months, except that the counseling and placement and
postplacement services described in section 3104(a)(2) and (5) of

goal may not exceed 12 months.
(3)(A) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a vet-
eran has been prevented from participating in counseling and
placement and postplacement services described in paragraphs (2)
and (5) of section 3104(a) of this title due to an emergency situa-
tion, the Secretary shall extend the period during which the Sec-
retary may provide such counseling and placement and
postplacement services for the veteran for a period equal to the
number of months that the veteran was so prevented from partici-
pating in such counseling and services, as determined by the Sec-
retary.
(B) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter due to an emergency situation, the
Secretary shall extend the period of the veteran’s vocational reha-
bilitation program for a period equal to the number of months that
the veteran was so prevented from participating in the vocational
rehabilitation program, as determined by the Secretary.
(c) The Secretary may extend the period of a vocational rehabili-
tation program for a veteran to the extent that the Secretary deter-
mines that an extension of such period is necessary to enable such
veteran to achieve a vocational goal if the Secretary also deter-
mines—
(1) that such veteran had previously been rehabilitated to
the point of employability but (A) such veteran’s need for fur-
ther vocational rehabilitation has arisen out of a worsening of
such veteran’s service-connected disability that precludes such
veteran from performing the duties of the occupation for which
such veteran had been so rehabilitated, or (B) the occupation
for which such veteran had been so rehabilitated is not suit-
able in view of such veteran’s current øemployment handicap¿
employment barrier and capabilities; or
(2) under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe,
that such veteran has a serious øemployment handicap¿ em-
ployment barrier and that an extension of such period is nec-
essary to accomplish the purposes of a rehabilitation program
for such veteran.
(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the period of a pro-
gram of independent living services and assistance for a veteran
under this chapter (following a determination by the Secretary that
such veteran’s disability or disabilities are so severe that the
achievement of a vocational goal currently is not reasonably fea-
sible) may not exceed twenty-four months.
(2)(A) The period of a program of independent living services and
assistance for a veteran under this chapter may exceed twenty-four
months as follows:
(i) If the Secretary determines that a longer period is nec-
essary and likely to result in a substantial increase in the vet-
eran’s level of independence in daily living.
(ii) If the veteran served on active duty during the Post-9/11
Global Operations period and has a severe disability (as deter-
mined by the Secretary for purposes of this clause) incurred or
aggravated in such service.

(2) The payment of the subsistence allowance and other assist-
ance referred to in paragraph (1) is the payment of such an allow-
ance or assistance for the period described in paragraph (3) to a

tion program as a result of being ordered to serve on active duty
under section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, 12304,
12304a, or 12304b of title 10.
(3) The period for which, by reason of this subsection, a subsist-
ence allowance and other assistance is not charged against entitle-
ment or counted toward the applicable aggregate period under sec-
tion 3695 of this title shall be the period of participation in the vo-
cational rehabilitation program for which the veteran failed to re-
ceive credit or with respect to which the veteran lost training time,
as determined by the Secretary.

Section 19:
§3106. Initial and extended evaluations; determinations re-
garding serious employment handicap
(a) The Secretary shall provide any veteran who has a service-
connected disability rated at 10 percent or more and who applies
for benefits under this chapter with an initial evaluation consisting
of such services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title as are
necessary (1) to determine whether such veteran is entitled to and
eligible for benefits under this chapter, and (2) in the case of a vet-
eran who is determined to be entitled to and eligible for such bene-
fits, to determine—
(A) whether such veteran has a serious øemployment handi-
cap¿ employment barrier, and
(B) whether the achievement of a vocational goal currently
is reasonably feasible for such veteran if it is reasonably fea-
sible to make such determination without extended evaluation.
(b) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran has a serious øemployment handicap¿ employment barrier and
that the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably
feasible for such veteran, such veteran shall be provided an individ-

suant to subsection (a) of this section, whether or not the achieve-
ment of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible, such vet-
eran shall be provided with an extended evaluation consisting of
the services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title, such serv-
ices under this chapter as the Secretary determines necessary to
improve such veteran’s potential for participation in a program of
services designed to achieve a vocational goal and enable such vet-
eran to achieve maximum independence in daily living, and assist-
ance as authorized by section 3108 of this title.
(d) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran has a serious øemployment handicap¿ employment barrier and
also determines, following such initial and any such extended eval-
uation, that achievement of a vocational goal currently is not rea-
sonably feasible, the Secretary shall determine whether the veteran
is capable of participating in a program of independent living serv-
ices and assistance under section 3120 of this title.
(e) The Secretary shall in all cases determine as expeditiously as
possible whether the achievement of a vocational goal by a veteran
currently is reasonably feasible. In the case of a veteran provided
extended evaluation under subsection (c) of this section (including
any periods of extensions under section 3105(a) of this title), the
Secretary shall make such determination not later than the end of
such extended evaluation or period of extension, as the case may
be. In determining whether the achievement of a vocational goal
currently is reasonably feasible, the Secretary shall resolve any
reasonable doubt in favor of determining that such achievement
currently is reasonably feasible.
(f) In connection with each period of extended evaluation of a vet-
eran and each rehabilitation program for a veteran who is deter-
mined to have a serious øemployment handicap¿ employment bar-
rier, the Secretary shall assign a Department of Veterans Affairs
employee to be responsible for the management and followup of the
provision of all services (including appropriate coordination of em-
ployment assistance under section 3117 of this title) and assistance

terminology within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vet-
erans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program. Specifically,
this bill would amend ‘‘employment handicap’’ language to ‘‘employ-
ment barrier’’ in the VR&E program.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Employment and Readi-
ness Yield Act’’ or the ‘‘VERY Act of 2025.’’
Section 2: Update Of Certain Terminology Regarding Veteran Em-
ployment
Chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code, provides the statutory
guidance governing the VA VR&E program. The VR&E program
has seen a 46% increase in applicants after the implementation of
the PACT Act [P.L. 117–168]. Many veterans with service-con-
nected disabilities take advantage of this program after they tran-
sition out of the military. The purpose of the VR&E Program is to
assist veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabil-
ities to obtain and maintain suitable employment and/or achieve
independent daily living.
The programs cover short and long-term education or training,
resume development, and employment services at institutions of
higher learning, certificates, and licenses for education, and entre-
preneur options. Family members of veterans with severe service-
connected disabilities may also be eligible for education and career
counseling.
The term ‘‘employment handicap’’ within the VR&E handbook, is
considered outdated in the context of the VR&E program. This is
because the term ‘handicap’ has a negative connotation in the dis-
ability community as it implies limitations or incapacity.1 This is
an important distinction as the severity of a veteran’s employment
handicap is critical to determining their eligibility for VR&E.
The Committee believes implementing this change in the statute
would rightfully remove the term ‘handicap’ and replace it with a
broader term that would not unintentionally restrict a veteran’s ca-
pabilities, independence, and opportunities to access the VA VR&E
program. Further, the Committee believes that this change would
honor and respect the sacrifices made by our nation’s veterans and
could encourage more service-disabled veterans to participate in
the VR&E program.

H.R. 2625 would replace the term ‘‘employment handicap’’ with
‘‘employment barrier’’ in title 38 of the U.S. Code, which governs
veterans’ benefits.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers programs
that offer vocational rehabilitation assistance to veterans with
service-connected disabilities that limit their ability to find employ-
ment. That limitation is referred to as a ‘‘handicap’’ under current
law. Much of VA’s recently published materials concerning the vo-
cational rehabilitation program have already replaced references to
‘‘handicap’’ with ‘‘barrier’’ or similar terms. CBO expects that the
costs to update any additional material would be less than
$500,000 over the 2025–2035 period; any spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Paul B.A. Holland. The
estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Di-
rector of Budget Analysis.

STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
2625 would establish or reauthorize a program of the Federal Gov-
ernment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, a
program that was included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 would establish the short title of the bill as the ‘‘Vet-
erans Employment Readiness Yield Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘VERY Act
of 2025.’’
Section 2: Update of certain terminology regarding veteran employ-
ment
Section 2 would amend Chapter 31 of Title 38 by striking ‘‘em-
ployment handicap’’ and inserting ‘‘employment barrier’’ in every
place that it occurs.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i), a person shall be consid-
ered to have exhausted such person’s rights to regular compensa-

eran under this chapter after the end of the twelve-year period be-
ginning on the date of such veteran’s discharge or release from ac-
tive military, naval, air, or space service.
(b)(1) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a vet-
eran has been prevented from participating in a vocational reha-
bilitation program under this chapter within the period of eligi-
bility prescribed in subsection (a) of this section because a medical
condition of such veteran made it infeasible for such veteran to
participate in such a program, the twelve-year period of eligibility
shall not run during the period of time that such veteran was so
prevented from participating in such a program, and such period
of eligibility shall again begin to run on the first day following such
veteran’s recovery from such condition on which it is reasonably
feasible, as determined under regulations which the Secretary shall
prescribe, for such veteran to participate in such a program.
(2) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter within the period of eligibility pre-
scribed in subsection (a) of this section because—

or release from active military, naval, air, or space service
under conditions other than dishonorable before (i) the nature
of such discharge or release was changed by appropriate au-
thority, or (ii) the Secretary determined, under regulations pre-
scribed by the Secretary, that such discharge or release was
under conditions other than dishonorable, or

of time that such veteran was so prevented from participating in
such a program.
(3) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter within the period of eligibility pre-
scribed in subsection (a) of this section because such veteran had
not established the existence of a service-connected disability rated
at 10 percent or more, the twelve-year period of eligibility shall not
run during the period such veteran was so prevented from partici-
pating in such a program.
(c) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
is in need of services to overcome a serious øemployment handicap¿
employment barrier, such veteran may be afforded a vocational re-
habilitation program after the expiration of the period of eligibility
otherwise applicable to such veteran if the Secretary also deter-
mines, on the basis of such veteran’s current øemployment handi-
cap¿ employment barrier and need for such services, that an exten-
sion of the applicable period of eligibility is necessary for such vet-
eran and—
(1) that such veteran had not previously been rehabilitated
to the point of employability;
(2) that such veteran had previously been rehabilitated to
the point of employability but (A) the need for such services
had arisen out of a worsening of such veteran’s service-con-
nected disability that precludes such veteran from performing
the duties of the occupation for which such veteran was pre-
viously trained in a vocational rehabilitation program under
this chapter, or (B) the occupation for which such veteran had
been so trained is not suitable in view of such veteran’s current
øemployment handicap¿ employment barrier and capabilities;
or
(3) under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe,
that an extension of the period of eligibility of such veteran is
necessary to accomplish the purposes of a rehabilitation pro-
gram for such veteran.
(d) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran’s disability or disabilities are so severe that the achievement
of a vocational goal currently is not reasonably feasible, such vet-
eran may be afforded a program of independent living services and
assistance in accordance with the provisions of section 3120 of this
title after the expiration of the period of eligibility otherwise appli-
cable to such veteran if the Secretary also determines that an ex-
tension of the period of eligibility of such veteran is necessary for
such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living.
(e)(1) The limitation in subsection (a) shall not apply to a reha-
bilitation program described in paragraph (2).
(2) A rehabilitation program described in this paragraph is a re-
habilitation program pursued by a veteran under section 3102(b) of

eran was prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-
tion program under this chapter within the period of eligibility oth-
erwise prescribed in this section as a result of being ordered to

(A) shall not run during the period the veteran is so pre-
vented from participating in such program; and
(B) shall again begin running on a date determined by the
Secretary that is—
(i) not earlier than the first day after the veteran is able

gram under this chapter; and

stitution by reason of an emergency situation; or

pating in the vocational rehabilitation program, as determined
by the Secretary.

tion program under this chapter within the 12-year period of eligi-
bility prescribed in subsection (a) due to an emergency situation,

(1) shall not run during the period the individual is so pre-
vented from participating such program; and

3106(c) of this title may not exceed twelve months, except that such
period may be extended for additional periods of up to six months

tion, the Secretary shall extend the period during which the Sec-
retary may provide such counseling and placement and
postplacement services for the veteran for a period equal to the
number of months that the veteran was so prevented from partici-
pating in such counseling and services, as determined by the Sec-
retary.
(B) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran
has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilita-

rehabilitation program, as determined by the Secretary.
(c) The Secretary may extend the period of a vocational rehabili-
tation program for a veteran to the extent that the Secretary deter-
mines that an extension of such period is necessary to enable such
veteran to achieve a vocational goal if the Secretary also deter-
mines—
(1) that such veteran had previously been rehabilitated to

ther vocational rehabilitation has arisen out of a worsening of

able in view of such veteran’s current øemployment handicap¿
employment barrier and capabilities; or

ployment barrier and that an extension of such period is nec-
essary to accomplish the purposes of a rehabilitation program

sible) may not exceed twenty-four months.

assistance for a veteran under this chapter may exceed twenty-four
months as follows:

Global Operations period and has a severe disability (as deter-
mined by the Secretary for purposes of this clause) incurred or

§3106. Initial and extended evaluations; determinations re-
garding serious employment handicap
(a) The Secretary shall provide any veteran who has a service-
connected disability rated at 10 percent or more and who applies
for benefits under this chapter with an initial evaluation consisting
of such services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title as are
necessary (1) to determine whether such veteran is entitled to and
eligible for benefits under this chapter, and (2) in the case of a vet-
eran who is determined to be entitled to and eligible for such bene-
fits, to determine—
(A) whether such veteran has a serious øemployment handi-
cap¿ employment barrier, and

sible to make such determination without extended evaluation.
(b) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran has a serious øemployment handicap¿ employment barrier and
that the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably
feasible for such veteran, such veteran shall be provided an individ-

suant to subsection (a) of this section, whether or not the achieve-
ment of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible, such vet-
eran shall be provided with an extended evaluation consisting of
the services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title, such serv-
ices under this chapter as the Secretary determines necessary to
improve such veteran’s potential for participation in a program of
services designed to achieve a vocational goal and enable such vet-
eran to achieve maximum independence in daily living, and assist-
ance as authorized by section 3108 of this title.
(d) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a vet-
eran has a serious øemployment handicap¿ employment barrier and
also determines, following such initial and any such extended eval-
uation, that achievement of a vocational goal currently is not rea-
sonably feasible, the Secretary shall determine whether the veteran
is capable of participating in a program of independent living serv-
ices and assistance under section 3120 of this title.
(e) The Secretary shall in all cases determine as expeditiously as
possible whether the achievement of a vocational goal by a veteran
currently is reasonably feasible. In the case of a veteran provided
extended evaluation under subsection (c) of this section (including
any periods of extensions under section 3105(a) of this title), the
Secretary shall make such determination not later than the end of
such extended evaluation or period of extension, as the case may
be. In determining whether the achievement of a vocational goal
currently is reasonably feasible, the Secretary shall resolve any
reasonable doubt in favor of determining that such achievement
currently is reasonably feasible.
(f) In connection with each period of extended evaluation of a vet-
eran and each rehabilitation program for a veteran who is deter-
mined to have a serious øemployment handicap¿ employment bar-
rier, the Secretary shall assign a Department of Veterans Affairs
employee to be responsible for the management and followup of the
provision of all services (including appropriate coordination of em-
ployment assistance under section 3117 of this title) and assistance
under this chapter to such veteran.

program with the objective of self-employment in a small business
enterprise, the Secretary may, subject to the limitations and cri-
teria provided for in such paragraph, provide such veteran with

equipment and initial stocks and supplies, or assistance in acquir-
ing them, are not available through the State program or other
sources.

termined under section 3106(d) or (e) of this title that the achieve-
ment of a vocational goal currently is not reasonably feasible.
(c) The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, include
