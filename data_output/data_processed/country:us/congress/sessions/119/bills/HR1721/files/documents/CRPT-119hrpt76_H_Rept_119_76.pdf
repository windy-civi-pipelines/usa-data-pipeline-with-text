H.R. 1721 requires the Secretary of Commerce to study and report
on products that are in high demand across the critical infrastruc-
ture sectors. The study must (1) identify the products in high de-
mand across those sectors that are being imported due to manufac-
turing, material, or supply chain constraints; and (2) analyze the
costs, benefits, and feasibility of manufacturing those products in
the United States.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Manufacturing is an essential component for the U.S., not only
in terms of economic stability and creating American jobs, but also
to ensure global leadership in spaces like developing and deploying
emerging technologies.
The U.S. must examine where the impediments exist for manu-
facturing in the U.S. and, in particular, manufacturing critical
products that are in high demand in the U.S. Failure to do so may
cause companies offering products and services to become reliant
upon countries like China for critical components and goods nec-
essary for those products and services. H.R. 1721 is a crucial bill
to establish the pathway to secure American leadership in domestic
manufacturing and innovation, and to protect economic and na-
tional security.
COMMITTEE ACTION
On September 20, 2023, the Subcommittee on Innovation, Data,
and Commerce held a hearing on H.R. 5390.1 The hearing was en-
titled, ‘‘Proposals to Enhance Product Safety and Transparency for
Americans.’’ The Subcommittee received testimony from:
• Chris Griswold, Policy Director, American Compass;
• Deena Ghazarian, Founder and Chief Executive Officer,
Austere;
• Justin Slaughter, Policy Director, Paradigm; and
• Scott Paul, President, Alliance for American Manufac-
turing.
On March 4, 2025, the full Committee on Energy and Commerce
met in open markup session and ordered H.R. 1721, without
amendment, favorably reported to the House by a voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
