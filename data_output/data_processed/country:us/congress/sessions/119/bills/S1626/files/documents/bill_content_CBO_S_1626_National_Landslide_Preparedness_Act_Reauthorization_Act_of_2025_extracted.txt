Estimated Increases in Spending Subject to Appropriation Under S. 1626Data and Supplemental InformationLegislative Information S. 1626 would amend and reauthorize programs established under the National Landslide Preparedness Act. The bill would authorize the appropriation of the following amounts: $47 million annually from 2025 through 2030 for the National Landslide Hazards Reduction Program. The authorization for the program expired in 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration allocated roughly $14 million for the program in 2024. $40 million each year from 2025 through 2034 for the 3D Elevation Program, a USGS program to acquire high-resolution 3‑dimensional elevation data. The authorization for the program expired at the end of 2024. No funds were allocated for the program in that year. $30 million annually from 2026 through 2033 to expand the Federal Priority Streamgage program, a countrywide network of automated stations that monitor the hydrological conditions of rivers and streams. Under current law, $10 million is authorized to be appropriated for that program through 2028. $30 million in 2026 for the USGS to establish a water observation system for compiling real-time data on water quality and for forecasting floods and droughts. CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted near the end of 2025 and that the specified amounts will be provided in each year. Based on historical spending patterns for the programs, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $588 million over the 2025‑2030 period and $317 million after 2030. The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).
