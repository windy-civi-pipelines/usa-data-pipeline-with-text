STATEMENT OF BUDGET AUTHORITY AND RELATED ITEMS
The resolution does not provide new budget authority, new
spending authority, new credit authority, or an increase or de-
crease in revenues or tax expenditures and a statement under
House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(2) and section 308(a)(1) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 is not required.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
In compliance with House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(3), the Com-
mittee states that the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
did not submit a cost estimate and comparison under section 402
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
On January 9, 2025, Robert Rochford (‘‘Contestant’’) filed a No-
tice of Contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives pur-
suant to the Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA).1 Contestant
ran as a Republican for the office of Representative to the United
States Congress representing the Fourteenth Congressional Dis-
trict of the State of Florida in the November 5, 2024, general elec-
tion. The other principal candidate for the Fourteenth Congres-
sional District was incumbent Democrat Kathy Castor
(‘‘Contestee’’). On November 19, 2024, the Florida Secretary of
State issued a Certificate of Election to the Clerk of the House of
Representatives, certifying Contestee as the winner of the Four-
teenth Congressional District.
BASIS OF CONTEST
In his Notice of Contest, Contestant alleges that the election for
Congressional District 14 in Florida was marred by irregularities
in the administration of the election, including statutory violations,
misconduct, and election fraud.
STANDING
To have standing under the FCEA, a contestant must have been
a candidate for election to the House of Representatives in the last
preceding election and claim a right to the Contestee’s seat.2 Con-
testant was the Republican nominee and his name appeared as a
candidate for the Fourteenth Congressional District on the official
ballot for the November 5, 2024 election, thereby satisfying the
standing requirement.
TIMING/NOTICE
FCEA requires that a contestant ‘‘shall, within thirty days after
the result of such election shall have been declared by the officer
or Board of Canvassers authorized by law to declare such result,
file with the Clerk and serve upon the contestee written notice of
his intention to contest such election.’’3 The Notice of Contest was
filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives on January 9,
2025, outside the prescribed time periods of the FCEA.

ANALYSIS
The Committee finds that Contestant has failed to timely file his
notice of contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
Under the FCEA, the deadline for Contestant to file with the Clerk
of the House of Representatives to contest this election would have
been December 19, 2024, 30 days after the Secretary of State of
Florida officially certified the election results for this contest. Con-
testant filed his notice of contest with the Clerk on January 9,
2025, a date occurring after the prescribed time period, therefore
the Committee finds that this claim must be dismissed due to un-
timely filing.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Committee therefore con-
cludes that this contest should be dismissed.
