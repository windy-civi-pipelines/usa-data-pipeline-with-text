INFORMING CONSUMERS ABOUT SMART DEVICES ACT
APRIL28, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 28]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 28) to require the disclosure of a
camera or recording capability in certain internet-connected de-
vices, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with-
out amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 28 is to require the disclosure of a camera or
recording capability in certain internet-connected devices.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Internet-connected smart devices are becoming increasingly com-
mon in U.S. households. Sixty-nine percent of U.S. houses have at
least one smart home product; 83 million households own more
than one such product.1 The U.S. smart home market is expected
to reach $87.25 billion by 2032, up from $31.85 billion in 2023.2
While internet-connected devices can provide enhanced capabilities
for household products and increase consumer convenience, con-
sumers may not expect their refrigerators, thermostats, or other
products to contain a camera or microphone that could surveil,
record, and transmit to others their private home activity. Con-

sumers have a strong privacy interest in knowing whether a house-
hold product has audio or video recording and transmission capa-
bilities before they purchase the product.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 28 would do the following:
• Require each manufacturer of a covered device to disclose,
clearly and conspicuously and prior to purchase, whether the
covered device contains a camera or microphone as a compo-
nent of the covered device.
• Authorize the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce the
Act as a violation of a rule prescribed under section 18 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act.3
• Require the FTC to issue guidance (including tailored guid-
ance) to assist manufacturers in complying with the require-
ments of the Act.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 28, the Informing Consumers About Smart Devices Act, was
introduced on January 7, 2025, by Senator Cruz (for himself and
Senators Cantwell and Curtis) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On
March 12, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and,
by voice vote, ordered S. 28 reported favorably without amendment.
118th Congress
S. 90, the Informing Consumers About Smart Devices Act, was
introduced on January 25, 2023, by Senator Cruz (for himself and
Senator Cantwell) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On March 22,
2023, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice
vote, ordered S. 90 reported favorably with amendments. Senator
Warnock became an additional cosponsor on March 28, 2023.
H.R. 538, a House bill similar to S. 90, was introduced on Janu-
ary 26, 2023, by Representative Curtis (for himself and Represent-
ative Moulton) and was referred to the Committee on Energy and
Commerce of the House of Representatives. On February 27, 2023,
H.R. 538 passed the House by a vote of 406–12.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
315 U.S.C. 57a.

S. 28 would require manufacturers of Internet-connected devices
to disclose to consumers whether such devices have microphones or
cameras. The bill would direct the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) to establish guidance for manufacturers to follow when noti-
fying consumers and to enforce any violations of the bill’s require-
ments.
Using information from the FTC and the cost of similar require-
ments, CBO expects that the FTC would need three employees to
issue guidance in 2026 and four employees in each year from 2027
through 2030 to enforce the bill’s requirements. CBO estimates
that the average cost for salaries and benefits for an FTC employee
would be $240,000 in 2025. After accounting for anticipated infla-
tion, CBO estimates that implementing S. 28 would cost $4 million
over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
The bill would authorize the FTC to collect civil monetary pen-
alties from businesses found in violation of the bill, along with pur-
suing other remedies. Civil monetary penalties are generally remit-
ted to the Treasury and recorded as revenues. However, CBO esti-
mates that the additional revenues collected over the next decade
would be insignificant. The extent to which business would violate
the new rules after they go into effect is uncertain.
Furthermore, if a business does violate the new rules and the
FTC chooses to proceed with an enforcement action, the extent to
which the agency pursues civil penalties versus other remedies is
also uncertain, as is the amount of time it would take to resolve
a case.
S. 28 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by requiring manufactur-
ers of Internet-connected devices to disclose to the consumer if a
component of the device includes a microphone or camera. Accord-
ing to industry sources, most manufacturers already disclose such
information on the device’s exterior packaging or other forms of ad-
vertising. Therefore, CBO estimates that the cost for manufactur-
ers to comply with the bill would not exceed the annual threshold

established in UMRA ($203 million in 2025, adjusted annually for
inflation).
S. 28 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Margot Berman (for
the FTC) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The estimate was re-
viewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 28 would require manufacturers of certain consumer products
that are capable of connecting to the internet to disclose to con-
sumers whether such products contain a camera or microphone. As
such, the number of persons covered would be approximately equiv-
alent to the number of manufacturers of such products.
Economic Impact
S. 28 would not have a significant economic impact. It may re-
quire some increased expenditures by manufacturers in order to
add clear and conspicuous labeling to such products as required
under the Act.
Privacy
S. 28 would have a positive impact on individual privacy because
it would provide transparency to consumers about whether house-
hold devices capable of connecting to the internet have cameras or
microphones.
Paperwork
S. 28 would not create additional paperwork.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 3:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 4:
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘In-
forming Consumers about Smart Devices Act’’.

Section 5:
Section 2. Required disclosure of a camera or recording capability
in certain internet-connected devices.
This section would require manufacturers of covered devices to
clearly and conspicuously disclose prior to purchase whether a cov-
ered device contains a camera or microphone.

Section 6:
Section 3. Enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission.
This section would provide that a violation of the Act shall be
treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive prac-
tice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Com-
mission Act,4 and would authorize the FTC to enforce the Act in
the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdic-
tion, powers, and duties as applicable under the Federal Trade
Commission Act.5
This section would also direct the FTC, within 180 days of the
Act’s enactment, to issue guidance to help manufacturers comply
with the Act’s requirements, including guidance about best prac-
tices for making required disclosures as clear and conspicuous and
age-appropriate as practicable, and best practices for using a pic-
torial visual representation of the information to be disclosed. Man-
ufacturers may petition the FTC for tailored guidance on how to
meet the disclosure requirements consistent with existing rules of
practice or any successor rules. The FTC’s guidance shall not confer
rights on any person or entity, and shall not operate to bind the
FTC or any person to the approach recommended in the guidance.
The FTC shall not base an enforcement decision on practices that
are alleged to be inconsistent with such guidance unless the prac-
tices allegedly violate section 2.

Section 7:
Section 4. Definition of covered device.
This section would define the term ‘‘covered device’’ to: (1) mean
a consumer product, as defined by section 3(a) of the Consumer
Product Safety Act that is capable of connecting to the internet, a
component of which is a camera or microphone; and (2) not include:
(A) a telephone (including a mobile phone), a laptop, tablet, or any
device that a consumer would reasonably expect to have a micro-
phone or camera; (B) any device that is specifically marketed as a
camera, telecommunications device, or microphone; or (C) any de-
vice or apparatus described in sections 255, 716, and 718, and sub-

Section 8:
sections (aa) and (bb) of section 303 of the Communications Act of
1934, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 9:
Section 5. Effective date.
This section would provide that the Act applies to all covered de-
vices manufactured after the date that is 180 days after the date
the FTC issues the guidance required by section 3. The Act would
not apply to covered devices manufactured, sold, or otherwise intro-
duced into interstate commerce before that date.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
