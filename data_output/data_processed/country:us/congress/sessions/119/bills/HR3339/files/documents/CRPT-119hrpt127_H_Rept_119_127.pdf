vidual with financial sophistication would be unlikely to fail; and

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3339, the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act of 2025,
was introduced on May 13, 2025, by Representative Mike Flood
(NE–01). H.R. 3339 expands the ‘‘accredited investor’’ definition to
include individuals who are certified through an examination es-
tablished by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA).
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
To qualify as an accredited investor, the SEC requires individ-
uals and businesses to meet one of several financial or professional
criteria.1 H.R. 3339 expands the pathways to qualify as an accred-
ited investor by allowing certification for individuals who pass an
examination established by the SEC and administered by FINRA.
This approach modernizes the existing definition that has inappro-
priately sidelined sophisticated, but not wealthy, individuals from
117 C.F.R. §270.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3339 is to expand the pathways
to qualify as an accredited investor by allowing certification for in-
dividuals who pass an examination established by the SEC and ad-
ministered by FINRA, thereby modernizing the existing definition
that has inappropriately sidelined sophisticated, but not wealthy,
individuals from high-growth asset classes historically reserved for
the wealthiest individuals.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3339. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of House rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the
cost estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 3339 as the ‘‘Equal Opportunity for All In-
vestors Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Certification examination for accredited investors
This section amends the definition of an accredited investor in
Regulation D to include individuals who are certified through an
examination established by the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (SEC) and administered by Financial Industry Regulatory Au-
thority (FINRA). This section requires the examination be designed
with an appropriate level of difficulty such that an individual with
financial sophistication would be unlikely to fail and may include
methods to determine competency with respect to different types of
securities, disclosure requirements under the federal securities
laws, corporate governance, financial statement, aspect of unregis-
tered securities, potential conflicts of interest between financial
professionals and their clients, and other criteria the SEC deter-
mines necessary. This section also requires that the examination be
offered free of charge to the public.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 3339 does not repeal or amend any section of a statute.
Therefore, the Office of Legislative Counsel did not prepare the re-
port required under clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
