Purpose and Summary
H.R. 1789, the Promptly Ending Political Prosecutions and Exec-
utive Retaliation Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Russell
Fry (R–SC), would give current and former Presidents and Vice
Presidents, current and former officers of the United States, and
current and former officers of any agency the ability to remove a
civil or criminal case against them in a state court to a federal dis-
trict court under 28 U.S.C. §1442(a). In addition, the bill provides
greater procedural protections for when a federal official’s case is
removed pursuant to §1442(a).
The bill also adds a new section to Title 28, United States Code,
which would codify the immunity recognized by the U.S. Supreme
Court in Trump v. United States for official acts carried out by a
federal official during their federal duties. The section also pro-
hibits the court, during its immunity determination, from exam-
ining official acts that are not the subject of the charge or claim
brought in state court. Finally, the section further permits the At-
torney General to provide representation to any individual whose
case is subject to removal based upon their current or past federal
government service, prohibits state courts from defining the duties
of federal officers, and requires that a federal court dismiss a pend-
ing case if it would interfere with the execution of the President’s
or Vice President’s official duties.
Background and Need for the Legislation
During the 118th Congress, the Committee investigated the
Biden-Harris Justice Department’s two-tiered justice system—one
for the politically favored and one for the Administration’s political
opponents—that extended to Democrat local and state offices.
Rather than debate political opponents on substance, the Demo-
crats’ strategy to win the 2024 election was through the use of par-
tisan lawfare tactics.1 The criminal indictments brought by left-
wing, activist state prosecutors showed that this two-tiered system
of justice was not just limited to the federal government. Prior to
1Lawfare has been defined as ‘‘the strategic use of legal proceedings to intimidate or hinder
an opponent.’’ William Holmes, ‘Lawfare’ among six new words added to Collins Dictionary,
LEGALCHEEK(Nov. 1, 2022).

the 2024 election, President Donald Trump was criminally indicted
an unprecedented four times after he announced his run for Presi-
dent, and he faced other civil lawsuits that exposed him to hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in liability. Several of these cases came
before hostile judges and biased jury pools.
Current law does not adequately protect federal officials, espe-
cially current and former Presidents and Vice Presidents, from
these rogue state and local attorneys who bring unwarranted
charges against their political opponents. Under current law, the
ability to remove civil or criminal cases from a state court to a fed-
eral court is limited to current federal agency officials, and legisla-
tive and judicial officers.2 This legislation would ensure that all the
nation’s leaders are protected from partisan lawfare tactics by giv-
ing current and former Presidents, Vice Presidents, and federal of-
ficials the ability to remove cases against them.
The legislation would further extend protections for the nation’s
leaders by codifying the immunity recognized by the U.S. Supreme
Court. In Trump v. United States the Supreme Court held that ‘‘the
nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute
immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclu-
sive and preclusive constitutional authority.’’3 In Nixon v. Fitz-
gerald, the Supreme Court also held that ‘‘the threat of future civil
liability for official acts—including years after the President left of-
fice—could deter the President from the ‘bold and unhesitating ac-
tion’ required for his official responsibilities.’’4 The Supreme Court
has repeatedly held that ‘‘there exists the greatest public interest
in providing’’ the President with ‘‘the maximum ability to deal fear-
lessly and impartially with the duties of his office.’’5 In essence,
knowing that official acts could lead to future liability ‘‘could dis-
tract [a President] from his public duties to the detriment of not
only the President and his office but also the Nation.’’6 These
‘‘same concerns apply to the threat of criminal prosecution’’ and are
in fact ‘‘dramatically enhanced.’’7
District Attorneys’ Politicized Investigations Against President
Trump
The rogue state and local prosecutors at the front lines in the
lawfare against President Trump made their intentions clear from
the start. When campaigning for office, New York County District
Attorney (DA) Alvin Bragg ran on a platform of going after Donald
Trump. Bragg would often boast about how many times he had
sued President Trump when working in the New York Attorney
General’s Office, stating, ‘‘It is a fact that I have sued Trump more
than a hundred times . . . I can’t change that fact, nor would I.’’8
Bragg ran on being the candidate most able to continue and ini-
tiate lawsuits against President Trump.9 In addition, in Georgia,
Fulton County DA Fani Willis—just four days before indicting
228 U.S.C. §1442(a).

President Trump—launched a new fundraising website high-
lighting her investigation.10
The 2024 lawfare strategy was a microcosm of the treatment
President Trump and other Republicans have faced for years. De-
spite their failure to prevent President Trump from winning the
2024 Presidential Election, Democrats seem intent to continue to
use lawfare to undermine other legitimate candidates and
weaponize the justice system. This rise in state litigation against
federal officials, particularly those who have served in conservative
administrations or have taken actions that are unpopular with rad-
ical left-wing state governments, disrupts the efficient operation of
the federal government and may lead to officials not fulfilling the
roles and responsibilities of their office out of fear of criminal pros-
ecution, civil suits, and harassment.
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’s Politicized Investiga-
tion
On August 14, 2023, Fulton County DA Fani Willis brought a 41-
count indictment against 19 defendants—including President
Trump, his attorneys, former White House Chief of Staff Mark
Meadows, and a former DOJ official—related to the 2020 election
for President of the United States.11 The politicized nature of this
prosecution is hard to ignore. Just four days before the indictment,
Willis launched a new campaign fundraising website highlighting
her investigation into President Trump.12 Willis’s investigation into
President Trump was first reported in February 2021;13 however,
she did not bring charges until two and a half years later—after
President Trump had announced his candidacy for the 2024 presi-
dential election.14 Willis requested that the trial begin on March 4,
2024, the day before Super Tuesday and eight days before the
Georgia presidential primary.15
Central to Willis’s case was a radical interpretation of Georgia’s
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) law, which
is intended to be used to prosecute criminal enterprises that infil-
trate legitimate businesses and use interstate commerce.16 In the
indictment, Willis alleged that the 19 individuals, 30 unindicted co-
conspirators, and others involved were part of a ‘‘criminal enter-
prise’’ that engaged in unlawful activity that can be prosecuted
under RICO.17 However, the actions that Willis alleged to have

been committed in furtherance of this purported criminal enter-
prise include several official and ordinary actions of senior federal
officials, including: (1) the then-White House Chief of Staff asking
a Member of Congress for the phone number of the Speaker of the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives; (2) the President tweeting
that hearings in the Georgia legislature were being aired on a news
channel and commenting on those hearings; and (3) numerous acts
taking place in other states not involving the conduct of the 2020
election in Georgia or the counting of the votes cast in Georgia.18
Willis’s Coordination With Special Counsel Smith, the Biden-
Harris White House, and the Partisan Democrat-led
House January 6th Committee
During her investigation, Willis and her office coordinated with
openly partisan actors. Prior to her decision to indict President
Trump, Willis’s office coordinated with Special Counsel Jack Smith
while she was investigating President Trump,19 ‘‘interview[ing]
many of the same witnesses and review[ing] much of the same evi-
dence.’’20 Nathan Wade, an outside attorney who Willis hired to
lead the case, also met with the Biden-Harris White House on mul-
tiple occasions over a period of several months prior to the indict-
ment.21 Perhaps most revealing was Willis’s decision to ‘‘quietly
me[e]t’’ with the partisan January 6th Committee before she in-
dicted President Trump.22 The January 6th Committee provided
Willis’s prosecution a ‘‘boost’’ as she prepared to convene a special
grand jury and even ‘‘helped prosecutors prepare for interviews
with key witnesses.’’23 During these meetings, the January 6th
Committee provided Willis with records that it withheld from
Members of Congress and law enforcement entities.24 The degree
of improper coordination among politicized actors—including Jack
Smith, the Biden-Harris White House, and the January 6th Com-
mittee—emphasizes the extent to which Willis’s prosecution is po-
litically motivated.
Meadows’s Attempt To Remove Case Into Federal Court
On August 15, 2023, Meadows filed a Notice of Removal with the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in an at-
tempt to have Willis’s charges against him removed from the Supe-
rior Court of Fulton County to federal court.25 In his Notice, Mead-
ows stated that he had the ‘‘right to remove’’ the case to federal
court because the ‘‘conduct giving rise to the charges in the indict-
ment all occurred during his tenure and as part of his service as
[White House] Chief of Staff.’’26 Meadows also specifically argued
that the federal removal statute, 28 U.S.C. §1442(a)(1), ‘‘protect[s]

the Federal Government from the interference with its operations
that would ensue were a State able, for example, to arrest and
bring to trial in a State court for an alleged offense against the law
of the State, officers, and agents of the Federal Government acting
within the scope of their authority.’’27
However, on September 8, 2023, the federal court ‘‘decline[d] to
assume jurisdiction over the State’s criminal prosecution of Mead-
ows’’ and found ‘‘insufficient evidence to establish that the grava-
men, or a heavy majority of overt acts alleged against Meadows,
relate[d] to his role as White House Chief of Staff.’’28 The Court
ultimately ruled that ‘‘Meadows was not acting in his scope of exec-
utive branch duties during most of the Overt Acts alleged.’’29 Both
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the Su-
preme Court upheld the lower court’s ruling.30 However, in a state-
ment to the Supreme Court, Meadows stated, ‘‘[i]f former officers
cannot remove at all, and if even a current chief of staff cannot re-
move a case arising out of acts taken in the White House in service
of the president, then the floodgates are open, and ‘nightmare sce-
narios’ will not take long to materialize.’’31
Current Status of Willis’s Politicized Prosecution
Willis’s prosecution of President Trump and his co-defendants
were hindered by allegations that she had a romantic relationship
with Wade, who allegedly used the money he received from the
Fulton County DA’s office to pay for lavish vacations with Willis.32
On January 8, 2024, one of President Trump’s co-defendants filed
a motion to dismiss the indictment and disqualify Willis, her office,
and Wade from further prosecuting the case due to the conflict
arising from Willis’s and Wade’s romantic relationship in which
they both were alleged to have created a personal financial interest
in the case.33 On March 15, 2024, after conducting an evidentiary
hearing and finding that Willis’s and Wade’s relationship created
an ‘‘odor of mendacity’’ around the case, the trial court gave Willis
and her office an option: either Wade resign his position with the
office or the office recuse itself from the prosecution.34 Wade re-
signed the same day.35 Both Willis’s office and the defendants in

the case appealed the trial court’s ruling to the Georgia Court of
Appeals.36
Upon reviewing the trial court’s evidentiary record, along with
the parties’ appellate briefings, on December 19, 2024, the Georgia
Court of Appeals disqualified Willis from prosecuting President-
elect Trump.37 The Georgia Court of Appeals held that the trial
court ‘‘erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office[]’’ be-
cause the trial court’s order ‘‘did nothing to address the appearance
of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising
her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what
charges to bring.’’38 On January 8, 2025, Willis’s office petitioned
the Georgia Supreme Court to reverse the decision of the Court of
Appeals.39 This appeal remains pending at the time of this report,
and, accordingly, the charges against President Trump and Mead-
ows remain pending.40 In the event that the Georgia Supreme
Court upholds the appellate court’s disqualification of Willis and
her office, the case will be ‘‘referred to the Georgia Prosecuting At-
torneys’ Council for reassignment[]’’ to a new Georgia district at-
torney’s office, who would decide the fate of the prosecution.41
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s Politicized Investigation
On April 4, 2023, New York County District Attorney Alvin
Bragg indicted President Trump with 34 counts of falsifying busi-
ness records to an ambiguous, unknown federal crime to aggravate
the charges to felonies.42 This indictment was an ‘‘unprecedented
abuse of prosecutorial authority.’’43 Falsifying business records is
ordinarily a misdemeanor subject to a two-year statute of limita-
tions,44 which would have expired long ago. However, Bragg used
a novel and untested legal theory—previously declined by federal
prosecutors—to bootstrap the misdemeanor allegations as a felony
by alleging that records were falsified to conceal a second crime.45
The facts surrounding Bragg’s indictment of President Trump have
‘‘been known for years.’’46 Michael Cohen, President Trump’s dis-
graced former lawyer and Bragg’s star trial witness, pleaded guilty
over five years ago to charges based on the same facts at issue in
the indictment.47 By July 2019, however, federal prosecutors deter-

mined that no additional people would be charged alongside
Cohen.48
Although both the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern Dis-
trict of New York and the New York County District Attorney’s Of-
fice (DANY) previously declined to further investigate the alleged
hush money payments to Stephanie Clifford (also known as Stormy
Daniels),49 Bragg opted to revive the DANY’s investigation at a po-
litically opportune moment—shortly after President Trump an-
nounced his White House run.50 The timing and basis for the
DANY’s prosecution of President Trump provide a clear inference
that Bragg was motivated by political calculations. The facts had
not changed since 2018 and no new witnesses emerged between
then and the date on which Bragg filed the indictment.51 The only
intervening factor, it appears, was President Trump’s announce-
ment that he would be a candidate for President in 2024.52 After
a 20-day trial, a Manhattan jury found President Trump guilty on
May 31, 2024.53
Bragg’s Pursuit To Prosecute President Trump
Throughout his campaign for district attorney, Alvin Bragg made
President Trump a focal point of his campaign.54 On March 17,
2021, Bragg indicated that, if elected as district attorney, he ‘‘will
hold [Trump] accountable . . . .’’55 Just a few days later, on March
23, 2021, he again boasted that he had ‘‘sued the Trump adminis-
tration over 100 times . . . .’’56 In June 2021, Bragg doubled
down, stating, ‘‘It is a fact that I have sued Trump more than a
hundred times. I can’t change that fact, nor would I. That was im-
portant work. That’s separate from anything that the D.A.’s office
may be looking at now.’’57 In other words, Bragg assumed office
with seemingly one fundamental goal: to prosecute President
Trump.
Despite campaigning heavily on his goal of prosecuting President
Trump, after assuming office on January 1, 2022, Bragg realized
the case against President Trump was thin.58 On January 8, 2022,
former Special Assistant District Attorney Mark Pomerantz met in-
dividually with Bragg.59 During the one-on-one, Pomerantz told
Bragg that his case against President Trump ‘‘was ready to be
charged.’’60 On January 11, 2022, Pomerantz and his colleague

Carey Dunne gave a presentation on former President Trump’s fi-
nancial statements to Bragg and his team.61 At this meeting,
Bragg’s team expressed ‘‘considerable ‘angst’’’ about using Cohen
as a witness and sought to pivot away from Pomerantz’s suggested
fraud charges.62
On January 24, 2022, according to Pomerantz, an investigative
team meeting ‘‘quickly degenerated into a whirlwind of negativity’’
because other DANY officials rightly questioned the credibility of
Pomerantz’s main witness, Michael Cohen.63 Two days later,
Pomerantz and Dunne agreed that both would resign if Bragg did
not move forward with an indictment and exchanged resignation
letters for the other to review.64
Throughout the first few weeks of February 2022, Pomerantz and
Dunne held several conversations with Bragg and his team to ex-
plain their multi-faceted investigation into President Trump.65 Ac-
cording to Pomerantz, the case against President Trump based
upon the Clifford payment facts—familiarly known as the ‘‘zombie’’
case—had multiple pitfalls, and notwithstanding possible ‘‘work-
arounds,’’ Pomerantz wrote that none were appealing.66 Further,
his DANY colleagues were ‘‘dubious about whether Trump had
been ‘extorted’ in the first place.’’67 Bragg therefore halted the in-
vestigation into President Trump despite ‘‘fac[ing] incredible polit-
ical pressure from his Democratic base to indict [President]
Trump.’’68
As a result, Pomerantz and Dunne dramatically resigned in pro-
test ‘‘while Bragg’s liberal supporters grew restless with the lack
of an indictment for more than a year.’’69 A copy of Pomerantz’s
resignation letter was leaked to the New York Times, which pub-
lished his scathing assessment of Bragg’s failures.70 Amid the fall-
out from the investigation into President Trump, Bragg issued an
‘‘unusual’’ public statement about the DANY’s investigation into
President Trump, ‘‘emphasizing that the investigation into Trump
and his business was far from over.’’71
After losing his two partisan prosecutors, Bragg retooled his of-
fice with more activists. In December 2022, Bragg hired Matthew

held senior positions in the New York Attorney General’s Office
and has a ‘‘history of taking on Donald J. Trump and his family
business.’’73 Colangelo led ‘‘dozens of lawsuits against the [T]rump
administration’’ during his time at the New York Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office.74
President Trump’s Trial Was Plagued With Serious Legal
and Constitutional Deficiencies
On April 4, 2023, Bragg succumbed to the left-wing political
pressure and filed a 34-count criminal indictment against President
Trump for falsifying New York business records, allegedly ‘‘to con-
ceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American
voters before and after the 2016 election.’’75 The indictment took
‘‘a single transaction—Trump’s reimbursement to Michael Cohen of
the $130,000 Cohen paid to [Stephanie Clifford] to stay mum about
an alleged 2006 fling [pursuant to an agreed-upon non-disclosure
agreement (NDA)]—and ludicrously slic[ed] it into 34 transactions,
each of which [it] brands as felony falsification of business
records.’’76
Legal experts explained that none of this alleged conduct
amounted to a provable felony offense. First, even if the alleged
bookkeeping irregularities ‘‘amount[ed] to fraud crimes . . . the
transactions in question could not possibly have had the slightest
impact on the 2016 election. They didn’t occur until months later—
specifically, from February 14 through December 5, 2017.’’77 Sec-
ond, ‘‘even if Bragg had jurisdiction to enforce federal campaign fi-
nance law’’ and ‘‘even if Bragg were correct that the . . . payments
were in-kind campaign contributions that had to be disclosed,’’ any
disclosure would have been due ‘‘several months into 2017. Again,
there could not conceivably have been any impact on the 2016 elec-
tion.’’78
Despite these legal infirmities, Bragg ultimately tried President
Trump on these charges, and, on May 30, 2024, a Manhattan jury
found him guilty on all 34 counts.79 President Trump promised to
appeal, stating, ‘‘We will fight for our constitution. This is far from
over.’’80 Legal experts agreed that President Trump’s appeal of his
conviction was on solid legal grounds for several reasons.
First, the jury instructions that New York District Judge Juan
Merchan read to the jurors were comprised of 55-pages of confusing
and seemingly unlawful charges.81 Specifically, Judge Merchan
charged the jury that they had to agree unanimously on whether
to convict President Trump on each of the 34 counts of falsifying

business records with the intent to conceal damaging information
before the 2016 election.82 This required them, unanimously, to de-
termine that President Trump used ‘‘unlawful means’’ to conceal
this information.83 Judge Merchan, however, instructed the jurors
that they ‘‘did not have to agree on a singular unlawful act’’ to con-
vict.84 He instructed ‘‘that they would have to find only that Mr.
Trump committed bookkeeping infractions to conceal [1] a cam-
paign finance violation, [2] tax law infraction or [3] falsification of
business records,’’ but they ‘‘didn’t have to agree on the underlying
crime to find the former president guilty.’’85
One New York criminal law expert reasoned that, by offering
‘‘three different theories as to how the false records could have vio-
lated state election law, limit[ing] instruction on what some of
those theories required, and the fact that jurors were not required
to agree on which had been proven,’’ Judge Merchan created ‘‘a real
issue for the appeal.’’86 As a matter of law, Judge Merchan should
have instructed the jurors ‘‘that they had to find at least one of
these objective crimes and they had to be unanimous on that find-
ing in order to convict Trump.’’87
Second, Judge Merchan allowed Bragg ‘‘to spread before the jury
in his Manhattan courtroom evidence that [was] blatantly inadmis-
sible against’’ President Trump.88 Bragg intended ‘‘to use Cohen’s
guilty plea to establish that Trump was complicit in crimes because
of the NDA payments.’’89 Judge Merchan held that neither Cohen’s
guilty plea nor David Pecker’s, former CEO of American Media,
non-prosecution agreement were admissible because ‘‘evidence of
another party’s guilty plea is not admissible to prove the defend-
ant’s guilt.’’90 Nevertheless, Judge Merchan ‘‘simultaneously ruled
that prosecutors could elicit testimony about Cohen’s guilty pleas
on the rationale that they are relevant to his credibility as a wit-
ness,’’ which he permitted over President Trump’s objection.91 As
a result, the jury heard testimony about:
Michael Cohen’s guilty pleas to two Federal Election
Campaign Act (FECA) crimes, which he claimed were es-
tablished by payments to [Stephanie Clifford] and Karen
McDougal for non-disclosure agreements (NDAs); and
David Pecker’s non-prosecution agreement with the Justice

Department, which he executed out of fear that he’d be in-
dicted over the McDougal NDA (he wasn’t, although his
former company, AMI, agreed to pay the Federal Election
Commission a fine—a disposition that allowed AMI to get
out from under the federal government’s investigation so it
could sell the National Enquirer.)92
Although inadmissible, this was the ‘‘evidence’’ that President
Trump violated campaign laws—if Cohen pleaded guilty to vio-
lating FECA, and Pecker was concerned that he might be charged
with violating FECA, then President Trump must have violated
FECA when he allegedly paid off Clifford and McDougal.93 Judge
Merchan compounded this reversible error by refusing to allow
President Trump’s defense to call former Federal Election Commis-
sion (FEC) Commissioner Bradley Smith as a witness to testify
that none of President Trump’s alleged conduct violated FECA.94
Third, Judge Merchan unfairly prejudiced the jury against Presi-
dent Trump by permitting Clifford to testify about an alleged past
encounter with President Trump because it had no relevance to the
falsified business recordkeeping charges at issue in the trial.95 This
showing of unfair prejudice would be sufficient for the appeals
court to vacate the guilty verdict and order a new trial.96
Finally, just before the trial, the judge granted the prosecutors’
request for an unconstitutional gag order on President Trump. On
February 22, 2024, Bragg’s office filed a motion seeking to restrict
President Trump’s ‘‘extrajudicial statements . . . for the duration
of the trial’’ following several public comments made by President
Trump regarding his pending trial in New York.97 President
Trump argued that as the ‘‘presumptive Republican nominee and
leading candidate in the 2024 election’’ he should have been able
to ‘‘criticize these public figures’’ and respond to their attacks.98
Judge Merchan found that President Trump’s statements ‘‘went far
beyond defending himself against ‘attacks’ by ‘public figures.’’’99
On March 26, 2024, Judge Merchan prohibited President Trump
from making any public statements regarding ‘‘witnesses, prosecu-
tors, jurors and court staff.’’100 The gag order did not restrict Presi-
dent Trump’s comments about Bragg or Judge Merchan.101 On
April 1, 2024, Judge Merchan extended the gag order to prohibit
comments made by President Trump about the District Attorney’s
or Judge’s family members (Judge Merchan’s daughter is a Demo-
crat political operative).102 If President Trump violated the gag

order, the court would have been able to impose fines or ‘‘in ex-
traordinary circumstances’’ jail time.103
President Trump’s legal team argued that the amended gag
order was unconstitutional because it prohibited him from engag-
ing in political speech.104 At the time, his campaign spokesman
stated, ‘‘The voters of America have a fundamental right to hear
the uncensored voice of the leading candidate for the highest office
in the land.’’105 Professor Jonathan Turley stated Judge Merchan’s
gag orders ‘‘raise[d] very serious free speech questions’’ as the or-
ders prohibited President Trump from criticizing ‘‘central figures in
this political campaign’’ such as Michael Cohen, Stephanie Clifford,
and Matthew Colangelo.106 Judge Merchan fined President Trump
roughly $10,000 for posts on Truth Social and his campaign
website and had threatened President Trump with jail time during
the trial for allegedly violating the gag order.107
Judge Juan Merchan’s Political Bias
The judge who presided over President Trump’s trial, Juan
Merchan, and his family have close ties to the Democrat party. Not
only did Judge Merchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, work on Vice
President Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign, but until
December 2024, she served as the president and Chief Operating
Officer of Authentic Campaigns, a ‘‘Chicago-based progressive polit-
ical consulting firm’’ that worked with Democrat Party candidates,
including President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.108
According to Judge Merchan, prior to the trial he obtained an opin-
ion from New York’s Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics re-
garding his daughter’s employment.109 The Advisory Committee re-
portedly stated: ‘‘We see nothing in the inquiry to suggest that the
outcome of the case could have any effect on the judge’s relative,
the relative’s business or any of their interest.’’110
However, two of Authentic Campaigns’ top clients—then-Con-
gressman Adam Schiff and the Senate Majority PAC—raised ‘‘at
least $93 million in campaign donations’’ while using President
Trump’s New York indictments in their solicitation emails.111 No-
tably, Congressman Schiff’s campaign for U.S. Senate received ‘‘$20
million in aid since he began soliciting donations off the presump-
tive GOP presidential front-runner’s unprecedented 34-count in-
dictment last April, according to Federal Election Commission
records.’’112 The Senate Majority PAC ‘‘pocketed $73.6 million since

it also began firing off fundraising emails following the ex-presi-
dent’s indictment.’’113 In 2020, Judge Merchan himself made dona-
tions to Democrat causes—including to President Biden’s campaign
and a group called Stop Republicans.114 According to Judge
Merchan, the Advisory Committee found that his donations were
‘‘modest political contributions made more than two years ago
[that] cannot reasonably create an impression of bias.’’115 Despite
these conflicts, Judge Merchan denied President Trump’s recusal
request in August 2023.116
Bragg’s case against President Trump came to an end on Janu-
ary 10, 2025, when New York Judge Juan Merchan sentenced
President Trump to an unconditional discharge,117 which ‘‘waives
legal penalties for a crime but does not negate the conviction.’’118
President Trump will not serve any jail time, serve any probation,
or pay any fines.119
Protecting Our Nation’s Leaders
A prosecutor’s job is to do justice. However, in their political pur-
suit against President Trump, state and local prosecutors abused
their power. Current law does not adequately protect current and
former Presidents and Vice Presidents from politically motivated
state and local prosecutions. H.R. 1789 is designed to protect the
nation’s leaders from lawfare tactics used against them by state
and local prosecutors. The bill provides an avenue for federal offi-
cials to have their cases moved to less biased federal courts. When
considering removal, federal courts should exercise their jurisdic-
tion to the fullest extent of their Article III authority. In addition,
the bill extends protections to federal officials by codifying case law
that already extends Supremacy Clause immunity to those acting
within the bounds or their federal duties. Finally, the bill gives
greater legal support from the Justice Department or government-
funded private counsel to prevent state prosecutors from bank-
rupting federal officials.
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 1789: ‘‘Legislative Re-
forms to End Lawfare by State and Local Prosecutors’’ a hearing
held on March 4, 2025, before the Subcommittee on the Constitu-
tion and Limited Government of the Committee on the Judiciary.

Committee Oversight Findings
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of House rule XIII, the Com-
mittee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to the require-
ments of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of
1974, the Committee has requested but not received a cost estimate
for this bill from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office a statement as to whether this
bill contains any new budget authority, spending authority, credit
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expendi-
tures. The Chairman of the Committee shall cause such estimate
and statement to be printed in the Congressional Record upon its
receipt by the Committee.
Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, a cost estimate provided
by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was not made available to the
Committee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of
the Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Con-
gressional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
Committee Estimate of Budgetary Effects
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee adopts
as its own the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974.
Duplication of Federal Programs
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House rule XIII, no provision of H.R.
1879 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another federal program.
Performance Goals and Objectives
The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House
rule XIII, H.R. 1789 would clarify when a current or former Presi-
dent or Vice President, or a current or former federal officer, may
remove a civil or criminal case brought against them in state court
to federal court. The bill would also codify the immunity recognized
by the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States for official
acts carried out in the course of official duties.

accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Pub. L. 104–1).
Section-by-Section Analysis
Section 1. Short title
The Act is the ‘‘Promptly Ending Political Prosecutions and Exec-
utive Retaliation Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Removal of certain actions
This section clarifies the requirements to move a civil or criminal
case from a state court to a district court.
This section also extends eligibility to include current and former
officers of the United States, current and former officers of any
agency, the President, the Vice President, a former President, and
a former Vice President.
Section 3. Procedure for removal of criminal cases
This section provides greater procedural protections for when a
federal official’s case is removed.
Section 4. Official immunity
This section adds a new section to Title 28, United States Code,
which would codify the immunity recognized by the U.S. Supreme
Court for official acts carried out by a federal official during the
course of their federal duties.
This section also prohibits the court, during its immunity deter-
mination, from examining officials acts that are not the subject of
the charge or claim brought in state court.
This section further permits the Attorney General to provide rep-
resentation to any individual whose case is subject to removal
based upon their current or past federal government service, pro-

§1455. Procedure for removal of criminal prosecutions
(a) NOTICE OF REMOVAL.—A defendant or defendants desiring to
remove any criminal prosecution from a State court shall file in the
district court of the United States for the district and division with-
in which such prosecution is pending a notice of removal signed
pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,
together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served
upon such defendant or defendants in such action.
(b) REQUIREMENTS.—(1) A notice of removal of a criminal pros-
ecution shall be filed not later than 30 days after the arraignment
in the State court, or at any time before trial, whichever is earlier,
except that for good cause shown the United States district court
may enter an order granting the defendant or defendants leave to
file the notice at a later time.
(2) A notice of removal of a criminal prosecution shall include all
grounds for such removal. A failure to state grounds that exist at
the time of the filing of the notice shall constitute a waiver of such
grounds, and a second notice may be filed only on grounds not ex-
isting at the time of the original notice. For good cause shown, the
United States district court may grant relief from the limitations
of this paragraph.
(3) The filing of a notice of removal of a criminal prosecution
øshall not¿ shall prevent the State court in which such prosecution
is pending from proceeding further, øexcept that a judgment of con-
viction shall not be entered unless the prosecution is first re-
manded¿ and no judgment of conviction shall be entered unless the
prosecution is remanded.
(4) The United States district court in which such notice is filed
shall examine the notice øpromptly. If¿ promptly and where a
prima facie showing demonstrating the basis for removal is made,
the matter shall be removed. Only if it clearly appears on the face
of the notice and any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should
not be permitted, the court shall make an order for summary re-
mand.
(5) If the United States district court does not order the summary
dismissal or the summary remand of such prosecution, it shall
order øan evidentiary hearing¿ a hearing to be held promptly and,
after such hearing, shall make such disposition of the prosecution
as justice shall require including dismissal under section 1456. If
the United States district court determines that removal shall be
permitted or dismissal ordered, it shall so notify the State court in
which prosecution is pending, which shall proceed no further.
(c) WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.—If the defendant or defendants are
in actual custody on process issued by the State court, the district
court shall issue its writ of habeas corpus, and the marshal shall
thereupon take such defendant or defendants into the marshal’s
custody and deliver a copy of the writ to the clerk of such State
court.
§1456. Official Immunity
(a) IMMUNITY.—In any case that is subject to removal under sec-
tion 1442(a), a Federal official shall be presumed to have immunity
under article VI, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States
from any charge or claim made by or under authority of State law

which may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that
the official was not acting under the color of such office or on ac-
count of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Con-
gress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collec-
tion of the revenue.
(b) DETERMINATION OF IMMUNITY.—For purposes of making a de-
termination of immunity under subsection (a), the following may
not be admitted into evidence:

claim made by or under authority of State law.
(2) An act alleged to be official that is not the subject of the
charge or claim made by or under authority of State law.

Attorney General may—
(1) represent such Federal official for any charge or claim
made by or under authority of State law; or
(2) compensate private counsel retained by such official at a
reasonable prevailing rate for any such charge or claim.
(d) PROHIBITION ON LIMITATION OF SCOPE.—No court may define
or limit the scope of the duties of an official of the Executive Office
of the President.
(e) DISMISSAL.—In any action subject to removal under paragraph
(5) or (6) of section 1442(a), such case shall be dismissed unless re-
butted by clear and convincing evidence establishing that the con-
tinued pendency of the State claim or charge would not in any way
interfere, hinder, burden, or delay the execution of the duties of the
President or Vice President.

Dissenting Views
H.R. 1789, the so-called ‘‘Promptly Ending Political Prosecutions
and Executive Retaliation Act,’’ represents yet another example of
how House Republicans are attempting to rig the rules to protect
President Donald Trump and his cronies.1 This problematic bill
would amend 28 U.S.C. §1442(a), the federal officer removal stat-
ute, to provide, among other things, for the removal of any state
criminal or civil case to federal court that was brought against a
current or former President or Vice President ‘‘for or relating to
any act while in office or where the State court’s consideration of
the claim or charge may interfere with, hinder, burden, or delay
the execution of the duties of the President or Vice President.’’2
In other words, Republicans want to make sure no state court
can ever again consider any violation of state law that Mr. Trump
engages in while President, even if that conduct has no relation to
1Congressional Republicans have attempted to misuse their power in other ways to help
President Trump. For example, several House Republicans, egged on by Elon Musk and other
Trump allies, have sought to intimidate federal judges by introducing or threatening to intro-
duce articles of impeachment against those judges that rule against the Trump Administration.

TIMES (Mar. 1, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/trump-musk-republicans-
congress-judge-impeachment.html. In a similar vein, congressional Republicans are now seeking
to advance legislation to create many new judgeships so that President Trump can pack the fed-
eral courts with loyalist judges. SEEThe JUDGES Act, H.R. 1702, 119th Cong. (2025).

his official acts. Furthermore, the bill seeks to provide presumptive
immunity for the President, Vice President, and federal officers in
cases subject to removal. The bill would also allow any former fed-
eral officer other than a former President or Vice President to re-
move state cases for their acts under color of office. Notably this
bill would apply to pending cases against federal officials named as
co-defendants in President Trump’s criminal case in Georgia, such
as former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
This bill, which should really be called the ‘‘Donald J. Trump Re-
lief Act,’’ is a gift to the President and his co-conspirators—who
have failed again and again to remove their state criminal cases
from New York and Georgia to federal courts where it might be
harder to hold them accountable for their actual or alleged criminal
conduct. To be clear, every federal court that has examined the
facts and the law determined that neither President Trump’s nor
his co-conspirator Mr. Meadows’s state criminal cases qualified for
removal under the current incarnation of the federal officer re-
moval statute because the conduct for which they were charged
were not official acts made pursuant to their duties as federal offi-
cers.3
Amending federal removal statutes primarily because one indi-
vidual, Donald Trump, wants to falsely assert that multiple state
officials were hostile to him and his cronies in the past because of
his policies would be an egregious misuse of congressional author-
ity. H.R. 1789 would undermine our system of federalism and the
rule of law simply to benefit President Trump and his cronies.
I. H.R. 1789 IS PART OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS’ EFFORT TO PROMOTE
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FALSE NARRATIVE THAT HE IS THE VICTIM OF
POLITICAL PERSECUTION TO JUSTIFY HIS SUBVERSION OF THE
RULE OF LAW
Since the 2024 presidential election, President Trump no longer
appears to be in immediate legal jeopardy in New York and Geor-
gia. Republicans, however, are still so eager to prove their loyalty
to President Trump that they continue to promote H.R. 1789 as a
‘‘remedy’’ to the false narrative that these state charges were ‘‘po-
litically motivated.’’ Moreover, Mr. Meadows’s case, and those of
the remaining Georgia defendants, are still pending, and H.R. 1789
would apply ‘‘to civil actions or criminal prosecutions pending on
the date of enactment of this Act or commenced on or after such
date.’’4 To be clear, every federal court that examined the facts and
the law determined that neither President Trump’s nor his co-con-
spirators’ state criminal cases qualified for removal under the cur-
rent federal officer removal statute because the conduct for which
they were charged did not constitute official acts made pursuant to
their duties as federal officers.5 This false political narrative, then,
is simply a pretext for H.R. 1789’s proposed expanded removal ju-
risdiction for federal officers. The bill is ultimately designed to ben-
efit President Trump and some of his allies who are still facing

criminal charges. H.R. 1789 is an attempt to place them beyond the
reach of state courts, even for state criminal charges or civil claims
stemming from their purely personal conduct.
A. STATE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS CO-
CONSPIRATORS
Prior to the 2024 presidential election, then-former President
Trump faced multiple criminal charges, including in two state
criminal cases filed in New York and Georgia, as well as civil
claims filed under state law.6 On March 30, 2023, Manhattan Dis-
trict Attorney Alvin Bragg indicted then-former President Trump
on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for Mr. Trump’s
efforts to conceal information that could have been harmful to his
2016 presidential campaign.7 Mr. Trump’s unlawful activity in-
cluded a ‘‘catch and kill’’ operation to ‘‘identify, purchase, and bury
negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects.’’8
Mr. Trump unsuccessfully sought to have his New York criminal
case removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1442(a), the
federal statute that governs the removal of state cases against fed-
eral officers to federal court. Federal district court Judge Alvin K.
Hellerstein ruled that the case could not be removed, stating:
‘‘Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a presi-
dent’s official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of the
president’s official duties.’’9 In May 2024, Mr. Trump was convicted
of 34 felony counts in the New York case, becoming the first Amer-
ican president ever tried and convicted of a crime.10 At his sen-
tencing hearing on January 10, 2025, following the results of the
2024 presidential election, Judge Juan Merchan granted then-
President-elect Trump an unconditional discharge, reasoning that
this was the only sentence that would not encroach on the Office
of the President.11
On August 14, 2023, a Georgia jury indicted Mr. Trump and 18
of his associates on 41 felony criminal charges under numerous
state racketeering, fraud, and conspiracy statutes related to their
attempts to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential
election throughout the state. Mr. Trump was charged on 13 of
these counts, including violation of the Georgia RICO statute. Fani
Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, opened
this investigation into Mr. Trump after the release of a recording
of a January 2021 phone call between then-President Trump and

Georgia’s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, in which Mr.
Trump told Mr. Raffensperger to ‘‘find’’ the votes for Mr. Trump to
win the state’s electoral votes and overturn his narrow loss to Joe
Biden.12 The 18 charged Trump associates included Mr. Meadows,
his former Chief of Staff; Rudolph Guiliani, his lawyer; John East-
man, the lawyer who helped originate the theories under which Mr.
Trump sought to overturn election results; and 15 others.13
Notably, Mr. Meadows and four other defendants filed motions to
have their cases removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§1442, where they likely hoped to have a more sympathetic jury
pool and to have the case delayed.14 Federal district court Judge
Steven Jones denied Mr. Meadows’s motion for removal, finding
that Mr. Meadows ‘‘failed to demonstrate how the election-related
activities that serve as the basis for the charges in the Indictment
are related to any of his official acts.’’15 Mr. Trump filed a notice
to the state court on September 7, 2023, stating that he ‘‘may’’ re-
quest removal to federal court.16 On September 28, 2023, however,
Mr. Trump’s lawyers dropped his removal request and, a day later,
Judge Jones denied the remaining four defendants’ request to re-
move their state criminal cases to federal court.17 On December 18,
2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld
Judge Jones’ order remanding Mr. Meadows’s case to state court,
holding that the federal officer removal statute did not apply to
former federal officers and, even if the statute did apply to former
officers, the acts for which prosecutors charged Mr. Meadows with
violating state law were not for or related to his ‘‘color of office.’’18
While four of President Trump’s co-defendants have so-far pleaded
guilty to state charges related to Mr. Trump’s attempts to overturn
the results of the 2020 election in Georgia,19 the case remains in
legal limbo as of this writing.

violations of state laws, and seeks to put a thumb on the scale in
favor of removal of state cases not only against the President and
Vice President, but against all federal officers, both current and
former. The Supreme Court has made clear that the federal officer
removal statute is intended to balance the interests of protecting
federal officers from states seeking to unduly interfere with federal
government operations, on the one hand,20 with the authority of
states to apply, shape, and enforce their laws, on the other.21 Yet
Republicans seek to amend the federal officer removal statute not
because the states have proven eager to stymie the operations of
the federal government or federal law through the prosecution of
federal officers, but because state prosecutors had the audacity to
prosecute President Trump and his cronies for unofficial acts com-
mitted during the course of criminal conduct.
A. H.R. 1789 SEEKS TO PROVIDE IMMUNITY FOR ALL FEDERAL OFFICERS
FACING STATE CIVIL CLAIMS AND CRIMINAL CHARGES
Section 4(a) of the bill, which purports to grant ‘‘presumptive’’
immunity to state civil claims and criminal charges for all federal
officials in cases subject to removal under 28 U.S.C. §1442(a) based
on the Supremacy Clause is likely constitutionally deficient.22 The
Supremacy Clause is effectively a choice-of-law provision that pro-
vides no substantive rights, let alone criminal or civil immunity for
federal officials.23 This appears to be a transparent attempt to pro-
vide a ‘‘catchall’’ federal defense for all federal officers to undergird
the expanded removal jurisdiction provided under the bill, though
its reliance on the Supremacy Clause likely means that it fails to
actually achieve that end.
Under 28 U.S.C. §1442(a), an officer of the United States, an of-
ficer of either house of Congress, or an officer of the courts of the
United States may move to have state criminal or civil cases
against them removed from state to federal court if the civil claim
or criminal prosecution is ‘‘for or relating to any act under color of
such office.’’24 The Constitution prohibits Congress from expanding
the scope of cases that can be removed to federal court to the ex-
tent that a case falls outside of the federal courts’ Article III sub-
ject matter jurisdiction. Although Article III authorizes Congress to
create inferior federal courts, it also limits the ‘‘original Jurisdic-
tion’’ of federal courts to certain cases ‘‘arising under this Constitu-
20See Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. 257, 263 (1880) (noting that if a state can compel a federal
officer to stand trial ‘‘for an alleged offense against the law of the State, yet warranted by the
Federal authority they possess,’’ then there is a risk that ‘‘the operations of the general govern-
ment may at any time be arrested at the will of one of its members.’’). See also People v. Trump,
683 F. Supp. 3d 334, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) (noting that the aim of the federal officer removal
statute was to prevent individual states ‘‘from using their laws to hinder the federal government
from exercising its lawful authority.’’).
21See Mesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121, 138 (1989) (noting that liberal construction of the fed-
eral officer removal statute must be balanced with strong judicial policy against federal inter-
ference in state criminal proceedings).
22H.R. 1789 §4(a).
23The Supremacy Clause reads ‘‘[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which
shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every
State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-
trary notwithstanding.’’ U.S. Cont. Art. VI, Cl. 2.

tion, the laws of the United States’’ and to cases ‘‘between Citizens
of different states,’’ among other limitations.25
The Supreme Court applied Article III’s limitation on federal
court jurisdiction to limit the reach of the federal officer removal
statute in Mesa v. California, where it held that the Constitution
requires that ‘‘[f]ederal officer removal under 28 U.S.C. §1442(a)
must be predicated upon averment of a federal defense.’’26 To re-
move a civil or criminal case on the basis of section 1442(a)(1), de-
fendants are required to show they are officers of the United States
or acting under the direction of one; that they are facing charges
‘‘for or relating to any act under color of such office’’; and that they
raised or will raise a ‘‘colorable federal defense,’’ such as immunity
from civil liability or criminal prosecution.27 As the Mesa Court ex-
plained:
Section 1442(a), in our view, is a pure jurisdictional stat-
ute, seeking to do nothing more than grant district court
jurisdiction over cases in which a federal officer is a de-
fendant. Section 1442(a), therefore, cannot independently
support Art. III ‘‘arising under’’ jurisdiction. Rather, it is
the raising of a federal question in the officer’s removal pe-
tition that constitutes the federal law under which the ac-
tion against the federal officer arises for Art. III pur-
poses.28
Apparently cognizant of this constitutional requirement, H.R.
1789’s authors included a provision that adds a new section 1456
at the end of chapter 89 of title 28, United States Code. Chapter
89 contains the various statutes governing the removal of cases to
federal court. Under the bill’s proposed section 1456(a), in any case
subject to removal under the federal officer removal statute, a fed-
eral ‘‘official shall be presumed to have immunity under’’ the Con-
stitution’s Supremacy Clause from any state criminal charge or
civil claim. The Supremacy Clause, which is effectively a choice-of-
law provision, is not a source of federal rights or authority for indi-
vidual officials, let alone immunity of any kind. As Professor Eliza-
beth Beske, a former clerk for the author of the Court’s unanimous
decision in Mesa, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, testified at a legis-
lative hearing held the day before the markup of H.R. 1789:
Justice Scalia—one of the best writers on the Supreme
Court, then and since—stated it plainly: ‘the Supremacy
Clause is not the source of any federal rights.’ 575 U.S.
320, 324 (2015). In other words, it lacks independent con-
tent. So, a unanimous Supreme Court has clearly told us
25Article III, Section 2 reads, in relevant part: ‘‘The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases,
in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties
made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other
public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Con-
troversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more
States;—between a State and Citizens of another State,—between Citizens of different States,—
between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and be-
tween a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. In all Cases af-
fecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be
Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before men-
tioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such
Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.’’ U.S. Cont. Art. III, Sec.

we cannot look to the Supremacy Clause to find any fed-
eral rights. It just tells us what to do once we have found
them. Plainly, then, Section 1456 and the Supremacy
Clause themselves cannot provide content for a brand new,
very expansive defense.29
Professor Beske concluded that ‘‘[s]ection 1456, by itself, does not
solve a Mesa problem.’’30 This section, then, appears to be a trans-
parent, and likely constitutionally defective, attempt to provide a
‘‘catchall’’ federal defense for all federal officers to predicate the un-
justified expansion of removal jurisdiction provided under H.R.
1789.
Perhaps more egregious, section 1456(a) further provides that
this proposed, ‘‘very expansive’’ defense ‘‘may only be rebutted by
clear and convincing evidence that the [federal] official was not act-
ing under color of such office or on account of any right, title or au-
thority claimed under any Act of Congress for the apprehension or
punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.’’ Proposed
section 1456(a) seems to be intended to create a presumption in
favor of removal, shifting the substantial burden of proof on the
party opposing removal to demonstrate—by a heightened ‘‘clear
and convincing’’ standard—that removal is not justified under sec-
tion 1442(a)(1). This provision is just one example of many where
Republicans have designed H.R. 1789 to put a thumb on the scale
in favor of removal by a federal officer, regardless of whether it
serves to balance the federal and state interests that the federal of-
ficer removal statute is meant to preserve.
B. H.R. 1789 IS AN ATTACK ON FEDERALISM AND STATE COURTS’ PRI-
MARY ROLE IN ENFORCING CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS UNDER OUR CON-
STITUTIONAL ORDER
H.R. 1789 would deeply and unjustifiably intrude on state courts’
role in shaping state criminal law. As previously noted, the federal
officer removal statute is meant to protect the operations of the
federal government. Indeed, the Supreme Court, in considering the
purpose behind the federal officer removal statute, has urged that
it be ‘‘liberally construed.’’31 The Supreme Court in Mesa, however,
also observed the admonition of prior courts that ‘‘[i]n criminal
cases . . . the Court’s liberal construction of the statute should be
balanced against a ‘strong judicial policy against federal inter-
ference with state criminal proceedings’ because ‘preventing and
dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than
it is of the Federal Government.’’’32 Heeding the Court’s warning
against undue federal interference with state criminal proceedings,
Democratic members offered amendments during the Committee’s
markup of H.R. 1789. For example, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D–NY) of-
fered an amendment to exempt the removal of cases alleging state
criminal fraud violations. Similarly, Rep. Becca Balint (D–VT) of-
fered an amendment to exempt alleged crimes related to sexual as-

sault from being removable from state court to federal court. These
amendments would have exempted from removal state crimes
charged against federal officers that, on their face, involve alleged
acts that are clearly outside of the scope of their federal duties. Yet
in pursuit of their goal to make it easier for President Trump and
his cronies to remove state criminal cases to federal courts, Repub-
licans rejected these amendments by party line votes.
Relatedly, proposed section 1456(d) prohibits a court from
‘‘defin[ing] or limit[ing] the scope of the duties of an official of the
Executive Office of the President.’’33 This provision may raise sig-
nificant separation of powers concerns with respect to the judi-
ciary’s role in determining what the law is. Moreover, as a practical
matter, it is unclear how a court should determine whether federal
officer removal is appropriate without examining (and thereby po-
tentially defining) the outer boundaries of a defendant’s official du-
ties. At the markup of H.R. 1789, during an extended colloquy with
Rep. Russell Fry (R–SC), the bill’s sponsor, on the purported effect
of this provision and its constitutionality, Rep. Fry’s responses im-
plied that any concerns were unwarranted because the provision
was meant only to limit the ability of state courts to consider the
‘‘scope of duties of an official of the Executive Office of the Presi-
dent,’’ presumably because federal courts are better situated to de-
termine an issue that may involve a federal question. When an
amendment was offered, however, to expressly limit section 1456(d)
to state courts, Republicans again rejected this amendment by a
party line vote.
At every opportunity presented to defend federalism, once a cor-
nerstone of conservative political ideology, Committee Republicans
instead revealed that their slavish devotion to President Trump
outweighed any past commitment to important constitutional prin-
ciples.
C. H.R. 1789’S EXPANSION OF THE FEDERAL OFFICER REMOVAL STAT-
UTE TO ALLOW PRESIDENTS AND VICE PRESIDENTS TO REMOVE
STATE CIVIL CASES BASED ON THEIR PURELY PRIVATE CONDUCT TO
FEDERAL COURT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY INTRUSION INTO STATE SOV-
EREIGNTY AND ERODES FEDERALISM’S BULWARK AGAINST TYRANNY
Another particularly egregious example of how H.R. 1789 seri-
ously erodes federalism’s ‘‘protection against tyranny,’’34 as Pro-
fessor Beske characterized it, is its ‘‘dramatic expansion’’35 of a
current or former President’s ability to remove state cases to fed-
eral court to include state civil cases that are based on purely pri-
vate matters. Specifically, section 2(a)(2) of the bill would add to
the current federal officer removal statute a new subsection allow-
ing a sitting President or Vice President to remove a case ‘‘for or
relating to any act while in office or where the State court’s consid-
eration of the claim or charge may interfere with, hinder, burden,
or delay the execution of the duties of the President or Vice Presi-
dent.’’36 Effectively, this provision would allow a President or Vice
President to remove a case to federal court for ‘‘any act,’’ even if
the act concerned only the President or Vice President’s purely pri-
33H.R. 1789 §4(a).

vate conduct. The bill also extends this removal authority to ‘‘any
act’’ of a former President or Vice President taken while that per-
son was in office.37 Such an expansion of removal authority flies in
the face of Supreme Court precedent holding that a President en-
joys no immunity from civil liability for such kinds of lawsuits
(meaning that a President enjoys no ‘‘colorable federal defense’’
from such a lawsuit, as the Court has said is constitutionally re-
quired in order to support federal officer removal under Mesa.)38
As Professor Beske explained in her written testimony before the
Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government, if
by this provision, the bill seeks to expand removal to en-
compass lawsuits against Presidents and Vice Presidents
involving purely private matters—the Trump University
cases, the Paula Jones suits, and whatnot—this is a dra-
matic expansion of the removal statute and a restructuring
of the state-federal balance that ought to merit
[Congress’s] full attention. Removal is intrusive; it divests
state courts of jurisdiction. It would be surprising to see
Congress make a move with such federalism implications
in the absence of a clear statement, particularly because
the Supreme Court has repeatedly, and recently, made
clear that the Constitution provides no shield against
these lawsuits.
. . .
Of course, even if Congress were attempting quietly to
make such a far-reaching expansion of federal jurisdiction,
per Mesa, no removal would be permissible unless the
President or Vice President had in pocket a ‘‘colorable fed-
eral defense.’’ The Mesa limitation, required by the Con-
stitution, restricts all jurisdiction conferred by the statute.
But it is worth flagging that the new section [expanding
a President’s or Vice President’s ability to remove state
cases to federal court for ‘‘any act’’ committed while in of-
fice] appears to propose something rather extraordinary.39
CONCLUSION
Committee Republicans seek to advance H.R. 1789 based on the
false premise that state criminal and civil matters against Donald
Trump were evidence of political persecution against him. I will not
relitigate the merits of these matters here beyond noting that Mr.
Trump was convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 state felony
counts in New York. Beyond the false premise that the Republicans
advance in support of H.R. 1789, the bill is deeply problematic on
the merits because it upends in numerous ways the careful balance
represented by the federal officer removal statute between pro-
tecting federal officers’ ability to carry out their lawful duties with-
out undue state interference, on the one hand, and states’ sov-
ereign power to shape and enforce their laws, on the other. This
bill is yet another example of the fact that Congressional Repub-
licans will stop at almost nothing to protect Mr. Trump and his cro-
