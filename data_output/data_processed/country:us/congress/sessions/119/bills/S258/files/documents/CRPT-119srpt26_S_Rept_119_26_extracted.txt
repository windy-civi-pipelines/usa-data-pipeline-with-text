TORNADO OBSERVATIONS RESEARCH AND NOTIFICATION
ASSESSMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONS ACT
JUNE2, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 258]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 258) to improve forecasting and un-
derstanding of tornadoes and other hazardous weather, and for
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon with amendments and recommends that the bill, as
amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 258, the Tornado Observations Research and
Notification Assessment for Development of Operations (TOR-
NADO) Act, is to improve forecasting and understanding of torna-
does and other hazardous weather, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Tornadoes are the fifth most deadly weather hazard, resulting in
an average of 48 fatalities per year over the last 10 years.1 Torna-
does are distinctively deadly events because they can form quickly
without warning and may be visibly obscured by rain or clouds.
While a tornado is on the ground, winds can reach up to 300 miles
per hour. Damage tracks can be more than 1 mile wide and 50

miles long.2 Around 1,200 tornadoes affect the United States year-
ly, but this is likely an underestimation due to discrepancies in re-
porting methods.3 While most people believe tornadoes only occur
in the Midwest’s Tornado Alley, they are present in all 50 States
and can happen at any time of year.4 Tornadoes are as common in
the Deep South as in the Great Plains.5 Overall, regions with
greater population density, urban sprawl, and manufactured homes
are particularly vulnerable.6
TORNADO RATING SCALE AND PUBLIC RESPONSE
The Fujita Scale (F-Scale) was initially developed based on the
damage intensity of tornadoes. However, this did not account for
observed wind speed. Since 2007, meteorologists have used the En-
hanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) to classify tornadoes based on wind
speeds and related damage. Both scales are rated from 0 (weak;
65–85 mph winds) to 5 (violent; 200+ mph winds).7 An issue with
this rating system is that many tornadoes move across rural areas
with little infrastructure, meaning their recorded damage may not
reflect their true strength.
The public is alerted to tornadoes through a tornado watch or
warning.8 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) issues a watch when the risk of a tornado is high but has
not yet occurred. A warning is issued when a tornado occurs and
there is a threat to life or property. Although understanding the
difference between a tornado watch and a warning is crucial for a
proper public response, at least a quarter of the individuals sur-
veyed did not know the difference.9 Most advice from local weather
stations is about sheltering in place at home, but when people are
at a public location during a tornado, they are unaware of how to
act safely. The combination of warning and location uncertainty
poses a greater risk for inappropriate safety actions by the public.
RECENT TORNADO IMPACTS
In 2024, the United States saw 1,473 confirmed tornadoes, the
second most on record. Major outbreaks in April, May, July, and
December caused widespread destruction, with several EF–4 torna-
does hitting the Midwest and Great Plains. May was especially se-
vere, with 527 tornadoes, nearly double the average. Hurricanes
Debby, Helene, and Milton fueled additional tornado activity in the
fall, including one of Florida’s most significant outbreaks in dec-
ades. The year ended with a December outbreak in the Southeast,
bringing 86 tornadoes, injuries, and fatalities. Tornadoes through-

out the year caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and
infrastructure nationwide.10
On March 31, 2023, 65 tornadoes swept across the Midwest and
South, killing at least 32 people. There was significant damage and
loss of life reported in Illinois, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, In-
diana, Mississippi, and even Delaware.11 In Illinois, a theater roof
caved in and left 1 person dead with 40 others injured. The severe
storms also caused significant gas leaks and power outages.12
IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING AND FORECASTING TORNADOES
Alerting people before tornadoes cannot happen without moni-
toring for suitable conditions that lead to formation and funnel
touch down. In the South, tornadoes are often difficult to see due
to rain, clouds, and nighttime occurrence.13 Overnight tornadoes
are 2.5 times more likely to kill than daytime tornadoes.14 Ample
warning time and effective public communications are critical since
people may be asleep or unable to see funnel formation. The NOAA
Storm Prediction Center (SPC) monitors tornado-prone regions and
issues daily forecasts.15 Local National Weather Service (NWS)
forecast offices issue tornado warnings that inform area residents.
Meteorologists at NOAA use multiple computer models at once, re-
ferred to as ensemble forecasting, to better predict weather.
However, there have been delays between the time NWS issues
warnings and when the public can access them. This decreases the
time people have to act in the event of a tornado. In Iowa, on
March 5, 2022, 17 tornadoes swept across the State, causing loss
of life and destruction of property. There was up to a 7-minute
delay in a tornado warning notification to the public due to soft-
ware and hardware issues at the national office.16 Advances in tor-
nado monitoring and forecasting can increase warning time, but
only if notifications can reach the public on time.
NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) conducts re-
search to better understand how tornados form and to improve
forecasts and warnings.17 The NSSL is involved with the Warn-on-
Forecast research program that seeks to improve warning lead
times for severe weather and water events by referencing high-res-
olution weather prediction models and high-performance com-
puting.18 NSSL also utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
their Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS of Supercells

(TORUS) project.19 UAVs can safely observe features near the
ground that may be key in tornado formation. To improve hazard
communication to the public, NSSL has created the Forecasting a
Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs) framework.20
FACETs aims to modernize weather forecasting and warnings by
incorporating evolving technology and developing user-specific,
clear, and simple communication methods that will better serve the
public during hazardous weather events.
THE ROLE OF RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN IMPROVING TORNADO
FORECASTS AND WARNINGS
Improvements and advances in tornado forecasting and warnings
would not be possible without the collaboration between Federal
agencies and research universities. NOAA Cooperative Institutes
are academic and nonprofit research institutions that conduct re-
search supporting NOAA’s goals and strategic plans.21 This pro-
gram includes 80 universities and research institutions in 33
States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Additionally,
NOAA Research Laboratories establish collaborative agreements
with universities to develop joint research institutes that are hubs
for leading research on atmospheric and earth sciences.22 At one
NOAA Research Laboratory, the National Severe Storms Labora-
tory (NSSL), the TORUS project is led by the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln in partnership with NOAA, the University of Okla-
homa Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies,
Texas Tech, and the University of Colorado Boulder.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 258 would do the following:
• Establish or designate a hazard risk communication office to
improve the communication of severe weather alerts, more
clearly inform action, and increase the likelihood that the pub-
lic takes appropriate action to prevent loss of life or property.
• Require NOAA to prepare and submit an action plan for the
national implementation of high-resolution probabilistic guid-
ance for tornado forecasting and prediction.
• Encourage NOAA to evaluate the current tornado rating sys-
tem and make updates.
• Require NOAA to coordinate with appropriate entities for post-
storm assessments to optimize data collection, sharing, and in-
tegration.
• Require NOAA to provide training, resources, and access to
professional counseling to support the mental health of employ-
ees conducting post-storm assessments.

118th Congress
S. 1284, the TORNADO Act, was introduced on April 25, 2023,
by Senator Wicker (for himself and Senators Cruz, Thune, Grass-
ley, Hyde-Smith, Young, Blackburn, Boozman, and Peters) and was
referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation of the Senate. On May 10, 2023, the Committee met in open
Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 1284 to be re-
ported favorably with an amendment (in the nature of a sub-
stitute). Senators Moran and Warnock were later added as cospon-
sors.
117th Congress
S. 3817, the TORNADO Act, was introduced on March 10, 2022,
by Senator Wicker (for himself and Senators Grassley, Hyde-Smith,
Thune, and Ernst) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On March 22,
2022, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice
vote, ordered S. 3817 to be reported favorably with an amendment
(in the nature of a substitute). Senators Duckworth, Cruz, and
Peters were later added as cosponsors.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 258 would direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA) to improve forecasting of and warnings about
hazardous weather. The bill also would require NOAA to initiate

a pilot program for communicating tornado hazards. Finally, the
bill would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to
report on the National Weather Service’s information technology
infrastructure.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).
CBO assumes that S. 258 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and
that the authorized and estimated amounts will be available in
each year. Based on historical spending patterns, CBO estimates
that implementing the bill would cost $74 million over the 2025–
2030 period, as described below.
VORTEX–USA: The bill would authorize the appropriation of $11
million annually from 2025 through 2032 for VORTEX–USA
(Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment)
to develop accurate and timely tornado forecasts, predictions, and
warnings. In 2024, NOAA allocated $11 million to the project. CBO
estimates that implementing this provision would cost $59 million
over the 2025–2030 period and $28 million after 2030, assuming
appropriation of the authorized amounts.
Other Activities: Using information from NOAA, CBO estimates
that the pilot program would require four full-time employees and
one cooperative agreement with a research university at a total
cost of $15 million over the 2025–2030 period. Most of that cost
would be for the cooperative agreement. CBO also estimates that
the GAO report would cost less than $500,000. Any related spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 258 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.

CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 3:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 4:
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘Tor-
nado Observations Research and Notification Assessment for De-
velopment of Operations Act’’ or the ‘‘TORNADO Act’’.

Section 5:
Section 2. Definitions.
This section would define the terms ‘‘hazardous weather and
water events’’, ‘‘historically Black college or university’’, ‘‘Indian
Tribe’’, ‘‘institution of higher education’’, ‘‘National Laboratory’’,
and ‘‘Under Secretary’’.

Section 6:
Section 3. Hazardous weather and water event risk communication.
This section would require maintaining and improving NOAA’s
systems for hazardous weather and water event communications to
prevent loss of life and property. It would create a hazard risk com-
munication office (Office) to simplify and improve hazard commu-
nications. The Office would develop a plan to enhance public haz-
ard communications, create metrics to track their impact on public
action, and periodically update the plan based on research and
metrics. The Office would also implement recommendations tai-
lored to vulnerable populations and based on social, behavioral,
risk, and communication science, responding to the needs of Fed-
eral, State, and local partners and various hazard types. To assess
effectiveness, the Office would collaborate with Federal partners in-
cluding National Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes, State
and local governments, Indian Tribes, educational institutions, and
media partners. Data from the Office would be accessible via a cen-
tral repository system.
This section would require NOAA to establish or maintain a haz-
ard communication research program to modernize the creation of
hazard information and responses to hazardous weather and water
events. NOAA would coordinate with States, Indian Tribes, local-
ities, and emergency managers on research priorities and results
and establish a tornado hazard communication pilot program to
evaluate the research.
This section would require NOAA to maintain a central reposi-
tory for NOAA data on hazardous weather and water event com-
munications, including social, behavioral, risk, and economic re-
search, and develop methods to prevent tampering with online haz-
ard communications.

Section 7:
Section 4. Warn-on-forecast strategic plan.
This section would require the Under Secretary to prepare and
submit to Congress a plan to develop and implement a high-resolu-
tion probabilistic forecast and warning system for hazardous
weather and water events no later than 1 year after enactment.
The plan would include priorities for vulnerable populations, im-

proved forecasting methodologies and modeling, and risk commu-
nication research.

Section 8:
Section 5. Tornado rating system.
This section would require NOAA to evaluate the current rating
system for tornado severity, determine if updates are needed, and
implement necessary changes.

Section 9:
Section 6. Post-storm surveys and assessments.
This section would require NOAA to perform one or more post-
storm surveys and assessments following significant hazardous
weather or water events. Surveys would be coordinated with Fed-
eral, State, local, and Tribal governments; institutions of higher
education; and private entities to optimize data collection, sharing,
and integration. Survey data would be made available to the public
after storm surveys. NOAA would improve the post-storm survey,
assessment methods, and data collection. Training, resources, and
counseling would be available to staff conducting post-storm sur-
veys and assessments.

Section 10:
Section 7. VORTEX-USA program.
This section would require the maintenance of a program for im-
proving tornado forecasts and warnings. NOAA would be required
to award research grants that improve risk communication and
STEM related to tornadoes, prioritizing research completed at mi-
nority-serving institutions. This section would authorize appropria-
tions of $11 million for each of fiscal years 2025 through 2032.

Section 11:
Section 8. Government Accountability Office report on hazardous
weather and water alert dissemination.
This section would require the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to create a report examining the information technology in-
frastructure of NWS of NOAA. The report would focus on the struc-
ture of the hazardous weather and water alert system and assess
if alerts are disseminated to the public in a timely and efficient
manner. GAO would be required to submit the report to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate
and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House
of Representatives no later than 540 days after enactment.

Section 12:
Section 9. Elimination of certain report requirements.
This section would eliminate an outdated report on information
systems at NWS.

TORNADO OBSERVATIONS RESEARCH AND NOTIFICATION
ASSESSMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONS ACT
JUNE2, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 258]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 258) to improve forecasting and un-
derstanding of tornadoes and other hazardous weather, and for
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon with amendments and recommends that the bill, as
amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 258, the Tornado Observations Research and
Notification Assessment for Development of Operations (TOR-
NADO) Act, is to improve forecasting and understanding of torna-
does and other hazardous weather, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Tornadoes are the fifth most deadly weather hazard, resulting in
an average of 48 fatalities per year over the last 10 years.1 Torna-
does are distinctively deadly events because they can form quickly
without warning and may be visibly obscured by rain or clouds.
While a tornado is on the ground, winds can reach up to 300 miles
per hour. Damage tracks can be more than 1 mile wide and 50

miles long.2 Around 1,200 tornadoes affect the United States year-
ly, but this is likely an underestimation due to discrepancies in re-
porting methods.3 While most people believe tornadoes only occur
in the Midwest’s Tornado Alley, they are present in all 50 States
and can happen at any time of year.4 Tornadoes are as common in
the Deep South as in the Great Plains.5 Overall, regions with
greater population density, urban sprawl, and manufactured homes
are particularly vulnerable.6
TORNADO RATING SCALE AND PUBLIC RESPONSE
The Fujita Scale (F-Scale) was initially developed based on the
damage intensity of tornadoes. However, this did not account for
observed wind speed. Since 2007, meteorologists have used the En-
hanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) to classify tornadoes based on wind
speeds and related damage. Both scales are rated from 0 (weak;
65–85 mph winds) to 5 (violent; 200+ mph winds).7 An issue with
this rating system is that many tornadoes move across rural areas
with little infrastructure, meaning their recorded damage may not
reflect their true strength.
The public is alerted to tornadoes through a tornado watch or
warning.8 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) issues a watch when the risk of a tornado is high but has
not yet occurred. A warning is issued when a tornado occurs and
there is a threat to life or property. Although understanding the
difference between a tornado watch and a warning is crucial for a
proper public response, at least a quarter of the individuals sur-
veyed did not know the difference.9 Most advice from local weather
stations is about sheltering in place at home, but when people are
at a public location during a tornado, they are unaware of how to
act safely. The combination of warning and location uncertainty
poses a greater risk for inappropriate safety actions by the public.
RECENT TORNADO IMPACTS
In 2024, the United States saw 1,473 confirmed tornadoes, the
second most on record. Major outbreaks in April, May, July, and
December caused widespread destruction, with several EF–4 torna-
does hitting the Midwest and Great Plains. May was especially se-
vere, with 527 tornadoes, nearly double the average. Hurricanes
Debby, Helene, and Milton fueled additional tornado activity in the
fall, including one of Florida’s most significant outbreaks in dec-
ades. The year ended with a December outbreak in the Southeast,
bringing 86 tornadoes, injuries, and fatalities. Tornadoes through-

out the year caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and
infrastructure nationwide.10
On March 31, 2023, 65 tornadoes swept across the Midwest and
South, killing at least 32 people. There was significant damage and
loss of life reported in Illinois, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, In-
diana, Mississippi, and even Delaware.11 In Illinois, a theater roof
caved in and left 1 person dead with 40 others injured. The severe
storms also caused significant gas leaks and power outages.12
IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING AND FORECASTING TORNADOES
Alerting people before tornadoes cannot happen without moni-
toring for suitable conditions that lead to formation and funnel
touch down. In the South, tornadoes are often difficult to see due
to rain, clouds, and nighttime occurrence.13 Overnight tornadoes
are 2.5 times more likely to kill than daytime tornadoes.14 Ample
warning time and effective public communications are critical since
people may be asleep or unable to see funnel formation. The NOAA
Storm Prediction Center (SPC) monitors tornado-prone regions and
issues daily forecasts.15 Local National Weather Service (NWS)
forecast offices issue tornado warnings that inform area residents.
Meteorologists at NOAA use multiple computer models at once, re-
ferred to as ensemble forecasting, to better predict weather.
However, there have been delays between the time NWS issues
warnings and when the public can access them. This decreases the
time people have to act in the event of a tornado. In Iowa, on
March 5, 2022, 17 tornadoes swept across the State, causing loss
of life and destruction of property. There was up to a 7-minute
delay in a tornado warning notification to the public due to soft-
ware and hardware issues at the national office.16 Advances in tor-
nado monitoring and forecasting can increase warning time, but
only if notifications can reach the public on time.
NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) conducts re-
search to better understand how tornados form and to improve
forecasts and warnings.17 The NSSL is involved with the Warn-on-
Forecast research program that seeks to improve warning lead
times for severe weather and water events by referencing high-res-
olution weather prediction models and high-performance com-
puting.18 NSSL also utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
their Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS of Supercells

(TORUS) project.19 UAVs can safely observe features near the
ground that may be key in tornado formation. To improve hazard
communication to the public, NSSL has created the Forecasting a
Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs) framework.20
FACETs aims to modernize weather forecasting and warnings by
incorporating evolving technology and developing user-specific,
clear, and simple communication methods that will better serve the
public during hazardous weather events.
THE ROLE OF RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN IMPROVING TORNADO
FORECASTS AND WARNINGS
Improvements and advances in tornado forecasting and warnings
would not be possible without the collaboration between Federal
agencies and research universities. NOAA Cooperative Institutes
are academic and nonprofit research institutions that conduct re-
search supporting NOAA’s goals and strategic plans.21 This pro-
gram includes 80 universities and research institutions in 33
States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Additionally,
NOAA Research Laboratories establish collaborative agreements
with universities to develop joint research institutes that are hubs
for leading research on atmospheric and earth sciences.22 At one
NOAA Research Laboratory, the National Severe Storms Labora-
tory (NSSL), the TORUS project is led by the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln in partnership with NOAA, the University of Okla-
homa Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies,
Texas Tech, and the University of Colorado Boulder.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 258 would do the following:
• Establish or designate a hazard risk communication office to
improve the communication of severe weather alerts, more
clearly inform action, and increase the likelihood that the pub-
lic takes appropriate action to prevent loss of life or property.
• Require NOAA to prepare and submit an action plan for the
national implementation of high-resolution probabilistic guid-
ance for tornado forecasting and prediction.
• Encourage NOAA to evaluate the current tornado rating sys-
tem and make updates.
• Require NOAA to coordinate with appropriate entities for post-
storm assessments to optimize data collection, sharing, and in-
tegration.
• Require NOAA to provide training, resources, and access to
professional counseling to support the mental health of employ-
ees conducting post-storm assessments.

ferred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate. Senator Blackburn is an additional cosponsor. On
February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session
and, by voice vote, ordered S. 258 to be reported favorably with an
amendment.
118th Congress
S. 1284, the TORNADO Act, was introduced on April 25, 2023,
by Senator Wicker (for himself and Senators Cruz, Thune, Grass-
ley, Hyde-Smith, Young, Blackburn, Boozman, and Peters) and was
referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation of the Senate. On May 10, 2023, the Committee met in open
Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 1284 to be re-
ported favorably with an amendment (in the nature of a sub-
stitute). Senators Moran and Warnock were later added as cospon-
sors.
117th Congress
S. 3817, the TORNADO Act, was introduced on March 10, 2022,
by Senator Wicker (for himself and Senators Grassley, Hyde-Smith,
Thune, and Ernst) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On March 22,
2022, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice
vote, ordered S. 3817 to be reported favorably with an amendment
(in the nature of a substitute). Senators Duckworth, Cruz, and
Peters were later added as cosponsors.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 258 would direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA) to improve forecasting of and warnings about
hazardous weather. The bill also would require NOAA to initiate

a pilot program for communicating tornado hazards. Finally, the
bill would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to
report on the National Weather Service’s information technology
infrastructure.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).
CBO assumes that S. 258 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and
that the authorized and estimated amounts will be available in
each year. Based on historical spending patterns, CBO estimates
that implementing the bill would cost $74 million over the 2025–
2030 period, as described below.
VORTEX–USA: The bill would authorize the appropriation of $11
million annually from 2025 through 2032 for VORTEX–USA
(Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment)
to develop accurate and timely tornado forecasts, predictions, and
warnings. In 2024, NOAA allocated $11 million to the project. CBO
estimates that implementing this provision would cost $59 million
over the 2025–2030 period and $28 million after 2030, assuming
appropriation of the authorized amounts.
Other Activities: Using information from NOAA, CBO estimates
that the pilot program would require four full-time employees and
one cooperative agreement with a research university at a total
cost of $15 million over the 2025–2030 period. Most of that cost
would be for the cooperative agreement. CBO also estimates that
the GAO report would cost less than $500,000. Any related spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 258 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.

CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘Tor-
nado Observations Research and Notification Assessment for De-
velopment of Operations Act’’ or the ‘‘TORNADO Act’’.
Section 2. Definitions.
This section would define the terms ‘‘hazardous weather and
water events’’, ‘‘historically Black college or university’’, ‘‘Indian
Tribe’’, ‘‘institution of higher education’’, ‘‘National Laboratory’’,
and ‘‘Under Secretary’’.
Section 3. Hazardous weather and water event risk communication.
This section would require maintaining and improving NOAA’s
systems for hazardous weather and water event communications to
prevent loss of life and property. It would create a hazard risk com-
munication office (Office) to simplify and improve hazard commu-
nications. The Office would develop a plan to enhance public haz-
ard communications, create metrics to track their impact on public
action, and periodically update the plan based on research and
metrics. The Office would also implement recommendations tai-
lored to vulnerable populations and based on social, behavioral,
risk, and communication science, responding to the needs of Fed-
eral, State, and local partners and various hazard types. To assess
effectiveness, the Office would collaborate with Federal partners in-
cluding National Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes, State
and local governments, Indian Tribes, educational institutions, and
media partners. Data from the Office would be accessible via a cen-
tral repository system.
This section would require NOAA to establish or maintain a haz-
ard communication research program to modernize the creation of
hazard information and responses to hazardous weather and water
events. NOAA would coordinate with States, Indian Tribes, local-
ities, and emergency managers on research priorities and results
and establish a tornado hazard communication pilot program to
evaluate the research.
This section would require NOAA to maintain a central reposi-
