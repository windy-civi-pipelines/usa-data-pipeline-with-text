GREAT LAKES MASS MARKING PROGRAM ACT OF 2025
JULY21, 2025.—Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 1917]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 1917) to establish the Great Lakes Mass Marking Pro-
gram, and for other purposes, having considered the same, reports
favorably thereon with an amendment and recommends that the
bill as amended do pass.
The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Great Lakes Mass Marking Program Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the Great Lakes have experienced rapid changes in recent years due to—
(A) the introduction of multiple aquatic invasive species;
(B) alterations in the food web; and
(C) decreases in the abundance of prey species;
(2) due to rapid biological change in the Great Lakes, the Great Lakes need
a collaborative, science-based program to assist in making management actions
regarding fish stocking rates, the rehabilitation of important fish species, and
habitat restoration;
(3) the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
New York, and Wisconsin and Indian Tribes in those States, working through
the Council of Lake Committees of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, have
identified that mass marking is—
(A) a precise tool to keep hatchery-produced fish in balance with wild
fish; and
(B) essential to achieving fishery management and research objectives
through producing a better understanding of—
(i) the quantity of hatchery produced fish compared to wild fish in
the Great Lakes;
(ii) the effectiveness of hatchery operations; and
(iii) the effectiveness of fishery management actions;
(4) the mass marking program of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
in the Great Lakes—

(A) was initiated in 2010 on a limited scale;
(B) annually tags approximately 9,000,000 to 11,000,000 of the hatchery-
produced fish stocked in the Great Lakes;
(C) is a basinwide cooperative effort among the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service, Indian Tribes, and State management agencies; and
(D) produces data used by State and Tribal fish management agencies to
make management decisions regarding Great Lakes fisheries;
(5) annually, Federal, State, and Tribal agencies stock approximately
21,000,000 hatchery-produced fish in the Great Lakes to support—
(A) native species recovery; and
(B) recreational and commercial fishing;
(6) mass marking of hatchery-produced fish, using automated technology, is
an efficient method of implementing a collaborative, science-based fishery pro-
gram; and
(7) the Great Lakes are an important and valued resource that—
(A) supports a robust regional economy valued at more than
$7,000,000,000; and
(B) provides stability to the economy of the United States.

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the Program $2,700,000 for
each of fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 1917 is to establish the Great Lakes Mass
Marking Program, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
According to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the tribal,
commercial, and recreational fisheries in the five Great Lakes are

home to 177 different species of fish, including 139 native species.1
These tribal, commercial, and recreational fisheries have an eco-
nomic value of more than $7 billion annually2 and support up to
75,000 jobs.3
One of the challenges that the Great Lakes’ fisheries have faced
is the prominence of invasive species that place pressure on native
fish populations and their ecosystems.4 One species, the Sea Lam-
prey (Petromyzon marinus), is native to the Atlantic Ocean but first
entered the Great Lakes in the 1920s and 1930s.5 In the roughly
100 years since sea lampreys first reached this region, Canada and
the United States went from harvesting roughly 15 million pounds
of lake trout annually in the upper Great Lakes in the 1940s to
roughly 300,000 pounds in the 1960s.6 Four carp species—grass,
black, bighead, and silver carp—also threaten the Great Lakes’
fisheries.7
To counter the threat of these invasive species, tribal, federal,
and state agencies introduce hatchery fish to encourage native spe-
cies recovery. For example, in 2018, the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources announced that they had introduced more than
21 million fish into the state’s waters, including the Great Lakes.8
More recently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) ten
hatcheries that support the Great Lakes region introduced more
than 4.7 million hatchery fish in all five Great Lakes in 2024.9 To
gather data on the success of hatchery fish, wildlife managers tag
large numbers of these fish through a practice known as mass
marking. This practice allows them to easily distinguish hatchery
fish from wild fish populations.
H.R. 1917 would codify the FWS’s existing Great Lakes Mass
Marking Program, which began in 2010. The activities carried out
by this program include tagging hatchery fish stocked in the great
lakes and assisting in cooperative fisheries management decisions
with states and tribes by producing data on the health of the fish-
ery.10 An amendment was adopted at markup to lower the author-
ization level to $2.7 million from Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 through FY
2030 to carry out this program, which is what the Great Lakes
Mass Marking Program currently receives in funding.

H.R. 1917 was introduced on March 6, 2025, by Representative
