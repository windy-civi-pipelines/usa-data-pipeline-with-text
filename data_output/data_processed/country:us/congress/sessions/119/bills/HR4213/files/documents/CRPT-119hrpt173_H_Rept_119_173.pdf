Overview
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for
vital homeland and national defense missions across eight oper-
ational components. From providing border security to keeping the
flying public safe, to protecting our Nation’s key leadership, guard-
ing against cybersecurity threats to the country’s critical infra-
structure, and to responding to both natural and man-made disas-

ters, the Department ensures the Nation is well-equipped to ad-
dress challenges facing the Homeland. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $99,136,555,000 in total discretionary appro-
priations for DHS, including $66,361,000,000 within the bill’s
302(b) budget allocation, $6,301,555,000 in discretionary appropria-
tions offset by fee collections, and $26,474,000,000 as an allocation
adjustment for major disaster response and recovery activities. The
total within the allocation is $1,331,769,000 above the fiscal year
2025 level.
Homeland Security Investments
Investments in this bill are intended to balance competing prior-
ities across the Department’s important missions, all of which are
critical to the security of the Nation, including providing funding
for: border security technology; Border Patrol Agents; the deploy-
ment of additional Non-Intrusive Inspection machines at ports of
entry (POEs) to increase the detection of fentanyl; artificial intel-
ligence and machine learning capabilities to reduce manual review
of cargo and vehicle images; immigration detention capacity; trans-
portation and removal operations for additional deportation of
criminal aliens; continuing recapitalization of the Coast Guard’s
surface and aviation fleets, including continued support for the
Fast Response Cutter, Waterways Commerce Cutter, and Offshore
Patrol Cutter programs; and cybersecurity defense tools and tech-
nology to protect government networks and critical infrastructure.
Border Security
Under the previous administration, alien encounters skyrocketed,
growing as high as nearly 15,000 per day. U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection (CBP) agents and officers were pulled away from
their primary law enforcement duties to ‘‘manage’’ this policy-driv-
en crisis. However, this administration made key policy changes to
enforce long-standing immigration laws already on the books. On
average, these policy changes have reduced border crossings by
more than 90 percent year-over-year, allowing CBP to close costly
soft-sided facilities due to the reduced alien flow along the southern
border. This bill supplements the policy direction of this adminis-
tration by making long-term border security investments that will
enable our front-line agents to sustain the recent reductions in il-
licit border activity. The bill sustains funding for a Border Patrol
end strength of 22,000 agents and includes the following:
$84,022,000 for workforce care; $20,000,000 for innovative tech-
nology; $24,000,000 for tactical aerostats; $10,440,000 for cross-bor-
der tunnel threat detection; and $4,000,000 for carrizo cane control.
Within CBP’s Procurement, Construction, and Improvements ac-
count, the recommendation includes: $346,000,000 for border tech-
nology; $300,000,000 for Non-Intrusive Inspection equipment;
$66,500,000 for Light Enforcement Helicopters; $29,700,000 for UH
60 Medium Lift Helicopters; and $13,000,000 for sensor upgrades.
Immigration Enforcement
As the number of aliens who have final orders of removal exceeds
1,300,000, it is the responsibility of this Committee to provide ap-
propriate funding to deter, detain, and deport those who do not

have a legal basis to remain in this country or those who harm our
citizens and communities. To further this administration’s prior-
ities, the Committee provides resources for U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) to fund significant increases for the
critical components of a robust enforcement and removal appa-
ratus, such as 50,000 detention beds. The recommendation also in-
cludes additional funding for transportation and removal oper-
ations to ensure that ICE can execute its statutory authority to
perform necessary interior enforcement actions.
Transportation Security
The Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) implementa-
tion of changes to its pay structure has caused dramatic increases
to the agency’s budget, which have continued to come at the ex-
pense of other priorities. This bill provides $213,000,000 for check-
point screening infrastructure to restore some of the cuts that were
necessary to fund the agency’s pay structure changes.
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
The bill provides $2,738,206,000 for the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency (CISA) to sustain investments in secur-
ing Federal civilian executive branch networks and helping state,
local, Tribal, and territorial governments and critical infrastructure
companies secure both cyber and physical infrastructure, while
making strategic cuts to programs and positions that are not
aligned with CISA’s statutory mission.
Citizenship and Immigration Processing
With few exceptions, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(has historically operated as a fee-funded agency, with its operating
expenses originating primarily from fees charged to applicants and
petitioners seeking immigration benefits. The bill returns to this
traditional funding structure and includes appropriations only for
the E-Verify program.
Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction
The authorization for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruc-
tion office, which was extended beyond its statutory end date
through fiscal year 2024 continuing resolutions, ended on March
22, 2024. Unlike some authorizations that simply lapse, the statu-
tory construction of section 591(e) of title 6, United States Code,
terminated the office. As a result, authority for the office continued
solely on the basis of the fiscal year 2024 appropriation. The Com-
mittee declines to continue, via appropriation, a terminated office
and instead chooses to move the critical functions of this office into
other components.
Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Submission
Due to the substantial delay of the fiscal year 2026 budget sub-
mission, most of the changes to DHS proposed by the administra-
tion have not been considered in this bill. The Committee notes
that the request includes a number of important reforms and pro-
posals to reorganize the Department. The Committee applauds the

long overdue efforts to restrain the growth of DHS outside of its
key statutorily authorized missions. The Committee looks forward
to working with the Department to consider these reforms as this
bill moves through the legislative process.

that cities hosting events associated with the 2026 FIFA World
Cup face critical public safety needs that require adequate prepara-
tion. These include ensuring secure communications for first re-

sponders; working with federal and SLTT jurisdictions to provide
emergency services; and ensuring a safe environment for all
attendees, residents, and visitors to the United States. However,
the Committee is concerned with the lack of departmental budget
planning for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Not later than 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary is directed to
brief the Committee on the security planning processes, expected
budgetary impacts to the Department, coordination efforts with
Federal and SLTT entities, and additional resource requirements
necessary for host cities to adequately prepare for the 2026 FIFA
World Cup.
2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.—The 2028 Olympic and
Paralympic Games in Los Angeles, California, have been des-
ignated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), which com-
mits the Department to develop event security and incident man-
agement plans to ensure the safety of all participants. Because sig-
nificant resources will need to be dedicated to this effort over the
next four years, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Com-
mittee not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this
Act that details the full scope of the Department’s obligations for
this NSSE. The report shall include the nature of the Department’s
coordination with the organizing committee involved in the 2028
Games and with other federal agencies and departments, as well
as representatives of the relevant state and local government enti-
ties, including Olympic events not hosted in the Los Angeles area.
The report shall also include the Department’s projected resource
needs for this NSSE for fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2029,
including specific account details for each fiscal year.
Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF).—The Committee
recognizes the critical need for secure, centralized infrastructure to
integrate federal and state administrative data for research and
policymaking. The Committee strongly encourages the Department
to expand secure access to administrative data on cyber threats,
border security, human trafficking, and emergency response
through the utilization of the ADRF, a Federal Risk and Authoriza-
tion Management Program authorized research platform designed
to securely link sensitive research and administrative data with
states and other federal agencies’ datasets. The Committee directs
the DHS Statistical Official, in consultation with the DHS Chief
Data Officer, the Chief Information Officer, and the Senior Agency
Official for Privacy, to coordinate these efforts across the relevant
DHS components and to ensure compliance with all applicable laws
and DHS policies, including the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93–579).
The recommendation provides $2,000,000 to expand the ADRF’s ca-
pabilities, including enhanced data-sharing partnerships, expanded
security measures, and the development of advanced analytical
tools to support DHS and other agencies’ homeland security re-
search needs, and to enhance DHS’s ability to securely transmit
timely data to the ADRF. The Committee directs the DHS Statis-
tical Official to submit a report within 180 days of the date of en-
actment of this Act detailing progress on the integration of admin-
istrative data for homeland security research, including an assess-
ment of how ADRF is being leveraged to enhance interagency col-
laboration and threat analysis.

Army’s 250th Birthday.—Not later than 30 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to the
Committee that details the total obligations associated with the pa-
rade commemorating the Army’s 250th birthday held in Wash-
ington, D.C., on June 14, 2025. The report shall include the total
cost to each departmental component, broken out by PPA, includ-
ing the costs for pre-parade preparation, security, travel, and other
activities related to this event.
Biometric Exit and Visa Overstay.—The Department is directed
to provide a spend plan for H–1B and L–1 fee revenues and any
other resources being applied to biometric exit implementation not
later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The
Committee further directs the Department to brief the Committee
within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act to detail ongo-
ing efforts to address entry and exit data collection and exchange
in the land border environment. Further, pursuant to section 1376
of title 8, United States Code, the Department is required to collect
data on nonimmigrants who have overstayed their visas and to re-
port annual estimates to Congress. The Department shall provide
the report on an annual basis. As previously required, the Depart-
ment shall submit an updated report outlining its comprehensive
strategy for overstay enforcement and deterrence not later than
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The report shall
detail the ongoing actions to identify individuals who have over-
stayed their visas, including those actions necessary to improve the
capabilities to report such information; notify individuals of their
required departure dates in advance; track such overstays for en-
forcement action; refuse or revoke current and future visas and
travel authorizations; and otherwise deter violations or take en-
forcement action.
Border and Immigration Related Data and Transparency.—With-
in 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, and quarterly
thereafter, the Secretary, in consultation with other appropriate
federal officials, shall submit to the Committee a report that details
the situational awareness of the southern border that includes data
related to the number of ‘‘turn backs,’’ ‘‘got aways,’’ and monthly
apprehension rate data by sector. For the purposes of this reporting
requirement, the Department shall use the definitions provided in
section 223 of title 6, United States Code. CBP is also directed to
ensure a review by third-party statistical experts on the current
process, assumptions, and formulas used to derive the ‘‘got aways’’
estimates and any proposed changes to improve such estimates, in-
cluding proposed changes to statutory definitions, if any. Addition-
ally, the Department shall provide to the Committee and shall post
on a publicly accessible website by the 15th of each month the fol-
lowing, delineating requests received and granted by entity, includ-
ing CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services:
(1) DHS’s total detention capacity, as well as usage rate dur-
ing the previous month;
(2) the total monthly number of ‘‘applicants for admission’’
under section 1225 of Title 8, United States Code, who are pa-
roled into the United States during the previous month;

leased into the United States, paroled or otherwise, during the
previous month;

States during the previous month;
(5) of the total number of individuals paroled, the rationale
for each grant, and its duration; and
(6) the total number of referrals for prosecution made to the
Department of Justice (DOJ) for illegal entry or illegal reentry
during the previous month.
Child Well-Being Specialists.—The recommendation provides
$18,050,000 for the Child Well-Being Specialists program. The
Committee continues the reporting directive under the heading,
‘‘Child Well-Being Professionals’’ in the explanatory statement ac-
companying Public Law 118–47.
Combatting Antisemitism.—The Committee directs the Secretary
to release a public report, not later than 90 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, detailing how the Department plans to im-
plement Executive Order 14188, of January 29, 2025, relating to
additional measures to combat antisemitism.
Customer Experience.—The Committee directs the Secretary to
develop standards to improve customer experience and to incor-
porate those standards into the performance plans required under
section 1115 of title 31, United States Code. Not later than 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Department shall pro-
vide the Committee an update on plans for implementing this re-
quirement.
Detention Space Report.—Not later than 60 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, and semiannually thereafter, consistent
with the requirements found in section 1368 of title 8, United
States Code, the Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS), in
coordination with ICE, shall submit the required report to the
Committee.
GAO Review on Unified Immigration Portal (UIP) Efficacy.—The
Committee recognizes that enabling agencies to efficiently share
data and information, in particular information relating to law en-
forcement activities, is critically vital to our domestic security.
While the intent of the UIP is to connect relevant data from across
agencies involved in the immigration lifecycle, the Committee is
concerned that the system’s efficacy remains unverified. Therefore,
the Committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to brief the Committee within 180 days of the date of enact-
ment of this Act with the results of a review on the UIP system’s
current performance metrics, operational efficiency, and moderniza-
tion requirements. The review shall include an assessment of:
(1) cloud-based solutions to enhance system performance and
reduce operational costs;
(2) any plans for modernizing legacy components;
(3) technical and operational challenges affecting system ef-
fectiveness; and
(4) any recommendations for improving cross-agency data
sharing and integration to save taxpayer resources.
Law Enforcement Support.—The Department is directed to con-
tinue quarterly reporting, on a publicly accessible website, on re-
quests to DHS law enforcement components for support in the form
of personnel, aircraft, or other assets, consistent with the require-

ment under this heading in the explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328. Support to a non-federal entity in a
location where First Amendment protected activity is occurring
should only be provided if approved in advance by the Secretary,
the Deputy Secretary, or the Under Secretary for Management.
The Department shall notify the Committee not more than 48
hours after the approval of such support.
Law Enforcement Support and Counter Transnational Repres-
sion.—The Committee is concerned about the increased use of
transnational repression tactics by foreign governments, Foreign
Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), and transnational crime organiza-
tions against individuals on U.S. soil. The Committee encourages
the Department to evaluate the implementation of a public service
announcement campaign educating the public and international al-
lies on the issue of transnational repression, terrorism threats re-
lated to transnational repression, and the resources available to
victims. Within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, DHS
is directed to brief the Committee on policy considerations related
to the implementation of such a public service campaign.
National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC).—The rec-
ommendation transfers the personnel and the functions of the
NBIC in the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office to the
Office of Health Security (OHS). The Committee encourages OHS
to ensure that NBIC analytics and products are operationally fo-
cused to support frontline operations and not duplicative of other
Federal government biosurveillance reporting.
Northern Border.—The Committee recognizes the continued work
of DHS, in partnership with our Canadian allies, to ensure ade-
quate resources are assigned to secure the Nation’s northern bor-
der. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide a briefing de-
tailing a breakdown of the financial, staffing, and equipment re-
sources allocated to northern border protection; statistics on border
crossings, seizures, and arrests; an analysis of the cost-effective-
ness of operations conducted on the northern border compared to
those on the southern border; and an assessment of joint U.S.-Can-
ada border security operations.
Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS).—The Committee
is concerned that monthly reports have not been updated since
January 2025, despite the requirements in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 117–328. The Committee directs
the OHSS to continue to provide monthly reports for fiscal year
2026. The Committee also directs OHSS to include in its report the
arrest location and the number of repatriations by arresting agen-
cy, as well as detentions, removals, and ICE arrests of U.S. citi-
zens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and former members of the
Armed Services. The report shall include monthly data on self-de-
portations through the CBP Home App.
Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO).—The
recommendation does not include funds for OIDO.
Official Reception and Representation Expenses.—DHS shall con-
tinue to submit quarterly obligation reports for official reception
and representation expenses, as in prior years. Prior to the obliga-
tion of any funds for reception and representation expenses to pur-
chase collectibles or memorabilia, the Department shall provide the

Committee no fewer than 14 days advance written notification de-
scribing the purpose of such purchases and the projected costs.
Performance Measures.—The Committee directs all agencies
funded by this Act to comply with title 31 of United States Code,
including by developing organizational priority goals and outcomes
such as performance outcome measures, output measures, effi-
ciency measures, and customer service measures.
Simulation-Based Emergency Preparedness Network.—The Com-
mittee encourages DHS to support the development and implemen-
tation of simulation-based emergency preparedness network pro-
grams. These programs ensure that the first responder and first re-
ceiver health workforce receive high-quality, pertinent, evidence-
based training required to care for people injured before, during,
and after emergencies and disasters, particularly those in rural
and remote areas. This effort may include increasing live and vir-
tual content delivery capacity at accredited healthcare simulation
centers and establishing partnerships with academic health institu-
tions and systems in developing training to the first responder and
first receiver health workforce. It should also include expanding
relevant content and access at DHS training facilities, developing
appropriate governance on data management, and outfitting
Health Professional Shortage Areas, Medically Underserved Areas,
or Tribal entities with necessary health security simulation hard-
ware and software assets.
Telemental Health and Employee Assistance Pilot.—The rec-
ommendation provides $1,500,000 to continue the pilot efforts, as
described in House Report 118–123 accompanying Public Law 118–
47.
Temporary Additional Duty in Support of Enforcement Oper-
ations.—The Committee directs DHS to brief the Committee no
later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act and quar-
terly thereafter, on the number of departmental employees who
have been temporarily assigned to ICE for the purposes of immi-
gration enforcement since January 20, 2025. The report should in-
clude a breakout by agency on the average costs per detail assign-
ment, the average length of detail assignments, and the roles and
responsibilities carried out during the detail, including the number
of arrests made in support of ICE enforcement and removal oper-
ations.
Terrorism Watch List.—The Department shall notify the Com-
mittee within seven days if an individual on the Federal Bureau
of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorist Screening Dataset (TSDS) is en-
countered by the Department at or between a Port of Entry (POE).
Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO) Recruiting.—The
Committee notes the dangers posed by TCOs and their illegal
smuggling and trafficking activities along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The Committee is also aware that TCOs have increasingly sought
to recruit minors in U.S. border communities to assist with illegal
smuggling and trafficking activities. To better understand the prev-
alence of TCO engagement with minors in the United States, the
Secretary is directed to report to the Committee within 180 days
of the date of enactment of this Act on the influence of TCOs in
border communities, including:
(1) the number of encounters Federal law enforcement has
had with U.S. citizens or otherwise lawfully present aliens

under 18 years of age working with or on behalf of known
TCOs for illegal smuggling or trafficking purposes within 100
miles of the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2026; and
(2) strategies for DHS to work with any necessary federal
and SLTT entities to combat TCO’s recruiting individuals
under 18 years of age in the U.S. for illegal smuggling and
trafficking activities.
Tribal Training.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
reducing immigration enforcement encounters with lawful U.S. citi-
zens. Given the unique nature of the government-to-government re-
lationship between Tribal Nations and the Federal government, im-
migration enforcement agents and officers should have an under-
standing of this relationship and the cultural intricacies of inter-
acting with Tribal members. This should include but not be limited
to recognizing names of Tribes in areas where officers and agents
are operating and recognizing and accepting Tribal identification
and Certificates of Degree of Indian Blood. The Committee encour-
ages the Department to consider training programs for agents and
officers to better inform encounters with Native Americans.
TSDS Encounters.—Individuals on the FBI TSDS encountered at
or between POEs may include family members or associates of a
known or suspected terrorist or individuals incorrectly identified as
TSDS matches who the Department determines, after evaluation in
coordination with the FBI, do not pose a homeland security threat.
Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, and quarterly
thereafter, the Department shall provide a report to the Committee
detailing what actions, if any, the Department has taken or plans
to take to determine whether each individual on the TSDS encoun-
tered at or between POEs poses a homeland security threat that
needs to be mitigated and the total number of individuals deter-
mined to pose such a threat. This report shall also include the loca-
tion of each encounter, the individual’s nationality, the individual’s
post-apprehension outcome, and any other available information.
This report shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain
a classified annex.
Women, Peace, and Security (WPS).—Not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, DHS shall submit a report and
provide a briefing to the Committee and to the co-chairs of the bi-
partisan Women, Peace, and Security Caucus detailing plans to im-
plement the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (P.L. 115–68),
the U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security, and the Depart-
ment’s WPS implementation plan. The briefing shall include details
on plans to hire and train qualified and dedicated advisors to en-
sure programming is accessible and that women’s equality is ad-
dressed. The briefing shall also include plans to bolster WPS efforts
in the Department, plans to provide department-wide training to
ensure officials understand how the inclusion of women increases
the effectiveness of security-related policies and programs, and new
WPS programming being developed.
Workforce Wellness and Suicide Prevention.—The recommenda-
tion provides $2,000,000 to expand department-wide workforce
wellness and suicide prevention efforts. Not later than 60 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, OHS shall provide an up-
date to the Committee on the status of these efforts and its plans
for this funding. Additionally, the Committee encourages OHS to

duce costs. The Committee directs the DHS AI Corps to continue
its efforts to achieve these objectives and to notify the Committee
regarding any planned cuts to programs or personnel.
Budget Justifications.—The Department is expected to provide
complete justification materials for the fiscal year 2027 budget re-
quest, including details for each office and program, and to clearly
describe and account for current services, transfers, adjustments to
base, and program changes. In addition to the detail provided in
current reporting, the justifications shall incorporate output from
predictive models used by DHS component agencies. For each rel-
evant program area, justifications shall clearly describe and quan-
tify the projections used to inform resource requests, indicate the
offices and components impacted by the projections, and confirm
whether the budget requests for those offices and components were
developed using the same assumptions. In addition, the Chief Fi-
nancial Officer (CFO) is directed to ensure that fiscal year 2027
budget justification materials for classified and unclassified budg-
ets of all components are submitted concurrently with the Presi-
dent’s budget submission to Congress and that the structure, ter-
minology, and format of such budget materials are standardized to
the greatest extent possible.
Component Staffing Plans.—The Department shall submit staff-
ing plans to the Committee on a quarterly basis and shall ensure
such plans are aligned to the budget justification materials at the
PPA level.
Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (cUAS).—The Department is
reminded of the requirement found under this heading in the ex-
planatory statement accompanying Public Law 117–328.
Enterprise-Wide IT License Agreements.—The Committee is
aware that the Department is improving its IT service, operations,
and asset management, low-code application development, and
human resources management systems to create improvements in
IT auditability, security, and efficiency at several operational com-
ponents. The Committee supports these efforts and strongly en-
courages the Department to evaluate opportunities to achieve im-
proved economies of scale through the consolidation of disparate
contracts into enterprise-wide agreements. Accordingly, the Com-
mittee directs the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to provide a
briefing to the Committee, within 180 days of the date of enact-
ment of this Act, on the Department’s efforts to consolidate IT li-
cense agreements across components to reduce cost and improve
performance.
Enterprise-Wide Maritime Domain Platform.—The recommenda-
tion includes a reduction of $6,000,000 to the Office of the Chief In-
formation Officer (OCIO) that was added as directed in the explan-
atory statement accompanying Public Law 118–47. The Depart-
ment is reminded of Congress’ oversight functions and the Depart-
ment’s duty to respond to lawful and constitutionally authorized re-
quests for information. For instances in which the Department has
a legitimate reason to execute funding in a manner inconsistent
with congressional intent, notification should be provided as soon
as possible before funds are obligated or would lapse.
Federal Protective Service (FPS) NSSEs Support.—The rec-
ommendation includes $3,800,000 allocated to the Office of the
Chief Security Office. The Department shall direct this funding to

FPS in support of FPS’s work at NSSEs and deployment of cUAS
capabilities.
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
(FedRAMP).—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
DHS OCIO’s responsibility as a member of the FedRAMP Joint Au-
thorization Board and the value of modern cloud products and serv-
ices. Accordingly, the Committee directs the OCIO to brief the
Committee, within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act,
on the resources necessary to enable increased FedRAMP contin-
uous monitoring workload and the facilitation of cloud services.
Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) System.—
The Committee is very interested in HART’s ability to achieve ini-
tial operating capability in fiscal year 2026 and its ability to
progress to full operational capability (FOC). During the transition
from the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), the
Committee directs the Department to ensure full system redun-
dancy until HART can be operationally certified. The Department
is directed to continue to brief the Committee monthly on system
development, associated costs, and schedule until FOC of HART is
achieved.
Joint Requirements Council (JRC).—The recommendation rejects
the transfer of the JRC to the Office of Program Accountability and
Risk Management as proposed in the fiscal year 2026 budget re-
quest. The explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–
47 required both a wind down plan and an identification of alter-
native methods to improve the management and resourcing of joint
requirements in lieu of funding the JRC. The Committee strongly
encourages the Department to provide a robust plan that presents
a wholesale change in the Department’s management of joint re-
quirements to comply with congressional intent.
Obligation Plans.—The Department shall continue to submit ob-
ligation plans on a quarterly basis consistent with direction pro-
vided in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 114–
113. Additionally, the CFO shall require the use of a uniform obli-
gation plan template aligned with the budget justification mate-
rials to ensure consistency across components, which shall include
quarterly spending targets for each account and PPA. The CFO
shall be responsible for ensuring that components with major ac-
quisition programs include the breakout of these programs within
their quarterly plans and provide additional context to describe and
justify any changes from the prior submission.
Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM).—OBIM is di-
rected to continue briefing the Committee on a semiannual basis
on its workload, service levels, staffing, modernization efforts, and
other operations. The recommendation includes $271,742,000 for
OBIM.

The recommendation provides no funding for the National Capitol
Region (NCR) headquarters consolidation.
Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems.—The Committee recognizes
the growing threat that unmanned aerial systems present during
NSSEs and the role that the FPS plays during these events. Not
later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the De-
partment shall brief the Committee on its cUAS acquisitions and
capabilities within the Office of the Chief Security Officer and FPS.
The recommendation provides $3,400,000 to detect and mitigate
persistent drone threats at NSSEs.
DHS Procurement Policies.—The Committee is concerned that
existing procurement policies and procedures interfere with deliv-
ering mission critical support to government agencies and the con-
stituents they serve. As technology develops at an increasingly
rapid pace, traditional methods of procurement are hampering the
government’s ability to respond to changing needs. Large scale, all-
encompassing procurements that seek to solve every problem with
a single procurement are unwieldy, often result in the need for sub-
contractors, and fail to take advantage of technology specialization
in the contractor community. Further, they are often delayed due
to protests, are difficult to modify afterwards, and result in waste-
ful government spending. Awardees then sometimes leverage their
legacy status as federal contractors to stifle competition and avoid
accountability. The Committee encourages DHS to make use of
smaller, targeted procurements that make use of alternative con-
tracting approaches to increase competition, foster innovation, and
reduce risk of contract non-performance. Further, the Committee
encourages DHS to focus on holding contractors accountable to
measurable results and, where appropriate, utilize pilot projects
and open competition to identify contractors that can most readily
meet the needs of DHS.
Facilities Transformation/Lease Efficiencies.—The recommenda-
tion includes $30,000,000 for facilities transformation and lease ef-
ficiencies to increase the occupancy footprint of existing facilities.
The Department is directed to brief the Committee within 120 days
of the date of enactment of this Act. The briefing shall include an
overview of the implementation of the funding provided as well as
an updated cost-benefit analysis for existing and future projects.
Financial Systems Modernization (FSM) Acquisition.—The rec-
ommendation includes $40,000,000 for FSM. The Department shall
brief the Committee not later than 120 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act on progress of the Department-wide financial sys-
tems modernization, plans for the project in future fiscal years, and
lessons learned from components that have transitioned from leg-
acy financial systems.
NCR Headquarters Consolidation.—The Department is directed
to provide a briefing to the Committee within 120 days of the date
of enactment of this Act on all current and future projects in the
NCR DHS Lease Consolidation Plan. The briefing shall include in-
formation on any projects that have been paused or cancelled with
an updated cost-benefit analysis for current and future projects
that incorporates present-day market rental rates for commercial
real estate. The Department is encouraged to continuously evaluate
if future construction is cost advantageous in lieu of long-term
leases.

include resourcing requirements to scale such integration with the
NVC inclusive of network infrastructure needs.
Semiannual Intelligence Threat Briefings.—The Committee rec-
ognizes I&A’s unique role in the Intelligence Community (IC) by
aggregating holdings from the Department to enrich those within
the IC and disseminating intelligence to SLTT and private sector
partners in order to identify and mitigate threats to the homeland.
I&A shall provide semiannual intelligence briefings to the Com-
mittee beginning not later than 90 days after the date of enactment
of this Act. The briefings shall include a high-level summary of
I&A produced collections and analysis products, summary statistics
of intelligence sharing to SLTT and private sector partners, and an
analysis of growing threat trends including examples of I&A as-
sisted outcomes. The briefings shall also include metrics used to

this Act, CBP shall report to the Committee on the number of ‘fail-
ures to yield’ that CBP encountered in southern border states and
how many of those incidents were coordinated with SLTT enforce-
ment partners.
Fentanyl Risk to Law Enforcement.—The Committee recognizes
the clear danger to all CBP officers, agents, other personnel, and
canines from secondary exposure to illicit substances like fentanyl
and other opioids. The Committee also notes that section 7135 of
the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023 (P.L. 117–263) requires the Commissioner of CBP to en-
sure the availability of containment devices for all CBP personnel
and canines at risk of accidental exposure to synthetic opioids. The
Committee directs the Commissioner to submit a report within 180
days of the date of enactment of this Act that details all actions
taken to comply with that directive, including any ongoing or
planned procurement processes. In addition, within 180 days of the
date of enactment of this Act, CBP in consultation with Homeland
Security Investigations (HSI), shall brief the Committee on the De-
partment’s current understanding of how transnational criminal or-
ganizations (TCOs) are distributing fentanyl and other illicit nar-
cotics throughout the United States after first smuggling it across
the southern border.
Gunshot Detection Technology.—The Committee recognizes the
escalating threats faced by CBP agents and officers along the U.S.-
Mexico border, particularly from TCOs employing firearms to dis-
rupt border security operations. To enhance the safety and effec-
tiveness of federal personnel operating in these high-risk regions,
the Committee supports the deployment of the best available gun-
shot detection technology to provide real-time alerts and precise
geolocation of gunfire, which could increase situational awareness
and response capabilities. Not later than 90 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee on the potential use of this technology along the southern
border.

time passive sonar AI models; and supply chain awareness. CBP is
directed to update the Committee on the planned obligation of
these funds not fewer than 15 days prior to any obligation of funds.
Funding shall not exceed $5,000,000 for any individual project.
Maintenance Apprenticeships.—CBP is encouraged to consider
the feasibility of apprenticeships, internships, or other avenues of
engagement with local educational institutions to cultivate the
maintenance skills needed by CBP.
Polygraph Flexibility.—The Committee is concerned that the
polygraph requirement for CBP law enforcement applicants con-
tinues to delay hiring and exacerbate hiring shortfalls. To improve
workforce readiness while maintaining personnel integrity, the
Committee urges CBP to use its full authority under section 221
of title 6, United States Code, to waive polygraph examinations for
anyone who holds a current, active Top Secret clearance and is able
to access sensitive compartmented information; has a current sin-
gle scope background investigation; was not granted a waiver to ob-
tain the clearance; or is a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. Not
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP
shall brief the Committee on the number of applicants eligible for
a waiver, the number of waivers granted, and the impact on hiring.

Therapy Dog Adoptions.—CBP launched an initiative to bring
real, on-the-ground support to its workforce through the creation of
the Support Canine Program. This program aims to have therapy
dogs on-site to assist in improving staff morale, assist in grief, and
mitigate trauma from critical incidents. The Committee strongly
encourages CBP to establish a pilot program to adopt dogs from
local animal shelters to be trained as therapy dogs.
Video Monitoring.—CBP shall continue the reporting directives
as described under this heading found in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 118–47.
Workforce Care.—The recommendation provides a total of
$84,022,000 for the sustainment of existing program operations
and personnel, on-site clinicians, the sustainment of family support
programs, CBP support networks, the expansion of employee holis-
tic health support centers, and the deployment of Field Resilience
teams consisting of Operational Psychologists and Field Resilience
Specialists. Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of
this Act, CBP, in coordination with the Office of Health Security,
shall brief the Committee on an obligation plan for this funding.
Border Security Operations
Border Patrol Checkpoints.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of facilitating security through the use of U.S. Border Pa-
trol (USBP) checkpoints throughout the country. The Committee
encourages CBP to prioritize the modernization of USBP check-
points. They are outdated and unable to safely and efficiently ac-
commodate increasing traffic volume, particularly along routes
with high rates of traffic, such as the Eagle Pass and San Clemente
checkpoints. The Committee also encourages CBP to prioritize the
modernization of checkpoints including acceleration and decelera-
tion lanes, lane expansions, vehicle bollards, new signage, primary
inspection booths, canine facilities, canopy, lighting, technology,
and facility updates to increase public and agent safety. Not later
than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall
provide a briefing to the Committee identifying the locations where
checkpoint modernization would be the most beneficial, the associ-
ated cost estimates, and project risk considerations. Additionally,
the briefing shall include an assessment of deploying and imple-
menting technology and cargo inspection processes that maximize
the effectiveness and efficiency of processing commercial vehicles.
The briefing should also include the feasbility of new Border Patrol
checkpoints, especially across the southwest border, aimed at in-
creasing narcotics interdiction.
Border Patrol Hiring.—The recommendation provides
$613,462,000 to sustain 22,000 Border Patrol Agents. CBP has
struggled to hire agents despite continued investment by the Com-
mittee. CBP’s top priorities should be growing the pipeline of quali-
fied applicants, further reducing attrition at the Border Patrol
Academy, and retaining the existing workforce. The Committee di-
rects CBP to use the funds provided that are above onboard per-
sonnel levels for recruitment and retention incentives. Not later
than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall
brief the Committee on its plans to address hiring and retention
challenges, including academy attrition, and its plans to use any

projected surplus personnel funding for recruitment and retention
incentives.
Carrizo Cane.—The recommendation provides $4,000,000 for ef-
forts to control the growth of carrizo cane along the Rio Grande
River in Texas. CBP shall continue to provide quarterly updates on
the performance of this program related to improved visibility, bio-
mass reduction, and miles of river treated.
Geospatial Data.—The Committee is aware of the challenges as-
sociated with CBP’s ability to access and utilize space-based
geospatial data and imagery to inform operational decision-making
at and near the northern and southern borders and surrounding
POEs. Critical gaps remain in the CBP’s ability to procure commer-
cially available geospatial data and related services in a way that
will provide the historical and real-time intelligence needed to se-
cure the borders and optimize resources and decision making. CBP
shall brief the Committee not later than 90 days after the date of
enactment of this Act on its current process for the evaluation, pro-
curement, integration, and distribution of space-based commercial
data, imagery products, and services.
Northern Border Resources and Encounters.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the number of encounters between POEs along the north-
ern border and the importance of having resources to adequately
staff and secure this border. The Committee urges the Department
to prioritize deployment of agents and other resources to sectors
along the northern border where encounters between POEs are in-
creasing the most and to reduce future deployments of agents from
sectors to the southern border. Not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act, CBP is directed to brief the Com-
mittee on efforts to address staffing issues, alien encounters, and
drug seizures on the northern border.
Trade and Travel Operations
Agriculture Quarantine Inspection.—The Committee supports ro-
bust funding for CBP’s Agriculture Specialists, Technicians, and
Canine Teams. These personnel are critical to protecting U.S. agri-
culture and the national food supply by conducting inspections at
the POEs to detect and prevent the entry of harmful foreign animal
diseases and plant pests, including African Swine Fever. The Com-
mittee recognizes that an outbreak of such diseases would have
catastrophic consequences for American livestock producers, rural
economies, and national food security. The Committee urges CBP
to prioritize staffing and training for these specialized teams and
to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to sustain and expand
their operations.
Automated Commercial Environment.—Not later than 30 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall update the Auto-
mated Commercial Environment system to enable export carriers
to close out customs bonds opened on their behalf by the importing
carriers and customs brokers.
Border Security Deployment Program (BSDP).—The Committee
recognizes the importance of a comprehensive, integrated, and con-
tinuous surveillance and intrusion detection system provided at
CBP locations to improve the safety and security of CBP officers
and the traveling public. The recommendation includes not less
than $40,000,000 to maintain and modernize the BSDP system in-

frastructure. The Committee directs CBP to provide a briefing
within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on efforts to
modernize this system.
Closed-Loop Cruise Ship Travel.—U.S. citizens who board a
cruise ship at a port or place within the United States, travel en-
tirely within the Western Hemisphere, and return on the voyage on
the same cruise ship to the same U.S. port or place from which
they departed, may present, rather than a passport, a government-
issued photo-identification document in combination with other
forms of identifying information. The Committee believes that the
adoption of this policy has measurably contributed to the facilita-
tion of secure travel for a significant number of U.S. citizens and
strongly encourages CBP to continue to allow U.S. citizens to use
documents other than passports when on closed-loop travel.
Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals.—The Committee recognizes the
critical role of CBP in keeping the U.S. borders secure, including
through the seizure of counterfeit pharmaceutical GLP–1 products
that threaten patient safety. The Committee is concerned about the
importation of counterfeit GLP–1s from manufacturers in foreign
countries, such as China and India, for use in manufacturing com-
pounded anti-obesity medications, putting American patients at
risk. The Committee urges CBP to strengthen enforcement against
counterfeit GLP–1s entering through POEs. The Committee strong-
ly encourages CBP to dedicate additional enforcement resources to
the inspection and seizure of illegal foreign pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents used to make counterfeit GLP–1 medications.
Country-of-Origin Labeling for Canned Goods.—The Committee
is concerned that current labeling requirements on imported
canned food fail to adequately inform American consumers of the
country of origin of their food. The Committee directs CBP to pro-
vide a report within 120 days of the enactment of this Act on what
is needed to implement country-of-origin labels on the front or top
of the imported agricultural products as defined in section 207 of
the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (P.L. 79–733), as amended,
that are packaged in a can.
DNA Verification.—The Committee understands that DNA
verification technology is currently deployed along the southern
border for basic relationship testing of family members. Advance-
ments in genomics may allow for additional applications. CBP is
encouraged to consult with relevant stakeholders to determine
whether there are additional use cases for DNA verification for en-
hancing border security. Not later than 120 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee on the potential application of DNA verification technology
at the southern border.
Electronic Cigarettes (e-cigarettes).—The Committee is deeply
concerned about the vast quantities of e-cigarettes being illegally
imported into the United States. The Committee directs CBP to co-
ordinate with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as part of
the multi-agency task force on illegal e-cigarettes; increase the
number of random joint inspections at POEs and targeted inspec-
tions of entries by known manufacturers, brokers, and importers of
illicit e-cigarettes; increase the number of field examinations at
POEs with high import volumes to target manufacturers, import-
ers, and brokers known to engage in illicit activity; and improve

screening systems, by using risk-based analytics tools and through
additional training for field staff, to detect mis-declared e-cigarette
imports. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, CBP shall provide a briefing to the Committee detailing its ef-
forts to combat illegal e-cigarette importation.
Foreign Trade Zones (FTZ).—Not later than 120 days after the
date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a briefing detail-
ing the assignment of CBP personnel, and their subsequent time
allocations spent on FTZ operations, including activation and ongo-
ing compliance checks, the current level of support provided by
CBP to FTZs, and plans for supporting the expanding number of
FTZs. Additionally, CBP shall include with the briefing a plan for
incorporating requirements relating to FTZs in the Office of Field
Operations (OFO) Workforce Staffing Model.
High Throughput Screening.—The Committee recognizes the
value in exploring new and innovative high-speed, high-throughput
screening technology capable of rapid inspection of small parcels,
mail, and goods at the speed of modern automated packaging han-
dling. Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the
Committee directs CBP to provide a briefing on its efforts to re-
search and develop innovative security screening technologies that
could be deployed at international mail facilities in the United
States.
Low-Risk Air Travelers.—The Committee strongly encourages
CBP to utilize technology and innovation to facilitate and expedite
the processing of low-risk travelers at U.S. airports, while enhanc-
ing security and enforcement, otherwise known as Enhanced Pas-
senger Processing. The Committee urges CBP to consider new proc-
esses that meet its operational needs, including for frequent trav-
elers that have not enrolled in a Trusted Traveler Program. Within
90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall submit a
report to the Committee on its efforts to utilize technology and in-
novation to facilitate and expedite the processing of low-risk trav-
elers at U.S. airports. The report shall include steps CBP has taken
to meet or exceed the current level of security for processing low-
risk travelers, the efficiencies in CBP staffing, impacts on the cus-
tomer experience, and partnerships with the commercial aviation
stakeholder community.
New Land Ports of Entry.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of strategically located new land POEs in enhancing cross-
border trade, strengthening security, and reducing pressure on ex-
isting ports’ resources. Within 120 days of the date of enactment
of this Act, the Committee directs CBP to provide a report detailing
the agency’s staffing plans for all new land POEs currently under
development and nearing completion, including but not limited to
the Gordie Howe International Bridge, the Otay Mesa East, and
the Douglas Land Ports of Entry. This report shall include the an-
ticipated hiring timelines; projected numbers of officers and sup-
port personnel; recruitment and retention strategies; plans for per-
sonnel allocation within each respective Field Office’s area of re-
sponsibility; and any other relevant information necessary to en-
sure the timely and efficient opening and sustained operation of
each new facility. The report shall also include an estimate of the
total costs associated with staffing, recruitment, training, and oper-
ational readiness for each new land POE.

Office of Field Operations Hiring.—The recommendation provides
$122,870,000 to hire an additional 450 OFO officers.
Passive Muon Tomography.—The Committee is aware of the ca-
pability to effectively scan dense and/or shielded cargo entering
U.S. sea and land ports using a passive muon tomography scanning
system. The Committee encourages CBP to deploy such technology
to improve CBP’s imaging capability of dense cargo and determine
additional uses for the technology in CBP’s layered enforcement
system.
Port Baseline Service Level.—The Committee directs CBP to pro-
vide each air, land, and sea port operator, including cruise termi-
nals, with information on baseline service levels and take those
service levels into consideration when acting on requests for facility
and security improvements. CBP should share information on each
POE’s service levels with the port operator and shall brief the Com-
mittee on current levels of service not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act. The brief shall address staffing
shortages; requirements for facility and security upgrades; plans
for technology recapitalization; and how CBP will coordinate with
port operators and incorporate their feedback into the development
of plans to address future facility and security needs.
Port Hours of Operation.—The Committee recognizes that ongo-
ing reduced hours of operation at certain land POEs, initially due
to public safety concerns over COVID–19, compromise the safety of
travelers and border security enforcement efforts. The Committee
strongly encourages CBP to prioritize restoring hours of operation
at land POEs on both the southern and northern border to those
in effect prior to the start of the COVID–19 public health emer-
gency to enhance border security efforts, cross-border economic ac-
tivity, and improve public safety. Within 90 days of the date of en-
actment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committee detailing all
POEs operating under reduced hours due to COVID–19 restric-
tions, actions taken to return to pre-COVID–19 levels of operation,
and an assessment the feasibility of returning to pre-COVID–19
levels of operation.
Port Retrofit.—The Committee is concerned about CBP progress
to retrofit certain southwest POEs to reflect Land Port of Entry De-
sign Standards as published in December 2023, under Chapter 7,
Commercial Vehicle Inspection; 7.6.2 Dock Components; Special
Spaces. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, CBP is directed to brief the Committee on its plans to accom-
modate commercial shipments of refrigerated and frozen goods at
POEs including: Pharr, Texas; Laredo, Texas; Nogales, Arizona;
and Otay Mesa, California.
Port Runners.—The recommendation provides $3,000,000 to con-
tinue demonstrations of less-than-lethal, energy-absorbing active
vehicle barrier systems designed to deter, safely stop, and contain
‘‘port runner’’ vehicles at CBP POEs that have a history of port
running to determine the scalability of the technology. Within 90
days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Com-
mittee on plans to expand this effort.
Port Staffing.—The Committee notes that although OFO has
been successful in hiring to its allocated level of CBP officers, some
land POEs have consistently faced staff recruitment and retention
challenges primarily due to the remoteness of the location. The

Committee encourages OFO to strategically allocate sufficient staff-
ing at remote land POEs with an international rail bridge to ade-
quately conduct rail inspections and operations to bolster cross-bor-
der trade and further secure the transportation of goods.
Port Technology Upgrades.—The Committee encourages CBP to
prioritize funding for License Plate Reader technology, Radio-Fre-
quency Identification technology, and booth installations for land
POEs that require technology upgrades or expansion to accommo-
date current levels of high cross-border traffic, including where ex-
isting inspection lanes are readily available for operation.
Resource Allocation Model (RAM).—Any modifications to the
RAM shall be described at the field and office level in future budg-
et submissions. Additionally, not later than 60 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committee on re-
source and staffing shortfalls on the northern and southern borders
compared to levels prescribed by the RAM for rail crossings and
POEs in the land, air, and sea environments, including cruise ship
terminals. CBP is encouraged to continue to improve the model by
seeking external review.
Solar Panel Stockpiling.—The Committee is aware that Chinese
solar companies have been found to be shipping products through
Southeast Asian countries for minor processing in an attempt to
avoid paying China antidumping and countervailing duties. The
Committee encourages CBP to dedicate adequate resources to en-
forcing the anti-stockpiling utilization requirement detailed in the
notice concerning the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Or-
ders on Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells and Modules Im-
ported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam (88 Fed.
Reg. 57419). The Committee encourages CBP to enforce, to the ex-
tent possible, the anti-stockpiling utilization requirement by as-
sessing civil penalties and seizure of merchandise. Not later than
90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall submit
a report detailing enforcement efforts including any questionnaires
that were sent to importers, documents that were requested from
importers, on-site efforts to verify anti-stockpiling requirements
were met, the number of enforcement actions taken, and the cumu-
lative amount duties collected by such enforcement efforts.
Staffing at Largest Airports.—The Committee strongly encour-
ages CBP to ensure adequate hiring, training, and staffing levels
to support operations at the top 10 U.S. air POEs, as determined
by passenger enplanements measured by the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration.
Tariff Evasion.—The recommendation provides $5,000,000 to
conduct operational demonstrations to further leverage private sec-
tor-driven solutions that may aid with improving supply chain trac-
ing, the classification of goods, trade revenue collection, and seg-
mentation of shipments at high-risk for tariff evasion or other vio-
lations of U.S. trade and customs laws. This may include supply
chain traceability solutions explored under the Global Business
Identifier (GBI) Test that increase visibility into production supply
chains as well as other solutions that streamline operations, pro-
mote cargo security and compliance, and secure revenue owed. The
Committee is aware that the Office of Trade has worked with data
providers to evaluate unique identifiers for supply chain parties in-
volved in the production of goods and other technology solutions

Maritime Threat Reporting.—The Committee supports CBP
AMO’s ability to effectively respond to maritime threats and situa-
tions, specifically suspect vessels involved in human trafficking or
drug smuggling. Within 180 days of the date of enactment of this
Act, CBP, in coordination with the Coast Guard, shall report to the
Committee on maritime threats intercepted during fiscal year 2025,
including:
(1) the number of suspect vessels intercepted;
(2) the aggregate number of aliens interdicted and trafficking
victims identified;
(3) drugs or other illicit substances interdicted on suspect
vessels, if any; and
(4) additional technology or personnel that would improve re-
sponse to maritime threats.
Minotaur.—The government-owned Minotaur software currently
in use by CBP fixed-wing air assets links sensors, camera, radar,
and other communications equipment into a single system to allow
for situational awareness and tactical action across multiple DHS
components. The Committee encourages CBP to upgrade cybersecu-
rity, cyber resiliency, authority to operate compliance require-
ments, and increase training for Minotaur operators.
Enterprise Services
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee is encouraged by CBP’s
continued use of AI, particularly at the southern border for surveil-
lance towers and to visually screen passenger vehicles and cargo
conveyance. However, the Committee is concerned that AI models
used to protect our national security can be subverted, allowing
criminals and terrorists to freely enter the country, drugs and
weapons to pass screening, and other malicious activities to go un-
detected. The Committee is also concerned with new threats that
may arise from the increased use of generative AI or large lan-
guage models and what, if any, new challenges to cybersecurity
these new capabilities introduce into CBP operations. Not later
than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP is di-
rected to brief the Committee on the potential use of commercially
available purpose-built cybersecurity for AI.
Artificial Intelligence for Front Line Border Security/Enterprise
and Edge Computing.—The Committee is encouraged by commer-
cial advancements in AI and edge computing to address border se-
curity operations. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, cap-
turing real-time data from multiple border domains, and leveraging
intelligence data enhances situational awareness by providing a
strategic and operational picture on movement, environmental con-
ditions, and potential threats. Processing data at the edge allows
for faster decision-making, reducing latency and reliance on sys-
tems that may be vulnerable to disruption. Not later than 270 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Com-
mittee on the potential to use these capabilities to enhance border
security operations, including enhancements for small object detec-
tion and motion detection to improve situational awareness.
Cybersecurity.—The technologies and communication systems
that underpin U.S. border security are increasingly targeted by
cyberattacks and cyber espionage, posing a direct threat to national
security. The Committee encourages CBP to implement a proactive

strategy to support real-time threat intelligence, risk-based
prioritization, and continuous monitoring of critical border security
technologies. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of
this Act, CBP is directed to brief the Committee on efforts to as-
sess, prioritize, and mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations across all IT, Operational Technology, and IoT
assets within the border security technology ecosystem.
Encryption.—The recommendation provides $3,500,000 to expand
the use of Post-Quantum Cryptography for operational use, to in-
clude testing one-time pad-based encryption system utilizing true
random entropy generation and changing symmetric keys to defend
against quantum computer-driven hacking and intrusion threats.
CBP is strongly encouraged to test this encryption to secure border
security technology at the edge and communications devices con-
necting these systems together while also expanding their oper-
ational use of Post-Quantum Cryptography.

Border Security Assets & Infrastructure
Autonomous Surveillance Towers (AST).—The Committee recog-
nizes the AST program provides the ability to quickly identify illicit
border crossings and notes the support of Border Patrol Sector
Chiefs and agents for this force-multiplying capability. The rec-
ommendation provides $60,000,000 to continue to modernize sur-
veillance capabilities with autonomous technologies to include the
procurement of standard, maritime, cold weather, and long-range
AST variants to reduce reliance on Border Patrol agents to manu-
ally operate equipment.
Border Technology Innovation.—The Committee continues to di-
rect CBP to make innovation a central element of all requests for
proposals and require vendors to describe in detail how such pro-
posals will provide an innovative solution to improve mission effec-
tiveness beyond that of currently deployed systems. Not later than
90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP, including the
CBP Chief Acquisition Executive, shall brief the Committee on a
plan to include innovation as scored evaluation criteria for every
border security procurement.
Consolidated Tower and Surveillance Equipment (CTSE).—The
Committee understands the recent technological advances within
the CTSE program and encourages CBP to quickly test and imple-
ment autonomous capability to modernize and deploy surveillance

towers. The Committee strongly encourages the rapid integration of
AI to allow CBP personnel to spend more time in the field. Not
later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP is
directed to brief the Committee on the status of the CTSE program,
test results for additional autonomous capability, and any impedi-
ments to the deployment of CTSE program towers.
Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems.—The Committee recognizes
the growing threat that unmanned aerial systems present to our
border, critical infrastructure, and other critical governmental op-
erations. The Committee encourages CBP to explore a portable de-
tection and identification system for countering sUAS. Not later
than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall
brief the Committee on its efforts to counter sUAS. The rec-
ommendation provides $25,000,000 to detect and mitigate the per-
sistent drone threat along the southern and northern border.
Cross-Border Tunnel Threat Detection.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the threat posed by TCOs’ use of subterranean tun-
nels and underground municipal infrastructure at the southern
border to smuggle drugs like fentanyl, weapons, and other illicit
materials into the country. The Committee remains alarmed over
the Department’s failure to integrate this threat into wider stra-
tegic planning efforts and resource allocation decisions. The rec-
ommendation provides $35,000,000 for subterranean detection tech-
nology investments. The Committee directs CBP to provide a brief-
ing on the plans to deploy, operate, and maintain cross-border tun-
nel detection technology not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act.
Dark Drones.—The Committee appreciates that drones have be-
come a predominant means of TCOs to exploit U.S. borders, smug-
gle contraband, perform reconnaissance on smuggling routes, and
conduct counter surveillance on border security law enforcement of-
ficers and equipment. Cartels have begun using ‘‘dark drones,’’
which do not emit a radio frequency (RF) signal and therefore
evade traditional RF detection methods. Not later than 120 days
after the enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committee on
its efforts to counter ‘‘dark drones.’’
Enhanced Communications Capabilities.—The recommendation
provides $36,000,000 for land mobile radios, Team Awareness Kits,
and satellite communications to extend connectivity for agents
where commercial cellular service is not present, of which
$6,000,000 shall be for communications upgrades to include edge
AI and machine learning across high and low bandwidth systems.
Integrated Surveillance Tower Program.—The recommendation
provides $105,000,000 for the Integrated Surveillance Tower Pro-
gram. Over the past four fiscal years, the Committee has strongly
encouraged adoption of autonomous technology and will dis-
continue investments to procure non-autonomous tower-based tech-
nology in fiscal year 2027. Not later than 90 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committee on the sta-
tus of autonomy in the tower program, current testing and valida-
tion methodology, and any impediments to procuring fully autono-
mous systems.
INVNT Program.—The recommendation provides $20,000,000 for
CBP’s INVNT Program, of which not more than $5,000,000 shall
be available for each specific technology project.

Mesh Network.—The recommendation includes $20,000,000 for
the continued deployment of interoperable mesh communications
equipment and devices that enable communication connectivity in
denied and degraded locations enhancing officers’ and agents’ safe-
ty.
Mobile Surveillance Platforms.—The recommendation provides
$30,000,000 for mobile surveillance platforms, including the Mobile
Video Surveillance System, and Mobile Surveillance Capability.
The Committee strongly encourages investments in remote and au-
tonomous operations using advanced AI and encourages CBP to
consider upgrading current systems with additional capabilities
such as radar and other enabling technologies to increase situa-
tional awareness. Additionally, the Committee encourages CBP to
consider re-using components of the existing mobile surveillance
systems where practical to reduce procurement costs.
Obligation Plan.—The Commissioner is directed to prioritize pro-
curement of the most cost-effective technologies based on lifecycle
costs, system availability, reduced requirements for personnel, and
input from sector leadership. CBP shall provide a briefing to the
Committee on a plan for the obligation of the funds provided within
the ‘‘Border Security Assets and Infrastructure’’ PPA at least 15
days prior to any obligation. The plan shall require the direct ap-
proval of the Commissioner and include:
(1) details about the process for prioritizing the use of funds;
(2) a summary of planned obligations for fiscal year 2026, de-
lineated by technology type;
(3) metrics that will be used to assess the cost effectiveness
of each type of technology for which funds will be obligated and
a plan for collecting the data required for such metrics; and
(4) operational effectiveness data to support continued pro-
curement investments, including evidence of support from sec-
tor leadership based on actual use of the technology.
CBP shall notify the Committee at least 15 days prior to the obli-
gation of any funds based on a change to the initial obligation plan.
Small Unmanned Aerial Systems.—The Committee continues to
recognize the growing threat of sUAS, both homemade and com-
mercial, along the southern border. To protect against this rapidly
growing and evolving threat, the Committee encourages CBP to
consider expanding radio frequency (RF) sensing to detect, track,
and identify all RF-based drones including spoofed or encrypted
drones, regardless of manufacturer. Further, the Committee strong-
ly encourages CBP to enhance current detect, track, and identify
capabilities to detect sUAS at greater distances through both long-
range radar and long-range camera for visual confirmation, and de-
velop and deploy advanced jammer-based mitigation and RF-cyber
takeover mitigation, deemed safe and effective for use in the Na-
tional Airspace System, that are effective against multiple sUAS as
the threat evolves. The recommendation provides $15,000,000 for
the acquisition of small unmanned systems to support border secu-
rity operations.
Trade & Travel Assets & Infrastructure
Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Infrastructure Capital Plan.—Not
later than 30 days after the submission of the budget request for
fiscal year 2027, the Commissioner shall submit a report that de-

tails its prioritization of LPOE infrastructure capital investment
projects, the methods and models used to determine prioritization,
and an overview of public-private partnership agreements. CBP
shall work with the General Services Administration and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) on the annual 5-year LPOEs
modernization plan, which is based on CBP’s operational priorities.
Specific attention should be paid to the health, safety, and welfare
needs of CBP Officers. Special consideration shall also be made for
facilities where reconfiguration or upgrades will improve the flow
of local traffic and allow local residents to move freely in their com-
munities. The report shall align with the annual LPOE priority
list, outline projected CBP costs, explain how CBP will engage with
State and local entities, and the specific milestones and timeline
for the project completion.
Mobile Vehicle Scanning Systems.—The Committee remains con-
cerned over CBP’s exceedingly slow pace of deployment of Non-In-
trusive Inspection (NII) commercial and passenger vehicle screen-
ing units, including the inability to appropriately plan and cost for
civil works construction. The Committee directs CBP to acquire
and deploy mobile scanning systems that allow for quick setup for
both passenger and commercial vehicle scanning as a supplement
to the Multi-Energy Portal and Low-Energy Portal, especially in lo-
cations not suitable for those systems. The Committee encourages
CBP to consider systems equipped with backscatter and trans-
mission imaging capabilities, along with advanced image-proc-
essing techniques, AI tools, and radiation detection equipment with
the ability to detect a comprehensive range of vehicle-based
threats, including fentanyl and other narcotics, stowaways, metals
used in weaponry, and nuclear materials. CBP shall brief the Com-
mittee not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this
Act on its acquisition and deployment plans for mobile scanning
systems.
Non-Intrusive Inspection Technology.—The Committee rec-
ommends $300,000,000 for NII technology at land- and sea-POEs.
CBP shall execute these funds as follows: $220,000,000 to procure
and deploy new non-intrusive detection devices, of which
$25,000,000 shall be for mobile vehicle scanning systems;
$29,000,000 for IT infrastructure; $25,000,000 for AI and machine
learning capabilities; $20,000,000 for system integration; and
$6,000,000 for command center construction. CBP shall provide a
briefing to the Committee on a plan for the obligation of these
funds at least 15 days prior to any obligation. The Committee is
aware that CBP has successfully piloted a commercial-off-the-shelf
integration platform as part of the Non-Intrusive Inspection Tech-
nology Integration (NII–I) program at select POEs on the southern
border, which significantly increased daily cargo inspections and
improved contraband detection resulting in increased seizures
along the border. The Committee encourages CBP to continue
working expeditiously with industry on their successful NII–I pro-
gram, which enhances CBP’s ability to collect and curate data to
support operational objectives and the development of AI capabili-
ties. CBP is directed to brief the Committee not later than 60 days
after the date of enactment of this Act on the status and results
of their NII–I program.

Integrated Operations Assets & Infrastructure
Air and Marine Helicopter Modernization.—The recommendation
provides $29,700,000 to convert at least two helicopters to the CBP
UH–60L configuration. Not later than 120 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the Committee on its efforts
to develop alternative approaches, including a partnership with the
U.S. Army, that may reduce the cost to field and sustain future
medium lift helicopters.
Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).—CBP is strongly
encouraged to conduct a feasibility study on HUMS for the Light
Enforcement Helicopter used by CBP’s AMO and the potential to
increase aircraft availability, reduce operations and maintenance
costs, and increase safety.
Light Enforcement Platform (LEP).—The recommendation pro-
vides $66,500,000 to purchase not less than seven LEP helicopters
that will allow CBP to continue to transition to one light helicopter
platform, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the safety of
CBP AMO pilots.
Medium Unmanned Aircraft System (mUAS).—The Committee
understands that CBP AMO intends to establish a program of
record for mUAS to augment existing aerial surveillance capabili-
ties in both land and maritime environments. To enhance the oper-
ational effectiveness of mUAS in detecting, tracking, and reporting
illicit activity, the Committee encourages CBP to incorporate light-
weight multi-mode radar surveillance payloads as part of its pro-
gram requirements. The Committee notes that such sensor capa-
bilities are consistent with other CBP AMO platforms, including
the Multi-role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA), MEA–Land Interdic-
tion, and the CBP’s MQ–9 Big Wing UAS.
Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft.—The recommendation provides
$66,000,000 for two MEAs to expand CBP’s ability to conduct mari-
time, air, and land surveillance at our Nation’s borders.

The bill continues language requiring ICE to provide an initial
obligation plan to the Committee within 45 days of the date of en-
actment of this Act. ICE shall also continue the monthly reporting
requirements outlined in the explanatory statement accompanying
Public Law 118–47 and incorporate data-driven projections into
such requirements to fully account for ICE’s mission impacts
throughout the fiscal year.
ICE is expected to continue briefing the Committee on its finan-
cial and reporting system, as directed in the explanatory statement
accompanying Public Law 117–328. Additionally, ICE is directed to
continue the requirement found under the heading ‘‘Contract Noti-
fications’’ in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
118–47 for contracts that exceed $10,000,000 related to the fol-
lowing:
(1) detention operations, including medical and mental
health services and other personnel services at detention facili-
ties;
(2) alternatives to detention programs;
(3) transportation and removal operations; and
(4) data services.
The Committee remains concerned with ICE’s financial manage-
ment practices, detailed in GAO–24–106550, ‘‘Additional Steps
Needed to Improve ICE’s Budget Projections and Execution,’’ which
have led to an inappropriate and disproportionate reliance on re-
programming and transfer authority to ensure solvency at the end
of any given fiscal year over the past decade. Actions already taken
in fiscal year 2025 are especially egregious—ICE began spending
more than its appropriated level shortly after the fiscal year com-
menced and operations now far exceed available resources. In order
to sustain this heightened operational tempo, ICE has and will
likely continue to use the bill’s transfer and reprogramming au-
thority to the maximum extent, once again taking from other com-
ponents’ operational priorities.
While the Committee recognizes the dynamic environment in
which ICE must function, neither ICE nor the Department should
rely on other components to fund the deficits that ICE itself often
creates. Not only does that presuppose that other missions within
DHS are less important, but it also sets the precedent that the De-
partment can shift funding away from congressional priorities
within other components to compensate for ICE’s budgetary mis-
management. This is unacceptable and should no longer be the

standard by which OMB, the Department, and ICE conduct their
fiscal management. As such, ICE shall expeditiously implement the
recommendations from GAO–24–106550 and update the Committee
on a monthly cadence to ensure appropriate congressional over-
sight.
In House Report 118–123 accompanying Public Law 118–47, ICE
was directed to better utilize Department-wide, data-driven projec-
tions for encounter levels, interior enforcement actions, and policy
considerations to better inform the agency of funding requirements
throughout the fiscal year. Therefore, ICE’s Program Analysis and
Evaluation division shall perform an assessment of ICE’s budg-
etary models on a quarterly basis and incorporate the data outlined
above and in House Report 118–123 to robustly project ICE’s re-
source needs. ICE is directed to inform the Committee of findings
not later than five business days after each assessment.
ICE was provided an additional $485,000,000 within Public Law
119–4 to support considerable increases in detention, transpor-
tation, and removal operations beginning in the second quarter of
fiscal year 2025. The Committee was assured that such funding
would be sufficient for the remainder of the fiscal year. After re-
ceiving the spend plan required by Public Law 119–4, the Com-
mittee was informed that such funds would be inadequate to sus-
tain ICE’s operational tempo given ICE’s current and anticipated
detention and removal levels.
While the Committee supports enhancements to ICE’s enforce-
ment and removal apparatus, allowing operations to significantly
exceed available resources is wholly irresponsible and perpetuates
fiscal mismanagement within the agency for which Congress is
forced to account. Such decisions also create an environment in
which the Department may be compelled to release tens of thou-
sands of aliens from detention and halt certain removal operations
if the necessary resources are not provided. As ICE works with the
Committee to refine its deficit projections for the remainder of the
fiscal year, ICE is directed to incorporate monthly estimates of
operational requirements and their impact on resources into the re-
quired monthly staffing and execution briefings found under the
heading ‘‘Monthly Reporting Requirements’’ in the explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 118–47.
Homeland Security Investigations
The recommendation provides a total of $2,545,487,000 for HSI,
including $2,218,106,000 for Domestic Investigations, $220,289,000
for International Investigations, and $107,092,000 for Intelligence.
Additional Criminal Investigators and Support Staff.—The rec-
ommendation includes an increase of $15,000,000 to hire additional
criminal investigators and associated support staff for both domes-
tic and international operations. As HSI’s broad, cross-border au-
thorities allow the agency to initiate and participate in a wide
array of investigations, staffing levels must be commensurate with
the increased workload. HSI shall provide an obligation plan for
these funds within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, de-
tailing the enhancements by investigative mission area.

vanced analytics to correlate open source, commercial, and native
agency data.
Blue Campaign.—The bill continues a provision that allows for
the transfer of not less than $5,000,000 from other departmental
components to HSI for necessary operations of the Blue Campaign.
HSI shall provide a detailed accounting of fiscal year 2026 base
funding requirements and an overview of the effort within 180 days
of the date of enactment of this Act.
Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BESTs).—The Com-
mittee provides $5,000,000 to support BESTs in their efforts to
combat illicit activities of transnational criminal organizations
(TCOs), with an emphasis on countering fentanyl initiatives. The
Committee is also concerned about the increased importation of
counterfeit and illicit active pharmaceutical ingredients, including
synthetic semaglutide. Within the additional funds provided,
BESTs shall enhance detection, seizure, and investigation of these
counterfeit ingredients.
Center for Countering Human Trafficking (CCHT).—The rec-
ommendation includes an increase of $5,000,000 for activities with-
in the CCHT. HSI shall provide quarterly briefings on CCHT ac-
tivities and future resource requirements beginning not later than
90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The Committee
urges HSI and the CCHT to coordinate with the Federal Law En-
forcement Training Centers to ensure human trafficking awareness
trainings conducted for Federal and SLTT law enforcement are ap-
propriately standardized.
Child Exploitation Investigations.—The recommendation provides
an increase of $5,000,000 for the Child Exploitation Investigations
Unit within HSI’s Cyber Crimes Center to provide additional inves-
tigative, forensic, and analytical support for these efforts. HSI is
urged to continue collaborating with partner nations and inter-
national stakeholders on victim identification techniques.
Combatting Transnational Crime Overseas.—The recommenda-
tion includes $6,000,000 for combatting transnational crime over-
seas, including $1,000,000 for new transnational criminal inves-
tigative units.
Coordination and Notifications.—The Committee notes that un-
accompanied alien minors continue to be vulnerable to labor and
sexual exploitation and urges HSI to consider proactive measures
to protect this population from such illicit activity. HSI shall con-
tinue to provide quarterly updates on the number of referrals of po-
tential instances of human trafficking from the Office of Refugee
Resettlement within the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices, consistent with the requirements identified in the explanatory
statement accompanying Public Law 118–47 under this heading.
Counterfeit Semiconductors.—The Committee is concerned that
foreign adversaries have attempted to flood the U.S. marketplace
with counterfeit semiconductor parts and materials, particularly
those that are found within the high-reliability semiconductor eco-
system, posing a significant national security risk. The Committee
is further concerned that some commercial providers of semicon-
ductor part authentication services neglect to follow proper proc-
esses and procedures, which can then lead to the introduction of
counterfeit parts into the supply chain. The recommendation in-
cludes $1,000,000 for HSI to create a task force to target counter-

feit semiconductor materials in the marketplace and global supply
chains. The task force shall include other federal, SLTT, and indus-
try stakeholders to establish policies and procedures for combating
these counterfeit materials. The task force shall also determine
best practices for validating approved counterfeit semiconductor
mitigation services. HSI is instructed to brief the Committee within
90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on efforts to create the
task force, challenges that arise in the establishment of such task
force, and additional resource requirements necessary for further
implementation.
Digital Forensic Tools and Analytics.—Within funds provided,
HSI is encouraged to procure technologies that analyze collected
digital forensics intelligence to enhance HSI’s investigative capa-
bilities. Such tools may include data mining and predictive ana-
lytics, secure digital evidence storage and sharing, and specialized
training for HSI criminal investigators.
Fentanyl Detection.—The Committee remains concerned about
the significant threat posed by the smuggling of narcotics, includ-
ing synthetic opioid fentanyl, through POEs and transportation
hubs and recognizes the challenges of using conventional detection
methods to address such threat. As such, the recommendation in-
cludes an increase of $5,000,000 to support procurement of tech-
nologies that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to
enhance traditional detection methods. Not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, HSI shall provide a briefing on
the procurement and implementation progress of such technologies
and future resources needed to further augment detection capabili-
ties.
Fentanyl Precursors.—While the majority of the fentanyl that
continues to devastate American communities is smuggled across
our borders as a finished product, domestic manufacturing of
fentanyl is steadily increasing. Often under derivative names to
mask their true purpose, precursor chemicals available online are
a critical component to fentanyl manufacturing. The recommenda-
tion includes an increase of $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025
enacted level to enhance HSI’s analytical ability to identify and
compile all nomenclature associated with precursor chemicals, in-
terrupt online operations, map distribution networks, and obtain
express consignment shipment data to interdict these chemicals.
Forced Labor.—HSI shall continue to provide the briefing re-
quired under this heading found in House Report 118–123 accom-
panying Public Law 118–47. The recommendation includes an addi-
tional $2,000,000 for forced child labor investigations.
Fraudulent International Driving Documentation.—The Com-
mittee is concerned by the proliferation of fraudulent international
driving documentation by operators of commercial motor vehicles
and directs HSI to assess the scope and impact of such fraudulent
documentation. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, HSI shall coordinate with appropriate federal and
SLTT agencies for such assessment and submit a report detailing
findings and recommendations for a coordinated enforcement strat-
egy to detect, deter, and prevent continued used of fraudulent docu-
mentation within the transportation supply chain.
Human Exploitation Rescue Operation (HERO) Child-Rescue

Illegal E-Cigarette Importation.—The Committee provides
$2,500,000 to increase criminal investigations of illegal e-cigarette
importation and misdeclarations of illicit e-vapor products.
Illegal Grow Operations.—In satisfying the requirement found
under this heading in the explanatory statement accompanying
Public Law 118–47, HSI detailed investigative methods used to
combat illegal grow operations in the United States controlled by
TCOs based in the People’s Republic of China and elsewhere. HSI
is encouraged to continue these methods and shall update the Com-
mittee on a quarterly basis on resource and authorization needs to
further advance these efforts.
Image Recognition Technology.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of open-source intelligence and facial recognition tech-
nology capabilities in investigating the illicit activities of large
TCOs and provides $5,000,000 to expand and enhance such capa-
bilities. Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, HSI is directed to provide a spend plan for these funds and
brief the Committee on the interoperability of facial recognition
with current investigative technologies. The briefing shall also in-
clude an assessment of initiatives to reduce HSI’s reliance on facial
recognition and open-source intelligence tools that are provided by
foreign owned-and-operated contractors.
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Center.—The Committee di-
rects ICE to provide quarterly briefings on its enforcement prior-
ities within the IPR Center, beginning not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act.
International Operations.—HSI shall continue providing the
Committee with a strategic plan for international operations, as di-
rected in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
117–328. The recommendation includes an increase of $5,500,000
for HSI to expand its presence overseas and increase the number
of transnational criminal investigative units. HSI is instructed to
provide an execution plan for these funds and include details of ad-
ditional resource needs to support the international mission.

(4) counter-proliferation and national security and results of
such investigations.
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.—The Committee is
concerned with human trafficking and other illicit activities on
Tribal nation land and directs HSI to partner with the Missing and
Murdered Unit within the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Office of Jus-
tice Services to aid in human trafficking investigations that cross
Tribal lands. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, HSI shall submit a report on coordination efforts, juris-
dictional or other challenges, and resources needed to enhance the
partnership between the two agencies. The recommendation in-
cludes an increase of $1,000,000 to support such partnership and
expand the Shadow Wolves unit.
Organized Retail and Supply Chain Crime.—The Committee pro-
vides $2,000,000 to establish a multi-agency, intelligence-based,
and prosecutor-led Organized Retail and Supply Chain Crime Co-
ordination Center to identify, disrupt, and dismantle TCOs that
put the Nation’s supply chain at risk. The Center shall coordinate
with appropriate federal agencies, including but not limited to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation; Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion; and relevant agencies within the Department of Justice, to
collect and analyze data from relevant stakeholders to identify re-
gions, modes of transportation, and specific distribution and retail
networks that are experiencing high volumes of organized crime to
better inform HSI’s response to such criminal activity. The Com-
mittee directs HSI to brief the Committee within 90 days of the
date of enactment of this Act on the status of the implementation
of the Center and any challenges in its establishment. The briefing
should also include an overview of the unmet resource needs and
future resource requirements.
Personnel Well-Being.—The Committee is concerned about the
mental and emotional well-being of HSI agents who primarily focus
their efforts on child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) inves-
tigations, especially given the disturbing nature and rapid growth
of CSEA over the past decade. HSI is directed to provide a briefing
within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on mental
health resources available to HSI personnel, current policies and
procedures to determine personnel resiliency, and any additional
funding requirements to enhance currently available resources.
Repository for Analytics in a Virtualized Environment
(RAVEn).—The Committee continues the requirement found under
this heading as described in the explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 118–47.
Special Response Teams (SRTs).—The recommendation includes
an increase of $5,000,000 for equipment and other general ex-
penses associated with additional SRTs. These specialized teams
provide critical tactical support in high-risk situations and are
uniquely positioned to deploy at a moment’s notice.
Targeting Online Drug Trafficking Operations.—The Committee
continues the directive found under this heading in House Report
118–123 accompanying Public Law 118–47.
Enforcement and Removal Operations
The recommendation includes a total of $6,402,677,000 for ERO.
Of this amount, $4,451,603,000 is for Custody Operations,

$178,703,000 is for Fugitive Operations, $349,807,000 is for the
Criminal Apprehension Program, $391,784,000 is for the Alter-
natives to Detention Program, and $1,030,780,000 is for the Trans-
portation and Removal Program.
287(g) Program.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
the 287(g) program, particularly since state and local law enforce-
ment who participate act as a force multiplier for the ERO work-
force, which has been understaffed for years. The program also pro-
vides safety benefits to officers and detainees as detainees are
transferred into ICE custody in a controlled environment. ICE is
directed to report quarterly on local law enforcement agencies that
express interest in joining the program and the number of new
agreements that are signed. Additionally, within 90 days of the
date of enactment of this Act, ICE shall provide a report to the
Committee regarding the growth of the program, progress of train-
ing partner agencies, and technologies or other resources needed to
seamlessly expand the program. The recommendation includes
$10,000,000 for these efforts, of which, funding for training shall be
prioritized.
287(g) Training.—The Committee acknowledges the significant
increase in new 287(g) agreements in fiscal year 2025. To ensure
proper oversight of the program and obtain maximum efficacy in
regard to program outcomes, ICE, in coordination with the Office
of Professional Responsibility, shall conduct an evaluation of both
the quality and the proper administration of the trainings required
with any new agreement within 30 days of the date of enactment
of this Act. ICE shall provide a briefing to the Committee within
60 days of the date of enactment of this Act of the findings of such
evaluation, as well as recommendations of enhancements to the re-
quired trainings and any improvements to oversight within the
287(g) program. Additionally, not later than 30 days after the date
of enactment of this Act and monthly thereafter, ICE shall provide
a report to the Committee detailing funding obligations of the
287(g) program, delineated by pay and non-pay requirements, and
the number of law enforcement entities with 287(g) agreements
that were provided training for the prior month.
Alternatives to Detention (ATD).—The recommendation provides
$391,784,000 for the ATD program. As the non-detained docket
level remains vast, it is the opinion of the Committee that all ATD
programs should incorporate elements of electronic monitoring for
compliance and enforcement purposes. The Committee instructs
ICE to prioritize detention and removal operations prior to consid-
ering alternatives to detention.
ATD Contracts.—ICE shall continue providing a monthly briefing
on the number of aliens participating in the ATD program, delin-
eated by technology type and associated daily cost, as well as the
number of participants who attend their immigration court hear-
ings. In addition, ICE shall continue to publish annually the fol-
lowing policies and data relating to ATD:
(1) guidance for referral, placement, escalation, and de-esca-
lation decisions;
(2) enrollments and disenrollments by field office;
(3) information on the length of enrollment, delineated by
type of ATD; and

(4) enrollments and disenrollments by type and point of ap-
prehension.
ATD Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) Utiliza-
tion.—To ensure the Committee maintains appropriate oversight of
the ISAP program, ICE shall provide a report to the Committee not
later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act detailing
its escalation and de-escalation policies for ISAP. Additionally, ICE
shall provide a report to the Committee on a monthly basis on the
following:
(1) the total number of participants in the ISAP program and
their length of time in the program;
(2) the total number of participants who are followed
throughout their immigration hearing process until immigra-
tion hearing adjudication and, in circumstances of removal or-
ders, are removed; and
(3) the total number of participants who have been escalated
or de-escalated within the program, including the number of
participants who have been disenrolled from the program prior
to the completion of their immigration hearing adjudication.
The Committee directs ICE to employ the ISAP program in a
manner that includes enforcement mechanisms to be conducted by
appropriate law enforcement personnel for noncompliance. Addi-
tionally, ICE shall ensure a fair and open competitive bidding proc-
ess for future iterations of the ISAP contract.
ATD Monitoring Pilot Program.—Within funds provided for ATD,
ICE shall pilot innovative, wearable technologies that incorporate
tokenized identity capabilities that verify location and biometric in-
formation to monitor those on the non-detained docket who do not
meet the escalation qualifications for enrollment into the ISAP pro-
gram. ICE is directed to confer with the Committee prior to any ex-
ternal engagement for the pilot program.
ATD Program Violation Reporting.—Within 30 days of the date
of enactment of this Act and monthly thereafter, ICE shall provide
to the Committee data on the number of ATD program violations
for enrolled participants in each program that occurred in the prior
month, disaggregating the data by area of responsibility (AOR),
type of program violation, whether such program violation was
committed by the same individual, and whether that individual
was subject to an enforcement action following such program viola-
tion.
ATD Wraparound Stabilization Services (WSS).—The rec-
ommendation does not include funding for WSS or any other case
management service as a pass-through within the ISAP contract.
ICE’s limited resources to monitor the non-detained docket must be
directed towards evidence-based approaches that lead to favorable
compliance and enforcement outcomes. Within 90 days of the date
of enactment of this Act, ICE shall provide a report regarding the
increase of participants served with ISAP technologies by utilizing
the funds previously available for WSS activities.
Contract Competition.—ICE is directed to ensure a fair and com-
petitive procurement and contracting process for awards made
within the Custody Operations, Transportation and Removal Oper-
ations, and Alternatives to Detention level II PPAs.
Courthouse Enforcement.—The Committee acknowledges the im-
portance of aliens participating in the immigration hearing adju-

dication process and urges ICE to restrain immigration enforce-
ment activities at courthouses or other locations where such proc-
ess takes place.
Criminal Aliens.—Not later than 180 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, ICE shall provide a report to the Committee
comprehensively listing every alien who has been convicted of a
violent crime in the United States and ICE’s compliance with man-
datory detention under the Laken Riley Act (P.L. 119–1) for fiscal
years 2020–2025, to include a list of aliens that have committed
such criminal acts upon release from SLTT or federal custody.
Criminal Aliens Prioritization.—The Committee remains con-
cerned by the number of aliens who remain in the United States,
despite having convictions of violent acts. ICE shall prioritize avail-
able resources to effectuate enforcement and removal actions for
such aliens. Additionally, ICE shall provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act and
monthly thereafter detailing such prioritization, the number of ef-
fectuated removals of such aliens, and the funding obligations for
such actions in the prior month.
Custody Operations.—The recommendation includes
$4,451,603,000 for Custody Operations, which includes
$3,543,836,000 for 50,000 detention beds. In light of the unprece-
dented non-detained docket level, increased detention capacity is
critical to support necessary interior enforcement actions, effec-
tuate removal orders, and ensure that aliens who pose a national
security or public safety threat are appropriately detained.
Custody Reporting.—Beginning not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, ICE is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committee with data regarding
the number of individuals in its physical custody who were subject
to solitary confinement during the preceding quarter. ICE shall
confer with the Committee prior to the first report to determine ad-
ditional relevant data points.
Deportation Officers (DOs).—The recommendation provides an in-
crease of $50,000,000 to support hiring additional DOs to address
law enforcement personnel shortages.
Detention Capacity in Rural Areas.—Within 180 days of the date
of enactment of this Act, ICE shall provide a report to the Com-
mittee detailing options to increase detention capacity in rural
areas and states that do not currently have any facilities that con-
tract with ICE. Options shall include, but are not limited to: engag-
ing with county and local facilities; consideration of joint facilities
with the U.S. Marshals Service; and building ICE-owned facilities
to serve as hubs for interior enforcement actions.
Detention Capacity and Utilization.—The Committee is encour-
aged by ICE’s willingness to better utilize its guaranteed minimum
detention capacity in fiscal year 2025, particularly since such ca-
pacity is fully funded regardless of use. ICE is instructed to inform
the Committee whenever the utilization rate for guaranteed min-
imum detention capacity declines to below 87 percent for more
than 14 consecutive days. ICE shall include plans to maximize fu-
ture utilization when updating the Committee.
Detention Partnerships.—The Committee is of the opinion that
partnerships with local and county facilities are critical for a robust
detention and enforcement apparatus and instructs ICE to continue

engaging with relevant stakeholders to increase detention capacity
wherever practical.
Foreign-Based Gangs.—The Committee is alarmed about recent
intelligence reports that certain foreign-based gangs have estab-
lished headquarters in the United States or are carrying out crimi-
nal activity within the Nation’s interior. The Committee directs
ICE to provide a report to the Committee within 90 days of the
date of enactment of this Act detailing the foreign-based gang pres-
ence in the United States, the number of aliens who have foreign-
based gang affiliations, and barriers to effectuating arrests and/or
removals of known or suspected alien gang members, including
state and local policies that restrict law enforcement from coordi-
nating with ICE for detention and removal purposes.
Fugitive Operations.—The recommendation includes an increase
of $5,000,000 for additional Mobile Criminal Alien Teams and Spe-
cial Response Teams within Fugitive Operations. These teams con-
tinue to prove crucial for high-stakes interior enforcement actions.
ICE Detainers.—The Committee is concerned by the rising num-
ber of aliens apprehended for crimes committed after being re-
leased into the community due to a state or local jurisdiction’s re-
fusal to honor ICE detainer requests. Within 90 days of the date
of enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, ICE shall provide
a briefing to the Committee identifying all state and local jurisdic-
tions that do not honor ICE detainers and the agency’s efforts to
increase and improve cooperation and information sharing with
these entities. The briefing shall also include an assessment of con-
gressional action that could aid such cooperation and information
sharing, including the consideration of prohibiting the obligation of
certain departmental funds to such entities until ICE detainer re-
quests are honored.
Medical Staffing.—Not later than 30 days after the close of the
fiscal year, ICE shall provide a report to the Committee detailing
the level of medical and mental health staffing, delineated by posi-
tion and qualification, at each detention facility with an active con-
tract in the fiscal year, along with the average daily population of
each facility. The report should indicate the hours of availability of
in-person, specialized medical service typically available during the
week; whether any positions were unfilled for more than one month
of the previous fiscal year; and the average detainee wait time to
see a medical professional. ICE also shall include in the report the
number of individuals taken into ICE custody with a serious med-
ical or mental health condition, including the number of pregnant
women.
National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center (NCATC).—
The Committee supports efforts to enhance the NCATC and en-
courages the deployment of novel data sets to improve lead genera-
tion for identifying, locating, and apprehending criminal aliens, fu-
gitives, visa overstays, and other removable individuals. The Com-
mittee further encourages integration of these tools to support en-
forcement actions related to non-compliance within the ATD pro-
gram.
Notice to Appear Wait Times.—ICE shall continue providing the
Committee with Notice to Appear wait times and backlogs on a
monthly basis, delineated by AOR.

previous requirement that ICE submit data on the removal of par-
ents of U.S. citizen children semiannually.
Requests for Information (RFI).—ICE is directed to inform the
Committee at least 15 business days before publishing either a RFI
or a Request for Proposal that has the potential to substantively
impact requirements within the Alternatives to Detention, Custody
Operations, or Transportation and Removal Operations level II
PPAs.
Removal Orders Reporting.—The Committee remains concerned
about the more than 1,300,000 aliens on the non-detained docket
who have final orders of removal, thus eliminating the legal basis
for such individuals to remain in the country. ICE is directed to
provide quarterly reports to the Committee on the number of aliens
with final orders of removal on ICE’s non-detained docket, the AOR
in which such aliens reside, the reason for the order of removal not
being effectuated, and the steps that ICE will take during the next
quarter to effectuate the order.
Third-Party Medical Care.—ICE is directed to delineate costs as-
sociated with third-party medical care in the monthly reporting re-
quirements and whenever providing information to the Committee
regarding custody operations resources.
Transportation and Removal Program.—The recommendation
provides an increase of $200,000,000 to facilitate additional trans-
portation and removal operations. The Committee directs ICE to
prioritize funding for repatriation flights and other removal oper-
ations. ICE shall brief the Committee within 60 days of the date
of enactment of this Act on cost considerations and analysis of
transporting aliens to guaranteed minimum detention facilities as
opposed to non-guaranteed minimum facilities that are in closer
proximity to the respective field office.
Veterans Subject to Removal.—The Committee supports ICE Di-
rective 10039.2, regarding consideration of U.S. military service in
making discretionary determinations regarding enforcement ac-
tions. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, ICE is directed to provide a briefing to the Committee on im-
plementation and training with regard to this directive, including
an evaluation of the sufficiency of current methods of identifying
aliens veterans of the Armed Forces who are placed in removal pro-
ceedings and ensuring consideration of veteran status prior to initi-
ation of removal proceedings against such individuals.

crease of $20,000,000 to hire additional OPLA attorneys and sup-
port staff to enhance the current ratio of OPLA attorneys to EOIR
Immigration Judges (IJs). The Committee urges ICE to coordinate
with EOIR to ensure future year budget requests include commen-
surate levels of OPLA attorneys to EOIR IJs to address the ever-
growing backlog of immigration cases.
Failure to Prosecute.—OPLA shall provide a report to the Com-
mittee not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, and monthly thereafter, detailing the number of cases EOIR
dismissed due to the Department’s failure to prosecute; the number
of such cases for which the Department subsequently filed a Notice
to Appear; and all associated departmental reports on such cases

Appropriation, fiscal year 2025...................................................... +43,647,000
Budget request, fiscal year 2026 ................................................... ¥169,725,000
Mission
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is charged
with protecting U.S. transportation systems while facilitating the
flow of travel and commerce.
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $10,614,968,000
Budget request, fiscal year 2026 ....................................................... 10,569,369,000
Recommended in the bill ................................................................... 10,378,063,000
Bill compared with:
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025...................................................... ¥236,905,000
Budget request, fiscal year 2026 ................................................... ¥191,306,000
The recommendation includes the following: $100,000,000 to con-
tinue staffing at certain exit lanes; $45,059,000 for the Law En-
forcement Officer (LEO) Reimbursement Program; and $20,000,000
for connecting airports.
Within the total amount provided, the bill makes $300,000,000
available until September 30, 2027. TSA’s entire Operations and
Support appropriation has historically been made available for two
fiscal years, which runs counter to the one-year period of avail-
ability that is the baseline for Operations and Support appropria-
tions provided for other DHS components and the standard across
the Federal government for appropriations that fund salaries and
operating expenses. TSA is directed to continue to work with the
DHS CFO and the Committee to develop a proposal for the TSA
Operations and Support appropriation, including potential modi-
fications to the current PPA structure, that would limit the two-
year period of availability to only the necessary activities that may
require such flexibility, consistent with the other DHS components.
TSA shall incorporate such proposal in its fiscal year 2027 budget
request.
Airport Interconnection Program.—The Committee supports ef-
forts to interconnect airports and use the TSA cloud environment
to facilitate remote screening technologies. The Committee provides
$20,000,000 for TSA to interconnect its airports and leverage the
cloud environment.
Airport Wait Times.—TSA must ensure the security of airline
passengers without creating undue burdens on the traveling public.
An important component of this is keeping wait times at airports
reasonable. The fiscal year 2025 enacted funding level ensured that
TSA could staff airport checkpoint with an adequate number of

Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). The Committee encour-
ages TSA to maintain TSO staffing at a level that does not create
delays for air travelers.
Aviation Worker Screening.—TSA recently issued an Airport Se-
curity Program (ASP) amendment that requires airports to signifi-
cantly increase airport-performed physical screening of employees
and procure explosive detection screening (EDS) equipment for the
first time. The Committee is concerned that these new mandates,
which require the establishment of screening operations at air-
ports, impose an undue burden on airport operators and are being
implemented without conducting a thorough cost-benefit analysis
or risk assessment to justify the change. The Committee strongly
encourages TSA to rescind the current ASP amendment and solicit
a formal round of notice and comment to understand the full finan-
cial and operational impacts of this proposal.
Equipment Transfer to Local Law Enforcement.—As it modern-
izes its screening and detection equipment, TSA is urged to im-
prove the manner in which older equipment can be transferred to
local law enforcement. A major barrier to transfer is that the
equipment is still tied to service contracts. TSA should consider
only entering into service contracts that expire when TSA no longer
owns the equipment and examine ways to expedite the transfer of
such equipment.
Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) and Crew Training.—The
Committee strongly supports the additional aviation security pro-
vided by FFDOs. The recommendation provides $32,307,000 for the
FFDO and Crew Training program.
Identity Management Capability (IDM).—The Committee sup-
ports TSA’s IDM capability. Through this program TSA, in concert
with other government agencies and the private sector, builds se-
cure and privacy-preserving digital identity solutions for all Ameri-
cans. The recommendation includes $11,300,000 for this activity.
Mishandled Firearms.—The Committee recognizes the threat of
misplaced, mishandled, or lost firearms in checked luggage. The
Committee directs the Administrator, in coordination with the Sec-
retary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and any other
relevant federal agencies, to conduct an assessment that includes
the following:
(1) the number of firearms misplaced, mishandled, or lost an-
nually by commercial airlines on domestic flights within the
United States;
(2) the number of firearms misplaced, mishandled, or lost an-
nually by commercial airlines on flights originating in the
United States to international destinations;
(3) the number of firearms misplaced, mishandled, or lost an-
nually by commercial airlines on flights originating in inter-
national destinations bound for a destination within the
United States;
(4) any actions currently being taken by commercial airlines
to ensure firearms in checked luggage are not misplaced, mis-
handled, or lost;
(5) any additional training currently being provided by TSA
or commercial airlines to individuals handling checked fire-
arms;

(6) the procedures by which commercial airlines notify TSA,
DOT, or any other federal agencies when a checked firearm
has been mishandled, misplaced, or lost; and
(7) any actions that are taken by TSA, DOT, or other rel-
evant federal agencies to track mishandled, misplaced, or lost
firearms in checked luggage.
Multimodal Generative AI Language Technology.—The Com-
mittee encourages TSA to consider the use of multimodal genera-
tive AI foreign language translation technology at TSA to carry out
the requirements set forth by section 7131 of Public Law 117–263.
Passenger Security Fee.—The Committee notes that the Pas-
senger Security Fee, collected from passengers of commercial air
travel, is intended to fund vital security measures to ensure the
safety and protection of travelers within the United States. The
Committee further believes that the diversion of funds collected
through the Passenger Security Fee to purposes unrelated to avia-
tion security could undermine the integrity and effectiveness of
aviation security programs. Under current law, the diversion of
funds ends in 2027, and the Committee believes that the diversion
should not be extended and that all collected fees should instead
be appropriated as part of the annual appropriations process to
strengthen aviation security.
PreCheck Enrollment.—The Committee notes TSA’s goal of 70
percent of American fliers enrolled in TSA PreCheck. PreCheck re-
duces screening costs and increases security. However, to date, en-
rollment sits at an estimated 30 percent across the traveling pub-
lic. The Committee directs the Administrator to work with private
sector TSA enrollment providers to increase the number of trav-
elers in the PreCheck program. Not later than 60 days after the
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall brief the
Committee on PreCheck enrollment numbers in fiscal year 2025.
Screening Workforce.—Many rural airports have difficulties hir-
ing and retaining qualified TSOs. At the same time, however, TSA
is reducing retention incentives for many rural airports, making it
even more difficult to retain qualified TSOs. Not later than 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Department shall pro-
vide a briefing to the Committee on the challenges of recruiting
and retaining TSOs in non-contiguous and rural states. The brief-
ing shall include a clear description of the obstacles related to
using small businesses; information about rates of attrition; the
numbers of unfilled positions; and the duration of time for which
those positions have remained vacant. The briefing shall also pro-
vide an assessment of the effect these vacancies have on the ability
of TSA to accomplish its mission.
Security Scanning Equipment.—The Committee notes the chal-
lenges faced by TSA in maintaining its equipment in open-air air-
ports where exposure to the elements is unavoidable. The Adminis-
trator is urged to address the potential degradation of major secu-
rity equipment exposed to the elements at such airports.
Surface Transportation Cybersecurity Toolkit.—As cybersecurity
threats to surface transportation infrastructure become more ad-
vanced, TSA must equip itself and industry partners with tools
that support real-time risk mitigation across operational and infor-
mation technologies. TSA is encouraged to modernize and scale the
toolkit to allow TSA to automate cyber assurance functions, iden-

tify adversarial attack paths, and share timely intelligence with in-
dustry.
TSA Cares.—The Committee recognizes the importance of the
TSA Cares helpline to provide assistance for travelers with disabil-
ities, medical conditions, and other special circumstances during
the security screening process. The Committee directs the Adminis-
trator to expand public awareness of this service. Further, the
Committee directs the Administrator to prioritize staffing of the
helpline for additional hours and to ensure that requests received
through the hotline are accommodated by Passenger Support Spe-
cialists.
TSA Reimbursable Services.—The Committee understands that
there may be underutilized space and equipment in security
screening areas which may limit TSA’s ability to handle expected
volume increases. The Committee encourages TSA to consider the
success of the CBP’s Reimbursable Services Program as a model for
generating private sector support and resources to improve security
and efficiency at the security checkpoint while alleviating the
strain on aviation from increases in traveler volume.
Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) Teams.—
VIPR teams are duplicative and can face jurisdictional, and in
some cases constitutional, challenges. TSA has acknowledged it is
working to move towards a new concept of surface transportation
protection. Consistent with the fiscal year 2025 budget request, the
recommendation does not include funding for VIPR teams. Further,
the Committee does not support simply transferring VIPR per-
sonnel and activities to the Air Marshal Service. A simple re-
branding of VIPR teams is not the Committee’s intent. Rather the
Committee believes that TSA should no longer perform the func-
tions previously executed by VIPR teams.

Explosive Detection System (EDS) Outages.—TSA is responsible
for the security screening of airline passengers’ checked baggage as
well as the purchase, maintenance, and installation of EDS equip-
ment. With TSA responsible for approximately 1.4 million checked
bags a day, the Committee appreciates the scale of TSA’s efforts to
keep the flying public safe. However, the Committee is concerned
with the recent pattern of EDS outages at airports across the Na-
tion. When these safety critical machines fail, they can cause sig-
nificant delays and disruptions for the flying public. According to
the fiscal year 2024 TSA Capital Investment Plan (CIP), TSA’s
Checked Baggage fleet consists of 1,626 EDS, of which 200 are at
their end-of-life. The recent pattern of outages suggests that many
of these machines lack long-term reliability and need to be re-
placed. The CIP, however, fails to identify a realistic path to replac-
ing these end-of-life and/or unreliable EDS. Additionally, when re-
pairs are needed, the current service maintenance agreements
often lead to unacceptable delays, particularly at smaller airports.
Further, the slowness of TSA in establishing a Qualified Product
List reduces the agency’s ability to replace unreliable EDS with
equipment that meets a higher security standard.
The Committee directs TSA to prioritize the purchase and instal-
lation of EDS at airports with chronic outages with amounts avail-
able in the Aviation Security Capital Fund. Further, within 90
days of the date of enactment of this Act, TSA shall develop a real-
istic plan for recapitalizing checked baggage equipment and brief
the Committee quarterly on:
(1) the status of the EDS portfolio throughout the Nation, in-
cluding EDS outages; and
(2) the progress being made on replacing end-of-life and un-
reliable EDS.
Further, the Committee encourages TSA to consider structuring
future maintenance contracts in a manner that requires set levels
of reliability at each airport versus a nationwide level.
Improved Security Screening Technology.—The Committee recog-
nizes the value in expanding beyond current security screening
technologies. TSA should consider whether the development, test-
ing, evaluation, and deployment of innovative high-speed, high-
throughput screening capabilities, including transmission line to-
mography, could improve security.
Innovation Task Force.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the Innovation Task Force’s research and development ef-
forts on next-generation baggage and passenger screening within
TSA. Given the increase in passenger travel through airports, the
need to reduce congestion in screening lines, and the evolution of
security threats, funding to improve baggage and passenger screen-
ing must be prioritized to ensure TSA is able to meet current and
future needs. The Committee recommends $8,146,000 for the Inno-
vation Task Force.

fense Mission, $2,500,000 for marine inspections and standards for
innovative vessels, and $100,000 for Training Center contracting
support.
47-Foot Motor Lifeboat Service Life Extension Program.—The
Committee supports the Coast Guard’s ongoing service life exten-
sion program for its 47-foot motor lifeboats. The Committee notes
that the condition of many of the 47-foot motor lifeboats is signifi-
cantly worse than expected at program inception and urges the
Coast Guard to continue providing the resources necessary to suffi-
ciently upgrade and extend the service life of the entire fleet.
Ballast Water Management.—The Committee encourages the
Coast Guard to expand partnerships with state and local govern-
ments in its efforts to test ballast water to prevent the spread of
aquatic invasive species and diseases, such as stony coral tissue
disease.
Blue Technoloy Center of Expertise.—The Committee urges the
Coast Guard to leverage the expertise at its Blue Technology Cen-
ter of Expertise to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that
enhance Coast Guard capabilities and mission sets.
Closure of Coast Guard Stations.—The Committee is concerned
about the operational adjustments made in 2024 to Coast Guard
stations. Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the
Coast Guard shall submit a report to the Committee on the efforts
to restore capability to impacted regions, particularly given im-
proved recruiting numbers. The report shall also detail efforts the

U.S. Coast Guard is making to increase enlistment so that the
closed stations can be reopened.
Coordination With the Navy on the Shipyard Infrastructure Opti-
mization Program.—The Committee supports Coast Guard efforts
to coordinate with the Department of the Navy on shipyard capac-
ity issues and to create the Government Shipbuilders Council to
address common and singular challenges in shipbuilding; identify
opportunities to leverage each organization’s resources to maximize
savings in costs and time; share best practices and lessons learned;
and support strategic decision making to strengthen the ship-
building industrial base.
Diesel Outboard Testing and Evaluation.—The Committee is
aware that, in response to Department of Defense Directive No.
4140.43, the United States Navy tested and evaluated several die-
sel-fueled outboard marine motors and has subsequently procured
more than 100 of these motors for vessel deployment. The Coast
Guard is encouraged to consider whether diesel-fueled outboard
marine motors are appropriate for Coast Guard assets.
Employee Assistance Program (EAP).—The Committee strongly
supports the work of the EAP in support of members of the Coast
Guard. Within funds provided for Operations and Support, not less
than fiscal year 2024 funding levels are provided for EAP. Addi-
tionally, the Coast Guard is directed to ensure that employees at
all Coast Guard facilities are aware of and can access EAP tools.
The Coast Guard is further directed to brief the Committee within
90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on how the Service will
meet this requirement.
Engagement in the Indo-Pacific.—The Committee supports the
Coast Guard’s efforts to help develop the maritime capabilities of
partners and allies in Southeast Asia and encourages the Coast
Guard to continue its work in the Indo-Pacific, including by consid-
ering opportunities for expansion and options for improving coordi-
nation and leveraging capabilities with the DoD, especially U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM).
First District Coastal Buoy Modernization Initiative.—The Com-
mittee is dismayed with the Coast Guard’s First District Coastal
Buoy Modernization Initiative Proposal. While the Coast Guard in-
vestigates modernizing buoy constellations, the Committee urges
the Service to consider the complicated coastline along the North-
eastern Seaboard and stresses the importance of visual navigation
markers to maritime economies, as fishermen routinely use these
buoys as a reliable safety measure to maneuver through inclement
weather and when there is sporadic access to technology.
Force Design 2028.—The Committee is aware of several dead-
lines in the Coast Guard’s Force Design 2028, including require-
ments to deliver an execution plan aligned around strategic im-
peratives, the Force Posture and Operational Concepts Campaign,
and semiannual updates on the implementation of Force Design
2028. The Committee is disappointed that the Coast Guard did not
brief the Committee in advance of the release of Force Design 2028.
The Coast Guard shall brief the Committee on the details of these
plans and activities in a timely manner and prior to public release.
Icebreaking Collaboration.—The Coast Guard, in collaboration
with relevant agencies, including the Department of the Navy, the
State Department, and the National Security Council, shall develop

a multi-fiscal year implementation plan for the collaboration effort
between the United States, Canada, and Finland designed to en-
hance icebreaker shipbuilding capacity. The plan shall be sub-
mitted to the Committee not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act and shall include the following:
(1) development of systematic industry engagement strate-
gies to involve relevant shipbuilding partners, ensuring align-
ment with mission goals and operational needs;
(2) an analysis of how such cooperation will positively impact
budgets, schedules, and milestones to meet the Coast Guard’s
requirements for medium and heavy polar icebreakers;
(3) evaluation of acquisition alternatives, including options
for the accelerated build and lease of icebreakers, including
‘‘commercial-off-the-shelf’’ designs as a bridging strategy dur-
ing the ongoing construction of the new U.S. icebreaker fleet;
(4) recommendations for statutory and regulatory changes to
reduce procurement timelines and costs;
(5) commitments to ensure that expedited bridging solutions,
if any, are linked to a fundamental long-term commitment to
expand the American shipbuilding industrial base;
(6) a schedule for expediting and optimizing the sharing of
information, technology, and expertise among shipbuilding
partners; and
(7) an assessment of economies of scale achievable through
multi-nation order books and other collaborative opportunities,
emphasizing coordinated production and mutual investments
to strengthen industrial bases across shipbuilding partners.
Indo-Pacific Operations.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the Coast Guard in maintaining the U.S.’s posture in the
Indo-Pacific. The Committee supports the Coast Guard’s efforts to
expand its presence in the Indo-Pacific, especially through the Ship
Rider Program, and encourages the Coast Guard to continue its co-
ordination with USINDOPACOM and partner and allied Nations.
This includes further cooperation with Taiwan by expanding joint
and integrated training opportunities between the United States
Coast Guard and the Taiwan Coast Guard Administration. The
Committee also supports the Coast Guard’s efforts to help develop
the maritime capabilities of partners and allies in Southeast Asia
and encourages the Coast Guard to continue its work in the Indo-
Pacific by considering opportunities for expansion and options for
improving coordination and leveraging capabilities with the DoD,
especially USINDOPACOM. To better evaluate these efforts, the
Committee directs the Coast Guard to provide a report to the Com-
mittee not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this
Act assessing the Coast Guard’s capabilities and operations in the
Indo-Pacific. This report shall include a list of current assets in the
region, assets and capabilities needed to address unfulfilled re-
quirements, areas where logistical support is needed, and any
changes that must be taken to effectively implement the U.S. Indo-
Pacific Strategy. Additionally, the Committee directs the GAO to
conduct an assessment of the Coast Guard’s role in advancing U.S.
interests in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in light of the People’s Re-
public of China’s (PRC) activities throughout this critical region.

rity assistance, national security, and any other relevant aspects of
Coast Guard operations in the region.
To support the Coast Guard’s Indo-Pacific operations, the rec-
ommendation provides $60,000,000 for additional activities in the
Indo-Pacific, which may include increased operations to combat Il-
legal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing; presence of re-
gional Coast Guard Maritime Advisors; Liaison Officers, Attache´s,
other foreign engagement positions throughout the Indo-Pacific;
and workforce support including for housing, medical, and
childcare access for Coast Guard personnel.
IUU Fishing.—The Committee recognizes the role of the Coast
Guard and supports the Service in combatting IUU fishing both do-
mestically and globally. Within 180 days of the date of enactment
of this Act, the Coast Guard shall provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee detailing the activities of the Coast Guard in fisheries en-
forcement, any gaps in enforcement capacity, and any resources
needed to address those gaps or expand enforcement activities com-
batting IUU fishing.
IUU fishing in the Gulf of America harms small businesses,
ocean ecosystems, and sustainable fisheries and is a threat to our
national security. The Committee recognizes the need to charac-
terize and quantify IUU fishing in the Gulf of America. The Com-
mittee encourages the Coast Guard to collaborate with state and
academic partners to better understand the impact and factors in-
fluencing increased IUU fishing activity in the Gulf of America.
Land Acquisition.—As the Coast Guard expands its role in the
Indo-Pacific, the Committee is aware that Coast Guard Base Hono-
lulu is in critical need of additional pier and related space, and
that the State of Hawai’i owns pier space immediately adjacent to
Coast Guard Base Honolulu which it may be willing to convey. The
Committee directs the Coast Guard to continue to explore all op-
portunities to acquire the adjacent pier space and provide a report
to the Committee within 180 days of the date of enactment of this
Act on the status of the potential acquisition. Additionally, the
Coast Guard should include any actions requested or required of
Congress to facilitate the acquisition of the adjacent Honolulu Har-
bor pier and related space.
Long-Range Command and Control Aircraft (LRCCA).—The
Coast Guard is directed to provide a report within 45 days of enact-
ment of this Act, for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, detailing the num-
ber of days each LRCCA was fully mission capable, partially-mis-
sion capable, and not mission capable. Further, the Coast Guard
shall report for such time period the number of flight hours for
each aircraft by month and the number of flight hours in which a
LRCCA was transporting the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of
DHS. Additionally, the Coast Guard shall brief the Committee
within 45 days of enactment of this Act on any expected duration
of 45 or more days on which one or both aircraft are expected to
be non-mission capable due to planned maintenance.
Long-Range Unmanned Aircraft.—The Committee provides ini-
tial operating costs for long-range unmanned aircraft and encour-
ages the Coast Guard to quickly incorporate these assets into its
operations.

Management of Shore Infrastructure.—The Committee directs the
Coast Guard to fully implement the remaining open recommenda-
tions in GAO–19–82 as appropriate.
Marine Inspection and Standards for Innovative Vessels.—Ad-
vances in vessel design, fuel, and use require the Coast Guard to
develop new standards and inspection regimes. Budget constraints
often do not allow the Coast Guard to dedicate personnel to this
activity, which can stifle technological advances. The recommenda-
tion provides the Coast Guard $2,500,000 to develop standards and
inspections regimes for innovative vessels.
Maritime Transportation Security Activities.—The Committee en-
courages the Coast Guard to allocate necessary funding to carry
out its conveyance authorities required in Public Law 107–295.
Museum Operations Staffing and Funding.—The Committee does
not continue funding for Coast Guard Museum staffing and oper-
ations. Museum staffing and operations should be the sole respon-
sibility of the National Coast Guard Museum Association and not
a detriment to Coast Guard missions. With the Museum opening
delayed until late 2026, the National Coast Guard Museum Asso-
ciation should have sufficient time to conduct the necessary fund-
raising, grant requests, and/or internal realignments to become
self-sufficient. The Coast Guard cannot be further burdened with
the operations of a museum it does not own, particularly in a time
in which the Service’s aged facilities routinely forgo critical mainte-
nance, cutters and aircraft lack adequate spare parts to maintain
readiness, and Coast Guard personnel routinely go without the
supplies necessary to perform their duties.
National Capital Region Air Defense Mission.—Since 2006 the
Coast Guard, under the operational control of the North American
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), has been responsible for
intercepting low-flying aircraft in the National Capital Region. The
Coast Guard has admirably performed the Rotary Wing Intercept
mission since assuming responsibility from CBP, protecting all
those in the National Capital Region. However, the aging of the
MH–65 aircraft and the Coast Guard’s transition to an all MH–60
fleet has created uncertainty about how the Coast Guard will per-
form this mission in the future. Additionally, with the lack of ar-
mament on Coast Guard aircraft, the only way for a Coast Guard
rotary wing aircraft to stop a noncompliant aircraft would be to
sacrifice the Coast Guard helicopter and crew. Further, new tech-
nologies, such as AI-enabled cameras with laser signaling have
been successfully deployed as part of NORAD’s multi-layered air
defense mission. It is time for the Coast Guard to leverage new in-
novative technology to perform this mission. The recommendation
provides $5,000,000 in operations and support funding so that the
Coast Guard can begin using unmanned aircraft systems to replace
the capabilities of the MH–65s for the National Capital Region Air
Defense mission by fiscal year 2027.
Oversight.—The Coast Guard is reminded to promptly, thor-
oughly, and accurately respond to congressional inquiries.
Program Changes.—The Committee does not continue funding
for the Cetacean Desk or the body worn camera initiative.
Physician Training Program.—The Committee applauds efforts
by the Coast Guard to institute a physician training program by
sponsoring Coast Guard members through the Uniformed Services

University of Health Services School of Medicine. The Committee
directs the Coast Guard to brief the Committee within 90 days of
the date of enactment of this Act on its plans to build and sustain
this promising initiative.
Reducing and Responding to Sexual Assault and Sexual Harass-
ment.—The recommendation includes $5,000,000 for additional ac-
tivities to support actions to expand the Coast Guard’s legal sup-
port and oversight related to sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment. The Committee supports the Coast Guard’s efforts to
strengthen the Service’s culture and provides these funds with the
expectation the Coast Guard will expand sexual assault and har-
assment prevention, response, recovery, victims’ services, and in-
vestigatory capacity.
Reducing Moves.—While most personnel moves are necessary for
the needs of the Coast Guard, they can be disruptive for members
and their families. The Committee believes the overall number of
geographic moves a member must make could likely be reduced
with no or minimal impact to the Service, while reducing costs and
significantly increasing the quality of life for members and their
families. Regrettably, the Service does not have clear metrics for
tracking geographic moves since a Permanent Change of Station
does not always require a servicemember to relocate. The Service
shall develop appropriate metrics to track physical moves and brief
the Committee not later than 180 days after the date of enactment
of this Act on the metrics it has developed.
Special Victim Counsel Program.—The Committee directs the
Coast Guard to provide a report within 90 days of the date of en-
actment of this Act on the number of expedited requests for trans-
fer made by victims of sexual assault during the prior fiscal year,
including the number of applications denied and a description of
the rationale for each denied request. The report shall also include
the number of service members served by the Special Victim Coun-
sel program during the same period.
STARBASE Programs.—The Committee acknowledges the Coast
Guard’s authority to establish Coast Guard-sponsored STARBASE
programs and encourages the Commandant of the Coast Guard to
establish the necessary policies and procedures, in consultation
with the DoD, to facilitate the timely establishment of Coast Guard
sponsored STARBASE programs that are determined to be con-
sistent with the needs of the Service.
Technology Optimization and Modernization.—Innovative, com-
mercial off-the-shelf technology can provide cost-effective ways for
the Coast Guard to modernize its equipment and address its oper-
ational needs. The recommendation provides $20,000,000 for the
Coast Guard to establish an innovative technology program. The
Committee urges the Coast Guard to use this program to test,
evaluate, and integrate commercially available technologies such as
unmanned maritime systems, including those with autonomous
control and computer vision, and tactical small unmanned aircraft
systems (sUAS). The Coast Guard is encouraged to use its other
transaction authority under section 11205 of Public Law 117—263
in executing these funds. The Coast Guard is directed to brief the
Committee at least 15 days prior to obligating funds for this pur-
pose.

Tracking Missions.—Beginning 90 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act and continuing quarterly thereafter, the Coast
Guard shall provide a summary of the approximate hours, dollars,
personnel, and assets dedicated to each of Coast Guard’s statutory
missions. Beginning with the second briefing, Coast Guard shall
also include a retrospective analysis of the hours, dollars, per-
sonnel, and assets dedicated to each statutory mission in the pre-
vious quarter.
Unmanned Maritime Systems.—Maintaining adequate maritime
domain awareness is a perennial challenge. The rapid proliferation
and advancement of unmanned maritime systems, both in un-
manned surface vessels and unmanned underwater vehicles, avail-
able for maritime domain awareness has, at times, led the Coast
Guard to take a scattershot approach to their use. The Committee
directs the Coast Guard to develop a comprehensive strategy iden-
tifying priority locations for improving maritime domain aware-
ness, determining which data streams are most needed in each
area, and the optimal fleet mix of unmanned maritime systems and
other technologies. Further, the Coast Guard is directed to periodi-
cally survey industry to assess emerging technologies that may
offer more cost-effective solutions to improving maritime domain
awareness. The recommendation includes $40,000,000 for un-
manned maritime systems.
U.S. Virgin Islands and the Caribbean.—The Committee sup-
ports the work of the Coast Guard in this region but remains con-
cerned about insufficient maritime resources based on the U.S. Is-
land of St. Croix. Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this
Act, the Coast Guard shall brief the Committee on its efforts to re-
spond to drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, human trafficking,
and smuggling operations in this area. The Coast Guard is directed
to address each with respect to necessary ship deployments, force
posture, and force projection in the Caribbean region and to incor-
porate reaction time to San Juan, St. Thomas, and St. Croix.
Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure Training Apparatus.—Within
the funds provided, the Committee urges the Coast Guard to pur-
chase two additional Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS)
Training Apparatus based on the successful deployment of the
VBSS Training Apparatus at Tactical Law Enforcement South. The
VBSS Training Apparatus has been shown to be a cost-effective
and efficient training solution to bolster maritime border security.
Wing-in-Ground Craft Inspections.—The Committee is encour-
aged by new transportation solutions in the maritime industry in-
cluding the development of electric wing-in-ground coastal pas-
senger vessels. Wing-in-ground craft have the potential to increase
the efficiency and speed of coastal and inter-island transportation
and reduce passenger costs. Within the funds provided, including
funds provided for marine inspection and standards for innovative
vessels, the Coast Guard is directed to develop the capacity to pro-
vide wing-in-ground craft certification and inspections.

The Coast Guard is directed to continue briefing the Committee
quarterly on all major acquisitions. The briefings shall identify
major challenges to the programs and obligations and expenditures
for the last five years. Further, the briefings shall include a discus-
sion of terminated programs and the follow on, if any, to those pro-
grams. The Committee is frustrated by the delay in quarterly up-
dates during fiscal year 2025. The Committee looks forward to re-
suming a quarterly cadence for these briefings.
The Committee also directs the Coast Guard to include an esti-
mate of the receipts to be deposited in the Housing Fund for the
budget year and a plan for the expenditure of those funds in its an-
nual budget justifications. Any deviations from the plan shall be re-
ported to the Committee not fewer than 15 days before the obliga-
tion of funds.
Vessels
The recommendation includes $530,000,000 for Offshore Patrol
Cutter (OPC), $300,000,000 for Fast Response Cutter (FRC),
$135,000,000 for Waterways Commerce Cutter, $160,000,000 for
In-Service Vessel Sustainment (ISVS), $100,000,000 for Polar Secu-
rity Cutter (PSC), $20,000,000 for a Great Lakes Icebreaker, and
$10,000,000 for Cutter Boats.
Arctic Security Cutters.—The Committee notes that a 2023 Coast
Guard fleet mix analysis concluded that the Service requires a total
of eight to nine polar icebreakers, including four to five heavy polar
icebreakers and four to five medium polar icebreakers, to perform
its polar (i.e., Arctic and Antarctic) missions in coming years. Con-
sistent with the authority and direction provided in section 11218
of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2023 (P.L. 117–347), the Committee encourages the Coast
Guard to establish a program office for the acquisition of Arctic Se-
curity Cutters. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, the Coast Guard shall submit a multi-year investment
plan to achieve the total number of icebreakers required in the
2023 fleet mix analysis.
Domestic Icebreaking Capability.—The Committee notes the im-
portance of the Coast Guard’s domestic icebreaking mission to the
economy of the Great Lakes region. Inadequate icebreaking capac-
ity can have devastating economic impacts, including significant
job losses. The Committee recommends $20,000,000 for the Service
to continue work on procuring a second heavy Great Lakes Ice-
breaker. The Committee also encourages the Service to begin exam-
ining how to replace its aging fleet of 140-foot bay-class tugboats.
The Committee directs the Coast Guard to brief the Committee not
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the
status of these important domestic priorities.
Fast Response Cutter.—The recommendation provides
$300,000,000 for the purchase of three additional FRCs, economic

price adjustments related to the rise in material and labor costs,
and post-delivery missionization costs.
In-Service Vessel Sustainment.—The Committee notes the impor-
tance of the ISVS program for maintaining and extending the serv-
ice life of Coast Guard’s vessels. The recommendation provides
$160,000,000 for this program, which includes $60,000,000 for a
service life extension for a 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutter to
be used in the Indo-Pacific.
National Security Cutter (NSC).—The Committee is frustrated
that the actions of the NSC contractor led the Coast Guard to forgo
NSC 11. The contractor’s use of pitted steel plates resulted in a no-
win situation for the Coast Guard. Either the Service had to accept
a vessel that does not meet its standards, or it had to forgo a crit-
ical national security asset. The Committee encourages the Coast
Guard to work with the General Services Administration to deter-
mine whether any lessons learned from NSC 11 should be incor-
porated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations to disincentivize
contractors from refusing to do the work they have been paid to do.
Offshore Patrol Cutter.—The recommendation provides
$530,000,000 to continue the program of record for these critical as-
sets. The Committee is frustrated by the delays in OPC Stage 1
and supports the efforts the Coast Guard has taken to de-risk the
program.
Polar Security Cutter.—The recommendation includes
$100,000,000 for PSC. The Committee remains supportive of the
construction of the first PSC and recognizes the urgency of the ca-
pability.
Special Purpose Craft—Heavy Weather (SPC HWX).—The Com-
mittee remains concerned with the proposed replacement of the 52-
foot SPC HWX in the Pacific Northwest. The Committee has safety
concerns with the proposed requirement that a replacement for the
52-foot SPC HWX should be able to tow large vessels over the haz-
ardous river bars along the Washington and Oregon coasts. An in-
creased towing capacity creates a moral hazard, and the Committee
is concerned the Coast Guard is prioritizing saving property over
the safety of its members. The Committee does not provide funds
for this program.
Waterways Commerce Cutter.—The recommendation includes
$135,000,000 to begin recapitalization of the Coast Guard’s inland
river tenders.The Committee recognizes the urgency in replacing
the Service’s existing fleet of inland waterways and western river
cutters and fully supports the program.
Aircraft
The recommendation provides $183,000,000 for an HC–130J Ac-
quisition, $100,000,000 for MH–60T Sustainment, $98,000,000 for
large Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and $750,000 for small Un-
manned Aircraft Systems.
HC–130J.—The recommendation includes $183,000,000 for the
purchase of one additional HC–130J aircraft for the Coast Guard’s
fleet, project management, outfitting of existing aircraft, and a
training simulator.
Long-Range Unmanned Aircraft.—The recommendation provides
$98,000,000 for these aircraft and necessary ground stations. The
Committee supports the Coast Guard increasing its use of long-

range, unmanned aircraft given the success of the MQ–9 Joint Pro-
gram Office with CBP. These aircraft provide a cost-effective plat-
form to improve high-seas interdiction and maritime rescue. Sev-
eral of the Coast Guard’s missions, such as International Ice Pa-
trol, can be entirely replaced by unmanned systems. As the Coast
Guard develops this program, the Committee encourages the Serv-
ice to consider any potential cost savings from co-locating ground
stations with existing DHS or DoD facilities.
Medium Unmanned Aircraft Systems (mUAS).—The Committee
notes the success of unmanned aircraft systems deployed on NSCs
for improving intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The
Coast Guard is urged to consider the viability of including mUAS
on Medium Endurance Cutters and OPCs.
MH–60T.—The Committee supports the Coast Guard’s recapital-
ization and transition to a rotary wing fleet consisting of all MH–
60T aircraft and provides $100,000,000 for additional aircraft and
other necessary components.
Other Acquisition Programs
The recommendation includes $30,000,000 for In-Service Systems
Sustainment, $30,000,000 for Cyber and Enterprise Mission Plat-
form, $25,000,000 for C4ISR, $21,500,000 for Program Oversight
and Management, $9,040,000 for Other Equipment and Systems,
and $4,500,000 for Survey and Design—Vessels, Boats, and Air-
craft.
Basic Handheld Radiation Isotope Identifiers.—The recommenda-
tion provides $2,040,000 for Basic Handheld Radiation Isotope
Identifiers that were previously procured for the Coast Guard by
the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.
Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Integration.—The Com-
mittee notes the capabilities of the government-owned Minotaur
mission system that links sensors, cameras, radar, and other
C4ISR components into a single system and understands it is cur-
rently deployed or planned for deployment on Coast Guard air and
sea assets, as well as other DHS partner agency assets. The Com-
mittee encourages the Coast Guard to leverage appropriate re-
sources to continue to include Minotaur in the missionization of
new assets and further encourages the Coast Guard to continue ex-
pansion of the retrofit of legacy assets such as the fleet of FRCs.
GIS Modernization.—The Committee notes the importance of the
Coast Guard’s Enterprise GIS Modernization and Expansion to
allow the SEXTANT program to improve maritime domain aware-
ness workflows that directly support the Marine Transportation
System by keeping pace with technological advancements in geo-
graphic information systems.
Shore Facilities and Aids to Navigation
The recommendation provides $270,000,000 for Shore Facilities
and Aids to Navigation, including $29,000,000 for Chase Hall Bar-
racks Annex A; $15,000,000 for Phase 2 of the NSC and Ocean-
Going Buoy Tender Homeport; and $15,000,000 for planning im-
provements to the Coast Guard Yard.

Air Station Barbers Point Hangar Project.—The Committee sup-
ports the Coast Guard’s investments at Air Station Barbers Point.
Within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Coast
Guard shall provide a report to the Committee containing an up-
date on any unmet requirements for Air Station Barbers Point air
assets, including any new maintenance requirements caused by the
upgrade of both fixed wing and rotary aircraft and the feasibility
of building a permanent hangar in addition to the tension hangar
currently under construction.
Coast Guard Academy Infrastructure.—The Committee recog-
nizes the significant need for capital investment in Coast Guard
Academy infrastructure to support the renovation and moderniza-
tion of facilities to maintain and increase recruitment and reten-
tion. The Committee directs the Coast Guard to provide a report
within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on a detailed,
multi-year investment and modernization plan for Coast Guard
Academy infrastructure. Additionally, the Coast Guard should in-
clude any actions requested or required of Congress to facilitate
such investment and modernization. Further, the recommendation
provides $29,000,000 for Chase Hall Barracks Annex A.
Coast Guard Yard.—The Coast Guard Yard provides an essential
industrial capability for the Service. It cannot currently accommo-
date NSCs or OPCs and is badly in need of modernization. The
Committee recommends $15,000,000 for the Coast Guard to begin
planning yard modernization.

The United States Secret Service (USSS or ‘‘the Secret Service’’)
protects and investigates threats against the President and Vice
President, their families, visiting heads of state, and other des-
ignated individuals; protects the White House, the Vice President’s
Residence, foreign missions, and certain other facilities within
Washington, D.C.; and coordinates the security at National Special
Security Events (NSSEs). The Secret Service also investigates vio-
lations of laws relating to counterfeiting of obligations and securi-
ties of the United States; financial crimes, including access device
fraud, financial institution fraud, identity theft, and computer
fraud; and computer-based attacks on financial, banking, and tele-
communications infrastructure. In addition, the agency provides
support for investigations related to missing and exploited children.

Within the total amount provided for Operations and Support,
the bill makes $11,299,000 available until September 30, 2027 for
certain activities.
Communications, Law Enforcement, and Awareness.—The Com-
mittee provides $6,000,000 for the Secret Service’s initiative to
modernize and enhance situational awareness, communications,
and sensor automation across protective and law enforcement oper-
ations through edge processing in Sensor Network Access Point.
Countering Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Tech-
nology and Training.—In light of the growing security threat posed
by sUAS and the need for SLTT law enforcement to expand its
usage of drones, the Committee recommends an increase of
$5,000,000 to develop a portable detection and identification system
for countering sUAS and for associated training at the National
Computer Forensics Institute.
Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems (cUAS) Review.—USSS
is directed to conduct a review of its cUAS capabilities to determine
further technological needs to ensure the safety of its protectees.

rent cUAS technology and operational readiness, as well as a cost
assessment for technology improvements. USSS shall provide a re-
port to the Committee within 180 days of the date of enactment of
this Act on the findings of the review.
Facial Recognition Technology for Investigations.—The rec-
ommendation includes $5,400,000 for training and technology that
leverages open-source image analysis to enhance financial criminal
investigations.
Financial Crimes.—The Committee recognizes the efforts of the
Secret Service’s Cyber Fraud Task Forces to combat bank card ac-
cess device fraud, including skimming, across the United States.
The Secret Service, in partnership with the Federal Trade Commis-
sion, other law enforcement entities, and small business owners, is
encouraged to sustain and strengthen efforts to educate the public
about skimming, investigate electronic crimes, and apprehend indi-
viduals responsible for skimming.
Geospatial Technology.—The Committee is concerned with the
Secret Service’s ability to access, utilize, and analyze commercial
space-based data and imagery products. As such, the recommenda-
tion includes $2,000,000 for procurement of such technology across
all field offices to better prepare for and execute protection of USSS
protectees, as well as for NSSEs. Within 180 days of the date of
enactment of this Act, the Secret Service shall brief the Committee
on the procurement, technical or policy impediments to integration,
and additional funds needed to expand the capabilities afforded by
the procured technology.
Mental Health Professionals.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to waive any freeze on hiring mental health providers to
support Secret Service personnel and report to the Committee on

Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA)
Requirements.—Public Law 117–103 mandates that CISA publish a
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register within 24
months of enactment of that Act, and issue a final rule 18 months
later, due September 2025, to implement mandatory cyber incident
reporting for all critical infrastructure owners and operators. A
subset of these owners and operators, to be defined in the rule-
making, will be required to report any cyber incident to CISA with-
in 72 hours and any ransom payment within 24 hours. The rec-
ommendation includes additional funds for CIRCIA requirements
to ensure seamless implementation. As part of the required quar-
terly budget and staffing briefings, CISA shall brief the Committee
on a spend plan for all CIRCIA-dedicated funding and the statutory
requirements supported.
Defense Capabilities.—The Committee urges CISA to identify and
report to Congress on programs and initiatives that bolster its de-
fense capabilities to prevent, identify, and remediate specific tactics
and vulnerabilities known to be used by the People’s Republic of
China and other foreign adversary cyber actors against U.S. critical
infrastructure.
Grant Reporting.—CISA, in coordination with FEMA, is directed
to continue providing the information required under this heading
in House Report 118–123 accompanying Public Law 118–47.
Pay Projections and Analysis.—CISA shall continue to provide
pay projections and analysis as required under this heading in
House Report 118–123 accompanying Public Law 118–47 that ap-
propriately compares enacted versus onboard personnel numbers to
enable timely congressional review of salary and benefit informa-
tion during the quarterly budget and staffing briefings. The re-
quired pay projections and analysis shall include cyber pay consid-
erations. The Committee notes this information is important when
assessing CISA’s progress toward hiring goals.

budget request transfers to Mission Support due to strategic con-
tract realignments and the consolidation of IT systems within the
Office of the Chief Information Officer; increases of $2,004,000 for
CIRCIA implementation and $3,200,000 for cybersecurity shared
services for critical infrastructure; and decreases of: $12,022,000
due to cost savings from initial voluntary deferred resignations,
$17,430,000 for previously funded vacancies, and $20,000,000 for
cost savings due to election security mission consolidation.
The Committee supports the use of further cost savings for pro-
tective Domain Name System (DNS), open-source software, and
supply chain security enhancements. Accordingly, the recommenda-
tion reverses some non-pay to pay transfers made in fiscal year
2025 to allow CISA flexibility to invest in such cybersecurity en-
hancements.
Attack Surface Management (ASM).—The recommendation in-
cludes a minimum of $73,700,000 to sustain prior year funding lev-
els for CISA’s ASM program to improve situational awareness of
internet-facing attack surface vulnerabilities. The Committee recog-
nizes that CISA’s ASM capabilities have dramatically improved the
agency’s situational awareness of internet-facing attack surface
vulnerabilities across the Federal Civilian Executive Branch
(FCEB), SLTT, and select critical infrastructure partner networks
before they can be exploited by foreign adversaries. To ensure the
efficient use of funds and enable effective program execution, CISA
is encouraged to leverage dedicated and sustainable procurement
vehicles for ASM program contractor support and commercial capa-
bilities. Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, CISA shall brief the Committee on the feasibility of admin-
istering an ASM shared service offering for FCEB partners, similar
to what it already provides for DNS security, to include capabilities
for high impact environments that handle the Federal govern-
ment’s most sensitive unclassified data.
Critical Infrastructure Program.—The Committee directs CISA to
prioritize funds for the Critical Infrastructure Program on the most
consequential critical infrastructure sectors being targeted by for-
eign nation-state actors. The recommendation includes an increase
of $3,200,000 for the program. CISA shall consider bringing on new
services to the program and review the efficacy of a supply-chain
vendor certification and real-time risk monitoring tool that ensures
adherence to international best practices and security standards.
Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
CISA shall brief the Committee on a spend plan for the program,
the services offered to address specific cybersecurity risks, how
they made determinations about which shared services to provide
based on risk, and a prioritized list of other shared services the
program would implement if resources allowed.
Cyber Education, Training, and Skilling.—The Committee ac-
knowledges the need to grow the number of qualified cybersecurity
professionals within the Federal government. The Committee ac-
knowledges the need to continue to upskill the current Federal cy-
bersecurity workforce to address the shortage of qualified cyberse-
curity professionals. The Committee continues to support sustained
investment in the Cyber Defense Education and Training (CDET)
program; the Federal Cyber Skilling Academy; the National Initia-
tive for Cybersecurity Education; and the Cybersecurity Education

and Training Assistance Program (CETAP). The Committee en-
courages CISA to collaborate with four-year academic institutions
with specific expertise in addressing the challenges of emerging ar-
tificial intelligence technology with the goal of strengthening the
Nation’s cyber defenses and building a more resilient, skills-based
workforce. CISA is also encouraged to consider partnerships with
universities to create tailored programs that build upon students’
prior learning experiences such as skills acquired through military
service, community college programs, technical certifications, and
other non-degree educational experiences.
DHS Contractor Cyber Readiness Pilot.—Not later than 270 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, CISA is directed to brief
the Committee on its assessment of the efficacy of a cyber readi-
ness pilot that would identify critical DHS contractors based on
strategic importance and risk profile, conduct in-depth cybersecu-
rity assessments using NIST SP 800–171 standards, and deliver
tailored remediation plans and provide ongoing support to ensure
compliance. The goal of such pilot program would be to improve the
protection of Controlled Unclassified Information and the integrity
of national security supply chains. The assessment shall include re-
source considerations for: initial planning and contractor selection,
vulnerability assessments and remediation consultation services,
analytical reporting and tailored remediation recommendations,
and follow-up monitoring and compliance verification.
Memory Safety.—The Committee encourages CISA, in consulta-
tion with the Sector Risk Management Agencies, to support the
definition, design, development, distribution, and testing of tech-
nology that fosters memory safe protection of critical open-source
packages which underpin critical infrastructure. Qualifying critical
infrastructure improvements should minimize system downtime by
reducing the number of critical security patches that need to be ap-
plied, be certified or certifiable to meet safety standards in their in-
dustries, and able to be implemented in a timely manner. Not later
than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CISA shall
brief the Committee on its progress to harden critical infrastruc-
ture memory safety attack surfaces across priority critical infra-
structure sectors.
Persistent Access Capability (PAC).—The Committee recognizes
the critical role CISA’s Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
PAC program plays in strengthening the cybersecurity posture of
FCEB agencies and ensuring proactive threat hunting and incident
response without operational impacts to FCEB networks. The Com-
mittee directs CISA to encourage all FCEB agencies to expedi-
tiously implement the timelines and implementation milestones set
forth in associated CISA guidance to achieve full enrollment of ap-
plicable endpoints in PAC-compliant EDR solutions and adoption of
technical controls necessary to support real-time cyber threat visi-
bility across Federal networks. FCEB agencies shall ensure that
CISA has timely and effective access to required cybersecurity
data, consistent with established security, privacy, and oversight
measures. Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of
this Act, CISA shall brief the Committee on PAC implementation,
including FCEB agency compliance status, technical challenges,
any resource constraints, and recommended actions to ensure expe-
ditious adoption.

Post-Quantum Cryptography.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of FCEB agencies building robust and accurate cryp-
tographic inventories to support a post-quantum transition. The
Committee also recognizes the importance of automating cryp-
tographic inventories at FCEB agencies in alignment with guidance
from CISA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Not later than
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CISA shall pro-
vide a briefing detailing: (1) the status of automated cryptographic
inventory adoption at FCEB agencies; (2) gaps or inconsistencies in
inventorying methods across agencies; and (3) recommendations for
standardizing and enhancing automation to ensure seamless mi-
gration to quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
Red Teaming.—The Committee encourages CISA to consider
ways to enhance cybersecurity penetration testing and red teaming
activities for FCEB agencies, as well as high priority critical infra-
structure companies, to augment network hardening and security
operations.
Regulation Harmonization.—The Committee is concerned with
the proliferation of cybersecurity regulations from multiple govern-
ment entities and the potential impacts on effective and efficient
compliance. CISA’s efforts to promote cybersecurity regulatory har-
monization should continue in collaboration with the Office of the
National Cyber Director with the goal of strengthening security
while reducing duplicative and conflicting cybersecurity require-
ments to minimize time, expense, and complexity of compliance.
Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
CISA shall brief the Committee on progress towards harmonizing
and streamlining duplicative cybersecurity rules and regulations.
Additionally, the brief should identify any remaining barriers to
harmonization and provide recommendations to expedite solutions.
Security Operations Center Modernization.—CISA’s Security Op-
erations Center ‘‘as-a-Service’’ (SOCaaS) offering, currently deliv-
ered by the DOJ, provides FCEB agencies with a customizable
menu of security operations services including threat monitoring,
detection and incident response, threat intelligence, and cybersecu-
rity investigations. The Committee notes that cutting edge cloud-
delivered technologies leveraging artificial intelligence and ad-
vanced machine learning are rapidly accelerating the capabilities of
both network defenders and foreign adversaries. To stay ahead of
the threat, Federal network defenders must be able to access, inter-
pret, and rapidly analyze large amounts of security data from a va-
riety of deployed sensors and capabilities; quickly identify,
prioritize, and triage potential security incidents; and quickly miti-
gate threats wherever possible. Therefore, CISA is directed to work
with the DOJ to assess the feasibility of transitioning SOCaaS de-
livery to CISA and deploying a new, modern SOCaaS offering capa-
ble of consolidating existing agency network security data and tools
into an AI-driven platform to provide FCEB agencies state-of-the-
art security intelligence and automation management capabilities.
Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
CISA and its DOJ partners shall brief the Committee on its assess-
ment and any resources required to facilitate the transition.

the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), the Contin-
uous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program, and Joint Col-
laborative Environment (JCE) including information on the re-
maining NCPS capabilities and the new Cyber Analytics and Data
System capabilities. The briefings shall include timelines and ac-
quisition strategies from the NCPS transition to JCE as well as a
full description of the CDM and JCE capabilities currently de-
ployed; the gaps remaining; and funding levels for the prior fiscal
year, the current fiscal year, and the budget year for each capa-
bility.
Specific Foreign Vehicle Cyber Risks.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of better understanding the potential security risks
of vehicles operating in the United States that send telemetry to
and receive updates from companies considered foreign entities of
concern and whether such entities empower their governments to
access sensitive data for national security purposes. Such activity
would raise significant privacy and security concerns for data used
by connected vehicles manufactured and operated by companies in-
corporated in foreign countries of concern, particularly the poten-
tial for unauthorized access to collect and transmit data, imple-
ment surveillance capabilities embedded within a vehicle’s tech-
nology, and disable some vehicles. The Committee directs CISA, in
partnership with the appropriate Sector Risk Management Agen-
cies, to identify potential risks to U.S. critical infrastructure related
to vehicles that send telemetry to and receive updates from compa-
nies considered as foreign entities of concern. CISA shall report to
the Committee on its findings not later than 240 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP).—The
Committee encourages CISA, in coordination with FEMA, to con-
sider targeted outreach to elementary and secondary schools as the
Department administers the SLCGP.
Infrastructure Security
The recommendation includes $120,889,000 for the Infrastruc-
ture Security Division. This includes budget request transfers to
Mission Support due to strategic contract realignments and consoli-
dation of IT systems within the Office of the Chief Information Of-
ficer; an increase of $1,350,000 for 2026 FIFA World Cup activities;
and decreases of: $1,895,000 due to cost savings from initial vol-
untary deferred resignations, $3,398,000 for previously funded va-
cancies, and $8,251,000 for cost savings due to the lapse in the
Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program authoriza-
tion.
Bombing Prevention.—The recommendation includes $26,623,000
for the Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP). The CISA OBP plays
a critical role in ensuring public safety and reducing the Nation’s
vulnerability to explosive threats by building capabilities to deter,
prevent, and respond to bombing incidents and the use of explo-
sives against critical infrastructure. The Committee encourages
CISA to enhance partnerships between OBP and entities address-
ing similar missions, including the FBI’s Hazardous Devices School

analysis and feasibility review of collocating OBP with these enti-
ties to further such collaboration, including any resources associ-
ated with collocating facilities and personnel.
Strengthening Preparedness for Critical Infrastructure and Spe-
cial Events.—The Committee recognizes that the CISA Exercise
Program provides valuable services that help SLTT and private
sector stakeholders enhance the security and resilience of the Na-
tion’s critical infrastructure, enabling them to prepare for and re-
spond to threats or attacks targeting critical infrastructure, mass
gatherings, and other high-profile events. This is particularly im-
portant in advance of upcoming National Special Security Events,
including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the Olympics. Not later
than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CISA shall
provide a briefing to the Committee on a spend plan for CISA Exer-
cise Support Services.

dation, $5,336,000 for previously funded vacancies, $5,505,000 for
cost savings due to the workforce transition program, and
$12,331,000 due to cost savings from initial voluntary deferred res-
ignations.
CISA Support to Pacific Islands.—The Committee supports the
work of CISA in bolstering the cyber and physical security of Fed-
eral, SLTT, and critical infrastructure partners in the Indo-Pacific
region and encourages CISA to consider potential areas for growth,
including resources needed to expand such Pacific Island engage-
ment to counter activities by foreign nation-state actors. The Com-
mittee also encourages CISA to assess the cybersecurity of Guam’s
energy installations, in coordination with Guam Power Authority,
to determine areas of need and opportunities for federal support.
Regional Security Advisors.—The Committee urges CISA to fill
security advisor vacancies in the ten CISA regional offices, as high-
lighted in the 2022–2026 Strategic Plan. These advisors will be in
addition to the Cybersecurity State Coordinators established in fur-
therance of section 1717 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (P.L. 116–
283), in order to supplement regional capability in areas of high de-
mand or particular national security importance. Within 90 days of
the date of enactment of this Act, CISA shall brief the Committee
with representatives from the regional offices on efforts to fill these
vacancies.
Risk Management Operations
The recommendation includes $67,206,000 for the Risk Manage-
ment Operations Division. This includes budget request transfers
to Mission Support due to strategic contract realignments and con-
solidation of IT systems within the Office of the Chief Information
Officer and decreases of: $931,000 for cost savings due to election
security mission consolidation, $1,091,000 due to cost savings from
initial voluntary deferred resignations, $3,093,000 to refocus the
National Risk Management Center on critical infrastructure, and
$16,295,000 for previously funded vacancies.
Digital Twin Technology.—The Committee recognizes that digital
twin technology can provide real-time information regarding the
physical and cybersecurity of important facilities, systems, and as-
sets. The Committee encourages CISA to consider whether digital
twin technology would improve its ability to understand, manage,
and reduce risk to the Nation’s cyber and physical infrastructure.
Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements

ings due to the workforce transition program, $794,000 due to cost
savings from initial voluntary deferred resignations, $2,396,000 for
previously funded vacancies.
Cyber Innovation Center.—The recommendation includes an ad-
ditional $3,200,000 for the Cyber Innovation Center.
Cyber Talent Programs.—The Committee supports CISA’s efforts
to work with FCEB agencies to streamline cyber workforce and
education programs and recognizes the value of the following pro-
grams: the CISA Try Cyber program, which helps provide early
skill identification and the fostering of cyber career interest of criti-
cally needed cyber talent; the Threat Sandbox Challenges program,
which allows CISA to provide rapid training to future cyberspace
defenders on some of the most dangerous Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) identified in the CISA Known Exploited
Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog; and AI workforce programs. These
programs ensure that CISA is prepared to provide early skill iden-
tification within cyber and AI jobs internally and support cyber tal-
ent identification and pipeline programs for the FCEB. The Com-
mittee encourages CISA to use cost savings from deferred resigna-
tions within the Stakeholder Engagement PPA to bolster such pro-
grams.
Mission Support
The recommendation includes $559,555,000 for the Mission Sup-
port Division. This includes increases due to budget request trans-
fers for strategic contract realignments and consolidation of IT sys-
tems within the Office of the Chief Information Officer and de-
creases of: $853,000 due to cost savings from initial voluntary de-
ferred resignations, $6,510,000 for previously funded vacancies,
$16,800,000 for cost savings due to the workforce transition pro-
gram, and $34,675,000 for Mission Support efficiencies consistent
with the budget request.

$65,810,000 for the Cyber Analytics Data System (CADS),
$29,090,000 for Next Generation Networks Priority Services, and
$10,000,000 for the CyberSentry program.
Cloud-Native Security.—The Committee is aware of the CISA
CDM program’s testing and evaluation of commercially available
cloud native application protection platform solutions. Such solu-
tions help FCEB agencies better protect cloud infrastructure and
modern applications by remediating vulnerabilities and preventing
attacks. These solutions also provide CISA with comprehensive vis-
ibility into the security posture of Federal network cloud infrastruc-
ture. Not less than $8,000,000 of the amount provided for CDM
shall be available for the deployment of proven, scalable cloud na-
tive application protection platform tooling to the FCEB. The Com-

mittee encourages CISA to leverage commercial solutions that meet
the highest level of security requirements for cloud-delivered serv-
ices on unclassified networks to FCEB agencies, in order to better
protect federal agencies’ most sensitive unclassified data and se-
cure federal agency software solutions through the software devel-
opment lifecycle. CISA shall include an update on steps taken to
fulfill this guidance during required fiscal year 2026 quarterly
CDM program execution briefs.
CyberSentry.—Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, CISA shall transmit to the Committee a spend plan for
the additional CyberSentry capacity it will achieve with the
$10,000,000 provided for fiscal year 2026. The Committee encour-
ages CISA to add at least 30 new CyberSentry partners with the
funds provided and to accelerate the engineering required to reduce
the cost per deployment and achieve further scalability of the pro-
gram. CISA is directed to prioritize the expansion of the program
to the top at-risk critical infrastructure sectors and companies.
Endpoint Detection and Response Technologies.—The Committee
supports the comprehensive, real-time threat detection and
proactive threat prevention capabilities of EDR technologies
through the CDM program. These solutions replace key legacy cy-
bersecurity tools, simplify cyber programs, and provide more com-
plete protection for distributed enterprises, including those with
travel and remote work requirements. Leveraging EDR, U.S. gov-
ernment defenders can perform threat hunting, incident response,
and a variety of other essential cybersecurity tasks. CISA shall
continue to provide the data required under this heading as de-
scribed in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
118–47 during the semiannual Cybersecurity Technology and Serv-
ices briefings. In such briefings, CISA shall include a timeline for
deployment to cloud environments and more information on how it
is leveraging EDR technologies to support vulnerability manage-
ment, IT hygiene, and to enable more responsive managed threat
hunting. The Committee provided an enhancement of $41,040,000
for CDM Network Security Management, of which EDR is a part.
Internet of Things (IoT) Patch Automation.—The Committee is
aware that automated software patch remediation capabilities have
been certified by MITRE Labs as interoperable with the CDM pro-
gram’s existing hardware asset management tools to effectively re-
mediate out-of-compliance IoT devices through firmware, password,
and certificate management capabilities. CISA is directed to evalu-
ate inclusion into CDM to make the technology available for FCEB
agencies.
Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) for Federal Civilian Networks.—
The Committee recognizes the increasingly sophisticated methods
being employed by both nation-state and other actors to gain access
to government mobile devices. The Committee is concerned about
the number of government devices without mobile device security
and the pace of deployment. The recommendation includes an in-
crease of $5,000,000 within the CDM program to expedite the dis-
tribution of mobile device security capabilities across FCEB agen-
cies. The funds shall address emerging threats to mobile devices by
supporting the deployment of MTD technologies, the integration of
MTD with other mobile security technologies, and the alignment of
these efforts with zero trust cybersecurity principles. Not later than

180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CISA shall brief
the Committee on progress made toward rolling out MTD tech-
nologies across the FCEB, including milestones and remaining
challenges.
New CDM Capability Pilot.—The recommendation includes
$6,000,000 within the CDM program for piloting of new technology
capabilities to become available to FCEB agencies. The maximum
available for a single technology is $2,500,000, and the Committee
encourages CISA to test and evaluate multiple commercially avail-
able technologies for inclusion in the pilot. Not later than 120 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, CISA shall brief the Com-
mittee on a spend plan, including the technologies chosen, the proc-
ess for choosing the technologies, and the new capabilities they
would provide for securing FCEB agencies.
Operational Technology (OT) Security.—The Committee is en-
couraged by CISA’s increased focus on the cybersecurity posture of
OT and Industrial Control Systems. Inventorying allows agencies
to establish a baseline to enable monitoring and detecting unau-
thorized, abnormal, or potentially malicious activities. Requiring
agencies to incorporate IoT and OT assets into the CDM program
helps reduce agency threat surface, increase visibility into the Fed-
eral cybersecurity posture, and improve Federal cybersecurity re-
sponse capabilities. CISA is directed to evaluate inclusion into the
new CDM capability pilot to make the technology available for
FCEB agencies.
Securing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools.—While the safe and
secure use of AI can enhance U.S. government mission effective-
ness, the use of unauthorized AI software, including models devel-
oped by companies headquartered in, or operating from, foreign
countries of concern, can put government networks, data, and ap-
plications at risk. Maintaining the security and integrity of AI sys-
tems requires a comprehensive approach involving continuous mon-
itoring, assessment, and improvement of the security posture of AI
models, data, and infrastructure, in order to effectively identify and
address vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential risks asso-
ciated with AI adoption, and ensure compliance with data handling
and security regulations. The Committee is aware of AI security
posture management, access, and runtime security solutions that
can enable U.S. Federal agencies to proactively protect AI systems
from threats, minimize data exposure, and maintain the trust-
worthiness of AI applications in Federal networks. CISA is directed
to evaluate inclusion into the new CDM capability pilot to make
the technology available for FCEB agencies.
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).—The Committee recognizes
the importance of SBOM protocols as a comprehensive list of all
components, libraries, and dependencies that constitute software.
This is critical for tracking components to ensure security, compli-
ance, and operational integrity. The Committee also notes that
such a program in CDM must support all asset types, including ap-
plications, firmware, operating systems, containers, and cloud
workloads, at a government-level scale imperative for the CDM
program to meet its goals of comprehensive visibility and near-in-
stantaneous response capabilities. CISA is directed to evaluate in-
clusion into the new CDM capability pilot to make the technology
available for FCEB agencies.

ations and Support, including increases of: $111,000 for cloud mod-
ernization and maintenance, $2,907,000 for Community Project
Funding grant administration, $3,000,000 for 2026 FIFA World
Cup activities, $5,137,000 for continuity of communications,
$6,000,000 for technology enhancements, $47,000,000 for the Mt.
Weather Emergency Operations Center, and decreases of:
$83,873,000 for previously funded vacancies and $9,180,000 con-
sistent with the administration’s requested reduction of equity re-
lated positions.
Deferred Resignation Program (DRP).—The Committee is aware
that FEMA is one of the DHS components that will see a signifi-
cant reduction to its number of full-time employees due to the DRP

process in which hundreds of employees chose to voluntarily sepa-
rate from the agency in fiscal year 2025. The Committee supports
the use of further cost savings towards IT modernization efforts to
streamline FEMA programs and systems.
Mitigation
Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Pro-
gram.—The BRIC program was established by Congress in the Dis-
aster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115–254) and signed into
law by President Trump with bipartisan support. While the pro-
gram was originally intended to improve disaster mitigation efforts
and decrease the costs associated with Federal disaster relief, over
the last few years the program shifted outside its intended scope.
However, the Committee is disappointed that FEMA unilaterally
decided to cancel the program instead of implementing appropriate
reforms to improve it. The Committee urges the Department to
identify and implement reforms as needed without forgoing invest-
ments critical to communities across the country to prepare for and
recover from future natural disasters.
Forest Fire Mitigation.—The Committee notes that new homes
continue to be built within the ‘‘wildland-urban interface’’ (WUI)
and that as many as 4.5 million homes are at high or extreme risk
of wildfires. FEMA is encouraged to identify more ways to support
at-risk communities, particularly those in the WUI, that wish to
proactively implement mitigation measures, particularly through
the pre-disaster mitigation program among others.
Hazard Mitigation Natural Infrastructure.—The Committee is
aware that rehabilitation or establishment of natural infrastruc-
ture, including but not limited to marshes, wetlands, mangroves,
and dunes can improve resilience, reduce damage from flooding and
coastal storm surges, and provide effective floodplain management.
Such natural infrastructure can also have long-term beneficial im-
pacts on topography, soils, water quality, wetlands, floodplains,
coastal resources, aquatic resources, and public health and safety
in coastal areas. The Committee encourages FEMA to continue to
engage with other Federal and non-Federal stakeholders to develop
and support conservation and environment-based flood mitigation
measures and to utilize mitigation grant funds for natural infra-
structure projects.
Preparedness and Protection
Animal Wellness Act Implementation and Mobile Pet Shelters.—
The Planning for Animal Wellness Act (P.L. 117–212) required
FEMA to establish a working group of experts to review and rec-
ommend best practices and Federal guidance on the needs of
household pets, service and assistance animals, and captive ani-
mals, as appropriate, in emergency and disaster preparedness, re-
sponse, and recovery. FEMA shall keep the Committee apprised of
its efforts to implement Public Law 117–212 and any recommenda-
tions made by the working group not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act. FEMA is encouraged to consider
ways to provide mobile pet shelter sites for use during major disas-
ters or units that can be deployed quickly to offer temporary shel-
ter and transport for household pets.

Strategic Stockpiles.—FEMA, in partnership with the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, shall provide an update with-
in 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the coordination
of Federal resources to strengthen the capabilities of state strategic
stockpiles, minimize duplication, and respond strategically to emer-
gencies.
Wireless Emergency Alerts.—The Committee reminds FEMA of
the requirement under this heading in House Report 118–123 ac-
companying Public Law 118–47 and urges the on-time trans-
mission of the report.
Response and Recovery
Innovative Technologies in Coordinated Disaster Response.—The
Committee is aware that FEMA employs innovative technologies,
including Geographic Information System (GIS) tools in collabora-
tion with nonprofit entities, to improve disaster response capabili-
ties, such as urban search and rescue software platforms. The rec-
ommendation includes $3,000,000 for the Office of Response and
Recovery, in close coordination with the U.S. Fire Administration,
to expand existing geospatial search and rescue training, planning,
and response program in collaboration with appropriate partners
and to continue sustainment and expansion of search and rescue
geospatial support technology solutions in preparation for emer-
gency incidents and disaster responses. In addition, the Committee
directs FEMA to ensure imagery and information collected through
these tools and technologies be made routinely available to support
joint preliminary damage assessments and the delivery of FEMA’s
disaster assistance programs, as appropriate. FEMA shall consider
appropriate data exchange between these efforts and the National
Emergency Response Information System (NERIS). Not later than
60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, FEMA shall brief
the Committee on a spend plan for the funds and information on
how FEMA plans to integrate the solution, where appropriate, with
NERIS.
National Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) Response System.—
The Committee recommends a total of $56,000,000 to support the
28 US&R Task Forces, which conduct critical search, rescue, and
recovery operations around the country and are deployed on a mo-
ment’s notice. State and local partners provide significant contribu-
tions to ensure these teams are operationally ready to deploy to na-
tionwide disasters, but the funding needs of each task force have
exceeded the ability of local partners to support them on their own.
This reflects rapidly rising costs due to increased labor and equip-
ment costs, an increase in the frequency of deployments, and an ex-
pansion of expected response capabilities.
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Satellite-Driven Hazard Moni-
toring.—The Committee recognizes that shortening natural dis-
aster response times saves lives, reduces suffering, and helps com-
munities recover quicker. The Committee understands that FEMA
has used SAR satellite-driven hazard monitoring technology to ana-
lyze disasters such as floods and wildfires, and this data has spe-
cifically been proven effective in streamlining disaster declarations,
improving immediate situational awareness, and in supporting
FEMA’s community engagements following major disasters. The
recommendation includes $3,000,000 for FEMA to expand the use

of this SAR-driven hazard monitoring technology to help FEMA re-
duce fraud, streamline individual assistance payments, decrease re-
liance on costly airborne assets, and save taxpayer dollars through
enterprise-wide efficiencies. Not later than 120 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, FEMA shall brief the Committee on a
spend plan for the funds and its efforts to integrate SAR satellite-
driven hazard monitoring technology into its disaster operations.
Veterinary Emergency Teams Pilot.—Consistent with section
1218 of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115–254),
the Committee strongly encourages FEMA to coordinate with ap-
propriate federal agencies to partner with accredited colleges of
veterinary medicine with a history of disaster response deploy-
ments in order to establish one or more national veterinary emer-
gency teams.
Mission Support
Enterprise-Wide Technology.—Not later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act, the FEMA office of the Chief Infor-
mation Officer, in coordination with program offices including those
that utilize GIS and SAR technology, shall develop a strategy to
implement a persistent enterprise-wide suite of technology solu-
tions that can be used during the life-cycle of FEMA’s emergency
response and recovery efforts. The strategy shall incorporate dif-
ferent types of technology that FEMA would benefit having per-
sistent enterprise-wide access to, the use cases for such technology
in multiple different types of application, a cost-benefit analysis of
persistent versus one-off procurement of such technology, and a
process for offices to identify technology needs and nominate solu-
tions for consideration.

Grants
Advanced National Security Training.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of providing accredited, advanced national se-
curity training for first responders serving urban and rural commu-
nities, as well as Tribal communities nationwide. The Committee
supports efforts to develop intensive, immersive, and agency-inte-
grated training that enhances preparedness and response capabili-
ties across a range of evolving threats. The Committee encourages
FEMA to incorporate best practices and international expertise in
areas such as search and rescue, counterterrorism, border enforce-
ment, school safety, cybersecurity, cartel violence response, mass
casualty incidents, natural disaster response, trauma care, and
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The Committee supports FEMA’s
continued engagement with first responder communities to ensure
this training strengthens interagency cohesion and operational
readiness.
Continuing Training Grants.—The recommendation includes
$16,000,000 for Continuing Training Grants, including not less
than $6,000,000 to be competitively awarded for FEMA-certified

rural and Tribal training, of which not less than $3,000,000 is for
rural and not less than $3,000,000 is for Tribal. Special emphasis
should be given to filling rural training gaps as identified in the
National Tribal and Rural Training Needs Assessment. The Com-
mittee also supports FEMA’s use of Continuing Training Grants for
the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium.
Cost-Share Analysis.—FEMA is directed to provide recommenda-
tions on the appropriateness of adjustments to existing cost-sharing
splits, or in the case that none exist, new cost-sharing splits that
improve the effectiveness and resilience of the programs on Amer-
ican communities. FEMA shall brief the Committee on the analysis
and recommendations within 210 days of the date of enactment of
this Act, to include any legislative or regulatory action needed to
carry out such recommendations.
Flood Early Warning System Upgrades.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of early warning systems in protecting com-
munities and infrastructure from the impacts of flooding. The Com-
mittee encourages FEMA to work with SLTT governments to iden-
tify ways to upgrade their flood warning systems using existing
Federal resources.
National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC).—The Com-
mittee recommendation includes $101,000,000 for the NDPC and
acknowledges its positive impact on domestic preparedness by
training emergency responders and event personnel against a
range of threats including chemical, biological, radiological, nu-
clear, and explosives incidents. The Committee recognizes the po-
tential threats inherent to large spectator sports and special events
particularly as communities around the Nation prepare for the
2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympics. Of the funds pro-
vided, $3,000,000 shall be used to improve domestic preparedness
and provide training to emergency responders and event personnel
involved in such large spectator events.
Next Generation Warning System.—The Committee supports the
mission of the Next Generation Warning System Grant Program
(NGWSGP) to help public media entities replace and upgrade aging
infrastructure needed to enhance alert, warning, and other public
safety communications systems to ensure national resilience and
the ability to meet the evolving nature of public alerting chal-
lenges. The recommendation includes $40,000,000 for NGWSGP.
Nonprofit Security Grant Program.—The Committee includes
$335,000,000 for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. Within
180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, FEMA is directed
to brief the Committee on the Nonprofit Security Grant Program
for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025. The briefing shall detail by
fiscal year: the number of grant applications submitted, the total
amount of grant funding requested, the number of grants awarded,
and, for each grant award, the name of the recipient, the amount,
and the project type including detailed information on what the
funds will be used for. The brief shall also include an analysis of
the impacts of the program, including tangible results dem-
onstrating how the program has improved preparedness and re-
duced the risk of terrorist or other extremist attacks. The briefing
shall also include an analysis of the efficacy of the expanded scope
of the program to include nonprofit consortia. The Committee en-
courages FEMA to work with states to consider the eligibility of

nonprofit organizations that memorialize historic sites of acts of
terrorism.
Operation Stonegarden.—The Committee strongly supports the
mission of the Operation Stonegarden program to enhance coopera-
tion and coordination among CBP, Federal, and SLTT law enforce-
ment agencies to improve overall border security. The recommenda-
tion includes $90,000,000 for Operation Stonegarden. The Com-
mittee reminds FEMA of the need to ensure states make proper
and timely distributions to local governments. The Committee en-
courages the Department to explore how funding can be used by
grant recipients to purchase technology such as cameras, sensors,
drones, and communications upgrades including land mobile ra-
dios. The Committee also encourages the Department to explore
how grant funding can be used to help interdict illicit outbound
firearms and currency.
School Safety.—The Committee encourages FEMA to work with
states and school districts to increase awareness of funding oppor-
tunities for school hardening measures that may be eligible activi-
ties under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), the State
Homeland Security Program, and the Nonprofit Security Grant
Program. Funds may be used for bullet resistant doors and glass;
hinge-locking mechanisms; immediate notification to emergency
911 systems; mechanisms that provide real time actionable intel-
ligence directly to law enforcement and first responders; installa-
tion of distraction devices or other countermeasures administered
by law enforcement; and other measures determined to provide sig-
nificant improvement to school physical security.
Shelter and Services Program (SSP).—The recommendation in-
cludes no funds for SSP for fiscal year 2026.
UASI Review.—The Committee encourages the GAO to assess
the risk assessment model used to allocate funds for the UASI
grants and recommend any necessary changes to Congress to en-
sure adequate funding for regions of similar populations.
Unmanned Aircraft Training.—The Committee supports the FAA
Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aerial Systems (ASSURE) Un-
manned Aircraft Systems (UAS) training program for first respond-
ers in a leadership role to understand how to manage larger-scale
and more complex disasters. The Committee encourages FEMA to
work toward the development of a framework to build workforce
skills and a database of those capable of applying them in local,
state, and national emergencies. The Committee supports FEMA’s
use of Continuing Training Grants for this purpose.

Small Business Administration (SBA) in a manner which allows for
rapid and timely data collection and sharing as it relates to federal
disaster assistance, including the determination of financial need
for the DRF, the Community Development Block Grant-Disaster
Recovery (CDBG–DR) program, and SBA disaster loans. These
agencies are further directed to provide joint monthly reports on
need by federally declared disaster, as that data becomes available.
Upon enactment of this Act, FEMA, HUD, and SBA are directed
to jointly brief the Committee if any of the three agencies indicate
that they cannot process or share the data as needed in a timely
manner. Finally, FEMA, HUD, and SBA are directed to jointly
brief the Committee no later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act on any challenges that exist in sharing and processing data re-
lated to interplay of these three disaster programs.
Disaster Assistance for New Mothers.—The Committee recognizes
the clinical benefits of breastfeeding for infants and new mothers
and urges FEMA to improve access to breastfeeding supplies after
major disasters through Critical Needs Assistance or other pro-
grams. In the aftermath of a major disaster, FEMA is directed to
coordinate with SLTT and volunteer organizations to ensure that
disaster survivors have information on support available for
breastfeeding equipment and supplies.
Disaster Assistance for Persistent Poverty Counties.—Public Law
117–103 increased the Federal cost share from 75 percent to 90
percent for major disasters declared during calendar years 2020
and 2021. The Committee encourages FEMA to adjust the cost
share for persistent poverty counties for disasters declared during
calendar year 2024.
Disaster Declaration Threshold Change Impact on Rural Areas.—
The Committee recognizes FEMA is conducting an ongoing review
of disaster declaration thresholds to improve the process, but re-
mains concerned that a rapidly implemented significant increase to
the threshold could unfairly affect states that are more rural, with
lower budgets, or that are more susceptible to disasters. The Com-
mittee urges FEMA to account for these considerations as it evalu-
ates formal policy changes moving forward.
Distribution of Surplus Goods During Emergencies.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the challenges posed by major disasters and the
large volume of supplies that they require. Not later than 120 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, FEMA shall brief the Com-
mittee on current operations related to the procurement and stor-
age of goods at warehouses for use during major disasters, includ-
ing the scope and scale of any product insecurity, and an analysis
of the efficacy of repurposing returned or surplus consumer goods
for these purposes. FEMA is encouraged to engage with organiza-
tions that provide resources that serve the public interest and have
the capacity to ensure that surplus goods are distributed and used
appropriately.
Domestic Production of Disaster Shelters.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the timely delivery of vital assistance to
victims in the aftermath of major disasters, including shelter and
housing assistance for individuals and families displaced from their
homes. The Committee strongly encourages FEMA to ensure Amer-
ican-made shelters are considered for purposes of providing federal
disaster relief for future major disasters.

Emergency Housing.—The Committee recognizes the vital sup-
port FEMA provides to communities in the aftermath of major dis-
asters, including sheltering and housing assistance for individuals
and families displaced from their homes. The Committee is con-
cerned that housing shortages may impact recovery efforts, reduce
community resiliency, and cause long-term displacement after a
major disaster. FEMA is directed to submit a report to the Com-
mittee within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act that
details emergency housing operations for major disasters over the
last four years, including the type of sheltering and housing assist-
ance provided to survivors and responders, the costs associated
with the shelter and housing assistance, the number of individuals
and families housed, and the duration of housing assistance.
GAO Assessment of Temporary Shelter Options.—The Committee
recognizes the need for FEMA to ensure vital resources deployed
in the aftermath of major disasters are done so in the most efficient
and cost-effective manner possible. As such, the Committee re-
quests that GAO conduct an assessment of current commercial off-
the-shelf temporary shelter options and whether FEMA has uti-
lized the most cost-effective solutions over the past three years dur-
ing natural disasters, including for the Maui wildfires and Hurri-
cane Ian.
Insurance Policy Review.—The Committee encourages FEMA to
review the 2015 Policy on Insurance to consider if there are ways
to better reflect the current commercial market and the utilization
by applicants of innovative mechanisms, including self-retention
plans funded with an applicant’s own money, to access commercial
insurance products to cover losses from natural disasters.
Major Disaster Telehealth Capabilities.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of uninterrupted access to health care during
major disasters and encourages FEMA to consider ways to enable
the deployment of telemedicine and mobile diagnostic units in
areas affected by such major disasters, including virtual emergency
room consultations and mobile healthcare solutions.
Post-Disaster Temporary Shelter Options.—The Committee en-
courages FEMA to review existing agency parameters regarding
the types of shelters eligible for federal reimbursement to consider
new and innovative industry materials, and other viable, cost-effec-
tive options for SLTT governments. Specifically, the Committee
urges FEMA to review current utilization restrictions and categor-
ical eligibility regarding temporary transportable housing units and
alternative temporary transportable housing units for disaster re-
covery efforts.
Proof of Residence.—The Committee recognizes that survivors of
natural disasters may face challenges in accessing formal deeds
and leases to prove ownership when applying for FEMA assistance.
The Committee encourages FEMA to consider ways to broaden the
array of proof of residence documents, to include both digital and
physical copies, without introducing additional risk of fraud into
the process. FEMA is encouraged to brief the Committee on any
changes it plans to make accordingly not later than 30 days prior
to implementation of such changes.
Reimbursement Delays.—The Committee encourages FEMA to
work with SLTT governments to ensure they are providing reim-

The recommendation includes $112,551,000 for Operations and
Support, which is provided exclusively for the E-Verify program to
allow enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employ-
ees to work in the United States.
Application Processing.—USCIS is directed to prioritize the time-
ly processing of citizenship and other applications, with a goal of
adjudicating all requests within six months of submission or refer-
ral. USCIS is directed to make available, on a publicly accessible
website, an interactive dashboard detailing, for all USCIS forms,
the number of forms received, processed, approved, denied, and
pending by month, along with the average processing time and the
number of forms pending for more than six months. USCIS shall
update the Committee on the status of this requirement during the
quarterly budget and productivity briefings required by House Re-
port 117–396 and House Report 118–123. The dashboard shall be
updated monthly but not later than the tenth business day fol-
lowing the end of each month and permit the downloading of the
underlying data in a searchable and sortable spreadsheet format.
Backlog Reduction and Reporting.—USCIS is directed to con-
tinue monthly reporting to the Committee on the application proc-
essing case backlog trends and statistics. USCIS is urged to im-
prove the timeliness of such reporting.
Budget Justification Materials.—USCIS is directed to ensure
user fee budget justifications include descriptions of planned spend-
ing profiles, year-over-year changes, and cost assumptions. The jus-
tifications for these accounts should provide the same level of detail
and analysis as is provided for the Department’s discretionary
funding accounts. For example, the justification shall contain de-
tailed budget exhibits for each of the fee PPAs and fully describe

the staffing and hiring strategy. In addition, the materials shall in-
clude the plans and budget assumptions for USCIS’s international
operations and the funding and planned outcome measures for
business process improvements and modernization efforts.
A full understanding of USCIS’s budget strategy, plans, and as-
sumptions are critical to Congress’ oversight responsibilities—re-
gardless of the funding source. The Committee expects these items
to be addressed with the annual budget justification materials or
that the necessary program details, funding and staffing profiles,
and other exhibits be submitted concurrently with the delivery of
the annual budget.
Corrected Employment Documents.—The Committee encourages
USCIS to take necessary steps to issue corrected employment au-
thorization documents.
Cost Recovery.—USCIS is urged to limit fee waivers to ensure
maximum recovery of costs associated with USCIS services. USCIS
is directed to include fee waiver data in the quarterly budget and
staffing briefings. The Committee reminds USCIS of the directive
in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118–47 to
provide a briefing on ways to improve cost recovery at the agency.
Data on Asylum Operations.—USCIS is directed to continue to
make available, on a publicly accessible website in a downloadable,
searchable, and sortable format, the information required under
this heading in the explanatory statement accompanying Public
Law 117–328.
E-Verify.—The Committee encourages USCIS to continue efforts
to modernize the E Verify program, as well as continue improve-
ments in outreach efforts and training tools to assist employers in
improving the accuracy of information they submit into the system.
Electronic Processing.—The Committee continues the require-
ment for USCIS to provide a quarterly briefing on its electronic
processing efforts. The Committee supports the ongoing digitization
efforts of USCIS forms and signature requirements to comply with
the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (P.L. 115–336)
and encourages USCIS to ensure digitization of all forms.
Eliminating Confusion in Classifying Job Occupations.—The
Committee directs USCIS to continue to update each of its online
and paper forms to ensure that the Standard Occupational Classi-
fication codes are the only occupational codes used.
Quarterly Budget and Productivity Reporting.—The Committee is
concerned by USCIS’s lack of urgency in providing timely quarterly
budget and productivity briefings and directs USCIS to ensure that
the quarterly briefings required under this heading in House Re-
port 117–396 are provided promptly. USCIS shall continue to pro-
vide these briefings in fiscal year 2026.
R–1 Visa Program.—USCIS shall provide a briefing to the Com-
mittee within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on de-
ceptive and exploitative labor practice abuses within the R–1 Visa
program. The briefing shall include plans on ways to mitigate and
prevent such abuse.

Spouse Petitions.—With respect to fiance´(e) or spouse petitions
involving a minor party, the Committee continues to direct USCIS
to document the age of the minor party at the time of the civil/legal
marriage, along with the age difference between the parties, with
ages given by months and years.
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges that TPS for Venezuela should not be used in
perpetuity and notes that this status should only be used in cases
of ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters, extreme humanitarian
crises, or extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent
aliens from safely returning to their country. However, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to reconsider the termination of TPS
for Venezuelans and conduct a more thorough analysis of the situa-
tion in-country. Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, the Secretary shall provide a briefing to the Committee
on the evaluation of the conditions that led to the termination of
TPS in Venezuela.
Uniting for Ukraine Program.—The USCIS’s Uniting for Ukraine
(U4U) program has provided critical humanitarian parole pathways

Research, Development, and Innovation
With the dissolution of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction
(CWMD), S&T will serve as the lead component in developing the
next generation of biological detection. CWMD’s biological detection
program, BioWatch, was plagued by prolonged event-to-detection
timelines, a limited suite of detectable pathogens, and high oper-
ating costs. As S&T works to develop potential replacements for
the BioWatch system, S&T is encouraged to consult with SLTT
stakeholders to determine their biodetection needs and with indus-
try and academia to examine existing capabilities. S&T should
focus on easily deployable, scalable solutions that are nearly tech-
nologically mature. At this time, S&T should avoid focusing devel-
oping a single solution that can detect all possible hazards, but
rather focus on what is practicable. The recommendation provides
$40,000,000 for this activity.

vided, S&T is encouraged to continue its work advancing next-gen-
eration computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technology to
enhance firefighter safety, situational awareness, and operational
performance through the use of helmet-mounted AR systems to im-
prove navigation and visibility in high-risk, low-visibility environ-
ments.
Binational Industrial Research and Development Homeland Secu-
rity (BIRD HLS) Program.—The Committee continues its strong
support of the BIRD HLS program, which allows S&T to work with
Israeli partners to develop innovative technology solutions for
homeland security needs, and encourages funding at the fiscal year
2024 enacted level.
Combating Transnational Criminal Organizations with Advanced
Data Analytics.—The Committee is concerned with the growing in-
fluence of and violence perpetrated by TCOs in the United States.
Within the funds provided and in consultation with HSI, the Com-
mittee encourages S&T to establish a pilot program to address
human trafficking and other illicit activity by developing com-
prehensive intelligence on TCOs operating domestically by using
analytical capabilities. The pilot should focus on three key do-
mains: advanced data collection, sophisticated network analysis,
and collaborative intelligence gathering with the goal of creating
actionable insights to support prevention and intervention efforts.
In determining the location for a pilot, S&T is encouraged to con-

sider areas where SLTT collaboration on such activities has al-
ready begun. S&T shall submit a report to the Committee not later
than one year after the date of enactment of this Act that details
any results of the pilot.
Critical Infrastructure and Cyber Attacks.—Within the funds pro-
vided, S&T is encouraged to support research to develop and dem-
onstrate timely hierarchical software quality assurance and timely
cyber-attack mitigation techniques for hardware in one or more of
the following Department-designated critical infrastructure sectors:
chemical, IT, critical manufacturing, water and wastewater, com-
munications, and transportation.
Cross-Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense.—
Within the funds provided, the Committee continues to encourage
S&T to expand research and analysis on cross-border threat screen-
ing and supply chain defense, including predictive data analytics,
to eliminate disruptions to the food and agriculture supply chain
and for early detection of public health threats and biothreats.
Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) System.—Within the
funds provided, S&T is encouraged to evaluate and deploy portable
counter IED systems.
Counter Unmanned Aircraft System.—The Committee supports
the cUAS Program, which assesses available cUAS solutions and
guides the development of new capabilities to support acquisition,
rapid deployment, and utilization decisions based on the needs and
requirements of DHS components such as CBP, USSS, Coast
Guard, and FPS.
Cybersecurity for Tourism.—Within the funds provided, the Com-
mittee urges S&T, in coordination with FLETC, to establish a Cy-
bersecurity for Tourism Consortium to help align government inter-
ests in public safety and security with the Nation’s tourism indus-
try.
Data Visualization and Emerging Analytics.—Within existing
funds, the Committee supports the further development of the Data
Visualization and Emerging Analytics tool to meet the increasing
demands in areas with limited border security resources.
Digital Twin.—Within the funds provided, S&T is encouraged to
pursue research and development related to the use of digital
twins. Advanced modeling and simulation can improve and en-
hance mission effectiveness by developing new paradigms, tools,
and simulation-enabled capabilities for DHS operations, including
geospatial simulations of the southern border.
Directed Energy Capabilities.—The Committee is aware of ad-
vances in directed energy technology, including high-power micro-
wave systems, which can support various missions across the De-
partment, including efforts to counter UAS and unmanned vessels.
The Committee encourages S&T, within the funds provided, to
study the use and application of such technology.

site for demonstration and research of UAS and is pleased that the
site is also available to other federal, state, and local partners. The
Committee encourages S&T to continue funding this work,
prioritize the use of the common test site to conduct on-site testing
and evaluation for the Department, and facilitate a close collabora-
tion with the Federal Aviation Administration UAS Center of Ex-
cellence.
Fentanyl Detection.—Within the funds provided, the Committee
encourages S&T, in conjunction with other federal partners, to im-
prove opioid and fentanyl detection. Such efforts may include re-
search on additional technological solutions to: target and detect
low-purity fentanyl, especially in counterfeit pressed tablets; en-
hance targeting of counterfeit pills through nonintrusive,
noninvasive, and other visual screening technologies; and improve
data-driven targeting to increase seizure rates of fentanyl and its
precursors and may include AI-assisted olfactory sensors.
Interconnected Passenger Screening.—The Committee recognizes
that interconnected technology can modernize TSA checkpoint
screening. Within funds provided, the Committee supports the de-
velopment of technology that can provide real-time data analysis
and support faster, more secure screening.
Networked Acoustic Sensors.—Networked acoustic sensors can
create a passive surveillance perimeter that can detect and track
sUAS. Within the funds provided, the Committee encourages S&T
to enable the development and deployment of this technology.
Partnership Intermediary Agreements.—Within the funds pro-
vided, the Committee encourages S&T to establish Partnership
Intermediary Agreements to enable components across the Depart-
ment to engage immediately on technology transfer and transition
activities. Partnership Intermediary Agreements, as defined under
section 3715 of title 15, United States Code, support the Depart-
ment’s ability to seek out, assess, and engage non-traditional small
business vendors for the Department’s development and acquisition
efforts.
Port and Maritime Resiliency and Security.—The Committee con-
tinues to recognize the vast threat facing the U.S. maritime/port
sector. Within the funds provided, the Committee encourages sup-
port for the ongoing Port and Maritime Resiliency and Security
Testbed.
Quantum Computing Use-Case Identification Initiative.—The
Committee supports a coordinated and focused research program in
identifying near-term public sector use cases for quantum com-
puting applications. The Committee encourages S&T, in coordina-
tion with the Quantum Economic Development Consortium, Feder-
ally Funded Research and Development Centers, and the quantum
industry, to identify public sector use cases which could benefit
DHS and its components. S&T shall examine all quantum com-
puting technologies including annealing, gate-model, and quantum-
hybrid.
Technology Scouting.—The Committee encourages S&T to con-
tinue its technology scouting program to allow it to leverage exist-
ing and emerging technologies and avoid the duplication of re-
search efforts.

level for the U.S.-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation grant program,
as authorized by section 1551 of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (P.L. 117–81), to support cybersecu-
rity research and development, demonstration, and commercializa-
tion of cybersecurity technology.
Voting Technologies and Election Data Security Procedures.—The
Committee supports research to ensure that voting software and
hardware is studied and vetted before being used during federal,
state, and local elections. Consistent with prior year direction and
within the resources provided, S&T is encouraged to fund quality
assurance and continuous evaluation research on voting tech-
nologies and election procedures in cooperation with a qualified or-
ganization with experience performing technical audits of statewide
elections systems. In consultation and coordination with other Fed-
eral partners, this investment should include the development of
new tools and training modules to enable states and localities to
ensure that their election systems are secure.
University Programs
The recommendation provides $45,880,000 for University Pro-
grams. S&T’s University Programs allow for cooperation with col-
leges and universities to address pressing homeland security needs.
University Programs promote homeland security research and edu-
cation, train current and future students and professionals, and
build a homeland security workforce.
Centers of Excellence (COE) Program.—The COE program is the
flagship research account for universities at DHS. The program
brings together hundreds of academic institutions and private sec-
tor entities to generate basic and applied research that rapidly de-
livers innovative technologies for the homeland security community
to meet imminent and future threats. The COE network catalyzes
the development of new marketplaces for technologies geared to-
ward keeping our Nation safe and secure. This level of coordination
for the development of user-facing security technologies is not fund-
ed by any other federal agency.
The Committee is frustrated by the Department’s lack of commu-
nication on its review of COEs and does not support the Depart-
ment’s termination of COEs as announced in April 2025. The Com-
mittee provides $45,880,000 to allow the Department to restore
funding to the COEs which were funded in fiscal year 2024 and di-
rects the Department to brief the Committee on its plan to fund
COEs in fiscal year 2026 no later than 30 days after the date of
enactment of this Act.

Within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Depart-
ment shall submit to the Committees a table delineating PPAs sub-
ject to section 503 notification requirements.
For purposes of reprogramming notifications, the creation of a
new PPA is defined as any significant new activity that has not
been explicitly justified to the Congress in budget justification ma-
terial and for which funds have not been appropriated by the Con-
gress.
Limited transfer authority is provided to give the Department
flexibility in responding to emerging requirements and significant
changes in circumstances, but is not intended to facilitate the im-
plementation of new programs, projects, or activities that were not
proposed in a formal budget submission. Transfers may not reduce
accounts by more than two and a half percent or augment appro-
priations by more than five percent. The Department must notify
the Committees on Appropriations not fewer than 30 days in ad-
vance of any transfer. To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency
Act, the Secretary shall ensure that any transfer of funds is carried
out in compliance with the limitations and requirements of section
503(c). In particular, the Secretary should ensure that any such
transfers adhere to the opinion of the Comptroller General’s deci-
sion in the Matter of John D. Webster, Director, Financial Services,
Library of Congress, dated November 7, 1997, with regard to the
definition of an appropriation subject to transfer limitations.
Notifications should provide complete explanations of proposed
funding reallocations, including detailed justifications for increases
and offsets; any specific impact the proposed changes are expected
to have on future-year appropriations requirements; a table show-
ing the proposed revisions to funding and full-time equivalents
(FTE) at the account and PPA levels for the current fiscal year;
and any expected funding and FTE impacts during the budget
year.
The Department shall manage its PPAs within the levels appro-
priated and should only submit reprogramming or transfer notifica-
tions in cases of unforeseeable and compelling circumstances that
could not have been predicted when formulating the budget request
for the current fiscal year. When the Department becomes aware
of an emerging requirement after the President’s budget has been
submitted to Congress but prior to the enactment of a full-year
funding Act for the budget year, it is incumbent on the Office of
the Chief Financial Officer to timely notify the Committees. When
the Department submits a reprogramming or transfer notification
and does not receive identical responses from the House and Sen-
ate Committees, it is expected to work with the Committees to rec-
oncile the differences before proceeding.
Section 504. The Committee continues a provision, by reference,
prohibiting funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the
Department to make payment to the Working Capital Fund (WCF),
except for activities and amounts allowed in the President’s fiscal
year 2025 budget request.

fication to the Committees at least three days before DHS executes
or announces grant allocations or grant awards in excess of
$1,000,000; contract awards (including contracts covered by the
Federal Acquisition Regulation), other transaction agreements, let-
ters of intent, or a task or delivery order on multiple award con-
tracts totaling more than $4,000,000; a task or delivery order
greater than $10,000,000 from multi-year funds; or sole-source
grant awards. Notifications shall include a description of projects
or activities to be funded and their location, including city, county,
and state.
Section 508. The Committee continues a provision prohibiting all
agencies from purchasing, constructing, or leasing additional facili-
ties for Federal law enforcement training without advance notifica-
tion to the Committees.

residence or domicile, whether in the United States or elsewhere,
and, except as otherwise provided in sections 320 and 321 of title
III, a child adopted in the United States, if such legitimation or
adoption takes place before the child reaches the age of 16 years
(except to the extent that the child is described in subparagraph

custody of the legitimating or adopting parent or parents at the
time of such legitimation or adoption.
(2) The terms ‘‘parent’’, ‘‘father’’, and ‘‘mother’’ include in the case
of a posthumous child a deceased parent, father, and mother.
(e) For the purpose of this Act—
(1) The giving, loaning, or promising of support or of money or
any other thing of value to be used for advocating any doctrine
shall constitute the advocating of such doctrine; but nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed as an exclusive definition of advo-
cating.

(1) a habitual drunkard;
(3) a member of one or more of the classes of persons, wheth-
er inadmissible or not, described in paragraphs (2)(D), (6)(E),
and (10)(A) of section 212(a) of this Act; or subparagraphs (A)
and (B) of section 212(a)(2) and subparagraph (C) thereof of
such section (except as such paragraph relates to a single of-
fense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marihuana);
if the offense described therein, for which such person was con-
victed or of which he admits the commission, was committed
during such period;
(4) one whose income is derived principally from illegal gam-
bling activities;
(5) one who has been convicted of two or more gambling of-
fenses committed during such period;
(6) one who has given false testimony for the purpose of ob-
taining any benefits under this Act;
(7) one who during such period has been confined, as a result
of conviction, to a penal institution for an aggregate period of
one hundred and eighty days or more, regardless of whether
the offense, or offenses, for which he has been confined were
committed within or without such period;
(8) one who at any time has been convicted of an aggravated
felony (as defined in subsection (a)(43)); or
(9) one who at any time has engaged in conduct described in
section 212(a)(3)(E) (relating to assistance in Nazi persecution,
participation in genocide, or commission of acts of torture or
extrajudicial killings) or 212(a)(2)(G) (relating to severe viola-
tions of religious freedom).
The fact that any person is not within any of the foregoing class-
es shall not preclude a finding that for other reasons such person
is or was not of good moral character. In the case of an alien who
makes a false statement or claim of citizenship, or who registers
to vote or votes in a Federal, State, or local election (including an
initiative, recall, or referendum) in violation of a lawful restriction
of such registration or voting to citizens, if each natural parent of
the alien (or, in the case of an adopted alien, each adoptive parent
of the alien) is or was a citizen (whether by birth or naturaliza-
tion), the alien permanently resided in the United States prior to
attaining the age of 16, and the alien reasonably believed at the
time of such statement, claim, or violation that he or she was a cit-
izen, no finding that the alien is, or was, not of good moral char-
acter may be made based on it.
(g) For the purposes of this Act any alien ordered deported or re-
moved (whether before or after the enactment of this Act) who has
left the United States, shall be considered to have been deported
or removed in pursuance of law, irrespective of the source from
which the expenses of his transportation were defrayed or of the
place to which he departed.
(h) For purposes of section 212(a)(2)(E), the term ‘‘serious crimi-
nal offense’’ means—
(1) any felony;
(2) any crime of violence, as defined in section 16 of title 18
of the United States Code; or

(3) any crime of reckless driving or of driving while intoxi-
cated or under the influence of alcohol or of prohibited sub-
stances if such crime involves personal injury to another.
(i) With respect to each nonimmigrant alien described in sub-
section (a)(15)(T)(i)—
(1) the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney Gen-
eral, and other Government officials, where appropriate, shall
provide the alien with a referral to a nongovernmental organi-
zation that would advise the alien regarding the alien’s options
while in the United States and the resources available to the
alien; and
(2) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, during the pe-
riod the alien is in lawful temporary resident status under that
subsection, grant the alien authorization to engage in employ-
ment in the United States and provide the alien with an ‘‘em-
ployment authorized’’ endorsement or other appropriate work
permit.

CHAPTER 2—QUALIFICATIONS FOR ADMISSION OF ALIENS; TRAVEL
CONTROL OF CITIZENS AND ALIENS
* * * * * * *
ADMISSION OF NONIMMIGRANTS
SEC. 214. (a)(1) The admission to the United States of any alien
as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such condi-
tions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, includ-
ing when he deems necessary the giving of a bond with sufficient
surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the Attorney
General shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of such
time or upon failure to maintain the status under which he was ad-
mitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under sec-
tion 248, such alien will depart from the United States. No alien
admitted to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands without a visa pursuant to section 212(l) may be authorized
to enter or stay in the United States other than in Guam or the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or to remain in
Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for
a period exceeding 45 days from date of admission to Guam or the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. No alien admit-
ted to the United States without a visa pursuant to section 217
may be authorized to remain in the United States as a non-
immigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the date of
admission.
(2)(A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant de-
scribed in section 101(a)(15)(O) shall be for such period as the At-
torney General may specify in order to provide for the event (or
events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.
(B) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described
in section 101(a)(15)(P) shall be for such period as the Attorney

General may specify in order to provide for the competition, event,
or performance for which the nonimmigrant is admitted. In the
case of nonimmigrants admitted as individual athletes under sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(P), the period of authorized status may be for an
initial period (not to exceed 5 years) during which the non-
immigrant will perform as an athlete and such period may be ex-
tended by the Attorney General for an additional period of up to
5 years.
(b) Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in subpara-
graph (L) or (V) of section 101(a)(15), and other than a non-
immigrant described in any provision of section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) ex-
cept subclause (b1) of such section) shall be presumed to be an im-
migrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular offi-
cer, at the time of application for a visa, and the immigration offi-
cers, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to
a nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15). An alien who is an
officer or employee of any foreign government or of any inter-
national organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and
immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act,
or an alien who is the attendant, servant, employee, or member of
the immediate family of any such alien shall not be entitled to
apply for or receive an immigrant visa, or to enter the United
States as an immigrant unless he executes a written waiver in the
same form and substance as is prescribed by section 247(b).
(c)(1) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant
under subparagraph (H), (L), (O), or (P)(i) of section 101(a)(15) (ex-
cluding nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)) in any
specific case or specific cases shall be determined by the Attorney
General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Gov-
ernment, upon petition of the importing employer. Such petition
shall be made and approved before the visa is granted. The petition
shall be in such form and contain such information as the Attorney
General shall prescribe. The approval of such a petition shall not,
of itself, be construed as establishing that the alien is a non-
immigrant. For purposes of this subsection with respect to non-
immigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), the term ‘‘ap-
propriate agencies of Government’’ means the Department of Labor
and includes the Department of Agriculture. The provisions of sec-
tion 218 shall apply to the question of importing any alien as a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a).
(2)(A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure under
which an importing employer which meets requirements estab-
lished by the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to im-
port aliens as nonimmigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(L) in-
stead of filing individual petitions under paragraph (1) to import
such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited processing
of visas for admission of aliens covered under such a petition.
(B) For purposes of section 101(a)(15)(L), an alien is considered
to be serving in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with re-
spect to a company if the alien has a special knowledge of the com-
pany product and its application in international markets or has an
advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the
company.
(C) The Attorney General shall provide a process for reviewing
and acting upon petitions under this subsection with respect to

nonimmigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(L) within 30 days
after the date a completed petition has been filed.
(D) The period of authorized admission for—
(i) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a manage-
rial or executive capacity under section 101(a)(15)(L) shall not
exceed 7 years, or
(ii) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a capacity
that involves specialized knowledge under section 101(a)(15)(L)
shall not exceed 5 years.
(E) In the case of an alien spouse admitted under section
101(a)(15)(L), who is accompanying or following to join a principal
alien admitted under such section, the Attorney General shall au-
thorize the alien spouse to engage in employment in the United
States and provide the spouse with an ‘‘employment authorized’’
endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
(F) An alien who will serve in a capacity involving specialized
knowledge with respect to an employer for purposes of section
101(a)(15)(L) and will be stationed primarily at the worksite of an
employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate, sub-
sidiary, or parent shall not be eligible for classification under sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(L) if—
(i) the alien will be controlled and supervised principally by
such unaffiliated employer; or
(ii) the placement of the alien at the worksite of the unaffili-
ated employer is essentially an arrangement to provide labor
for hire for the unaffiliated employer, rather than a placement
in connection with the provision of a product or service for
which specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning em-
ployer is necessary.
(3) The Attorney General shall approve a petition—
(A) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(O)(i) only after consultation in accordance with
paragraph (6) or, with respect to aliens seeking entry for a mo-
tion picture or television production, after consultation with
the appropriate union representing the alien’s occupational
peers and a management organization in the area of the alien’s
ability, or
(B) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(O)(ii) after consultation in accordance with para-
graph (6) or, in the case of such an alien seeking entry for a
motion picture or television production, after consultation with
such a labor organization and a management organization in
the area of the alien’s ability.
In the case of an alien seeking entry for a motion picture or tele-
vision production, (i) any opinion under the previous sentence shall
only be advisory, (ii) any such opinion that recommends denial
must be in writing, (iii) in making the decision the Attorney Gen-
eral shall consider the exigencies and scheduling of the production,
and (iv) the Attorney General shall append to the decision any such
opinion. The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for the
waiver of the consultation requirement under subparagraph (A) in
the case of aliens who have been admitted as nonimmigrants under
section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) because of extraordinary ability in the arts
and who seek readmission to perform similar services within 2
years after the date of a consultation under such subparagraph.

porting documentation to the national office of an appropriate labor
organization.

of amateur performance of that sport in the relevant for-
eign country;
(bb) participation in such league or association renders
players ineligible, whether on a temporary or permanent
basis, to earn a scholarship in, or participate in, that sport
at a college or university in the United States under the
rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association; and
(cc) a significant number of the individuals who play in

(I) performs with or is an integral and essential part of the
performance of an entertainment group that has (except as
provided in clause (ii)) been recognized internationally as being
outstanding in the discipline for a sustained and substantial
period of time,
(II) in the case of a performer or entertainer, except as pro-

of an alien as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(P).

Security and the heads of other appropriate United States agen-
cies, that such alien does not pose a threat to the safety, national
security, or national interest of the United States. In making a de-
termination under this subparagraph, the Secretary of State shall
apply standards developed by the Secretary of State, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of
other appropriate United States agencies, that are applicable to the
nationals of such states.
(ii) In this subparagraph, the term ‘‘state sponsor of international

States on a temporary or seasonal basis; or

porary basis to provide services to State, county, and local

profit organizations for fundraising.
(5)(A) In the case of an alien who is provided nonimmigrant sta-

a motion picture or television production), the petitioner shall sub-
mit with the petition an advisory opinion from a labor organization
with expertise in the skill area involved.
(iii) To meet the consultation requirement of paragraph (4)(D) in
the case of a petition for a nonimmigrant described in section

(B) To meet the consultation requirements of subparagraph (A),
unless the petitioner submits with the petition an advisory opinion
from an appropriate labor organization, the Attorney General shall
forward a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to
the national office of an appropriate labor organization within 5
days of the date of receipt of the petition. If there is a collective
bargaining representative of an employer’s employees in the occu-
pational classification for which the alien is being sought, that rep-
resentative shall be the appropriate labor organization.
(C) In those cases in which a petitioner described in subpara-
graph (A) establishes that an appropriate peer group (including a

dicate the petition without requiring an advisory opinion.
(D) Any person or organization receiving a copy of a petition de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) and supporting documents shall have
no more than 15 days following the date of receipt of such docu-

ment or to provide a letter of no objection. Once the 15-day period
has expired and the petitioner has had an opportunity, where ap-
propriate, to supply rebuttal evidence, the Attorney General shall
adjudicate such petition in no more than 14 days. The Attorney
General may shorten any specified time period for emergency rea-
sons if no unreasonable burden would be thus imposed on any par-
ticipant in the process.
(E)(i) The Attorney General shall establish by regulation expe-
dited consultation procedures in the case of nonimmigrant artists

Attorney General determines, in his sole discretion, to be appro-
priate.
(7) If a petition is filed and denied under this subsection, the At-

paragraph (5).
(7) Any alien who has already been counted, within the 6 years
prior to the approval of a petition described in subsection (c), to-
ward the numerical limitations of paragraph (1)(A) shall not again
be counted toward those limitations unless the alien would be eligi-
ble for a full 6 years of authorized admission at the time the peti-
tion is filed. Where multiple petitions are approved for 1 alien, that

tion established under clause (i) has not been exhausted at the end
of a given fiscal year, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ad-
just upwards the numerical limitation in paragraph (1)(A) for that
fiscal year by the amount remaining in the numerical limitation

issued pursuant to such adjustment within the first 45 days of the
next fiscal year to aliens who had applied for such visas during the
fiscal year for which the adjustment was made.

dence of an intention to abandon a foreign residence for purposes

tion Agency with a statement in writing that it has no objec-
tion to such waiver;
(B) in the case of a request by an interested State agency,
the grant of such waiver would not cause the number of waiv-
ers allotted for that State for that fiscal year to exceed 30;
(C) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency
or by an interested State agency—
(i) the alien demonstrates a bona fide offer of full-time
employment at a health facility or health care organiza-
tion, which employment has been determined by the Attor-
ney General to be in the public interest; and
(ii) the alien agrees to begin employment with the health
facility or health care organization within 90 days of re-
ceiving such waiver, and agrees to continue to work for a
total of not less than 3 years (unless the Attorney General
determines that extenuating circumstances exist, such as
closure of the facility or hardship to the alien, which would
justify a lesser period of employment at such health facil-
ity or health care organization, in which case the alien
must demonstrate another bona fide offer of employment
at a health facility or health care organization for the re-
mainder of such 3-year period); and
(D) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency
(other than a request by an interested Federal agency to em-
ploy the alien full-time in medical research or training) or by
an interested State agency, the alien agrees to practice pri-
mary care or specialty medicine in accordance with paragraph
(2) for a total of not less than 3 years only in the geographic
area or areas which are designated by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services as having a shortage of health care pro-
fessionals, except that—
(i) in the case of a request by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, the alien shall not be required to practice
medicine in a geographic area designated by the Secretary;
(ii) in the case of a request by an interested State agen-
cy, the head of such State agency determines that the
alien is to practice medicine under such agreement in a fa-
cility that serves patients who reside in one or more geo-
graphic areas so designated by the Secretary of Health and
Human Services (without regard to whether such facility
is located within such a designated geographic area), and
the grant of such waiver would not cause the number of
the waivers granted on behalf of aliens for such State for
a fiscal year (within the limitation in subparagraph (B)) in
accordance with the conditions of this clause to exceed 10;
and
(iii) in the case of a request by an interested Federal
agency or by an interested State agency for a waiver for
an alien who agrees to practice specialty medicine in a fa-
cility located in a geographic area so designated by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, the request shall
demonstrate, based on criteria established by such agency,
that there is a shortage of health care professionals able
to provide services in the appropriate medical specialty to
the patients who will be served by the alien.

clause (i) or (iii) of section 101(a)(15)(F) in order to pursue a course

ered to have violated such status, and the alien’s visa under section
101(a)(15)(F) shall be void, if the alien terminates or abandons
such course of study at such a school and undertakes a course of
study at a public elementary school, in a publicly funded adult edu-
cation program, in a publicly funded adult education language
training program, or at a public secondary school (unless the re-
quirements of paragraph (1)(B) are met).

MINORITY VIEWS
We first and foremost want to convey our deep appreciation to
all Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel for the crit-
ical work they do every day to protect our country. We recognize
our shared goals to make smart, cost-effective investments that
prioritize the DHS workforce as well as its versatile mission. While
we acknowledge that there are several bipartisan funding initia-
tives in this bill, unfortunately, we cannot support it. The bill
underinvests in critical missions that keep our communities safe
from growing national security threats and will ultimately increase
costs and burdens on State and local governments to respond to fu-
ture major disasters. Furthermore, it fails to hold the current ad-
ministration accountable and uphold core, constitutional protec-
tions in the Department’s execution of the laws it is entrusted to
enforce. We regret that this legislation reflects a missed oppor-
tunity to strike a balance in optimizing funding across all parts of
the DHS mission while upholding the ideals and values that make
America the greatest nation in the world.
There is no question that encounters at the border began to de-
cline at the start of fiscal year 2025. However, U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made a conscious choice under a
continuing resolution to ramp up detention space, well above the
levels that would be fiscally responsible, without clear justification
to the Committee. The current administration has made no secret
of their goals to deport one million individuals this calendar year,
and it appears they are willing to do so at any cost. While the bill
rewards poor financial management with even more investment in
for-profit detention centers with 50,000 detention beds, it neglects
to ensure commensurate independent oversight for this growth.
However, we are pleased the bill now includes Democratic provi-
sions that will prohibit the Department using funds to detain and
deport American citizens and reaffirm constitutional protections.
Such provisions would not need to be restated in normal times.
However, the current administration’s reckless approach to depor-
tation and reliance on private contractors requires these additions
to the bill.
The bill also embraces the elimination of longstanding programs
that provide legal pathways, such as preventing the use of country-
specific parole processes for certain nationals fleeing socialist dicta-
torships or gang rule from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela
or temporary protected status for individuals from Afghanistan,
Cameroon, and Honduras. In particular, the bill’s failure to extend
temporary protected status to Afghans who in some cases directly
assisted U.S. troops during the war there, is tantamount to a death
sentence for these individuals. Democrats attempted to include pro-
tections in the bill for these individuals and look forward to hope-
fully securing protections in a final bill.

The bill eliminates the Family Reunification Task Force in defi-
ance of the Ms. L et al. settlement despite Democratic efforts to re-
store them. Further, the bill guts funding for refugee and asylum
programs and eliminates the Citizenship and Integration Grant
Program which provides resources for those seeking to lawfully
pursue U.S. citizenship. Underfunding asylum operations will only
further overwhelm the immigration court backlog and ensure more
noncitizens are released into the interior with the threat of depor-
tation looming over them as they await the outcome of their case.
Additionally, despite the ever-increasing threats against Amer-
ican families, businesses, critical infrastructure, and national insti-
tutions, this bill weakens our national security and leaves Ameri-
cans vulnerable to attacks from our adversaries. Following the ad-
ministration’s June 21, 2025 bombing of Iran nuclear sites, the De-
partment issued a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin
confirming the likeliness of cyber-attacks against U.S. networks by
pro-Iranian hackers and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian
government. Unfortunately, this bill takes years of investment in
cybersecurity backwards through the adoption of $130 million in
DOGE staffing cuts to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency (CISA). The bill sets in motion a growing push to re-
quire State and local governments to detect and mitigate the next
ransomware attack and protect Americans’ sensitive data from
hackers with fewer CISA personnel to work alongside them. Com-
munities nationwide, which lack the funding and expertise to navi-
gate the next attack on hospitals, schools, water plants, financial
institutions, or telecommunications, will have to prepare to do so
on their own.
Further, in the face of worsening hurricanes, wildfires, and other
natural disasters, this bill doubles-down on the current administra-
tion’s effort to throw the responsibility of disaster recovery and
mitigation onto the States. The bill reduces Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) personnel by $93 million and ignores
a current $8 billion shortfall in the Disaster Relief Fund. Emer-
gency management, response, recovery, and mitigation is not
waste. Helping our neighbors and fellow Americans rebuild their
lives after disasters is not abuse. States simply don’t have the abil-
ity to rebuild after disasters on their own. We saw earlier this year
after our FEMA fiscal year 2026 budget hearing what the Depart-
ment does to leadership when they speak truth to power. While we
are disappointed that Democratic amendments to protect the elimi-
nation of FEMA and secure additional emergency supplemental
funds for the DRF ahead of hurricane season were not agreed to,
we look forward to continuing to work with the majority on the res-
toration of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities
funding that so many of our communities rely on to reduce their
vulnerability to future and repeat disasters.
Finally, this bill has been considered during a time of remark-
able upheaval for the Committee. Since taking office in January
2025, the executive branch has been engaged in a rampant, unlaw-
ful, and unconstitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular,
the Office of Management and Budget has been at the center of a
government-wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s
laws in its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the

agency’s legally-binding budget decisions (known as apportion-
ments) in contravention of an unambiguous and constitutionally
sound assertion of the Congress’s authority to impose transparency
requirements upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of almost all Democrats on the Com-
mittee, the debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just
as former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
William Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney
General with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any funds in the bill, so too does the Committee decide
the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the Com-
mittee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or upper
limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does so in
contrast to every other instance where it has included a specific
amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear intent to
be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
In closing, this bill falls far short of our responsibility to provide
for the safety and security of Americans. As the appropriations
process continues, we look forward to working with the majority
