ings given those terms in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.

(15 U.S.C. 632), unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy

I. PURPOSE AND BILL SUMMARY
On April 17, 2025, Rep. Van Duyne, along with Rep. King-Hinds,
introduced H.R. 2965, the Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act
of 2025. H.R. 2965 requires the Small Business Administration
(SBA) to ensure that for each fiscal year the cost to small busi-
nesses of the Administration’s rule making, including the modifica-
tion or repeal of a rule, is not greater than zero. The SBA Office
of Advocacy must also report the costs of regulations issued by
other federal agencies that have an impact on small businesses.
II. NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 2965 provides needed relief to Main Street as they recover
from four years of overregulation under the Biden-Harris Adminis-
tration. The bill ensures that the burdens of federal regulations on
small businesses are minimized, creating a government-wide report
detailing the regulatory costs on small businesses.
This bill codifies President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14192
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.’’1 Additionally, H.R.
2965 ensures that the SBA’s total cost of new regulations is not
more than zero dollars. Further, the bill directs the Small Business
Office of Advocacy to calculate the annual cost of rulemaking for
1Exec. Order No. 14,192, 90 F.R. 9065 (2025).

each Federal agency. Both of these legislative requirements codify
the requirements in EO 14192.

VI. SECTION-BY-SECTION OF H.R. 2965
Section 1—Short title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Regulatory Reduc-
tion Act of 2025.’’
Section 2—Small Business Administration rulemaking costs to
small business concerns
This section requires the Administrator of the SBA to ensure
that the small business regulatory budget for a fiscal year is not
greater than zero. Additionally, it requires a report on regulations
issued by other federal agencies that have an impact on small busi-
nesses.
Section 3—No additional funds
No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry
out H.R. 2965.
VII. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause 3(d)(1) of House rule XIII, the Committee
adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974. The Committee has requested but
not received from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
a cost estimate for the Committee’s provisions. Once available, the
cost estimate will be published in the Congressional Record.
VIII. NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY,
AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives and section 308(a)(I) of the Congressional Budg-
et Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following opinion and
estimate with respect to new budget authority, entitlement author-
ity, and tax expenditures. While the Committee has not received an
estimate of new budget authority contained in the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to Sec. 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee does not believe that there will be any additional costs at-
tributable to this legislation. H.R. 2965 does not direct new spend-
ing, but instead reallocates funding independently authorized and
appropriated.
IX. OVERSIGHT FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
In accordance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the over-
sight findings and recommendations of the Committee on Small
Business with respect to the subject matter contained in H.R. 2965
are incorporated into the descriptive portions of this report.
X. PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goals
and objectives of H.R. 2965 requires the SBA Office of Advocacy to

report to Congress on rules issued by Federal agencies that have
an impact on small businesses.
XI. STATEMENT OF DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, no provision of H.R. 2965 is known to be dupli-
cative of another Federal program, including any program that was
included in a report to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139 or the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic As-
sistance.
XII. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS,
AND LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House

tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives.

dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office

accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.

XVII. MINORITY VIEWS
A regulatory budget seeks to impose an arbitrary cap on total
regulatory costs. Any new rule that levies a cost could not be im-
plemented unless an existing rule with an equal dollar amount is
repealed. The first Trump Administration implemented a regu-
latory budget that allowed zero or negative new costs for regula-
tions.
Under H.R. 2965, the definition of a regulatory budget would
only include costs, not benefits. The practical effect would be SBA
would be inclined to either stop issuing rules or opt for rules that
impose the least costs on small businesses, despite the benefits.
Moreover, the agency could block new proposals enacted by Con-
gress if the Administrator determined that the rule would not fit
into its regulatory budget.
It is important to note regulations can also benefit small busi-
nesses. Oftentimes, the benefit of the regulation is greater than the
cost to small businesses. This bill would only look at one side of
the ledger. In a real-world situation, no small business would ever
make an investment in a new product or equipment if it looked
solely at the cost. For example, the Paycheck Protection Program
(PPP) would not have been implemented during the pandemic be-
cause of the costs associated with the program. Moreover, there is
no exception in this bill for national emergencies.
Committee Democrats offered two amendments to the bill. Rep.
Johnny Olszewski, Jr. (D–MD) offered an amendment to carve out
an exemption for rules related to workforce development and small
rural business programs. Mr. Olszewski shared he is happy to work
together to fix our regulatory system, however noting that the Coa-
lition of Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than 200 labor,
scientific research, faith, community health, and environmental
groups said the bill is unworkable, he offered the amendment to ex-
empt rules related to workforce development programs and those
that benefit rural small business owners. Republicans defeated this
amendment.
Similarly, Rep. Kelly Morrison (D–MN) offered an amendment to
carve our rules pertaining to veterans. The Ranking Member ex-
pressed support for the amendment stating, we owe a lot to our na-
tion’s veterans and cannot take a chance with the unintended con-
sequences a regulatory budget would have on them. Despite Demo-
crats support for our nation’s veterans, the Republicans defeated
this amendment.

In sum, Committee Democrats opposed the measure because it is
unworkable and would grind the legislative process to a halt.
