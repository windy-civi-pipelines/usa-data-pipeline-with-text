GENERAL STATEMENT AND SUMMARY
The Legislative Branch appropriations bill provides funding for
the Congress and for the agencies that serve the Congress. Mul-
tiple agencies funded through this bill provide oversight of execu-
tive branch agencies, including objective, nonpartisan, and timely
audits and analysis of Federal programs. The funding in this bill
also ensures that the public has permanent access to printed and
electronic information products of the Federal Government.
All accounts in the bill have been examined in detail to ensure
that the funding provided is appropriate for the agencies to carry
out their responsibilities and to continue to respond to Congress in
a timely and accurate manner. Details on the accounts, the funding
levels provided, and the Committee’s justification for the funding
levels are included in the explanatory statement.
Conforming to longstanding practice under which each body of
Congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the
other concurs without intervention, funds for neither the House of
Representatives nor House office buildings are included in the bill.
Similarly, the House will consider a Legislative Branch appropria-
tions bill that addresses House but not Senate funding.
The Committee recommends new budget (obligational) authority
of $4,973,758,000 for the legislative branch for fiscal year 2026, of
which $44,500,000 is designated as an emergency requirement by
Congress. This amount excludes House items as per normal pro-
tocol. This total is $256,955,000 above the fiscal year 2025 appro-
priation.
The bill includes $1,470,739,000 for the operations of the Senate,
which is $146,196,000 above the fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
The bill includes $698,224,000 for the Architect of the Capitol, ex-
cluding the House Office Buildings, to maintain, improve, and con-
struct buildings and facilities for the Congress. The recommenda-
tion for the Architect of the Capitol is $14,137,000 above the fiscal
year 2025 appropriation. The recommendation supports the day-to-
day operations of each jurisdiction and allows for the most critical
capital improvements across campus. The bill also includes
$855,100,000 for the Capitol Police; $811,894,000 for the Govern-
ment Accountability Office; $852,158,000 for the Library of Con-
gress; and $132,000,000 for the Government Publishing Office.
The Committee directs legislative branch departments and agen-
cies to ensure that all reports are completed in the timeframe
noted in each respective directive. All legislative branch depart-
ments and agencies are reminded that funding should be utilized
according to congressional intent and that reallocations or
repurposing of funds, whether within or above reprogramming
thresholds, should be done with the intent for the appropriation of
the specific funding in mind.

5
Reprogramming Guidelines.—The Committee expects all agencies
to notify the Committee of any significant departures from budget
plans presented to the Committee in any agency’s budget justifica-
tions. The Committee recommendation grants limited reprogram-
ming authorities to ensure that funds are devoted to the highest
priorities, particularly due to changes in circumstances. In par-
ticular, agencies funded through this bill are required to notify the
Committee prior to any reprogramming of funds in excess of the
lesser of 10 percent or $750,000 between programs, projects or ac-
tivities, or in excess of $750,000 between object classifications (ex-
cept for shifts within the pay categories, object class 11, 12, and 13
or as further specified in each agency’s respective section). This in-
cludes cumulative reprogrammings that together total at least
$750,000 from or to a particular program, activity, or object classi-
fication as well as reprogramming full time equivalents [FTE] or
funds to create new organizational entities within the agency or to
restructure entities that already exist.
In addition, the Committee must be notified of reprogramming
actions that involve less than the above-mentioned amounts if such
actions would have the effect of changing an agency’s funding re-
quirements in future years or if programs or projects specifically
cited in the Committee’ reports are affected.
Prior to initial obligation or reallocation of funds, all Congres-
sional reprogramming notifications shall, to the maximum extent
practicable, contain detailed information about the sources of the
funds and why such funds are no longer intended to be used as
previously justified. The Committee expects that the conditions as-
sociated with funding appropriated by this act shall be accom-
plished in the manner as directed in the report, consistent with
congressional intent.
Member Security.—The Committee recognizes the increasing
number of threats and directions of interest against Members of
Congress and their families and the importance of protecting Mem-
bers in Washington, D.C. and in their home states. It is essential
that every Member of Congress is able to fulfill their congressional
duties without concern for their personal safety and that of their
families and staff.
Over the past several fiscal years, the Committee has made sig-
nificant investments to enhance security for Members, their fami-
lies, D.C. and district staff, and visitors to the Capitol campus. The
Committee remains committed to providing the necessary resources
to ensure the ongoing safety of all Members and their families. To
that end, the Committee recommends providing emergency funding
to the Senate Sergeant at Arms and United States Capitol Police
to implement further security enhancements to address evolving
threats and risks. The Committee will continue to work on a bipar-
tisan basis with congressional leadership, the Senate Committee on
Rules and Administration, the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the
United States Capitol Police, on the best path forward to address
security concerns.
Full-Time Equivalents [FTE].—The Committee directs that budg-
et justifications sent to the Committee shall include a comparison
of FTE based on the number of FTE supported by the funding pro-
vided in the current enacted appropriations legislation and the

6
number of FTE that would be supported by the funding requested
for the following fiscal year.
Zero-Based Budgeting.—The Committee continues to direct all
legislative branch agencies to develop budget requests from a zero-
base. Budget justifications should provide sufficient detailed infor-
mation on all requested funding requirements to allow the Com-
mittee to make informed funding decisions.
Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act.—The Good Ac-
counting Obligation in Government Act, or GAO–IG Act (Public
Law 115–414) requires that each Federal agency, including the
agencies of the legislative branch, include an accounting of any
public recommendations by the Government Accountability Office
or the agency’s Office of Inspector General that have not yet been
implemented and the timeframe for implementation.
Each legislative branch agency is directed to continue to address
recommendations from oversight entities, such as the GAO and
OIGs, in a timely manner and to request resources, as appropriate,
to fully implement these recommendations. Legislative branch
agencies are directed to develop corrective action plans that include
timelines for completion of open recommendations, to include rea-
sons for the recommendation remaining open and the cost pro-
posals for fully implementing each unresolved oversight rec-
ommendation. It is expected that each agency in this bill include
such a report in its fiscal year 2027 congressional budget justifica-
tion.
Offices of Inspectors General [OIG] Budgets.—The Committee be-
lieves it is important to ensure independence between legislative
branch OIGs and their respective reporting agencies and expects a
separate section included in each agency’s fiscal year 2027 budget
justification reflecting a detailed budget request for the agency’s
OIG. These requests should be submitted without change by the
agency. Agencies are reminded that FTEs and operating funds pro-
vided to Office of Inspectors Generals in appropriation should be
provided as directed and funds should remain available to the OIG
throughout the entirety of the fiscal year. Additionally, the Com-
mittee directs each OIG to keep the Committee fully apprised of its
funding needs. The Committee also directs each agency to avoid
interfering with or requiring approval for such communications.
Congressional Requirements for Legislative Branch Cyber and
Physical Data Security to Assure Resilience.—The Committee di-
rects Legislative Branch agencies to continue to take proactive
steps to fully protect critical Information Technology [IT] infra-
structure, including prevention of cyberattacks, assuring secure
data storage, and ensuring continuity of government operations for
all Branch agencies. The Committee reiterates prior direction that
legislative branch agencies utilize computing and cloud facilities
designed for concurrent maintainability and consider geographic di-
versity in data center locations. The Committee directs each agency
to refine and improve their detailed implementation plans for ro-
bust, secure, and resilient data center infrastructure. Further,
agencies are required to provide cost estimates for full compliance
with the above directive. In addition, the Committee expects agen-
cies to continue to provide quarterly progress reports to the Com-
mittee.

7
Cybersecurity for the Legislative Branch.—Legislative branch
agencies are charged with combating cyber-attacks that could dis-
rupt Congress’ ability to perform its constitutional duties. Accord-
ingly, the legislative branch agencies, including the U.S. Senate,
must have the tools and resources necessary to defend our net-
works against sophisticated adversaries. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes funding requested by legislative branch
agencies in fiscal year 2026 to strengthen cyber defenses. Each leg-
islative branch agency shall continue to provide quarterly updates
to the Committee on Appropriation on the status of its cybersecu-
rity program, to include milestones, significant activities, chal-
lenges, and the status of the execution of funding provided for this
purpose.
Legislative Branch Support Agency Information Working
Group.—The Committee understands the importance of data access
to certain of the legislative branch agencies’ missions. Accordingly,
the Committee directs the Congressional Budget Office, the Library
of Congress, and the Government Accountability Office to continue
to provide a briefing on the efforts of the working group to identify
the challenges they face in obtaining timely, detailed, and sufficient
access to Federal agency information. The working group should
continue to develop options for ensuring that legislative branch
agencies have access to the information they need at the time, in
the formats and level of detail necessary for them to complete their
work. As a part of this effort, the working group should develop a
data map for how data is collaboratively stored, secured, utilized
and adapted by each receiving entity, to include any impacts from
the use or influence of artificial intelligence on this data. The task
force shall continue to meet to monitor the situation and make rec-
ommendations to the relevant committees, as appropriate.
Use of Government Vehicles.—Legislative branch agencies are re-
minded that Federal Government vehicles are to be utilized for offi-
cial government business only and are not to be used for general
personal use. In fiscal year 2023, all legislative branch agencies
were directed to implement policies regarding the acquisition and
use of Federal Government vehicles, including price limitations,
equipment installation, and lifecycle replacement procedures.
Further, all legislative branch agencies are required to maintain
internal controls over home-to-work vehicle programs where vehi-
cles are issued to employees for the purposes of responding to their
assignment to fulfill an official duty in a timely manner. These con-
trols are to include an annual recertification of home-to-work jus-
tifications for any vehicle assigned to agency personnel for this pur-
pose. This process is required to include the justification for the
issuance of the home-to-work vehicle, the estimated roundtrip mile-
age for the vehicle to and from the employee’s residence on a daily
basis, and the estimated cost to the agency resulting from the as-
signment of the vehicle.
Within 30 days of enactment of this act, legislative branch agen-
cies shall provide an updated detailed report to the Committee on
Appropriations on agency internal controls, policies and procedures
for the use of government vehicles, to include home-to-work jus-
tifications and current fleet inventories with appropriate justifica-
tions, as described above.

8
Single-Use Plastic.—The Committee continues to direct all agen-
cies and offices funded by this act with a food service provider to
reduce plastic waste. The AOC is expected to continue this effort,
including options for utilizing high content recycled products.
Child Care.—The Committee continues to support access to li-
censed and certified child care as a tool for recruiting and retaining
personnel within offices and committees of the Senate and other
legislative branch entities. The Committee also recognizes that on-
site child care centers are critical to the work-life balance of legisla-
tive branch personnel. The Committee recognizes that the child
care requirements of the legislative branch entities far exceeds the
capacity of established child care services within the branch and
will continue to work collaboratively with the Committee on Rules
and Administration on this issue.
Bicycle Access.—The Committee encourages the USCP, AOC, and
the Senate SAA to continue to work with the District of Columbia
Department of Transportation to determine if a protected bike lane
on Louisiana Avenue can be achieved.
Interfaith Space.—The Committee is supportive of working with
the Committee on Rules and Administration and the Architect of
the Capitol to consider potential locations for Interfaith Prayer
spaces for Senate staff and interns. Within 60 days of the issuance
of the report, the Committee will initiate discussions with the Com-
mittee on Rules and Administration on this effort.
Legislative Branch Agencies-Reporting.—The Committee directs
legislative branch agencies and departments to submit within 30
days of enactment of this act an annual operating plan for the exe-
cution of funds appropriated for its programs and quarterly execu-
tion reports thereafter that provide execution data against the an-
nual operating plan. These controls will allow the Committee to
conduct necessary oversight of the utilization of funding against
the implementation and continuance of programs and initiatives for
which appropriated funding was provided. These quarterly reports
should include information regarding deviations, transfers, or re-
programming of funds for activities other than those included in
the agencies annual operating plan.

Committee recommends an appropriation of $130,353,000 for fiscal
year 2026, which supports a staffing level of 1,050 FTEs. The rec-
ommendation includes funding to enhance the information tech-
nology operations and resiliency in the Senate; continue moderniza-
tion of congressional systems; and fully support the continued ini-
tiative to expand the Senate’s cybersecurity capabilities. The Com-
mittee expects to be updated regularly as the SAA develops its
strategic plan to modernize and harden the Senate’s cyber defense.
The Sergeant at Arms is the chief law enforcement officer, the chief
protocol officer, and an executive officer of the Senate.
To fulfill these responsibilities, the Sergeant at Arms operates
through four principal units:
—The Office of Security and Emergency Preparedness prepares
the Senate to respond to a full spectrum of emergencies that
may disrupt normal business operations. This preparation in-
cludes programs that support life safety, intelligence, security,
and continuity of operations policies and programs throughout
the U.S. Senate, including Senate home State offices, as well
as strategic and analytic assistance to the Sergeant at Arms in
her capacity as Chairman or Member of the Capitol Police
Board and Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the Senate.
—Capitol Operations is responsible for many of the services pro-
vided within the Capitol building that support the day-to-day
operation of the Senate. Services include Chamber operations
maintained by the Doorkeepers; official business visitor proc-
essing provided by the Senate Appointment Desks; as well as
credentialing and interfacing with the news media via the Sen-

14
ate Media Galleries. In addition, the Senate Recording Studio
provides audio and video services.
—The Operations Division provides an array of services to the
Senate community to include identification, transportation,
parking, and photographic services; printing, publishing,
graphic design, and framing services; and USPS mail screen-
ing, and mailing and package delivery services. Operations fur-
nishes and maintains the Senate side of the Capitol Building
and supports the maintenance of Senate State offices.
—The Office of the Chief Information Officer [OCIO] builds, oper-
ates, and supports the Senate’s information infrastructure. The
OCIO is responsible for information security, technology infu-
sion, telecommunications, helpdesk, IT systems to support Con-
tinuity of Operations and Continuity of Government, enterprise
computing systems, data networks, web services and hosting,
system development, and office equipment.
Executive and other offices provide general management, human
resource, financial, and training support to the Senate.

The Committee also directs the SAA to continue increasing its out-
reach efforts to offices to improve security coordination and emer-
gency preparedness, including creating better awareness of Sen-
ators’ activities off of the Capitol campus; educating and training
staff to identify and alert the SAA and the Capitol Police of events
or activities that may warrant a threat assessment; facilitating
threat assessments and security coordination with the USCP as
well as Federal, State, and local law enforcement, as appropriate;
and informing and updating Members and Senate staff on emer-
gency preparedness training and other resources available to them.

requested increase for SAA to expand resources, including adding
personnel, providing additional website services and supplementing
existing resources with new options, such as transcendental medi-
tation instruction, to meet increased demand and support the men-

15
tal and emotional health needs and well-being of the Senate com-
munity.
Office Cybersecurity.—The Committee expects SAA to utilize
funds provided for fiscal year 2026 to continue to conduct third-
party cybersecurity auditing services and resiliency assessments for

rity of office networks; provide enhanced cybersecurity training for
each Senate office; institute protections against insider threats; and

Congress (2025–2026).
Committee Intern Pay.—Senate committees have the authority
and sufficient resources needed to pay committee interns from
within funding made available to committees. The Committee reit-
erates that the significant increase provided to this account will
more than allow for committees to pay their interns if they so

additional funding for intern pay to include such an increase in its
budget request to the Committee on Rules and Administration of
the Senate, so that this Committee can fully consider the needs of
Senate committees under such budgetary advisement.

Secretary of the Senate without apportionment in the interest of fa-
cilitating financial management duties and restructuring that oc-
curs from time to time. The Committee expects notification in writ-
ing in a timely manner of any cumulative changes in excess of 10
percent to the funding levels between programs, projects, or activi-
ties. Typical expenditures of the Secretary of the Senate include:

The following table compares the fiscal year 2026 Committee rec-
ommendation for the component categories within this account to
the fiscal year 2025 enacted funding levels.
EXPENSES–OFFICE OF THE SERGEANT AT ARMS AND DOORKEEPER
Fiscal year 2025 Committee
Enacted recommendation
Office of Security and Emergency Preparedness ........................................................... $4,453,000 $14,511,000
Capitol Operations .......................................................................................................... 5,635,000 11,620,000
Operations ....................................................................................................................... 8,815,000 9,023,000

Grand Total........................................................................................................ 185,442,000 230,845,000
The Committee provides these funds to the Sergeant at Arms
without apportionment in the interest of facilitating financial man-
agement duties and restructuring that occurs from time to time.
The Committee expects to be notified in writing in a timely manner
of any cumulative changes in excess of 10 percent to the funding
levels between programs, projects, or activities.
Senator Security.—The Committee directs the Sergeant At Arms,
in coordination with USCP, to continue exploring all forms of ap-
propriate security measures including mutual aid, personal protec-
tion security, and commercially available technology solutions that
allow for a rapid law enforcement response both in and outside of
the National Capital Region. The Committee further directs the
SAA, in collaboration with the USCP, to utilize available resources
to promptly investigate, analyze and mitigate threats and direc-
tions of interest toward Members of Congress, their families and
staff.
Residential Security System Program.—The SAA shall continue
to update the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on
Rules and Administration of the Senate quarterly on the progress
of the implementation of the Residential Security System Program.
Hearing Room Audiovisual Equipment.—The Committee rec-
ommends $5,000,000 in no-year funding to partially or fully ren-
ovate two to four hearing rooms per year, as per the request. The
audiovisual equipment and systems in these hearing rooms has or
will soon exceed their useful life and must be replaced. The failure
of hearing room audiovisual systems has disrupted several high-
profile hearings in recent years, and represents a problem that will
only grow worse as the equipment and systems reach their useful
life. The Committee expects the SAA to continue working with the
Architect of the Capitol and the Committee on Appropriations and
the Committee on Rules and Administration to develop a replace-
ment plan to avoid equipment failure.
Captioning, Translation, and Transcription Services.—The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Senate, in coordination with the
Sergeant-at-Arms, to provide an update to the Committee within
60 days of enactment of the act on the ongoing efforts to increase
captioning and translation services for various operational func-
tions within the Senate, to include the use of emerging technologies
for this purpose. The joint report should also include efforts and op-
tions to increase classified transcription capacity.

21
Training to ‘‘Stop the Bleed’’.—For the past several years, the
SAA has offered Senate staff the opportunity to train in Tactical
Combat Casualty Care, also known as ‘‘Stop the Bleed’’ training,
which increases survivability from mass shootings and other cas-
ualty events causing life-threatening external bleeding. The Com-
mittee supports the SAA Office of Security, Emergency Prepared-
ness and Continuity’s continued utilization of ‘‘Stop the Bleed’’
training on the Capitol campus so that more Senate staff know how
to respond to and administer basic bleeding control techniques to
individuals with trauma if such a situation arises and for emer-
gency preparedness purposes.
Accessibility.—The Committee recognizes the importance for the
Senate to incorporate accessibility features for people with disabil-
ities into plans for new initiatives. Further, the Committee recog-
nizes that including accessibility features in new systems and proc-
esses, such as software, building designs, and security procedures,
at the start of such plans makes accessibility less expensive to
achieve. The Committee directs Senate entities contracting services
to, as feasible, build accessibility into their design and acquisition
processes.
Website Attachments.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of receiving letters and other appropriate documents from mem-
bers’ constituents, and directs the SAA to work with offices and
committees on additional enhancements necessary to ensure that
attachments can be made to submissions on Senate websites in a
manner that meets the needs of the Senate offices. The Committee
strongly encourages SAA to continue reviewing its policy con-
cerning the receipt of attachments from a Senate network cyberse-
curity perspective and to conduct focused discussions with Senate
offices to determine the specific needs of the Senate community re-
garding website attachments.
Cyber Tools.—The Committee directs the SAA to continue its
outreach to the Senate community on the requirements for cyber
tools and to provide an update within 90 days of enactment of this
act to the Committee on the SAA’s efforts to provide the Member
offices and committees use of cloud-based word processing and doc-
ument real-time collaboration tools in a SAA-hosted and CIO-oper-
ated data center.
IT Requirements for State Offices.—The Committee appreciates
the work of the SAA across the information technology platform. To
continue to stay abreast of these requirements, the SAA shall con-
duct an updated survey with personal State offices to validate the
IT requirements for each office. Based on the results of the survey,
the SAA shall provide an update to the Committee within 30 days
of enactment of the act on the SAA efforts to address the specific
findings from the survey.
Training for System Administrators.—The Committee notes that
the SAA Chief Information Officer [CIO] has worked to provide
Linked in Learning training for Senate offices’ and committees’ sys-
tem administrators and expects the CIO to continue exploring and
recommending training options for system administrators.
Cyber Care Education for Senators and Staff.—The Committee
recognizes the threat of hacking and cyberattacks on Senators and
staff on their official and personal devices and accounts. The SAA

22
is working to improve personal cybersecurity, cyber advisories, and
cybersecurity best practice documents tailored to such devices and
accounts, and should continue to educate members and staff on
such practices. In addition, the SAA shall, in coordination with this
Committee, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,
and Senate majority and minority leadership, continue to explore
ways-including the options presented in the bipartisan Senators’
Personal Cybersecurity Working Group’s report-in-which it may
better provide voluntary cybersecurity support to any Senator seek-
ing assistance with their personal devices or accounts under exist-
ing ethics, rules, appropriations, statutory, and civil law, including
whether investments in additional IT hardware and software, addi-
tional personnel, and additional guidelines are needed. The Com-
mittee also directs the SAA to provide increased training opportu-
nities so that members and staff traveling abroad are aware of
cyber threats and appropriate best practices to mitigate such
threats to their devices, and to brief this Committee on whether
members and staff are utilizing these awareness tools.
Enterprise Software.—Employees of the Senate use and rely upon
software approved and managed by the SAA to carry out their re-
sponsibilities on behalf of the American people. While SAA appro-
priately focuses on the safety, security and integrity of these soft-
ware applications and license agreements, the SAA is encouraged
to make available software that is best suited to the requirements
of its end users. The Committee directs the SAA to update the
Committee on the SAA’s continuing efforts to provide software and
systems that meet the identified needs of the Senate community.
Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Correspondence.—The SAA is
directed to brief the Committee on Appropriations within 60 days
of enactment of this act on its ongoing efforts to support Senate of-
fices and committees in identifying artificial intelligence prolifera-
tion in constituent correspondence and its impact on the legislative
work of the Senate.
Sergeant-at-Arms Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Fund.—The SAA shall provide continuing updates to the Com-
mittee on the utilization of the Sergeant at Arms Business Con-
tinuity and Disaster Recovery [BCDR] fund
McCain-Mansfield Fellowship Program.—The Committee con-
tinues to support the SAA’s efforts to implement the McCain-Mans-
field Fellowship Program. The SAA shall update the Committee
within 90 days of the enactment of the act on the SAA’s progress
in implementing the fellowship program.
Collaborative Co-Development of Legislative Branch Tech-
nology.—The SAA is encouraged to work more closely with the
House of Representatives on the co-development of future mod-
ernization technology tools to increase congressional capacity, con-
tinuity, and customer service to the American people. The SAA
shall update the Committee within 30 days of enactment of the act
on its efforts to develop a memorandum of understanding with the
House of Representatives on the shared technology development
and enhancement.
Enhancing Effectiveness of Constituent Casework Functionality.—
The Committee directs the SAA to provide an update to the Com-
mittee within 60 days of enactment of this act on the ongoing ef-

23
forts to support personal office casework operations, such as the
sharing of best practices, training, and technology support. Fur-
ther, the SAA should include in the update recommendations for
the SAA to provide additional support for casework operations,
such as the development of methods to track aggregate casework
data, the development of caseworker toolkits, the establishment of
a central hub to provide caseworker resources and liaison assist-
ance between agencies and personal offices.

Senate Employees’ Child Care Center.—Under current law, Con-
gress may only provide funding for employee benefits and travel ex-
penses for employee training activities for the Senate Employees’
Child Care Center [SECCC], and the reimbursement of salaries for
the executive director and assistant director of the center, which
are provided for and fully funded in this act. However, funds for
all other employees’ salaries and operational expenses are paid by
the Center’s operating budget and cannot be supplemented with

24
appropriated funds. In agreeing to provide salary reimbursements
for the SECCC executive director and the assistant director, the
Committee recognizes the importance of access to high quality, af-
fordable child care for recruitment and retention of U.S. Senate
employees and supports the ability of the Center to employ high
caliber faculty, maintain its commitment to early childhood edu-
cation, and continue to serve the growing number of Senate em-
ployees who require child care for their infant to pre-school chil-
dren. Furthermore, the Committee understands these payments
will free up the Center’s operating budget to provide salary in-
creases for all day care faculty, allowing the Center to pay its staff
competitive salaries comparable with the House of Representatives
Child Care Center.

cover the costs of Senate resolutions and public laws that authorize

pensation).—This amount is for reimbursements made to the U.S.
Department of Labor for total benefits and other payments made
on behalf of Senate employees from the employees’ compensation
fund. Payments are authorized to be made from expired balances,
a practice that is consistent with the other agencies of the legisla-
tive branch.
Reception of Foreign Dignitaries.—The Committee on Foreign Re-
lations is authorized to expend, and not to exceed, $30,000 each fis-
cal year to receive foreign dignitaries under the authority of Senate
Resolution 247, agreed to February 7, 1962, as amended.
Foreign Travel: Members and Employees.—Senate Resolution

ommended provides for the expenses of the majority and minority
conference committees.

recommended provides for the expenses of the majority and minor-
ity policy committees.

tionery and office supplies for the President of the Senate, con-

25
ference committees of the Senate, Office of the Chaplain, and the
Senate Chamber.

cellular telephone and mobile data devices and services for the Of-
fice of the Vice President, Secretary for the Majority, Secretary for
the Minority, Office of the Chaplain, Majority Leader, Minority
Leader, Majority Whip, and Minority Whip.

SENATORS’ OFFICIAL PERSONNEL AND OFFICE EXPENSE ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $607,400,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 645,431,000
The Committee recommends an appropriation for fiscal year
2026 of $645,431,000 for the Senators’ Official Personnel and Office
Expense Account [SOPOEA]. The recommendation is an increase of
$38,031,000 above the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. Of the fund-
ing provided, $32,272,000 is available until September 30, 2028.
This account funds salaries and benefits of Senators’ staffs as well
as the office expense allowance for Senators’ offices. The SOPOEA
is comprised of three components. Two of these are for salaries of
personnel in Senators’ offices. The allowance for administrative and
clerical assistance is based on the population of States, beginning
with States with a population of fewer than five million people to
States with a population of 28 million or more. The table illustrates
the allowances per population category and the States that fall into
those categories. The estimate for fiscal year 2026 totals
$378,603,336. The second component of the salaries allowance is
for legislative assistance to Senators, as authorized by Public Law
95–94 as amended. This allowance provides funding for three posi-
tions in each Senator’s office for a total of $677,100 per office, or
$67,710,000 for all 100 Senators. The third component of the
SOPOEA account is for official office expenses and totals
$20,128,950. Each Senator’s office is allocated an amount for office
expenses, as displayed in the following table. It should be noted
that the amounts provided for the various components of the
SOPOEA are interchangeable. Amounts provided for salaries may
be used for expenses, and vice versa, subject to regulations set by
the Committee on Rules and Administration with respect to official
mail. It should also be noted that the figures in the following table
are preliminary, and that official notification of member budgets is
issued by the Financial Clerk of the Senate after enactment of this
bill.
The following table illustrates the several components of the
SOPOEA.

According to the most recent employment data compiled by the
Secretary of the Senate, as of May 31, 2025, there were 4,298 indi-

28
viduals employed in Senators’ offices throughout the United States
and covered by this appropriation. In addition to providing funds
for compensation of employees within Senators’ offices, this appro-
priation also provides for agency contributions for those employees;
that is, the Senate’s share, as an employer, of the various employee
benefit programs for which Senate employees are eligible. These
payments are mandatory, and fluctuate according to the programs
in which employees are enrolled, the level of compensation, and the
degree of participation. Budget requests for this account prepared
by the Financial Clerk must be based on both experience and eval-
uation of trends. The fiscal year 2026 funding level for this account
anticipates $165,252,000 in agency contribution costs. The amount
recommended by the Committee for the SOPOEA is less than
would be required to cover all obligations that could be incurred
under the authorized allowances for all Senators. The Committee
is able to recommend an appropriation of a lesser amount than po-
tentially necessary because Senators typically do not obligate funds
up to the absolute ceiling of their respective allowances. However,
spending patterns have been changing and the Committee’s rec-
ommended increase is necessary to bring the appropriation more in
line with the statutorily authorized level.
Senate Intern Compensation.—The Committee continues to be-
lieve that Senate internships should be available to the broadest
possible pool of candidates who have the ability and interest to
serve. Unfortunately, unpaid internships exclude those who cannot
independently afford to work without pay, hindering students’ fu-
ture career opportunities and making it more difficult for Senators
to attract and hire the most qualified interns, regardless of socio-
economic status. Providing interns financial compensation provides
an avenue for more students to have the opportunity to serve their
country and gain experience toward a career in public service. In
addition to funding allocated in the table above for Senators’ office
allowances and for agency contribution costs, the bill includes
$7,000,000 for the sole purpose of providing financial compensation
to interns. This will allow offices to continue to diversify their in-
tern hires and, if an office chooses to do so, provide stipends to bet-
ter help interns with travel and housing costs. Any intern com-
pensation funding that remains unspent by any office will be re-
turned to the Treasury in accordance with section 101 of the bill.
Such funding is directed to be allocated among Senators’ offices in
relative proportion to funds allocated for each office’s administra-
tive and clerical assistance allowance for fiscal year 2026 shown in
the table above, which reflect natural variables including State
populations, with a small additional amount for non-contiguous
States. On average, each office will be allocated an estimated
$70,000 for intern compensation.

JOINT ITEMS
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,283,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,283,000
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,283,000 for
the Joint Economic Committee [JEC]. The recommendation is equal
to the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. The Joint Economic Com-
mittee was created by the Employment Act of 1946 (Public Law
79–304). The primary tasks of the JEC are to review economic con-
ditions and to recommend improvements in economic policy. The
JEC performs research and economic analysis, and monitors and
analyzes current economic, financial, and employment conditions.
JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,554,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,960,620
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $13,960,620 for
salaries and expenses of the Joint Committee on Taxation. The rec-
ommendation is $406,620 above the fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
The Joint Committee on Taxation is established under the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986 to:
—investigate the operation and effects of internal revenue taxes
and the administration of such taxes;
—investigate measures and methods for the simplification of
such taxes;
—make reports to the House Committee on Ways and Means and
the Senate Committee on Finance (or to the House and the
Senate) on the results of such investigations and studies and
to make recommendations; and
—review any proposed refund or credit of income or estate and
gift taxes, or certain other taxes set forth in Code section 6405
in excess of $2,000,000. In addition to these functions that are
specified in the Internal Revenue Code, the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–344) requires the Joint
Committee to provide revenue estimates for all tax legislation
considered by either the House of Representatives or the Sen-

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,292,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,854,000
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,854,000 for
the Office of the Attending Physician. The recommendation is

31
$562,000 above the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. The Office was
first established by House Resolution 253, adopted December 5,
1928.
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ACCESSIBILITY SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,766,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,818,980
The Committee recommends $1,818,980 for the Office of Congres-
sional Accessibility Services [OCAS]. This office is a successor to
the Special Services Office following enactment of the Capitol Vis-
itor Center Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–437). The OCAS provides
and coordinates accessibility services for individuals with disabil-
ities, including Members of Congress, staff, and visitors to the U.S.
Capitol complex. These services include sign language interpreting,
adaptive tours, and wheelchair loans. OCAS also provides informa-
tion regarding accessibility for individuals with disabilities, as well
as related training and staff development to Members of Congress
and employees of the Senate and House of Representatives.
CAPITOL POLICE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $806,473,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 855,100,000
The United States Capitol Police [USCP] is charged with the pro-
tection of the United States Congress, its legislative processes,
Members, employees, visitors, and facilities within the U.S. Capitol
complex from crime, disruption, or terrorism so that the Congress
may fulfill its constitutional responsibilities in a safe and open en-
vironment. The Committee recommends $855,100,000 for the
USCP. The recommendation is $48,627,000 above the fiscal year
2025 appropriation. While unable to meet the Department’s request
level, the Committee recommends funding to support the most crit-
ical mission requirements, including expanded Member protection,
technology investments, and continued hiring of sworn personnel.
Risk-Based Protections for Members of Congress.—Threats
against Members of Congress have increased significantly since cal-
endar year 2021. In light of this, the Committee continues to find
that ensuring the continuity of government must include protecting
the overall security of Members of Congress. The recommendation
provides $2,000,000 for the Department to continue to provide
Member security outside of the Capitol campus in the National
Capital Region [NCR], as warranted by risk-based analyses. The
Committee expects the USCP to continue working closely with the
Sergeants at Arms and law enforcement partners in the NCR, as
well as educating Member offices, on the USCP strategy for Mem-
bers’ protection within the NCR while off the Capitol Grounds, per
the December 2018 report detailing the Department’s plans to en-
hance off-campus Member security in the NCR.
Enhanced Member Protection.—The Committee continues to rec-
ognize the expanding mission requirements for the United States
Capitol Police in the area of Member protection. The Department
has been provided significant funding to support complex enhanced
Member protection initiatives over the last few fiscal years. The
Department shall provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on

32
Appropriations on the Department’s progress in implementing
these member protection initiatives. The Committee directs the
USCP, in collaboration with the SAA, to utilize available resources
to promptly investigate, analyze and mitigate threats and direc-
tions of interest toward Members of Congress, their families and
staff. These briefings should include recommendations, as nec-
essary based on threats and risks, for the enhancement of the De-
partment’s efforts in this area, as well as recommended funding
strategies for addressing the newly identified and evolving require-
ments.
Mutual Aid Reimbursements.—The Committee recognizes that
the Department views mutual aid as a force multiplier that allows
for additional support and coverage in Washington, D.C. and across
the country. The USCP is directed to continue to expand the use
of other Federal, State and local law enforcement entities through
reimbursable mutual aid agreements and to ensure a collaborative
two-way sharing of critical information to meet USCP mission re-
quirements.
Capitol Police Board.—The Committee reminds the Department
of the Capitol Police Board’s role to direct, oversee, and support the
Department in its mission, as well as to further coordination
among Congress, the Capitol Police, the Sergeants at Arms, and
the Architect of the Capitol. In particular, the Committee empha-
sizes the importance of the Board’s review, and approval, of the
Capitol Police’s annual budget request as part of its process to
make informed, strategic funding decisions. The Committee directs
the USCP to provide the Board the level of detail and time nec-
essary to properly evaluate the budget request prior to its submis-
sion to the Committee.
Contract Security Officers.—The Committee directs the USCP to
provide an updated version of report requested under this heading
in Senate Report 118–60.
Uniform Procurement.—The Department is directed to update
the Committee on the status of current uniform procurement and
availability for USCP officers.
Civilian Staffing.—The Committee supports the Department’s
authorized number of civilians, however the Committee’s rec-
ommendation includes a reduction to the funding request as the
Department’s projections for fiscal year 2025 civilian hiring are
below the authorized and appropriated levels. The Committee be-
lieves it will continue to be difficult to hire the requested civilians
for fiscal year 2026.
SALARIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $603,627,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 653,422,000
The amount provided covers salaries, benefits, overtime costs and
salaries related incentives programs to recruit and retain highly
qualified personnel. The Committee recommends $653,422,000 for
USCP salaries, which is $49,795,000 above the fiscal year 2025 ap-
propriation.
USCP Office of Inspector General.—The Committee notes that as
the USCP has grown over the last several fiscal years, so has the

33
workload of the USCP OIG. To support the oversight of an expand-
ing agency, the Committee includes funds to support not less than
19 FTEs within the USCP OIG and includes no less than $897,000
in operating funds from within the USCP’s annual appropriation.
Overtime.—The Committee recommends no more than
$84,767,000 for overtime in fiscal year 2026 without notification.
This provides for approximately 996,613 hours of additional duty.
The Committee notes that overtime pay is a standard practice law
enforcement entities utilize to respond to unscheduled and unan-
ticipated events. However, understanding the impact of overtime
on the onboard personnel, the Committee finds that keeping over-
time pay at a minimum should continue to be a goal of the USCP.
The Committee directs the USCP to continue its efforts to better
track and manage overtime pay in order to keep overtime costs to
a minimum. Further, the Committee directs the USCP to provide
a detailed report to the Committee within 60 days of issuance of
this report on the Department’s efforts to manage the use of over-
time on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the USCP should provide
a written report within 60 days of issuance of this report that pro-
vides detailed and specific recommendations for addressing the
USCP’s requests for implementation of 1811 classification status,
the implementation of availability pay and inclusion of overtime
within retirement calculation methodology. The report should
speak to the costs and benefits of implementing these recommenda-
tions, including the expected operational mission benefits and the
costs of implementation and out-year fiscal impacts from each.
Prior to making any sworn staffing classification adjustments that
may impact salaries and overtime, the USCP should consult with
the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice,
the Congressional Budget Office and other relevant Federal entities
to develop the report and input from these agencies should be in-
cluded in the report’s details.
The recommendation does not include funds for USCP overtime
for requirements associated with major construction projects under-
taken by the Architect of the Capitol [AOC], as those funds are pro-
vided to the AOC as part of the overall project costs for those major
projects and are paid to the USCP on a reimbursable basis. The
Committee expects the USCP to operate within the designated
funding level for requirements associated with each project. The
Committee directs the USCP to provide for any additional require-
ment costs beyond that allocation.
USCP Overtime and Staffing Report.—The Committee directs the
USCP to continue to submit to the Committee quarterly updates as
required under this heading in Senate Report 118–60. The Com-
mittee expects the reports to include relevant observations from
and actions taken by the newly created staffing office and to in-
clude updates on the Department’s implementation of management
controls over the impact of overtime on employees reaching the
maximum annual payable rate. Further, the updates should in-
clude details on the Department’s efforts to align sworn personnel
to balance the use of overtime within the total required staffing re-
quirements to meet mission.

GENERAL EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $202,846,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 201,678,000
Expenses include office supplies and equipment, communications,
motor vehicles, uniforms and equipment, investigations, training,
and miscellaneous items. The Committee recommends
$201,678,000 for general expenses, which is $1,168,000 below the
fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
Stop the Bleed Training.—The Committee appreciates the
USCP’s commitment to conducting ‘‘Stop the Bleed’’ training for its
sworn workforce. The USCP is encouraged to continue to provide
this training to all new sworn personnel upon appointment to the
Department.
Wellness Programs for Law Enforcement.—The Committee appre-
ciates the efforts undertaken by the USCP to develop and imple-
ment a holistic wellness and resiliency program for its workforce,
including the Howard C. ‘Howie’ Liebengood Center for Wellness.
The Committee requests that the Department continue to provide
bi-annual updates on the wellness program and its accessibility to
USCP sworn and civilian personnel.

OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE RIGHTS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,150,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,396,400
The Congressional Accountability Act [CAA] (Public Law 104–1)
established an independent Office of Congressional Workplace
Rights [OCWR], formerly the Office of Compliance, to apply the
rights and protections of the following labor and employment stat-
utes to covered employees within the Legislative Branch: the Fair
Labor Standards Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety
and Health Act, the Federal Service Labor Management Relations
Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Worker Adjust-
ment and Retraining Notification Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights
Act. That act was amended in 1998 to apply the Veterans Employ-
ment Opportunities Act and in 2008 to apply the Genetic Informa-
tion and Nondiscrimination Act. On December 21, 2018, the Con-
gressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act (Public Law 115–
397) was signed into law expanding the Office’s duties and respon-
sibilities, as well as the number of employees covered by the CAA
and the CAA Reform Act [CAARA]. The Office of Congressional
Workplace Rights administers and ensures the integrity of the neu-
tral dispute resolution process concerning claims that arise under

35
the CAA and CAARA. The Office also carries out an education and
training program for congressional Members, employing offices and
congressional employees to assist them in understanding their
rights and responsibilities under the CAA and CAARA. The Com-
mittee recommends an appropriation of $8,396,400 for the salaries
and expenses of the OCWR, which is $246,400 above the fiscal year
2025 enacted level. Of such amount, $2,500,000 shall remain avail-
able until September 30, 2027.

viding to the Congress objective, nonpartisan, and timely analyses
to aid in economic and budgetary decisions on the wide array of

and estimates required for the congressional budget process. The
Committee recommends an appropriation of $71,400,000 for the
CBO. The recommendation is $1,400,000 above the fiscal year 2025
appropriation.
Promoting Timeliness and Transparency.—The Congressional
Budget Office provides Congress with budgetary and economic
analysis that is important to the legislative process and can have
significant policy implications. The Committee acknowledges that
CBO has undertaken efforts to improve and promote transparency
of the agency’s modeling and cost estimates process. The Com-
mittee continues to encourage CBO to strengthen its efforts on
transparency to respect the interest of Congress and to maintain
the agency’s professional independence. As with prior year budget
submissions, the Committee expects CBO to include in its fiscal
year 2027 budget request details about the agency’s ongoing and
future efforts to implement the multi-year plan to increase its ca-
pacity to make CBO’s work as transparent and responsive as pos-
sible.

The Office of the Architect of the Capitol [AOC] is responsible to
the United States Congress for the maintenance, operation, devel-
opment, and preservation of 16.5 million square feet of buildings
and more than 450 acres of land throughout the Capitol complex.
This includes the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center, the House
and Senate office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings, the
U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power Plant, and other facilities.
The AOC also provides professional expertise with regard to the
preservation of architectural and artistic elements entrusted to its

tion, and maintenance of the facilities and grounds. The Committee
recommends a funding level of $698,224,000 for activities of the Ar-
chitect of the Capitol, excluding the House Office Buildings ac-
count. The recommendation is $14,137,000 above the fiscal year

U.S.C. 1343 and, as such, limited by the statutory controls over
motor vehicle acquisition and use, including price limitation, equip-
ment, and replacement of motor vehicles, and per regulations set
forth by the Government Services Administration [GSA]. The Com-
mittee directs the AOC to adhere to GSA regulations on official use
of agency vehicles to perform AOC’s mission, including proper iden-
tification of the vehicle as Federal Government-issued and -owned,
as well as home-to-work policies.
Hygiene Products.—The Committee appreciates the AOC’s efforts
to ensure menstrual hygiene products are available at no cost with-
in restroom facilities throughout the Capitol Complex buildings and

mittee recommends an appropriation of $156,676,000 for capital
construction and operations. The recommendation is $4,169,000
above the fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
Efficiencies Evaluation.—The Committee is encouraged by recent
developments at the AOC and commends the efforts of the leader-
ship team to improve agency operations and project management.
In furtherance of these efforts, the Committee recommends the
AOC undertake a systematic evaluation of all operations and
projects to ensure the highest standards of industry best practices
for quality, efficiency, and financial responsibility are being met.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $85,207,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 77,630,000
The Committee recommends $77,630,000 for Capitol Police
Buildings, Grounds, and Security, of which $12,000,000 shall re-
main available until September 30, 2030. The recommendation is
$7,577,000 below the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. This funding
will continue to support the maintenance, care and operations of
buildings, grounds and security enhancements of the USCP and
AOC security and resilience/ continuity programs. As noted in the
fiscal year 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026 budget submissions of the

41
Capitol Police, the Department’s growth since January 6, 2021, and
ongoing threats translates into the need for adequate facilities and
infrastructure support from within the AOC’s annual Capitol Police
Buildings, Grounds, and Security appropriation. The operational,
administrative, training, and logistical support needs of a Federal
law enforcement agency of the size and complexity of the USCP
has and will continue to have significant fiscal impacts for the
AOC. The funds provided by the Committee for core security needs
will support the USCP mission and its efforts to transform the
manner and means by which the Department performs its mission.
The Committee is concerned by the extended timelines and in-
creased costs for addressing critical initiatives. The AOC is directed
to implement controls and management focus over these initiatives.
Further, the AOC should address any internal impediments, such
as non-cleared acquisition processes or disjointed project manage-
ment that may be impacting the ability to address projects in a
timely manner.
The Committee directs the AOC to submit a detailed project sta-
tus report within 30 days of the issuance of this statement and
every 30 days thereafter. The detailed project status reports may
be provided in a classified setting and should provide specific
timelines and details for the execution of the various projects.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
SEC. 120. This provision prohibits payment of bonuses to contrac-
tors behind schedule or over budget.
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
The Library of Congress [LOC] is the largest library in the world
and an unmatched source of information for Congress, the Amer-
ican people, and beyond. The LOC acquires, registers, preserves,
protects, and makes accessible the creative record of the United
States. It is the main research arm of the United States Congress,
and its resources and services are used by millions of people every
month. Its mission is to support the Congress in fulfilling its con-
stitutional duties and to further the progress of knowledge and cre-
ativity for the benefit of the American people. The LOC’s collections
include more than 178 million items (books, photographs, maps,
sound recordings, films, sheet music, legal materials) in 470 lan-
guages. Digital technology is transforming the way the LOC does
its work, and the institution plays an important leadership role in
superimposing digital library collections and services on those that
are analog based. The Library of Congress houses the Congres-
sional Research Service, U.S. Copyright Office, National Library
Service for the Blind and Print Disabled, Law Library of Congress,
and numerous other programs and services. The Committee rec-
ommends a total of $852,158,000 for the Library of Congress, which

43
is equal to the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. In addition to the ap-
propriation, the Library estimates receipts of $44,849,000, funds
from gifts and trusts totaling $175,059,000, and reimbursable and
revolving funds totaling $342,285,000. Total funds available to sup-
port Library operations, including the Architect of the Capitol’s Li-
brary Buildings and Grounds account, are expected to be approxi-
mately $905,297,000 in fiscal year 2026 under the Committee rec-
ommendation.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $592,411,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 592,411,000
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $592,411,000 for
salaries and expenses of the Library of Congress. The recommenda-
tion is equal to the fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
IT Continuous development.—The Committee maintains invest-
ment in the IT continuous development initiative at the Library
and directs the Library to brief the Committee regularly on these
efforts.
American Folklife Center-Appalachian Culture and Traditions.—
The LOC is directed to provide a report to the Committee within
30 days of enactment of the act on its continued efforts to preserve
Appalachian culture and traditions through the American Folklife
Center programs and initiatives.
Veterans History Project.—The Committee continues to support
the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project [VHP]. VHP is
a critically important initiative designed to oversee a nationwide ef-
fort to build an archive of oral histories, from World War I through
current conflicts, by collecting, preserving, and making available
the personal stories of American war veterans and the civilian
workers who support them. The VHP collection includes submis-
sions from every State and is the largest oral history project in the
United States. The LOC shall provide a report to the Committee
within 30 days of enactment of the act on the ongoing work of the
VHP.
Teaching with Primary Sources.—The Committee provides con-
tinued funding for the Library’s Teaching with Primary Sources
program [TPS], a teacher training initiative that encourages edu-
cators to incorporate the Library’s online primary sources into
school curricula. The TPS program achieves this by making grants
funding available to a broad array of eligible organizations in every
State in order to develop innovative strategies, tools, and materials
for meaningful teaching and learning experiences using primary
source material from LOC collections, to include activities focused
on the importance of the various languages that helped to form the
foundational development of the United States. These activities
should include, but are not limited, the influence of the Spanish
language in various States’ governing constitutional practices. The
Committee is aware of the important role that colleges, univer-
sities, and other educational institutions and foundations have held
in developing and expanding the scope and reach of the TPS and
encourages the Library’s efforts to develop and implement the
Lewis-Houghton civics education grants initiative. The Committee
believes that competitive, merit-based grants should be awarded

44
through the TPS Consortium of partner organizations, so that
grant recipients benefit from the experiences of consortium mem-
bers. The LOC shall provide a report annually on the implementa-
tion of the various components of the TPS program.
National Film and Sound Recording Preservation Programs.—
The Committee recognizes the important work of the National Film
Preservation Program and the National Sound Recording Preserva-
tion Program, including the federally chartered National Film and
National Recording Preservation Foundations [Foundations]. Con-
sistent with the authorizing statute, the Foundations utilize both
public and private matching funds to provide grants to a wide
array of educational and non-profit organizations that help pre-
serve historical and cultural artifacts that would otherwise dis-
appear or be destroyed over time. Given that these programs were
reauthorized under the Library of Congress Sound Recording and
Film Preservation Programs Reauthorization Act of 2016 (Public
Law 114–217), the Committee expects that the Library will con-
tinue to provide support to these programs to emphasize their im-
portance.
Congress.gov Update Study.—The Committee recognizes that
Congress.gov is an important tool for Members, staff, and the pub-
lic to follow and understand the congressional process. The Com-
mittee appreciates the Library’s continuing efforts to date to im-
prove Congress.gov and the ongoing efforts to enhance the capabili-
ties of Congress.gov. The Committee requests that the Library pro-
vide regular updates to the congressional community and the pub-
lic on the ongoing efforts to enhance Congress.gov.
The Committee understands that the study identified potential
challenges for further enhancements. The Committee directs the
Library to brief the Committees on Appropriations and the Senate
Committee on Rules and Administration on any continuing chal-
lenges and recommend solutions within 90 days of enactment of
this act.
Library of Congress Annual Public Forum.—The Committee is
aware of the tremendous value the Library of Congress’s public fo-
rums are for Congress, stakeholders, and the public. The Com-
mittee also understands that users of the Library’s legislative infor-
mation services have suggestions regarding ways in which those
services could be improved or expanded, and the Committee would
like to encourage the continuance of a more structured process for
receiving and considering such suggestions, such as the public fo-
rums held in previous years. Such a process should also recognize
some of the limits on the Library’s ability to implement improve-
ments and expansions of these services, however. For example,
much of the information presented on the Congress.gov website is
not generated or controlled by the Library but rather comes from
other sources-particularly various offices of the House of Represent-
atives and the Senate and the Government Publishing Office-and
expanding or changing the content of Congress.gov will often re-
quire those sources to do something new or different. Further, some
improvements and expansions would require commitment of sub-
stantial time and resources by offices both within and outside the
Library that already have a heavy IT workload.

45
To facilitate public input into the Library’s legislative informa-
tion services and how they could be improved, the Committee di-
rects the Library of Congress to hold an annual public forum and
to regularly present at the Congressional Data Task Force public
meetings. The Library should invite a broad range of potentially in-
terested parties to participate, such as academics, advocacy, jour-
nalists and public interest organizations, research institutions, li-
braries, and publishers of legislative information. The Library
should also invite and encourage participation from representatives
of Legislative Branch stakeholders such as the Clerk of the House,
the Secretary of the Senate, the Senate and House Sergeants-at-
Arms and the Government Publishing Office.
Following each annual forum, the Library shall continue to pre-
pare a report, to be submitted to the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees, to relevant authorizing committees and officers
of the House and Senate, and to be made publicly available on the
Library’s website. The report should summarize the comments and
suggestions made, indicate which could be implemented by the Li-
brary itself and which would require action by other entities,
roughly estimate the cost and effort needed (where possible), and
provide the Library’s evaluation and recommendations for further
action. The Library is authorized to discuss its recommendations
with the public.
Access to Appropriations Data.—The Committee realizes the com-
plexity of presenting annual and supplemental appropriations data
in a comprehensive manner in similar formats for public access.
The Committee directs the Library to provide a detailed update
within 45 days of the issuance of this report on various options for
providing appropriations data for public access; the challenges to
doing so in a consistent manner; and the resources that would be
required to implement the requirement.
Surplus Books.—The Committee remains committed to the Sur-
plus Book Program and recommends an appropriation of $150,000
for this purpose.
Data Storage and Migration Methods Initiative.—The Committee
supports the Library of Congress’ ongoing work to optimize its
large-scale data storage infrastructure and explore promising new
technical solutions for long-term preservation of digital collections.
The Committee encourages the Library to continue to explore this
initiative.
Office of Inspector General.—The LOC Office of Inspector General
is provided funding to support no less than 14 FTE and $4,500,000
in operating funding for fiscal year 2026 from within the LOC’s an-
nual appropriation. The authority of the LOC Inspector General ex-
tends fully and completely to all entities within the LOC. All enti-
ties with the LOC will comply with all requests for assistance and
information necessary to facilitate the work of the inspector gen-
eral. Further, all entities within the LOC shall prioritize the reso-
lution of open recommendations from the LOC Office of Inspector
General and shall identify for the Committee on Appropriations the
reasons why the full implementation of the recommendation cannot
or should not be achieved.

46
COPYRIGHT OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $57,537,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 57,537,000
The United States Copyright Office plays an important role in
our Nation’s intellectual property system. Copyright law is the
foundation for the creation and dissemination of American artistic
works, leading to substantial economic and cultural benefits. The
Copyright Office serves multiple central roles in the copyright sys-
tem, overseeing the registration of copyrighted works, admin-
istering the copyright law, and providing counsel to Congress on
copyright policy. The Committee recommends the direct appropria-
tion of $57,537,000 for the Copyright Office, and approves authority
to spend receipts of $44,849,000, for a total of $102,386,000 in fis-
cal year 2026. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2025
appropriation.
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $136,080,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 136,080,000
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $136,080,000 for
the Congressional Research Service [CRS]. The recommendation is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
Congressional Research Service Modernization.—The Committee
recognizes the tremendous value that CRS has added to Congress
by providing objective, authoritative, nonpartisan, and confidential
research and analysis on the breadth of policy issues considered
during each legislative session since its inception in 1914. The
Committee continues to support modernization of CRS mission-spe-
cific information systems to increase efficiency of the office while
protecting confidentiality of congressional data. An important part
of this modernization is the enhancement of the timeliness and
transparency of the CRS. The Committee directs the Library of
Congress and the CRS to provide quarterly updates on these ef-
forts, to include benchmarks for reaching these expected outcomes.
Science and Technology Research Capacity.—The Committee con-
tinues to support CRS’s efforts to increase the depth and breadth
of its capacity to provide research and policy analysis on current
and emerging legislative issues related to science and technology
[S&T] and Federal uses and oversight of S&T. The Committee en-
courages CRS to continue developing this capacity, as rec-
ommended in the National Academy of Public Administration study
directed in conference report H.R. 115–929. This added expertise
will allow CRS to meet the expanding requirements of Congress for
timely, complex, and multidisciplinary analysis of policy issues re-
lated to these rapidly changing technologies, the role of the Federal
Government in oversight of such technologies, and the effects of
Federal S&T policies across all sectors. The Committee directs the
CRS to partner with the Government Accountability Office to maxi-
mize the legislative branch capabilities in this area. The Com-

47
mittee also encourages CRS to increase outreach efforts to make
Members and congressional staff more aware of the resources it
provides related to S&T policy analysis, including on current and
emerging S&T issues Congress is examining. The CRS shall pro-
vide a briefing to the Committee within 60 days of enactment of
this act on its continued progress to expand the CRS’ capacity.
Expansion of Big Data Analytics Capacity.—The Committee con-
tinues to have interest in CRS’s ability to analyze and create fore-
cast models using big data sets. The Committee directs the CRS to
provide an update within 60 days of the issuance of this report to
the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Rules and
Administration of the Senate on its progress in this area.
Augmenting Existing Data Analysis Capacity.—The Committee
continues to encourage CRS to expand its big data analytics capac-
ity.
Outreach to Congress.—The Committee recognizes the ongoing ef-
forts of the Library of Congress to improve the tools available to
the Congress in carrying out its work, to include Congress.gov.
Based on feedback received from the congressional community, it
appears that outreach to Congress on all of the tools available to
Congress needs to be improved. The Committee directs the Library
of Congress to enhance its outreach efforts to the entire congres-
sional community through various means that highlight the spe-
cific tools and capabilities of systems, collections, data, and tech-
nology available to the Congress in performing its constitutional re-
sponsibilities. The Library of Congress should begin this outreach
upon the issuance of this report and report to the Committee quar-
terly on its specific efforts to improve congressional awareness of
available Library of Congress resources, to include, but not limited
to appropriations data, constituent services/casework contact mate-
rials, big data analytics, and Congressional Research Service mate-
rials and subject matter expertise.
NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE BLIND AND PRINT DISABLED
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $66,130,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 66,130,000
This appropriation supports a national reading program for eligi-
ble residents of the United States and U.S. citizens living overseas
who are blind or print disabled. Books and magazines in braille
and various recorded formats are produced by the National Library
Service for the Blind and Print Disabled [NLS] for distribution
through a network of State and locally supported libraries. At
present, 55 regional libraries in 49 States, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands house and circulate books
and magazines to eligible readers. Twenty-eight subregional librar-
ies in 10 States and Guam assist at the local public library level.
In addition, 15 Advisory and Outreach Centers assist regional li-
braries in provision of services. Fifty-three of the regional libraries
and three separate cooperating agencies distribute sound repro-
ducers. Two multi-State centers, under contract to the NLS, store
and distribute books and other materials in their geographical re-
gion. The program supports a readership of approximately 300,000.

48
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $66,130,000 for
salaries and expenses for NLS. The recommendation is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
The Committee continues its full support for the work of the NLS
in providing high-level services to the constituency it serves.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
Section 130 limits to $332,285,000 the amount that may be obli-
gated during fiscal year 2025 from various reimbursements and re-
volving funds available to the Library of Congress.
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE
The U.S. Government Publishing Office [GPO] is the Federal
Government’s primary centralized resource for gathering, cata-
loging, producing, providing, and preserving published information
in all its forms. By law and tradition, the GPO’s mission is to pro-
vide expert publishing and printing services to all three branches
of Government; to provide, in partnership with Federal depository
libraries, permanent public access to the printed and electronic in-
formation products of all three branches of the Federal Govern-
ment; and to sell copies of authentic printed and electronic docu-
ments and other government information products to the public.
GPO’s core mission dates to 1813 when Congress determined that
information regarding the work of the Federal Government should
be available to all Americans. Over 200 years later, GPO’s mission
remains unchanged. However, the means for producing and distrib-
uting that information has transformed dramatically with the ad-
vent of the digital revolution. Today, GPO provides free online pub-
lic access to more than 1.5 million searchable titles, including the
Budget of the U.S. Government, the Code of Federal Regulations,
the Congressional Record, and congressional bills, hearings, and re-
ports. GPO also provides access to Government information in dig-
ital format through apps, eBooks, and related technologies. Since
2009, GPO has experienced more than 1.5 billion digital retrievals
from its Federal Digital System, and in February 2019 GPO intro-
duced the next generation of its digital information system,
govinfo.gov, symbolizing the evolution of how Americans access
Government information in the digital era.
GPO Printing Modernization.—The Committee continues its in-
terest in the pace of modernization at GPO, to include the adoption
of commercial, off-the-shelf technology which may present advan-
tages in operational and fiscal efficiency. The Committee directs
GPO, within 90 days of enactment of this act, to submit to this
Committee a detailed report on the agency’s current print prac-
tices; how GPO continues to enable agencies to use color, cameras,
modern interfaces and software; and other existing solutions and
technology to improve the agencies communications with taxpayers,
beneficiaries, veterans and citizens.
Office of Inspector General.—The GPO Office of Inspector Gen-
eral is provided funding to support no less than 25 FTE and
$7,000,000 in operating funds for fiscal year 2026 from within the
GPO’s annual appropriation. The GPO shall prioritize the resolu-
tion of open recommendations from the GPO Office of Inspector

49
General and shall identify for the Committee on Appropriations the
reasons why the full implementation of the recommendation cannot
or should not be achieved.
CONGRESSIONAL PUBLISHING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $83,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 80,000,000
The appropriation for Congressional Publishing supports trans-
parency of the congressional process by funding digital and print
publication of congressional proceedings, including the Congres-
sional Record, bills, amendments, Committee reports, and hearing
transcripts. This appropriation also supports the direct publication
and printing needs of Congress. The Committee recommends
$80,000,000 for congressional publishing. The recommendation is
$3,000,000 below the fiscal year 2025 appropriation.
PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS OF THE OFFICE OF
SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $37,388,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 42,475,000
This appropriation provides for salaries and expenses associated
with the distribution of electronic and printed Government docu-
ments to depository and international exchange libraries, the cata-
loging and indexing of Government publications, and the distribu-
tion of electronic and printed publications authorized by law at the
request of Members of Congress and other Government agencies.
The Committee recommends $42,475,000 for salaries and expenses
of the Public Information Programs of the Office of the Super-
intendent of Documents. The recommendation is $5,087,000 above
the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. The Committee supports GPO’s
introduction of its next generation information system, govinfo.gov,
as well as the agency’s other information technology systems, given
that these efforts continue to reduce costs.
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE BUSINESS OPERATIONS
REVOLVING FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $11,611,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 9,525,000
The Committee recommends $9,525,000 for the GPO Business
Operations Revolving Fund. The recommendation is $2,086,000
below the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. The Committee supports
continued investment in the Revolving Fund as the most efficient
solution to both cutting costs and ensuring efficient online access
to government documents. One reason GPO is able to meet the in-
creased work demands and continually reduce costs is through its
constant focus on capital investments to modernize information
systems, production equipment, and major facility repairs.

50
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $811,894,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 811,894,000
The U.S. Government Accountability Office [GAO] is an inde-
pendent nonpartisan agency that was established by the Budget
and Accounting Act of 1921 (Public Law 67–13) to act as an auditor
for Congress and investigate how the Federal Government spends
taxpayer dollars.
The function of GAO includes auditing agency operations to de-
termine whether Federal funds are being spent efficiently and ef-
fectively; investigating allegations of illegal and improper activities;
reporting on how well Government programs and policies are meet-
ing their objectives; performing policy analyses and outlining op-
tions for congressional consideration; and issuing legal decisions
and opinions, such as bid protest rulings and reports on agency
rules.
The Committee recommends funding of $811,894,000 for salaries
and expenses of the GAO, of which $5,000,000 shall remain avail-
able until expended. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year
2025 appropriation.
Additionally, $35,424,000 is authorized in offsetting collections
derived from rent receipts and reimbursements for conducting fi-
nancial audits of Government corporations, for a total of
$847,318,000.
GAO Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics Team.—The
Committee commends the efforts of GAO’s STAA team and encour-
ages STAA to continue providing Congress with unbiased explana-
tory data, as well as assessments of future science and technology
issues relevant to Congress. The Committee also supports the ongo-
ing adaptation of the STAA team to meet congressional needs, to
include the impacts of artificial intelligence. At the previous direc-
tion of the Committee, the STAA is providing Congress with contin-
ued technology assessments, technical assistance, and reports in
the areas of oversight of Federal technology and science programs,
as well as best practices in engineering sciences and cybersecurity.
The Committee requests that the STAA develop a report for the
Committee on the use of artificial intelligence across the legislative
branch, to include adoption of best practices, security practices and
lessons learned.
Congressionally Directed Spending and Community Project Fund-
ing Transparency and Accountability.—The Committee directs the
GAO to again undertake an audit of Congressionally Directed
Spending [CDS] and Community Project Funding [CPF] contained
in fiscal year 2026 appropriations legislation. The audit shall in-
clude the same characteristics GAO adhered to in its fiscal year
2022, 2023 and 2024 CDS and CPF directive after consulting with
the Committees on Appropriations. In conducting its audit, GAO
shall provide periodic briefings and reports based on available data
to the Committees.
Unimplemented Government Accountability Office Recommenda-
tions.—Within 180 days of enactment of this act, GAO shall pub-

51
lish on its website and provide to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of the Senate and House of Representatives, the Senate
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the
House Oversight Committee a report estimating the financial costs
of unimplemented GAO recommendations.
Appropriations and Budget Law.—The Committee acknowledges
that GAO legal decisions, including those related to the Congres-
sional Review Act, are often fact specific and time consuming. The
Committee commends the improvements made by the GAO Appro-
priations Law Group to increase resources dedicated to supporting
Congress’ oversight role. The Committee continues the directives
contained in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law
117–328. Further, the GAO is directed to brief the Committee on
its continued efforts to expeditiously respond to Congressional Re-
view Act requests, including the number of requests received annu-
ally and the average response time to those requests, within 90
days of enactment of this act.
GAO Study on Agency Responsiveness to Congressional Casework
Requests.—The Committee requests the Government Accountability
Office review the current status of the responsiveness of executive
branch agencies to Member office inquiries on behalf of constitu-
ents seeking assistance. The GAO should update the Committee on
its efforts within 90 days of enactment of this act. Among other
things, the update should describe findings and make recommenda-
tions for minimum response standards, as well as standard agency
personnel and technology needs to provide accurate and timely re-
sponses to Congressional inquiries.
Government Accountability Office Reports as Text Files.—The
Government Accountability Office is encouraged to improve con-
gressional and public access to the information contained in its re-
ports and testimony by publishing that information both as PDF
and in a text format, ideally a structured or semi-structured text
format with appropriate metadata. In light of the large corpus of
documents, GAO should start with the documents it publishes in
fiscal year 2026 and as practicable, work to make more of the back-
documents publicly available online in PDF and in structured data
text format (such as TXT, HTML, XML] with accompanying
metadata.
GAO Office of Inspector General.—The Committee recommends
no less than $2,400,000 in operating funds and no fewer than 20
FTE within the GAO OIG. The Committee believes that independ-
ence between legislative branch OIGs and their respective report-
ing agencies is important and reminds the GAO that the budget
and FTE amounts in the report are expected to be provided as a
floor for the OIG to conduct its oversight mission.
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE FOR INTERNATIONAL
LEADERSHIP FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,000,000
The Committee recommends $6,000,000 as a payment to the
Congressional Office for International Leadership [COIL] Fund,
which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 appropriation. Founded in

52
1999 by Congress, COIL, formerly the Open World Leadership Cen-
ter, serves as the dedicated support agency for congressional legis-
lative diplomacy efforts. Legislative diplomacy is crucial in pro-
viding critical advice and consultation to nascent parliamentary
bodies trying to build nonpartisan resources to improve legislative
output. The Office provides this support for Members of Congress
by encouraging both inter-parliamentary and judicial contacts, and
by conducting exchanges that establish lasting professional rela-
tionships between emerging leaders and their U.S. counterparts.
The Office also supports Congress in achieving outcomes that in-
clude the further promotion of common values, particularly
strengthening international diplomatic relations between legisla-
tive bodies, and lasting partnerships between Members of Congress
and foreign parliamentarians.
The Office maintains a vast network of more than 31,000 alumni
in strategic countries across Eurasia and the Indo Pacific. These
alumni are placed at all levels of their societies, including regional
and Federal elected positions and ministries. Their presence pro-
vides assurances that U.S. interests are understood and considered.
Ukraine.—The Committee continues to be deeply troubled by the
Russian invasion of Ukraine and supports COIL’s efforts to rein-
state programming in Ukraine, as possible. The Committee further
urges COIL’s engagement with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine to
maintain democratic advancement throughout wartime.
Expansion of Program to Other Countries.—The Committee con-
tinues to request that COIL keeps the Committee apprised of any
new developments on expanding programming to include other re-
gions and countries that may be of strategic necessity to the United
States.
JOHN C. STENNIS CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE TRAINING
AND DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $430,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 430,000
The John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training and De-
velopment was created by Congress in 1988. The mandate of the
