COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
infiltrated American K–12 schools through grants, sister school
partnerships, and programs sponsored by Confucius Classrooms,
which are trojan horses for Chinese propaganda.
CHINA’S ACTIVITY IN U.S. K–12 SCHOOLS
The Chinese government’s effort to infiltrate with American
schools is one facet of the CCP’s broader soft-power strategy to in-
fluence policy in nations throughout the world. The United States
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that ex-
panding Confucius Classrooms in the United States has been a top
priority for the Chinese government.1 Many K–12 schools have ac-
cepted CCP-linked grants, which come with perks including fully
funded teacher exchanges, Chinese language programs, and oppor-
tunities for American students to learn in China.2

Confucius Classrooms are smaller-scale, K–12 versions of Confu-
cius Institutes that the CCP has pushed for on U.S. college cam-
puses. Confucius Institutes are established as partnerships be-
tween a host institution, a Chinese partner (usually a Chinese uni-
versity), and a Chinese government agency. China’s Ministry of
Education Office of Chinese Language Council International funds
each Confucius Institute, often at around $100,000 per year, and
asks host institutions to match those funds with its own contribu-
tions.
This Confucius Institute funding comes with strings attached
that compromise academic freedom. The Chinese government ap-
proves teachers, events, and speakers and requires teachers to sign
contracts pledging they will not injure the national interests of
China. The government’s control over the Institute is highlighted
by the contracts that make clear that Chinese directors or teachers
will be terminated if they ‘‘violate Chinese laws’’ or ‘‘engage in ac-
tivities detrimental to national interests’’ and states that they must
‘‘conscientiously safeguard national interests.’’3
Many K–12 Confucius Classrooms developed as offshoots of uni-
versity-based Confucius Institutes. China has strategically de-
ployed and rapidly expanded their Confucius Classrooms, going
from very few in 2008 to more than a thousand worldwide by 2017.
More than 500 American K–12 schools have hosted Confucius
Classrooms, aided in part by the Asia Society, an American non-
profit that previously ran a network of 100 Confucius Classrooms
before they ended the partnership in 2021.4 A Parents Defending
Education report tracked Chinese affiliation in 143 schools across
34 states—with at least seven still active as of publication.5
OTHER COUNTRIES’ INFLUENCE IN U.S. K–12 SCHOOLS
While it appears that no other country has a program similar in
scope and size to the CCP’s propaganda campaign in American
schools, other countries have also invested in language and cultural
educational programs in American K–12 schools.
One notable example is Qatar. The Qatar Foundation, along with
its subsidiaries like Qatar Foundation International and the Qatar
National Research Fund, have been actively involved in influencing
American K–12 education through financial partnerships with indi-
vidual schools.6 From 2009 to 2017, the Qatar Foundation allocated
$30.6 million to various schools across 12 U.S. states. The funds
are predominantly directed towards facilitating Arabic language
programs, and they cover expenses for teacher education, mate-
rials, and salaries. These contributions have taken various forms,
from direct funds to professional development initiatives, such as
teacher councils and language conferences. Additionally, there are
instances of school districts, like the Tucson Unified School District

and New Haven Public Schools, receiving substantial grants over
multiple years.7
Other countries have also made notable donations to U.S. K–12
schools. After the May 8, 2024, subcommittee hearing on anti-
semitism in K–12 schools, then-New York City Public Schools
Chancellor David Banks informed Committee staff that the Italian-
American Committee on Education, which is connected to the
Italian government, contributed $257,000 to New York City Public
Schools in 2021–24. Chancellor Banks also reported that the Con-
sulate General of the Republic of Korea in New York contributed
$16,000 to support Korean instruction and programming in New
York City Public Schools. It is unclear the extent to which these
foreign ties had been publicized prior to the Committee’s request
for information.8
It is imperative that American students are not subject to mali-
cious foreign influence in their schools. Parents are crucial guard-
ians when it comes to ensuring that their students are taught accu-
rate content. To that end, the TRACE Act requires that, as a condi-
tion of receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Edu-
cation Act, a local educational agency ensures that public schools
provide each parent the right to review any curricular material
provided or purchased with funds from a foreign government or for-
eign entity of concern. The bill also guarantees parents the right
to know how many personnel at their child’s school are com-
pensated by foreign sources and about any donations or financial
transactions between the school and a foreign government or for-
eign entity of concern.
CONCLUSION
It is unacceptable that foreign adversaries such as the CCP are
attempting to influence U.S. K–12 schools. Congress should take
immediate action to ensure that students are not being indoctri-
nated with communist propaganda. Congress should also take ac-
tion to ensure that parents have the right to review and be aware
of all curricula purchased or provided by a foreign country. H.R.
1049 will help ensure that the Chinese government does not take
advantage of local school districts and that parents have the right
to be fully informed of what is happening in their child’s schools.

sures that parents are aware of foreign influence in their child’s
public school. H.R. 1049 applies to schools receiving funds under
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and therefore
does not apply to the Legislative Branch.

Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee adopts as its own the cost esti-
mate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1049 is to ensure that
public elementary and secondary schools provide parents with in-
formation related to foreign influence in their child’s school.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 1049 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF
THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 1049: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1049 would require that local education agencies ensure
that each school served by the agency provide information about
funding from or agreements with foreign governments or related
entities to parents upon request as a condition of receiving funds
from the Department of Education.
CBO expects that local education agencies would comply with
these new requirements; thus, enacting the bill would not affect
their eligibility to receive federal funds. Based on the costs of simi-
lar activities, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost
the Department of Education less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Garrett Quenneville.
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1049. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
In compliance with clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,
as reported, are shown as follows (new matter is printed in italics
and existing law in which no change is proposed is shown in
roman):

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1049, the Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Con-
tributions to Education Act, requires local educational agencies
(LEAs) and individual schools to provide parents with the oppor-
tunity to: (1) access curriculum and staff professional development
materials provided by a government of a foreign country (foreign
government) or foreign entity of concern; (2) know how many school
staff have been paid, in whole or part, by a foreign government or
foreign entity of concern; and (3) know of any donation to, written
agreement with, or financial transaction between the school or LEA
and a foreign government or foreign entity of concern and related
details.1 The Majority claims the bill ‘‘solidifies the rights of par-
ents to know how foreign funding is impacting their child’s class-
room and adds a layer of deterrence to keep foreign nations from
reaching America’s youth.’’2 Yet, the Majority has not proven any
local school system has allowed foreign influence to exist in ele-
mentary and secondary public schools. Instead, the bill would feed
into baseless claims encompassed in the Majority’s self-created cul-
ture wars and raises a number of administrative questions and
concerns for public schools.
SUMMARY OF CONCERNS
H.R. 1049 Claims to provide parents with rights, but in reality feeds
into culture wars
While the Majority claims a desire to provide parents with infor-
mation on foreign governments and foreign entities of concern al-
legedly impacting their students’ education, H.R. 1049 is another
attempt to feed into culture wars. Throughout the last Congress,
and continuing into this Congress, the Majority has used its agen-
da-setting power to consider a series of bills that provide solutions
to non-existent problems to advance divisive narratives. Last Con-
gress, the House passed H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act,
which the Majority claimed would ‘‘put in place concrete legal pro-
tections that will ensure parents always have a seat at the table
when it comes to their child’s education.’’3 But, as Committee
Democrats pointed out in the Minority Views accompanying that
bill to the House floor, the bill was ‘‘largely duplicative of current
law, lacks clarity in how its provisions will actually address stu-

dents well-being, and stands as an example of the type federal
overreach Congressional Republicans have long claimed would
harm children, teachers and schools.’’4 Similarly, it is worth noting
that pursuant to a law that already applies to entities that receive
U.S. Department of Education funding and awards, parents cur-
rently have the right to inspect instructional materials pertaining
to their child’s classes.5 But H.R. 1049 permits parents to inspect
and copy—at unlimited cost to the school—any instructional mate-
rials or professional development materials that the school pur-
chased or obtained using funds from a foreign government or for-
eign entity of concern.6 The costs (in staff time and money) associ-
ated with complying with transparency requests are documented
challenges schools face; systemic foreign influence is not.7
Foreign influence has not posed a threat to K–12 classrooms
The Majority claims H.R. 1049 is necessary because ‘‘foreign ad-
versaries . . . are systematically and aggressively attempting to in-
fluence our nation’s elementary and secondary schools.’’8 But the
most common example of foreign influence in schools that the Ma-
jority cites are Confucius Classrooms.
Chinese influence has not posed a threat to elementary and sec-
ondary classrooms
Confucius Classrooms, which are affiliated with Confucious Insti-
tutes, are centers for Chinese culture and language established at
public and private elementary and secondary schools—either to bol-
ster a Chinese language program already at the school or to start
a new one. Many countries around the world lack quality Chinese
language and culture resources and Confucious Institutes and
Classrooms provide those resources for free.9 However, over nearly
five years, the number of U.S. Confucius Classrooms has dropped
from more than 500 to currently no more than 16.10 Experts have
summed up the current state of these programs, saying ‘‘[t]he
harsh reality is that Confucius Institutes/Confucius Classrooms
stepped up to fulfill a need that governments were not—and they
were happy to accept a ‘freebie,’. . . . Now that Confucius Insti-

6This significantly broadens the information that parents may access beyond information per-
taining to their own child under GEPA. In addition, even with that expansion, as written, the
bill does not include the right to inspect and copy donated materials for which funds were not
used.

tutes have been tainted by wider distaste and suspicion of the Chi-
nese government, this ‘freebie’ now has a cost.’’11
Parents Defending Education (PDE), a right-wing non-profit or-
ganization, published a report in July 2023 entitled, ‘‘Little Red
Classrooms: China’s Infiltration of American K–12 Schools.’’ The
report cites the mere presence of Confucius Institutes, Confucius
Classrooms, and related ‘‘programming’’ (including local program-
ming that may have pre-dated the establishment of a Confucius
Classroom), sometimes in areas near U.S. military bases, to allege
the Classrooms exert undue Chinese influence in America.12 De-
spite the claims in the report, Committee Democratic staff have
been unable to locate credible evidence to support either the claims
made by the Majority or PDE that there is inappropriate and
undue foreign influence in our nation’s K–12 public schools cur-
rently as a result of Confucius Classrooms. In 2019, the Senate
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’
(HSGAC) Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hear-
ing entitled ‘‘China’s Impact on the U.S. Education System’’. The
hearing was held the day after the HSGAC released a bipartisan
staff report with the same title.13 While the staff report made rec-
ommendations that schools should ensure that Chinese partnership
organization’s ‘‘vetting, screening and interview processes are
aligned with their own hiring protocols and procedures’’14 and that
‘‘the State Department should demand reciprocal and fair treat-
ments of its diplomats and employees in China.’’15 The Committee
did not find security risks or curriculum vulnerability, as claimed
by the Majority.
H.R. 1049 Includes severe penalties for public school systems
Failure to comply with the requirements of H.R. 1049 could
cause public school systems and states to lose funding from the El-
ementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), including the Title
I–A program. Specifically, the bill conditions receipt of ESEA pro-
gram funds on meeting the requirements of the bill. Each LEA is
responsible for making sure that each school in the LEA posts or
disseminates information about these rights at the beginning of
every school year. It also requires state educational agencies
(SEAs) to notify LEAs of these requirements at the beginning of
every school year. By conditioning ESEA funds to LEAs and SEAs
on meeting the requirements in the bill, H.R. 1049 contains severe
penalties for districts and states that fail to implement the require-
ments of the bill correctly, whether intentional or accidental.
H.R. 1049 Raises significant administrative concerns for public
schools

they seek to follow the law. With respect to staff compensation, it

is unclear whether the bill only applies to staff compensation that
is provided by the school using funds the school received from a for-
eign government or foreign entity of concern or if it applies, for in-
stance, to a volunteer compensated directly by a foreign govern-
ment or foreign entity of concern without a school’s knowledge.
Further, while the obligation to provide information about dona-
tions, agreements, or financial transactions rests with the school,
schools are often not aware of donations, agreements, or financial
transactions made at the LEA level, and the bill does not require
LEAs to share that information with schools.
Additionally, the bill does not provide a clear definition for ‘‘for-
eign country.’’ This sets a dangerous precedent by leaving it to
LEAs and schools to decide what constitutes a foreign country and
inviting them to engage in international diplomacy. It is also un-
clear in what instances an LEA or school will need to determine
whether there is any involvement by a foreign government or a
‘‘foreign entity of concern’’. The bill is also silent as to how to make
such a determination, or how to assess whether any entity the LEA
or school works with—U.S. or otherwise—has substantial oper-
ations in another country. Learning how to assess and make these
determinations and ensure that anyone authorized to spend money
is aware of the requirements in the bill will require significant
training, professional development, and cost. Moreover, it is un-
clear whether every contract (new and existing) for food, tutoring,
textbooks, janitorial services, trash collection, recycling, etc. would
need to undergo such examination. The bill is also not specific
about whether such an examination to ensure compliance would
need to focus on each individual employee or only key decision-
makers at the entity providing services.
During the markup for the bill Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–
VA) asked for clarification on what a ‘‘foreign entity of concern’’ is,
citing the bill incorporates by reference the definition of the term
from the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation
Act.16 Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R–PA) responded that ‘‘foreign entity
of concern’’ meant ‘‘Communist China’’,17 however the Research
and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act includes a
much more expansive definition, that itself cross-references numer-
ous other criminal and national security statutes.18 Rep. Scott (D–

VA) went on to highlight the difficulties schools may have com-
plying, since the definition in the bill text expands well beyond
China.
Finally, H.R. 1049 will likely have a chilling effect on SEAs,
LEAs, and schools engaging in international and cultural exchange
opportunities because they often require some coordination with
foreign governments (through U.S. consulates). Statements made
at markup lead us to wonder if the chilling effect on engaging with
foreign entities, however benign, is part of the purpose of the legis-
lation. During the markup of H.R. 1049, when faced with questions
on the difficulty schools would have complying with this bill, Rep.
Mackenzie said:
‘‘I think the easiest and fastest way to comply with this
legislation is to not accept funds from communist China.
It’s very simple. If you’re not accepting funds from an enti-
ty like that, you won’t have any compliance costs because
then parents will have the transparency that will be
brought about by this act. They will not ever find that
there was any money being given to a school district to in-
fluence the curriculum or the teaching that is going on in
a classroom, and it’ll be very simple to reply from the
school district, just saying we have not received those
funds. Very simple, very easy, straightforward piece of leg-
islation that increases transparency and also again then
will help parents be involved in their student’s education.’’
H.R. 1049’s requirements related to disclosing information on do-
nations, agreements, and financial transactions in the bill are not
limited to ‘‘Communist China’’ or ‘‘foreign influence’’. Everyday
commonplace business that a school may engage with a vendor
could easily be implicated by H.R. 1049. When faced with questions
regarding compliance, Committee Republicans suggested the easi-
est way to comply is to not engage in the underlying practice. This
suggests that if H.R. 1049 became law, we would likely see a gen-
eral disincentive among schools to contract with, or accept dona-
tions from anyone who looks or sounds ‘‘foreign’’, for fear of losing
ESEA funds.
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENT OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1049
Recognizing the administrative burden schools will face, Ranking
Member Scott put forward an amendment to provide funds to as-
sist schools, LEAs, and SEAs with compliance costs. Significant ef-
fort may need to be expended to investigate existing and new con-
tracts, to determine whether existing or potential business partners
are foreign governments or ‘‘foreign entities of concern’’, to create
and maintain systems to keep track of all the new information and
respond to inquiries and to train staff in each school on the ways
to report to be in compliance with the bill. This amendment author-
izes $300 million for fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent fiscal
year, providing on average approximately $3,000 to every public
school in America to assist with coming into compliance with H.R.

Section 19:
1049.19 Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on a
party-line vote.
Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) put forward an
amendment designed to ensure the Department of Education, and
no other agency, is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of
this legislation. Over the past several weeks, President Trump has
suggested he will have a plan soon to eliminate the Department of
Education, calling into question how this bill would be adminis-
tered. Yet H.R. 1069 specifically calls for funds that are adminis-
tered by the Department of Education to be withheld if schools do
not comply. Therefore, the Bonamici amendment sought to ensure
that the Department be the sole agency empowered to enforce the
bill. However, Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on
a party-line vote.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1049 is another solution in search of a problem. While the
Majority claims that some foreign countries seek to influence our
nation’s students, there is no credible evidence proving such a
claim. Yet, they use the bill to feed into baseless arguments that
parents do not have rights, claims we all know are not substan-
tiated under current law. The bill raises a number of administra-
tive questions and concerns for public schools and in practice will
result in many schools discontinuing perfectly safe and legal inter-
national engagements. For the reasons stated above, we urge the
House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 1049.

(2023), https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_216.10.asp. Three hundred million
dollars would provide $3,000 per year to each of those schools to offset the costs of compliance.
In reality, the administrative burden this bill poses could easily require a full time administra-
tive staff person at each school.

Second Session—Hearings
On May 8, 2024, the Committee’s Subcommittee on Early Child-
hood, Elementary, and Secondary Education held a hearing on
‘‘Confronting Pervasive Antisemitism in K–12 Schools.’’ The pur-
pose of the hearing was to discuss the proliferation of antisemitism
in K–12 schools. During the hearing, then-Committee Chairwoman
Virginia Foxx (R–NC) asked New York City Chancellor David
Banks if foreign governments donate significant funding to NYC
Public Schools. Chancellor Banks stated that the Qatar Foundation
did donate, and he followed up after the hearing to confirm that
the Italian government and the Consulate General of the Republic
of Korea also contributed funding to NYC Public Schools’ K–12
schools. Testifying before the Subcommittee were Mr. David Banks,

COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
infiltrated American K–12 schools through grants, sister school
partnerships, and programs sponsored by Confucius Classrooms,
which are trojan horses for Chinese propaganda.
CHINA’S ACTIVITY IN U.S. K–12 SCHOOLS
The Chinese government’s effort to infiltrate with American
schools is one facet of the CCP’s broader soft-power strategy to in-
fluence policy in nations throughout the world. The United States
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that ex-
panding Confucius Classrooms in the United States has been a top
priority for the Chinese government.1 Many K–12 schools have ac-
cepted CCP-linked grants, which come with perks including fully
funded teacher exchanges, Chinese language programs, and oppor-
tunities for American students to learn in China.2

Confucius Classrooms are smaller-scale, K–12 versions of Confu-
cius Institutes that the CCP has pushed for on U.S. college cam-
puses. Confucius Institutes are established as partnerships be-
tween a host institution, a Chinese partner (usually a Chinese uni-
versity), and a Chinese government agency. China’s Ministry of
Education Office of Chinese Language Council International funds
each Confucius Institute, often at around $100,000 per year, and
asks host institutions to match those funds with its own contribu-
tions.
This Confucius Institute funding comes with strings attached
that compromise academic freedom. The Chinese government ap-
proves teachers, events, and speakers and requires teachers to sign
contracts pledging they will not injure the national interests of
China. The government’s control over the Institute is highlighted
by the contracts that make clear that Chinese directors or teachers
will be terminated if they ‘‘violate Chinese laws’’ or ‘‘engage in ac-
tivities detrimental to national interests’’ and states that they must
‘‘conscientiously safeguard national interests.’’3
Many K–12 Confucius Classrooms developed as offshoots of uni-
versity-based Confucius Institutes. China has strategically de-
ployed and rapidly expanded their Confucius Classrooms, going
from very few in 2008 to more than a thousand worldwide by 2017.
More than 500 American K–12 schools have hosted Confucius
Classrooms, aided in part by the Asia Society, an American non-
profit that previously ran a network of 100 Confucius Classrooms
before they ended the partnership in 2021.4 A Parents Defending
Education report tracked Chinese affiliation in 143 schools across
34 states—with at least seven still active as of publication.5
OTHER COUNTRIES’ INFLUENCE IN U.S. K–12 SCHOOLS
While it appears that no other country has a program similar in
scope and size to the CCP’s propaganda campaign in American
schools, other countries have also invested in language and cultural
educational programs in American K–12 schools.
One notable example is Qatar. The Qatar Foundation, along with
its subsidiaries like Qatar Foundation International and the Qatar
National Research Fund, have been actively involved in influencing
American K–12 education through financial partnerships with indi-
vidual schools.6 From 2009 to 2017, the Qatar Foundation allocated
$30.6 million to various schools across 12 U.S. states. The funds
are predominantly directed towards facilitating Arabic language
programs, and they cover expenses for teacher education, mate-
rials, and salaries. These contributions have taken various forms,
from direct funds to professional development initiatives, such as
teacher councils and language conferences. Additionally, there are
instances of school districts, like the Tucson Unified School District

and New Haven Public Schools, receiving substantial grants over
multiple years.7
Other countries have also made notable donations to U.S. K–12
schools. After the May 8, 2024, subcommittee hearing on anti-
semitism in K–12 schools, then-New York City Public Schools
Chancellor David Banks informed Committee staff that the Italian-
American Committee on Education, which is connected to the
Italian government, contributed $257,000 to New York City Public
Schools in 2021–24. Chancellor Banks also reported that the Con-
sulate General of the Republic of Korea in New York contributed
$16,000 to support Korean instruction and programming in New
York City Public Schools. It is unclear the extent to which these
foreign ties had been publicized prior to the Committee’s request
for information.8
It is imperative that American students are not subject to mali-
cious foreign influence in their schools. Parents are crucial guard-
ians when it comes to ensuring that their students are taught accu-
rate content. To that end, the TRACE Act requires that, as a condi-
tion of receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Edu-
cation Act, a local educational agency ensures that public schools
provide each parent the right to review any curricular material
provided or purchased with funds from a foreign government or for-
eign entity of concern. The bill also guarantees parents the right
to know how many personnel at their child’s school are com-
pensated by foreign sources and about any donations or financial
transactions between the school and a foreign government or for-
eign entity of concern.
CONCLUSION
It is unacceptable that foreign adversaries such as the CCP are
attempting to influence U.S. K–12 schools. Congress should take
immediate action to ensure that students are not being indoctri-
nated with communist propaganda. Congress should also take ac-
tion to ensure that parents have the right to review and be aware
of all curricula purchased or provided by a foreign country. H.R.
1049 will help ensure that the Chinese government does not take
advantage of local school districts and that parents have the right
to be fully informed of what is happening in their child’s schools.

EXPLANATION OF AMENDMENTS
The amendments, including the amendment in the nature of a
substitute, are explained in the body of this report.
APPLICATION OF LAW TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104–1 requires a description of
the application of this bill to the legislative branch. H.R. 1049 en-
sures that parents are aware of foreign influence in their child’s
public school. H.R. 1049 applies to schools receiving funds under
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and therefore
does not apply to the Legislative Branch.
UNFUNDED MANDATE STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344 (as amended
by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee adopts as its own the cost esti-
mate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974.
EARMARK STATEMENT
H.R. 1049 does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9 of
House rule XXI.
ROLL CALL VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1049 is to ensure that
public elementary and secondary schools provide parents with in-
formation related to foreign influence in their child’s school.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 1049 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF
THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 1049: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1049 would require that local education agencies ensure
that each school served by the agency provide information about
funding from or agreements with foreign governments or related
entities to parents upon request as a condition of receiving funds
from the Department of Education.
CBO expects that local education agencies would comply with
these new requirements; thus, enacting the bill would not affect
their eligibility to receive federal funds. Based on the costs of simi-
lar activities, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost
the Department of Education less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Garrett Quenneville.
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1049. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
In compliance with clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,
as reported, are shown as follows (new matter is printed in italics
and existing law in which no change is proposed is shown in
roman):

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1049, the Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Con-
tributions to Education Act, requires local educational agencies
(LEAs) and individual schools to provide parents with the oppor-
tunity to: (1) access curriculum and staff professional development
materials provided by a government of a foreign country (foreign
government) or foreign entity of concern; (2) know how many school
staff have been paid, in whole or part, by a foreign government or
foreign entity of concern; and (3) know of any donation to, written
agreement with, or financial transaction between the school or LEA
and a foreign government or foreign entity of concern and related
details.1 The Majority claims the bill ‘‘solidifies the rights of par-
ents to know how foreign funding is impacting their child’s class-
room and adds a layer of deterrence to keep foreign nations from
reaching America’s youth.’’2 Yet, the Majority has not proven any
local school system has allowed foreign influence to exist in ele-
mentary and secondary public schools. Instead, the bill would feed
into baseless claims encompassed in the Majority’s self-created cul-
ture wars and raises a number of administrative questions and
concerns for public schools.
SUMMARY OF CONCERNS
H.R. 1049 Claims to provide parents with rights, but in reality feeds
into culture wars
While the Majority claims a desire to provide parents with infor-
mation on foreign governments and foreign entities of concern al-
legedly impacting their students’ education, H.R. 1049 is another
attempt to feed into culture wars. Throughout the last Congress,
and continuing into this Congress, the Majority has used its agen-
da-setting power to consider a series of bills that provide solutions
to non-existent problems to advance divisive narratives. Last Con-
gress, the House passed H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act,
which the Majority claimed would ‘‘put in place concrete legal pro-
tections that will ensure parents always have a seat at the table
when it comes to their child’s education.’’3 But, as Committee
Democrats pointed out in the Minority Views accompanying that
bill to the House floor, the bill was ‘‘largely duplicative of current
law, lacks clarity in how its provisions will actually address stu-

dents well-being, and stands as an example of the type federal
overreach Congressional Republicans have long claimed would
harm children, teachers and schools.’’4 Similarly, it is worth noting
that pursuant to a law that already applies to entities that receive
U.S. Department of Education funding and awards, parents cur-
rently have the right to inspect instructional materials pertaining
to their child’s classes.5 But H.R. 1049 permits parents to inspect
and copy—at unlimited cost to the school—any instructional mate-
rials or professional development materials that the school pur-
chased or obtained using funds from a foreign government or for-
eign entity of concern.6 The costs (in staff time and money) associ-
ated with complying with transparency requests are documented
challenges schools face; systemic foreign influence is not.7
Foreign influence has not posed a threat to K–12 classrooms
The Majority claims H.R. 1049 is necessary because ‘‘foreign ad-
versaries . . . are systematically and aggressively attempting to in-
fluence our nation’s elementary and secondary schools.’’8 But the
most common example of foreign influence in schools that the Ma-
jority cites are Confucius Classrooms.
Chinese influence has not posed a threat to elementary and sec-
ondary classrooms
Confucius Classrooms, which are affiliated with Confucious Insti-
tutes, are centers for Chinese culture and language established at
public and private elementary and secondary schools—either to bol-
ster a Chinese language program already at the school or to start
a new one. Many countries around the world lack quality Chinese
language and culture resources and Confucious Institutes and
Classrooms provide those resources for free.9 However, over nearly
five years, the number of U.S. Confucius Classrooms has dropped
from more than 500 to currently no more than 16.10 Experts have
summed up the current state of these programs, saying ‘‘[t]he
harsh reality is that Confucius Institutes/Confucius Classrooms
stepped up to fulfill a need that governments were not—and they
were happy to accept a ‘freebie,’. . . . Now that Confucius Insti-

tutes have been tainted by wider distaste and suspicion of the Chi-
nese government, this ‘freebie’ now has a cost.’’11
Parents Defending Education (PDE), a right-wing non-profit or-
ganization, published a report in July 2023 entitled, ‘‘Little Red
Classrooms: China’s Infiltration of American K–12 Schools.’’ The
report cites the mere presence of Confucius Institutes, Confucius
Classrooms, and related ‘‘programming’’ (including local program-
ming that may have pre-dated the establishment of a Confucius
Classroom), sometimes in areas near U.S. military bases, to allege
the Classrooms exert undue Chinese influence in America.12 De-
spite the claims in the report, Committee Democratic staff have
been unable to locate credible evidence to support either the claims
made by the Majority or PDE that there is inappropriate and
undue foreign influence in our nation’s K–12 public schools cur-
rently as a result of Confucius Classrooms. In 2019, the Senate
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’
(HSGAC) Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hear-
ing entitled ‘‘China’s Impact on the U.S. Education System’’. The
hearing was held the day after the HSGAC released a bipartisan
staff report with the same title.13 While the staff report made rec-
ommendations that schools should ensure that Chinese partnership
organization’s ‘‘vetting, screening and interview processes are
aligned with their own hiring protocols and procedures’’14 and that
‘‘the State Department should demand reciprocal and fair treat-
ments of its diplomats and employees in China.’’15 The Committee
did not find security risks or curriculum vulnerability, as claimed
by the Majority.
H.R. 1049 Includes severe penalties for public school systems
Failure to comply with the requirements of H.R. 1049 could
cause public school systems and states to lose funding from the El-
ementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), including the Title
I–A program. Specifically, the bill conditions receipt of ESEA pro-
gram funds on meeting the requirements of the bill. Each LEA is
responsible for making sure that each school in the LEA posts or
disseminates information about these rights at the beginning of
every school year. It also requires state educational agencies
(SEAs) to notify LEAs of these requirements at the beginning of
every school year. By conditioning ESEA funds to LEAs and SEAs
on meeting the requirements in the bill, H.R. 1049 contains severe
penalties for districts and states that fail to implement the require-
ments of the bill correctly, whether intentional or accidental.
H.R. 1049 Raises significant administrative concerns for public
schools

is unclear whether the bill only applies to staff compensation that
is provided by the school using funds the school received from a for-
eign government or foreign entity of concern or if it applies, for in-
stance, to a volunteer compensated directly by a foreign govern-
ment or foreign entity of concern without a school’s knowledge.
Further, while the obligation to provide information about dona-
tions, agreements, or financial transactions rests with the school,
schools are often not aware of donations, agreements, or financial
transactions made at the LEA level, and the bill does not require
LEAs to share that information with schools.
Additionally, the bill does not provide a clear definition for ‘‘for-
eign country.’’ This sets a dangerous precedent by leaving it to
LEAs and schools to decide what constitutes a foreign country and
inviting them to engage in international diplomacy. It is also un-
clear in what instances an LEA or school will need to determine
whether there is any involvement by a foreign government or a
‘‘foreign entity of concern’’. The bill is also silent as to how to make
such a determination, or how to assess whether any entity the LEA
or school works with—U.S. or otherwise—has substantial oper-
ations in another country. Learning how to assess and make these
determinations and ensure that anyone authorized to spend money
is aware of the requirements in the bill will require significant
training, professional development, and cost. Moreover, it is un-
clear whether every contract (new and existing) for food, tutoring,
textbooks, janitorial services, trash collection, recycling, etc. would
need to undergo such examination. The bill is also not specific
about whether such an examination to ensure compliance would
need to focus on each individual employee or only key decision-
makers at the entity providing services.
During the markup for the bill Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–
VA) asked for clarification on what a ‘‘foreign entity of concern’’ is,
citing the bill incorporates by reference the definition of the term
from the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation
Act.16 Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R–PA) responded that ‘‘foreign entity
of concern’’ meant ‘‘Communist China’’,17 however the Research
and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act includes a
much more expansive definition, that itself cross-references numer-
ous other criminal and national security statutes.18 Rep. Scott (D–

VA) went on to highlight the difficulties schools may have com-
plying, since the definition in the bill text expands well beyond
China.
Finally, H.R. 1049 will likely have a chilling effect on SEAs,
LEAs, and schools engaging in international and cultural exchange
opportunities because they often require some coordination with
foreign governments (through U.S. consulates). Statements made
at markup lead us to wonder if the chilling effect on engaging with
foreign entities, however benign, is part of the purpose of the legis-
lation. During the markup of H.R. 1049, when faced with questions
on the difficulty schools would have complying with this bill, Rep.
Mackenzie said:
‘‘I think the easiest and fastest way to comply with this
legislation is to not accept funds from communist China.
It’s very simple. If you’re not accepting funds from an enti-
ty like that, you won’t have any compliance costs because
then parents will have the transparency that will be
brought about by this act. They will not ever find that
there was any money being given to a school district to in-
fluence the curriculum or the teaching that is going on in
a classroom, and it’ll be very simple to reply from the
school district, just saying we have not received those
funds. Very simple, very easy, straightforward piece of leg-
islation that increases transparency and also again then
will help parents be involved in their student’s education.’’
H.R. 1049’s requirements related to disclosing information on do-
nations, agreements, and financial transactions in the bill are not
limited to ‘‘Communist China’’ or ‘‘foreign influence’’. Everyday
commonplace business that a school may engage with a vendor
could easily be implicated by H.R. 1049. When faced with questions
regarding compliance, Committee Republicans suggested the easi-
est way to comply is to not engage in the underlying practice. This
suggests that if H.R. 1049 became law, we would likely see a gen-
eral disincentive among schools to contract with, or accept dona-
tions from anyone who looks or sounds ‘‘foreign’’, for fear of losing
ESEA funds.
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENT OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1049
Recognizing the administrative burden schools will face, Ranking
Member Scott put forward an amendment to provide funds to as-
sist schools, LEAs, and SEAs with compliance costs. Significant ef-
fort may need to be expended to investigate existing and new con-
tracts, to determine whether existing or potential business partners
are foreign governments or ‘‘foreign entities of concern’’, to create
and maintain systems to keep track of all the new information and
respond to inquiries and to train staff in each school on the ways
to report to be in compliance with the bill. This amendment author-
izes $300 million for fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent fiscal
year, providing on average approximately $3,000 to every public
school in America to assist with coming into compliance with H.R.

1049.19 Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on a
party-line vote.
Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) put forward an
amendment designed to ensure the Department of Education, and
no other agency, is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of
this legislation. Over the past several weeks, President Trump has
suggested he will have a plan soon to eliminate the Department of
Education, calling into question how this bill would be adminis-
tered. Yet H.R. 1069 specifically calls for funds that are adminis-
tered by the Department of Education to be withheld if schools do
not comply. Therefore, the Bonamici amendment sought to ensure
that the Department be the sole agency empowered to enforce the
bill. However, Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on
a party-line vote.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1049 is another solution in search of a problem. While the
Majority claims that some foreign countries seek to influence our
nation’s students, there is no credible evidence proving such a
claim. Yet, they use the bill to feed into baseless arguments that
parents do not have rights, claims we all know are not substan-
tiated under current law. The bill raises a number of administra-
tive questions and concerns for public schools and in practice will
result in many schools discontinuing perfectly safe and legal inter-
national engagements. For the reasons stated above, we urge the
House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 1049.

19According to the National Center for Education Statistics in the Institute of Education
Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education, there were 99,388 public elementary and sec-
ondary schools for the 2022–2023 school year. NCES, Digest of Education Statistics tbl. 216.10
(2023), https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_216.10.asp. Three hundred million
dollars would provide $3,000 per year to each of those schools to offset the costs of compliance.
In reality, the administrative burden this bill poses could easily require a full time administra-
tive staff person at each school.
