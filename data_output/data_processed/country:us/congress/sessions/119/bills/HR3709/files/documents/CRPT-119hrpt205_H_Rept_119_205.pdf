smaller institutions to serve their customers and potentially act as
financial agents.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Treasury Department’s current mentor-prote´ge´ program, es-
tablished in 2018, connects the largest banks in the country with
the smallest financial institutions.1
This voluntary program fosters relationships between small and
large banks by expanding the pool of financial agents. Large banks
partner with smaller institutions to provide managerial and tech-
nical support, helping them strengthen their balance sheets and
improve customer services. Areas of support may include credit
card partnerships, access to capital markets, equity investments,
loan participations, and opportunities related to U.S. Treasury con-
tracts.
