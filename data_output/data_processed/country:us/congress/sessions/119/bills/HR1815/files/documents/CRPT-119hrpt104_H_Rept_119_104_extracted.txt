PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1815, the ‘‘VA Home Loan Program Reform Act,’’ was intro-
duced by Representative Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin on March
3, 2025. H.R. 1815, as amended, would require the Secretary of the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to create and establish a par-
tial claim program within the VA Home Loan program. This bill
would ensure that when a veteran uses the partial claim program,
the amount of money applied to a veteran’s arrearage would not
count against the guarantee provided to the lender on the original
loan. This bill would also require VA to develop a strategy to en-
sure veterans remain competitive in the home loan process. Addi-

tionally, this bill would authorize funding for the Grant Per-Diem
(GPD) program.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

Section 8:
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Home Loan Program Reform
Act.’’

Section 9:
Section 2: Authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to Take
Certain Actions in the Case of a Default on a Home Loan Guar-
anteed by the Secretary
VA has assisted veterans with homeownership since 1944, when
Congress enacted the loan guaranty program to help veterans who
were returning home from World War II purchase homes.1 The
loan guaranty program helps veterans by insuring mortgages made
by private lenders. It is available for the purchase or construction
of homes, as well as to refinance existing loans. The loan guaranty
program has expanded over the years, updating its regulations
through published circulars. During the COVID pandemic, through
the CARES Act [P.L. 116–136], VA implemented the COVID–
VAPCP, or VA’s Partial claim Program.
The COVID–VAPCP was a temporary program to help borrowers
who were suffering from financial hardship due to the COVID pan-
demic. Under the CARES Act, a veteran who was experiencing fi-
nancial hardship related to COVID was allowed to request forbear-
ance on government guaranteed mortgage loans. VA was author-
ized to assist a borrower that had utilized a COVID forbearance by
purchasing the veteran’s debt from the loan servicer. In exchange
for VA’s partial claim payment on behalf of the borrower, the bor-
rower agreed to repay VA, in the amount of such partial claim pay-
ment, upon loan terms established by the VA Secretary at the
time.2 Once the CARES Act provisions expired during the Biden-
Harris administration, VA implemented the VA Servicer Pur-
chasing (VASP) program.
The VASP program allowed any veteran who had missed at least
three mortgage payments to apply for relief. Under the VASP pro-
gram, VA would buy the loan of a veteran who was behind on their
mortgage from the private lender and give them a new loan at a
reduced interest rate of 2.5%. There were no guardrails on the
VASP program, which was a cause for concern. A veteran did not
need to show proof of income when applying for VASP; they would
be eligible as long as they had missed three payments on their
mortgage. Some at-risk veterans did have to go through a Trial
Payment Plan (TTP) to ensure they could pay their mortgage at
the new rate, but this applied to only about 3% of veterans partici-
pating in the program. The other 97% did not need to show finan-
cial need to participate in the program.
This program was implemented without congressional authority
and was purported to save money according to VA and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) at the time. VA also estimated
that 80,000 veterans would participate in the VASP program. As
of April 2025, over 17,000 people have participated in the program
1VA Housing: Guaranteed Loans, Direct Loans, and Specially Adapted Housing Grants.

and VA had purchased $5.48 billion of loans. The average loan
under the program is $321,000. VA purchased these loans even
though the average veteran who was delinquent was just $22,000
behind on their mortgage. Under the Trump Administration, VA
announced it was ending VASP and began a phased rollback of the
program. All veterans enrolled in the program could be grand-
fathered in until May 1, 2025. After that, no new applications
would be accepted.
This section of this bill would grant the Secretary the authority
to implement a partial claim program. The Federal Housing Ad-
ministration (FHA) and the United States Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) both have partial claim programs. Creating a par-
tial claim program within the VA Home Loan program would put
the VA Home Loan program on the same level as other federal
home loan programs and allow VA to provide needed relief to vet-
erans without requiring VA to become the lender of record for bil-
lions of dollars of mortgage loans. It is important to note the par-
tial claim would not count against VA’s guarantee to the original
lender to cover up to 25% of the loan if there is a foreclosure.
The Committee believes it is important to provide VA with the
authority to establish a partial claim option within the VA Home
Loan program to allow veterans who get behind on their mortgages
to have options similar to other federal housing programs like FHA
and USDA. The Committee believes this would help veterans who
may fall behind on their mortgage in the current high-interest rate
environment and that this program is more fiscally responsible
than the VASP program. While VA’s loss mitigation waterfall has
multiple options to assist a veteran who is at risk of defaulting be-
fore foreclosure, adding a partial claim option to the program would
prevent more veterans from foreclosure, and prevent VA from hav-
ing to maintain a property post foreclosure.

Section 10:
Section 3: Partial Claim Program of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs
This section would amend subsection III of Chapter 37 of Title
38 to establish the partial claim program for five years after enact-
ment of the legislation. This section would establish the program
itself. The program would allow the Secretary to cover up to 25%
of the unpaid principal balance of the original loan for a primary
residence. This bill would also provide relief for a veteran during
a natural disaster; if the President declares a major disaster a vet-
eran or servicemember would be eligible for an additional partial
claim of 25% during the duration of the declaration, or for 120 days
after the President declares the major disaster. Specific individuals
who were working through other loss mitigation options because of
COVID–19 up until May 1, 2025, may qualify for a partial claim
up to 30% of their unpaid principal balance to account for extra ar-
rears because of the foreclosure moratorium that existed during
that time period.
The Committee believes that allowing an additional 5% of the
unpaid principal balance to be covered for those veterans experi-
encing financial hardships due to COVID would help them avoid
foreclosure. The allowance of multiple partial claims for victims of
a Presidentially declared major disaster may also assist veterans in
avoiding foreclosure, which generally would cost VA more than al-

lowing for other loss mitigation options. Additionally, by placing a
time limitation on the window to apply for a partial claim in the
event of a major disaster, the federal government would prevent in-
dividuals who have missed payments not because of the disaster,
but by being in the area of the disaster, from applying for a partial
claim. The Committee is supportive of VA establishing a partial
claim program as part of VA’s loss mitigation process. This would
allow veterans more options to get back on their feet when dealing
with temporary financial hardship and prevent veteran homeless-
ness.

Section 11:
Section 4: Strategy of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Regarding
the Effect of Certain Litigation
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) was sued by buyers
in several states who alleged that the way compensation for real
estate agents was set by the industry violated the law. The NAR
entered into an agreement to settle numerous class action lawsuits
alleging antitrust violations. The terms of NAR’s settlement agree-
ment, which were established in August 2024 and approved by the
court in November 2024, included industry practice changes that
impacted the settlement and payment of buyer’s agent commis-
sions. In some transactions, sellers may choose not to pay buyer
broker compensation, particularly if competing buyers offer to cover
the cost themselves. The settlement created a difficult situation for
veteran buyers. Under the home loan program at VA, veterans
were not permitted to pay a buyer agent to represent them. As the
implementation date approached, VA temporarily lifted its long-
standing policy that prohibited veterans from paying fees or com-
missions to real estate agents or brokers on a VA home loan.
This section would require VA to develop a long-term strategy to
help ensure that veterans remain competitive buyers in the hous-
ing market. The Committee believes this is important because the
strategy must guarantee that a veteran using a home loan backed
by VA is not at a disadvantage when securing representation from
a real estate agent or broker. While VA has published interim guid-
ance, this would ensure that VA creates a long-term strategy to
maintain the competitiveness of VA home loans for veteran home-
buyers.

Section 12:
Section 5: Increase Authorizations of Appropriations for Comprehen-
sive Service Programs for Homeless Veterans
In P.L. 118–210, the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Vet-
erans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act (the Dole Act),

Section 13:
Section 402, authorized an increase in the funding for the Grant
Per Diem (GPD) program. The GPD rate increased during the
COVID pandemic, and this provision increased the GPD from 115%
to 133%, with certain providers in the program receiving 200%.
This section would ensure there was sufficient authorization to
cover the cost of the increase in the GPD rate. The Committee be-
lieves this authorization of funding is essential to pay for the Dole
Act that was signed into law on January 2, 2025.

SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On April 9, 2025, the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity
held an open markup session on H.R. 1815.
An amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered by Sub-
committee Chairman Van Orden. This amendment in the nature of
a substitute would strike a specific termination date and change it
to three years after enactment of the law. This amendment in the
nature of a substitute would also remove the interest rate on the
partial claim to be in line with other federal home loan programs.
This amendment was agreed to by voice vote.
Ranking Member Pappas offered a substitute amendment to H.R.
1815, as amended. This amendment would require VA to carry out
the VA Service Purchase Program (VASP) by amending the statute.
This substitute amendment would also allow VA to pay the servicer
any unpaid loan balance plus accrued interest. Subcommittee
Ranking Member Pappas requested a recorded vote on this sub-

Brown’s legislation from last Congress. Ranking Member Pappas
requested a recorded vote on this substitute amendment. This
amendment failed by a recorded vote of 5–3.
A motion by Rep. Barrett to favorably forward H.R. 1815, as
amended, to the full Committee, was agreed to by voice vote.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion, a quorum being present, and ordered H.R. 1815, as amended,
to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives by voice
vote. During consideration of the bill one amendment to the
amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered by Represent-
ative Van Orden. This amendment, in the nature of a substitute,
would ensure that a partial claim does not count against the cur-
rent or existing loan guarantee. The amendment in the nature of
a substitute would also extend the program to five years and in-
crease the amount of unpaid principal that could be covered by a
partial claim to 25%.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
to H.R. 1815 was offered by Ranking Member Takano. This amend-
ment would allow the amount of unpaid principal balance that
could be covered by a partial claim to be increased to 30% partial
claim for veterans who missed a payment starting on March 1,
2020, until May 1, 2025. This amendment would also provide dis-
aster relief when the President declares a major disaster by permit-
ting a veteran who is a victim of a disaster to enter into more than
one partial claim of 25%. Additionally, this amendment would au-
thorize funding for the Grant Per-Diem (GPD) provision in the Dole
Act. This amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute was agreed to by voice vote.
An additional amendment to the amendment in the nature of a
substitute was offered by Ranking Member Takano. This amend-
ment would encourage VA to continue to use the authorities under
VASP. Additionally, the amendment would create a 90-day fore-
closure moratorium after the enactment ofthe bill. This amendment
to the amendment in the nature of a substitute failed by a recorded
vote of 11–13.
A motion by Representative Bergman to report H.R. 1815, as
amended, favorably to the House of Representatives, was agreed to
by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
In compliance with clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, one recorded vote was taken on amend-
ments or in connection with ordering H.R. 1815, as amended, favor-
ably reported to the House.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 1815, as amended, are to authorize and establish
a partial claim program within the VA Home Loan Program. Addi-
tionally, the legislation would increase authorization caps from
$257 million to $344 million for the Grant and Per-Diem program
for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 1815, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the Congressional Budget Of-
fice cost estimate on this measure.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST
ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1969,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
The bill would:
• Establish a Partial Claim Program through which the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) would pay lenders amounts

to prevent foreclosure on guaranteed loans that are delinquent
or in default
• Temporarily increase the amounts authorized for the
Grant and Per Diem Program through which VA awards fund-
ing to organizations to provide transitional housing for vet-
erans
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Paying partial claims to lenders to avoid foreclosure of
loans guaranteed by VA
• Increasing grants to organizations providing transitional
housing for veterans
Bill summary: H.R. 1815 would temporarily increase the
amounts authorized for the Grant and Per Diem Program through
which The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awards funding to
organizations to provide transitional housing for veterans. The bill
also would establish a Partial Claim Program through which VA
would pay lenders amounts to prevent foreclosure on guaranteed
loans that are delinquent or in default.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effects of H.R.
1815 are shown in Table 1. The bill would decrease net direct
spending by $147 million and increase spending subject to appro-
priation by $146 million over the 2025–2035 period. The costs of
the legislation fall within budget function 700 (veterans benefits
and services).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R.
1815 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and that provisions will
take effect upon or soon after enactment. CBO also estimates that
outlays will follow historical spending patterns for affected pro-
grams.
Provisions that affect spending subject to appropriation and di-
rect spending: Section 5 would temporarily increase the amounts
authorized for the Grant and Per Diem Program through which VA
pays a daily rate to public and nonprofit entities that provide hous-
ing and supportive services to homeless veterans.
Current law limits the total amount that VA can award for those
grants to $258 million each year; section 5 would raise that limit
to $344 million for 2025 and 2026. Using information on past grant
payments and historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that the
amounts paid for grants would increase by a total of $169 million
over the 2025–2035 period.

mental hazards; thus, CBO expects that some of the costs of imple-
menting the bill would be paid from the Toxic Exposures Fund
(TEF) established by Public Law 117–168, the Honoring our PACT
Act. The TEF is a mandatory appropriation that VA uses to pay
for health care, disability claims processing, medical research, and
information technology modernization that benefit veterans who
were exposed to environmental hazards. Additional spending from
the TEF occurs if legislation increases the costs of similar activities
that benefit veterans with such exposure. Thus, in addition to in-
creasing spending subject to appropriation, enacting section 5
would increase amounts paid from the TEF, which are classified as
direct spending.
CBO projects that the proportion of costs paid by the TEF will
grow over time based on the amount of formerly discretionary ap-
propriations that CBO expects will be provided through the manda-
tory appropriation as specified in the Honoring our PACT Act.1
CBO estimates that over the 2025–2035 period, implementing sec-
tion 5 would increase outlays for spending subject to appropriation
by $146 million and direct spending by $23 million.
Direct spending: The discussion above in ‘‘Provisions That Affect
Spending Subject to Appropriation and Direct Spending’’ describes
the increased authorizations for the Grant and Per Diem Program
that would increase direct spending from the TEF under section 5.

Section 18:
Section 3 of the bill would establish a Partial Claim Program de-
scribed below, which would decrease direct spending. In total, the
bill would decrease net direct spending outlays by $147 million
over the 2025–2035 period (see Table 2).
Partial Claim Program. VA provides loan guarantees to lenders
that allow eligible borrowers to obtain better loan terms—such as
lower interest rates or smaller down payments—to purchase, con-
struct, improve, or refinance a home. VA typically pays lenders up
to 25 percent of the outstanding mortgage balance if a borrower’s
home is foreclosed upon. Those payments, net of fees paid by bor-
rowers and recoveries by lenders, constitute the subsidy cost for the
loan guarantees.2 Such costs are paid from mandatory appropria-
tions and, thus, are reflected in the budget as direct spending.

Section 19:
Section 3 would establish a Partial Claim Program through
which VA would pay lenders amounts to prevent foreclosure on
guaranteed loans that are in or at risk of default. That amount
would cover a portion of indebtedness sufficient to prevent or re-
solve the default, not to exceed 25 percent of the outstanding mort-
gage balance (or 30 percent if the borrower became delinquent be-
fore May 1, 2025). The partial claim payment would be classified
as a direct loan from VA to the delinquent borrower. Those direct
loans would be secured by a government lien on the property and
would not accrue interest. The bill would authorize one partial
1For additional information about estimated spending from the TEF, see CBO’s most recent
table with details about baseline projections: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-01/60044-
2025-01-tef.pdf.
2Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the subsidy cost of a loan guarantee is the
net present value of estimated payments by the government to cover defaults and delinquencies,
interest subsidies, or other expenses offset by any payments to the government, including origi-
nation or other fees, penalties, and recoveries on defaulted loans. Such subsidy costs are cal-
culated by discounting those expected cash flows using the rate on Treasury securities of com-
parable maturity. The resulting estimated subsidy costs are recorded in the budget when the
loans are disbursed or modified. A positive subsidy indicates that the loan results in net outlays
from the Treasury; a negative subsidy indicates that the loan results in net receipts to the
Treasury.

claim on a loan guaranteed by the department, unless subsequent
delinquencies occur within 120 days following a major disaster de-
clared by the President. A partial claim would not reduce the
amount of VA’s guarantee on the existing loan. The authority for
the program would expire five years after the enactment of
H.R.1815. In CBO’s estimation, that program also would reduce
costs of the loan guarantees the VA provides.
Using its projection of loan volume based on data provided by
VA, CBO expects that VA will pay roughly 12,200 partial claims
on behalf of borrowers at an average amount of $27,200 over the
course of the program. In addition, CBO estimates that some of
those loans would not be repaid by the borrowers. The combination
of defaults and lack of interest income result in a subsidy rate of
37 percent and total subsidy costs of $124 million over the 2025–
2035 period, CBO estimates.
Other Loan Effects. In addition to the costs described above,
CBO expects that the partial claims payments under section 3
would reduce the number of foreclosures on guaranteed loans. As
a result, they would reduce the net amount that VA pays related
to defaults on those guaranteed loans by an estimated $294 million
over the 2025–2035 period.
Taken together, CBO estimates that enacting section 3 would de-
crease net direct spending by $170 million over the 2025–2035 pe-
riod.

Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go proce-
dures are shown in Table 2.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting H.R. 1815 would not increase net direct spend-
ing or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year peri-
ods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: H.R. 1815 contains an intergovernmental and private-
sector mandate, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). By not allowing judicial review of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs decision to obtain secured interest in a veteran’s de-
faulted home loan, the bill would eliminate an existing right of ac-
tion for any public or private entity that would otherwise be able
to seek judicial review. There is no cost associated with this man-
date because judicial review does not result in monetary damages;
the cost is therefore well below the thresholds established in
UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($103
million and $206 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually
for inflation).

STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1815, as amended, would establish or reauthorize a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 21:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 22:
Section 1. Short title
This section would establish the short title of the bill as the ‘‘VA
Home Loan Program Reform Act.’’

Section 23:
Section 2. Authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take cer-
tain actions in the case of a default on the home loan guaran-
teed by the Secretary
This section would amend 38 U.S.C. §3732 by adding in a sub-

Section 24:
section that would grant VA the authority to establish ae partial
claim option as part of the loss mitigation waterfall process before
foreclosure. Under this subsection the VA Secretary shall, on a ran-
dom sampling basis, post a payment audit to ensure compliance
with the requirements. The VA Secretary would also be required
to establish a mandatory sequence for the loss mitigation waterfall
within the VA Home Loan program.

Section 25:
Section 3. Partial claim program of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs
This section would amend Subchapter III of chapter 37 of Title
38 in order to establish and implement a partial claim program at
VA. The payments made to a lender under the partial claim pro-
gram to bring a mortgage loan up-to-date would not count against
the 25% that VA guarantees to pay the original lender if there is
a foreclosure. The partial claim would pay up to 25% of the unpaid
principal balance to the lender to bring a loan up-to-date. This sec-
tion would also provide disaster relief if the President declares a
major disaster. A veteran or servicemember would be eligible for an
additional partial claim of 25% during the duration of the declara-
tion, or for 120 days after the President declares the major dis-
aster. Specific individuals who were working through other loss
mitigation options due to COVID–19 up until May 1, 2025, may
also qualify for a partial claim up to 30% of their unpaid principal
balance to account for extra arrears that may exist because of the
foreclosure moratorium that existed during that time period. This

Section 26:
section would establish the right to recovery by VA when an indi-
vidual defaults on their mortgage payment even after using a par-
tial claim. This section would terminate the program five years
after the enactment of this law.

Section 27:
Section 4: Strategy of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding
the effect of certain litigation
This section would require that no later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act that the VA Secretary shall submit

to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans’ Affairs a report
on the strategy the VA Secretary will use to ensure that veterans
remain competitive in the real estate market and secure represen-
tation to ensure that veterans are not at a disadvantage in the
marketplace.

Section 28:
Section 5: Increase authorizations of appropriations for comprehen-
sive service programs for homeless veterans
This section would authorize funding for the Grant Per Diem
(GPD) program by amending 38 U.S.C. §2016 in paragraph 7 by
striking ‘‘fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent year after’’ and in-
serting ‘‘each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2024.’’ Adding in a
new subsection that would increase authorizations from
$257,000,000 to $344,000,000 for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026. Be-
ginning in 2027, authorizations would return to $257,000,000.

Section 35:
§3732. Procedure on default
(a)(1) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaran-
teed under this chapter, the holder of the øobligation¿ loan shall
notify the Secretary of such default. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Secretary may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, pay to
such holder the guaranty not in excess of the pro rata portion of
the amount originally guaranteed. Except as provided in section
3703(e) of this title, if the Secretary makes such a payment, the
Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the øob-
ligation¿ loan to the extent of the amount paid on the guaranty.
(2)ø(A) Before suit or foreclosure the holder of the obligation
shall notify the Secretary of the default, and within thirty days
thereafter the Secretary may, at the Secretary’s option, pay the
holder of the obligation the unpaid balance of the obligation plus
accrued interest and receive an assignment of the loan and secu-
rity. Nothing in this section shall preclude any forebearance for the
benefit of the veteran as may be agreed upon by the parties to the
loan and approved by the Secretary.¿ (A) The Secretary may, under
terms and conditions determined by the Secretary—
(i) pay the holder of a loan guaranteed under this chapter an
amount necessary to avoid the foreclosure of such loan;
(ii) require the holder of the loan and the veteran obligated
on the loan to execute all documents necessary to ensure the
Secretary obtains a secured interest in the property covered by
the loan; and
(iii) require the holder of the loan to take any actions nec-
essary to carry out this paragraph, including preparing, exe-
cuting, transmitting, receiving, and recording documents, and
requiring the holder of the loan to place the loan in forbearance.
(B) In the event that a housing loan guaranteed under this chap-
ter is modified under the authority provided under section 1322(b)
of title 11, the Secretary may pay the holder of the øobligation¿
housing loan the unpaid principal balance of the øobligation¿ hous-
ing loan due, plus accrued interest, as of the date of the filing of
the petition under title 11, but only upon the assignment, transfer,
and delivery to the Secretary (in a form and manner satisfactory
to the Secretary) of all rights, interest, claims, evidence, and
records with respect to the housing loan.
(C)(i) Any decision by the Secretary under this paragraph is final
and is not subject to judicial review.
(ii) For purposes of section 511 of this title, any decision under
this paragraph shall not be treated as a decision under a law that
affects the provision of benefits.
(D)(i) The Secretary may establish standards for processing pay-
ments under this paragraph based on a certification by a holder of
a loan guaranteed under this chapter that the holder has complied
with all applicable requirements established by the Secretary.
(ii) The Secretary shall carry out, on a random-sampling basis,
post-payment audits to ensure compliance with all requirements de-
scribed in clause (i).
(3) The Secretary may establish the date, not later than the date
of judgment and decree of foreclosure or sale, upon which accrual
of interest or charges shall cease.
(4)(A) Upon receiving a notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
subsection, the Secretary shall—

(i) provide the veteran with information and, to the extent
feasible, counseling regarding—
(I) alternatives to foreclosure, as appropriate in light of
the veteran’s particular circumstances, including possible
methods of curing the default, conveyance of the property
to the Secretary by means of a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
and the actions authorized by paragraph (2) of this sub-

Section 36:
section; and
(II) what the Department of Veterans Affairs’ and the
veteran’s liabilities would be with respect to the loan in
the event of foreclosure; and
(ii) advise the veteran regarding the availability of such
counseling;
except with respect to loans made by a lender which the Secretary
has determined has a demonstrated record of consistently pro-
viding timely and accurate information to veterans with respect to
such matters.
(B) The Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of appro-
priations, ensure that sufficient personnel are available to admin-
ister subparagraph (A) of this paragraph effectively and efficiently.
(5) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed
or insured under this chapter in which a partial payment has been
tendered by the veteran concerned and refused by the holder, the
holder of the øobligation¿ loan shall notify the Secretary as soon
as such payment has been refused. The Secretary may require that
any such notification include a statement of the circumstances of
the default, the amount tendered, the amount of the indebtedness
on the date of the tender, and the reasons for the holder’s refusal.
(b) With respect to any loan made under section 3711 which has
not been sold as provided in subsection (g) of such section, if the
Secretary finds, after there has been a default in the payment of
any installment of principal or interest owing on such loan, that
the default was due to the fact that the veteran who is obligated
under the loan has become unemployed as the result of the closing
(in whole or in part) of a Federal installation, the Secretary shall
(1) extend the time for curing the default to such time as the Sec-
retary determines is necessary and desirable to enable such vet-
eran to complete payments on such loan, including an extension of
time beyond the stated maturity thereof, or (2) modify the terms
of such loan for the purpose of changing the amortization provi-
sions thereof by recasting, over the remaining term of the loan, or
over such longer period as the Secretary may determine, the total
unpaid amount then due with the modification to become effective
currently or upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of
the period for curing the default.
(c)(1) For purposes of this øsubsection—¿ subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘defaulted loan’’ means a loan that is guaran-
teed under this chapter, that was made for a purpose described
in section 3710(a) of this title, and that is in default.
(B) The term ‘‘liquidation sale’’ means a judicial sale or other
disposition of real property to liquidate a defaulted loan that
is secured by such property.
(C) The term ‘‘net value’’, with respect to real property,
means the amount equal to (i) the fair market value of the
property, minus (ii) the total of the amounts which the Sec-

retary estimates the Secretary would incur (if the Secretary
were to acquire and dispose of the property) for property taxes,
assessments, liens, property maintenance, property improve-
ment, administration, resale (including losses sustained on the
resale of the property), and other costs resulting from the ac-
quisition and disposition of the property, excluding any amount
attributed to the cost to the Government of borrowing funds.
(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of paragraph
(10) of this subsection, the term ‘‘total indebtedness’’, with re-
spect to a defaulted loan, means the amount equal to the total
of (i) the unpaid principal of the loan, (ii) the interest on the
loan as of the date applicable under paragraph (10) of this sub-

Section 37:

(as specified in the loan instrument and permitted by regula-
tions prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection)
associated with liquidation of the loan, including advances for
taxes, insurance, and maintenance or repair of the real prop-
erty securing the loan.
(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph,
this subsection applies to any case in which the holder of a de-
faulted loan undertakes to liquidate the loan by means of a liquida-
tion sale.
(B) This subsection does not apply to a case in which the Sec-
retary proceeds under subsection (a)(2) of this section.
(3)(A) Before carrying out a liquidation sale of real property se-
curing a defaulted loan, the holder of the loan shall notify the Sec-
retary of the proposed sale. Such notice shall be provided in accord-
ance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement
this subsection.
(B) After receiving a notice described in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph, the Secretary shall determine the net value of the prop-
erty securing the loan and the amount of the total indebtedness
under the loan and shall notify the holder of the loan of the deter-
mination of such net value.
(4) A case referred to in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of this sub-

Section 38:
section as being described in this paragraph is a case in which the
net value of the property securing a defaulted loan exceeds the
amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount
guaranteed under this chapter.
(5) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the
holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan
at a liquidation sale for an amount that does not exceed the lesser
of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness under the
loan—

to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of
an amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebt-
edness; and

holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan
at the liquidation sale for an amount that exceeds the lesser of the
total indebtedness under the loan or the net value and—
(A)(i) the amount was the minimum amount for which,
under applicable State law, the property was permitted to be
sold at the liquidation sale, the holder shall have the option to
convey the property to the United States in return for payment
by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of the
amount for which the holder acquired the property or the total
indebtedness under the loan; or
(ii) there was no minimum amount for which the property
had to be sold at the liquidation sale under applicable State
law, the holder shall have the option to convey the property to
the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an
amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebted-
ness; and

from the holder of the loan; and
(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty
shall be limited to the amount of the total indebtedness under
the loan minus the amount realized by the holder of the loan
incident to the sale at a liquidation sale of the property.
(9) In no event may the liability of the United States under a
guaranteed loan exceed the amount guaranteed with respect to
that loan under section 3703(b) of this title. All determinations
under this subsection of net value and total indebtedness shall be
made by the Secretary.
(10)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this
paragraph, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this sub-

reasonable period of time for such sale to occur as the Secretary
may specify pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to
implement this subsection).
(B)(i) Subject to division (ii) of this subparagraph, in any case in

of the loan exercising øforebearance¿ forbearance at the request of
the Secretary, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this
subsection shall be such date, on or after the date on which
øforebearance¿ forbearance was requested and prior to the date of

earlier date under subparagraph (C)(i) of this paragraph.
(d) The Secretary shall prescribe loss mitigation procedures, in-
cluding a mandatory sequence in which the holder of a loan guar-

foreclosure of such loan. The Secretary may not purchase an entire
such loan until the veteran has completed such sequence.

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
The creation of the GI Bill during World War II offered returning
servicemembers significant assistance as they began the readjust-
ment to civilian life. In addition to the educational benefit that
could provide job training and improved employment outcomes, the
GI Bill offered these newly transitioned veterans a leg up to buy
a home. The first ten years of this benefit represented twenty per-
cent of all U.S. home purchases.1 The terms of the program offered
veterans a way to close on a home with limited money down, com-
petitive mortgage rates, and expanded protections to prevent fore-
closure.
Historically, VA has used the authorities granted as part of the
VA Loan Guarantee program to historically keep foreclosure rates
as the lowest among major loan types.2 However, these low rates
of foreclosure were a reflection of existing authorities and their de-
pendence on consistently low 30-year mortgage rates from banks.
During the COVID–19 pandemic, there was a severe rise in the
number of missed mortgage payments among veterans. Combined
with rising 30-year mortgage rates, the long-used VA foreclosure
mitigation measures lost their effectiveness. This led to the Biden
Administration to use several existing authorities to help as many
veterans as possible to avoid foreclosure. According to VA data, in
2023 alone, these authorities helped over 145,000 veterans and
their families avoid foreclosure.3
In 2024, President Biden built off these successes at VA and of-
fered veterans and servicemembers with delinquencies a new pro-
gram to avoid foreclosure, the Veteran Affairs Servicing Purchase
(VASP) program. This program offered the delinquent payers a way
to refinance into rates not available in the open market. From pro-
gram creation, 18,000 borrowers used VASP prior to the Trump
Administration abruptly ending this program on May 1, 2025.
DIRE RISK TO VETERAN FORECLOSURES
According to lenders and housing trade groups, upwards of
60,000 to 85,000 VA borrowers are still severely delinquent on
their mortgage payments. This means they have missed more than
three consecutive months of payments. As mortgage rates in the
open market remain high compared to recent years, and with the
closure of the VASP program, the only options available to these
borrowers are either selling their home or being foreclosed upon. As

VASP was the program of last resort, ending VASP has accelerated
the risk to these borrowers.
Subcommittee Chairman Van Orden has called VASP a ‘‘dis-
aster,’’ referred to a veteran facing foreclosure as ‘‘bum loan,’’ and
has repeatedly urged VA to end the program—even as officials in
the Trump VA and other witnesses testified to the program’s suc-
cesses. As recently as March 11, 2025, the VA reported, ‘‘We con-
tinue to see strong performance from our VA portfolio. Matter of
fact, we’re up in every category from a loan guarantee standpoint.
We are up a year over year in purchase and refinance as well as,
you know, our comparative default ratios versus other programs.
So, we’re continuing to see VA perform very well against its com-
petition.’’4
The Mortgage Bankers Association also testified on March 11,
2025, that VASP ‘‘has provided critical relief to thousands of vet-
erans whose loan payments became unaffordable in today’s higher
rate environment. While partial claims should be the first line of
defense, VASP has been an essential safety net for borrowers who
had no other options. Without VASP, VA would have foreclosed on
tens of thousands of borrowers.’’5 That is the reality borrowers now
face.
Democratic Members of the Committee continue to call on VA to
reinstate VASP6 (at least in the interim and until an alternative
program is offered) and offer the program to these tens of thou-
sands of borrowers. Helping veteran borrowers upholds the goals
and ideals of the VA Loan Guarantee program—which promised
veterans an easy entry point to home ownership. Further, the pro-
gram is meant to offer protections to veterans to only allow fore-
closure in the most extreme circumstances. As of the date of this
report, President Trump and Secretary Collins have refused to offer
these borrowers any options beyond already exhausted program op-
tions.
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
Based on prior Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports,7
foreclosures cost VA an estimated $60,000 per loan and are always
the most expensive option for the agency. Short of VA reinstating
VASP or putting in place a foreclosure moratorium prior to enact-
ment and implementation of H.R. 1815 as amended into law, the
agency is likely to incur significant costs while placing even more
financial and emotional costs on veterans.
Committee on House Veterans’ Affairs Democrats urge the
Trump administration to take all possible administration actions,
including but not necessarily limited to, reinstating VASP, or
issuing a foreclosure moratorium while this legislation works its
way through Congress and potentially becomes law and is imple-
mented.

Veterans who are at risk of foreclosure, and who would use the
authorities granted by H.R. 1815, as amended, to avoid such fore-
closure, should be offered assistance instead of being unfairly pun-
ished by the unknown timetable to move H.R. 1815, as amended,
from law to functional program.
GRANT PER DIEM FUNDING
Public Law 118–210, the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century
Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act authorized in-
creased per diem payments from VA to homeless providers.8 How-
ever, while S. 141 included offsets identified by the Congressional
Budget Office and required by Republican House Rules to cover the
cost of these per diem payments for the next three years, VA
shared with Congress that they lack authorities to carry out this
portion of law.
H.R. 1815 as amended includes authorization for funding for the
next two years of these payments, however the Committee holds
that these provisions should not require a second offset when they
have already been offset as part of S. 141. Committee Democrats
recommend that the House Budget Committee not require further
offsets for Fiscal Year 2027. The three years of increased funding
granted by S. 141, along with H.R. 1815, as amended, for grant per
diem payments in lieu of a permanent authorization of these au-
thorities is based on an agreement between House and Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committees (Majority and Minority) to determine a
more appropriate method to calculate adequate payments to pro-
viders in the future.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1815, the ‘‘VA Home Loan Program Reform Act,’’ was intro-
duced by Representative Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin on March
3, 2025. H.R. 1815, as amended, would require the Secretary of the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to create and establish a par-
tial claim program within the VA Home Loan program. This bill
would ensure that when a veteran uses the partial claim program,
the amount of money applied to a veteran’s arrearage would not
count against the guarantee provided to the lender on the original
loan. This bill would also require VA to develop a strategy to en-
sure veterans remain competitive in the home loan process. Addi-

tionally, this bill would authorize funding for the Grant Per-Diem
(GPD) program.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Home Loan Program Reform
Act.’’
Section 2: Authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to Take
Certain Actions in the Case of a Default on a Home Loan Guar-
anteed by the Secretary
VA has assisted veterans with homeownership since 1944, when
Congress enacted the loan guaranty program to help veterans who
were returning home from World War II purchase homes.1 The
loan guaranty program helps veterans by insuring mortgages made
by private lenders. It is available for the purchase or construction
of homes, as well as to refinance existing loans. The loan guaranty
program has expanded over the years, updating its regulations
through published circulars. During the COVID pandemic, through
the CARES Act [P.L. 116–136], VA implemented the COVID–
VAPCP, or VA’s Partial claim Program.
The COVID–VAPCP was a temporary program to help borrowers
who were suffering from financial hardship due to the COVID pan-
demic. Under the CARES Act, a veteran who was experiencing fi-
nancial hardship related to COVID was allowed to request forbear-
ance on government guaranteed mortgage loans. VA was author-
ized to assist a borrower that had utilized a COVID forbearance by
purchasing the veteran’s debt from the loan servicer. In exchange
for VA’s partial claim payment on behalf of the borrower, the bor-
rower agreed to repay VA, in the amount of such partial claim pay-
ment, upon loan terms established by the VA Secretary at the
time.2 Once the CARES Act provisions expired during the Biden-
Harris administration, VA implemented the VA Servicer Pur-
chasing (VASP) program.
The VASP program allowed any veteran who had missed at least
three mortgage payments to apply for relief. Under the VASP pro-
gram, VA would buy the loan of a veteran who was behind on their
mortgage from the private lender and give them a new loan at a
reduced interest rate of 2.5%. There were no guardrails on the
VASP program, which was a cause for concern. A veteran did not
need to show proof of income when applying for VASP; they would
be eligible as long as they had missed three payments on their
mortgage. Some at-risk veterans did have to go through a Trial
Payment Plan (TTP) to ensure they could pay their mortgage at
the new rate, but this applied to only about 3% of veterans partici-
pating in the program. The other 97% did not need to show finan-
cial need to participate in the program.
This program was implemented without congressional authority
and was purported to save money according to VA and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) at the time. VA also estimated
that 80,000 veterans would participate in the VASP program. As
of April 2025, over 17,000 people have participated in the program
1VA Housing: Guaranteed Loans, Direct Loans, and Specially Adapted Housing Grants.

and VA had purchased $5.48 billion of loans. The average loan
under the program is $321,000. VA purchased these loans even
though the average veteran who was delinquent was just $22,000
behind on their mortgage. Under the Trump Administration, VA
announced it was ending VASP and began a phased rollback of the
program. All veterans enrolled in the program could be grand-
fathered in until May 1, 2025. After that, no new applications
would be accepted.
This section of this bill would grant the Secretary the authority
to implement a partial claim program. The Federal Housing Ad-
ministration (FHA) and the United States Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) both have partial claim programs. Creating a par-
tial claim program within the VA Home Loan program would put
the VA Home Loan program on the same level as other federal
home loan programs and allow VA to provide needed relief to vet-
erans without requiring VA to become the lender of record for bil-
lions of dollars of mortgage loans. It is important to note the par-
tial claim would not count against VA’s guarantee to the original
lender to cover up to 25% of the loan if there is a foreclosure.
The Committee believes it is important to provide VA with the
authority to establish a partial claim option within the VA Home
Loan program to allow veterans who get behind on their mortgages
to have options similar to other federal housing programs like FHA
and USDA. The Committee believes this would help veterans who
may fall behind on their mortgage in the current high-interest rate
environment and that this program is more fiscally responsible
than the VASP program. While VA’s loss mitigation waterfall has
multiple options to assist a veteran who is at risk of defaulting be-
fore foreclosure, adding a partial claim option to the program would
prevent more veterans from foreclosure, and prevent VA from hav-
ing to maintain a property post foreclosure.
Section 3: Partial Claim Program of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs
This section would amend subsection III of Chapter 37 of Title
38 to establish the partial claim program for five years after enact-
ment of the legislation. This section would establish the program
itself. The program would allow the Secretary to cover up to 25%
of the unpaid principal balance of the original loan for a primary
residence. This bill would also provide relief for a veteran during
a natural disaster; if the President declares a major disaster a vet-
eran or servicemember would be eligible for an additional partial
claim of 25% during the duration of the declaration, or for 120 days
after the President declares the major disaster. Specific individuals
who were working through other loss mitigation options because of
COVID–19 up until May 1, 2025, may qualify for a partial claim
up to 30% of their unpaid principal balance to account for extra ar-
rears because of the foreclosure moratorium that existed during
that time period.
The Committee believes that allowing an additional 5% of the
unpaid principal balance to be covered for those veterans experi-
encing financial hardships due to COVID would help them avoid
foreclosure. The allowance of multiple partial claims for victims of
a Presidentially declared major disaster may also assist veterans in
avoiding foreclosure, which generally would cost VA more than al-

lowing for other loss mitigation options. Additionally, by placing a
time limitation on the window to apply for a partial claim in the
event of a major disaster, the federal government would prevent in-
dividuals who have missed payments not because of the disaster,
but by being in the area of the disaster, from applying for a partial
claim. The Committee is supportive of VA establishing a partial
claim program as part of VA’s loss mitigation process. This would
allow veterans more options to get back on their feet when dealing
with temporary financial hardship and prevent veteran homeless-
ness.
Section 4: Strategy of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Regarding
the Effect of Certain Litigation
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) was sued by buyers
in several states who alleged that the way compensation for real
estate agents was set by the industry violated the law. The NAR
entered into an agreement to settle numerous class action lawsuits
alleging antitrust violations. The terms of NAR’s settlement agree-
ment, which were established in August 2024 and approved by the
court in November 2024, included industry practice changes that
impacted the settlement and payment of buyer’s agent commis-
sions. In some transactions, sellers may choose not to pay buyer
broker compensation, particularly if competing buyers offer to cover
the cost themselves. The settlement created a difficult situation for
veteran buyers. Under the home loan program at VA, veterans
were not permitted to pay a buyer agent to represent them. As the
implementation date approached, VA temporarily lifted its long-
standing policy that prohibited veterans from paying fees or com-
missions to real estate agents or brokers on a VA home loan.
This section would require VA to develop a long-term strategy to
help ensure that veterans remain competitive buyers in the hous-
ing market. The Committee believes this is important because the
strategy must guarantee that a veteran using a home loan backed
by VA is not at a disadvantage when securing representation from
a real estate agent or broker. While VA has published interim guid-
ance, this would ensure that VA creates a long-term strategy to
maintain the competitiveness of VA home loans for veteran home-
buyers.
Section 5: Increase Authorizations of Appropriations for Comprehen-
sive Service Programs for Homeless Veterans
In P.L. 118–210, the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Vet-
erans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act (the Dole Act),
Section 402, authorized an increase in the funding for the Grant
Per Diem (GPD) program. The GPD rate increased during the
COVID pandemic, and this provision increased the GPD from 115%
to 133%, with certain providers in the program receiving 200%.
This section would ensure there was sufficient authorization to
cover the cost of the increase in the GPD rate. The Committee be-
lieves this authorization of funding is essential to pay for the Dole
Act that was signed into law on January 2, 2025.

SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On April 9, 2025, the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity
held an open markup session on H.R. 1815.
An amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered by Sub-
committee Chairman Van Orden. This amendment in the nature of
a substitute would strike a specific termination date and change it
to three years after enactment of the law. This amendment in the
nature of a substitute would also remove the interest rate on the
partial claim to be in line with other federal home loan programs.
This amendment was agreed to by voice vote.
Ranking Member Pappas offered a substitute amendment to H.R.
1815, as amended. This amendment would require VA to carry out
the VA Service Purchase Program (VASP) by amending the statute.
This substitute amendment would also allow VA to pay the servicer
any unpaid loan balance plus accrued interest. Subcommittee
Ranking Member Pappas requested a recorded vote on this sub-
stitute amendment. This amendment failed by recorded vote of 5–
3.
Ranking Member Pappas offered a substitute amendment to H.R.
1815, as amended. This amendment would repeal VASP when par-
tial claim legislation is enacted into law. Additionally, this sub-
stitute amendment would implement a permanent partial claim
program at VA at 30% of the unpaid principal. Additionally, under
this legislation, there would not be a maximum number of times
a veteran could use a partial claim. The partial claim language is

identical to Representative Deluzio and Senators Tester and
Brown’s legislation from last Congress. Ranking Member Pappas
requested a recorded vote on this substitute amendment. This
amendment failed by a recorded vote of 5–3.
A motion by Rep. Barrett to favorably forward H.R. 1815, as
amended, to the full Committee, was agreed to by voice vote.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion, a quorum being present, and ordered H.R. 1815, as amended,
to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives by voice
vote. During consideration of the bill one amendment to the
amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered by Represent-
ative Van Orden. This amendment, in the nature of a substitute,
would ensure that a partial claim does not count against the cur-
rent or existing loan guarantee. The amendment in the nature of
a substitute would also extend the program to five years and in-
crease the amount of unpaid principal that could be covered by a
partial claim to 25%.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
to H.R. 1815 was offered by Ranking Member Takano. This amend-
ment would allow the amount of unpaid principal balance that
could be covered by a partial claim to be increased to 30% partial
claim for veterans who missed a payment starting on March 1,
2020, until May 1, 2025. This amendment would also provide dis-
aster relief when the President declares a major disaster by permit-
ting a veteran who is a victim of a disaster to enter into more than
one partial claim of 25%. Additionally, this amendment would au-
thorize funding for the Grant Per-Diem (GPD) provision in the Dole
Act. This amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute was agreed to by voice vote.
An additional amendment to the amendment in the nature of a
substitute was offered by Ranking Member Takano. This amend-
ment would encourage VA to continue to use the authorities under
VASP. Additionally, the amendment would create a 90-day fore-
closure moratorium after the enactment ofthe bill. This amendment
to the amendment in the nature of a substitute failed by a recorded
vote of 11–13.
A motion by Representative Bergman to report H.R. 1815, as
amended, favorably to the House of Representatives, was agreed to
by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
In compliance with clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, one recorded vote was taken on amend-
ments or in connection with ordering H.R. 1815, as amended, favor-
ably reported to the House.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 1815, as amended, are to authorize and establish
a partial claim program within the VA Home Loan Program. Addi-
tionally, the legislation would increase authorization caps from
$257 million to $344 million for the Grant and Per-Diem program
for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 1815, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the Congressional Budget Of-
fice cost estimate on this measure.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST
ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1969,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
The bill would:
• Establish a Partial Claim Program through which the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) would pay lenders amounts

to prevent foreclosure on guaranteed loans that are delinquent
or in default
• Temporarily increase the amounts authorized for the
Grant and Per Diem Program through which VA awards fund-
ing to organizations to provide transitional housing for vet-
erans
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Paying partial claims to lenders to avoid foreclosure of
loans guaranteed by VA
• Increasing grants to organizations providing transitional
housing for veterans
Bill summary: H.R. 1815 would temporarily increase the
amounts authorized for the Grant and Per Diem Program through
which The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awards funding to
organizations to provide transitional housing for veterans. The bill
also would establish a Partial Claim Program through which VA
would pay lenders amounts to prevent foreclosure on guaranteed
loans that are delinquent or in default.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effects of H.R.
1815 are shown in Table 1. The bill would decrease net direct
spending by $147 million and increase spending subject to appro-
priation by $146 million over the 2025–2035 period. The costs of
the legislation fall within budget function 700 (veterans benefits
and services).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R.
1815 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and that provisions will
take effect upon or soon after enactment. CBO also estimates that
outlays will follow historical spending patterns for affected pro-
grams.
Provisions that affect spending subject to appropriation and di-
rect spending: Section 5 would temporarily increase the amounts
authorized for the Grant and Per Diem Program through which VA
pays a daily rate to public and nonprofit entities that provide hous-
ing and supportive services to homeless veterans.
Current law limits the total amount that VA can award for those
grants to $258 million each year; section 5 would raise that limit
to $344 million for 2025 and 2026. Using information on past grant
payments and historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that the
amounts paid for grants would increase by a total of $169 million
over the 2025–2035 period.
Some of the homeless veterans who would obtain services under
section 5 would be veterans who have been exposed to environ-

mental hazards; thus, CBO expects that some of the costs of imple-
menting the bill would be paid from the Toxic Exposures Fund
(TEF) established by Public Law 117–168, the Honoring our PACT
Act. The TEF is a mandatory appropriation that VA uses to pay
for health care, disability claims processing, medical research, and
information technology modernization that benefit veterans who
were exposed to environmental hazards. Additional spending from
the TEF occurs if legislation increases the costs of similar activities
that benefit veterans with such exposure. Thus, in addition to in-
creasing spending subject to appropriation, enacting section 5
would increase amounts paid from the TEF, which are classified as
direct spending.
CBO projects that the proportion of costs paid by the TEF will
grow over time based on the amount of formerly discretionary ap-
propriations that CBO expects will be provided through the manda-
tory appropriation as specified in the Honoring our PACT Act.1
CBO estimates that over the 2025–2035 period, implementing sec-
tion 5 would increase outlays for spending subject to appropriation
by $146 million and direct spending by $23 million.
Direct spending: The discussion above in ‘‘Provisions That Affect
Spending Subject to Appropriation and Direct Spending’’ describes
the increased authorizations for the Grant and Per Diem Program
that would increase direct spending from the TEF under section 5.
Section 3 of the bill would establish a Partial Claim Program de-
scribed below, which would decrease direct spending. In total, the
bill would decrease net direct spending outlays by $147 million
over the 2025–2035 period (see Table 2).
Partial Claim Program. VA provides loan guarantees to lenders
that allow eligible borrowers to obtain better loan terms—such as
lower interest rates or smaller down payments—to purchase, con-
struct, improve, or refinance a home. VA typically pays lenders up
to 25 percent of the outstanding mortgage balance if a borrower’s
home is foreclosed upon. Those payments, net of fees paid by bor-
rowers and recoveries by lenders, constitute the subsidy cost for the
loan guarantees.2 Such costs are paid from mandatory appropria-
tions and, thus, are reflected in the budget as direct spending.
Section 3 would establish a Partial Claim Program through
which VA would pay lenders amounts to prevent foreclosure on
guaranteed loans that are in or at risk of default. That amount
would cover a portion of indebtedness sufficient to prevent or re-
solve the default, not to exceed 25 percent of the outstanding mort-
gage balance (or 30 percent if the borrower became delinquent be-
fore May 1, 2025). The partial claim payment would be classified
as a direct loan from VA to the delinquent borrower. Those direct
loans would be secured by a government lien on the property and
would not accrue interest. The bill would authorize one partial
1For additional information about estimated spending from the TEF, see CBO’s most recent
table with details about baseline projections: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-01/60044-
2025-01-tef.pdf.
2Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the subsidy cost of a loan guarantee is the
net present value of estimated payments by the government to cover defaults and delinquencies,
interest subsidies, or other expenses offset by any payments to the government, including origi-
nation or other fees, penalties, and recoveries on defaulted loans. Such subsidy costs are cal-
culated by discounting those expected cash flows using the rate on Treasury securities of com-
parable maturity. The resulting estimated subsidy costs are recorded in the budget when the
loans are disbursed or modified. A positive subsidy indicates that the loan results in net outlays
from the Treasury; a negative subsidy indicates that the loan results in net receipts to the
Treasury.

claim on a loan guaranteed by the department, unless subsequent
delinquencies occur within 120 days following a major disaster de-
clared by the President. A partial claim would not reduce the
amount of VA’s guarantee on the existing loan. The authority for
the program would expire five years after the enactment of
H.R.1815. In CBO’s estimation, that program also would reduce
costs of the loan guarantees the VA provides.
Using its projection of loan volume based on data provided by
VA, CBO expects that VA will pay roughly 12,200 partial claims
on behalf of borrowers at an average amount of $27,200 over the
course of the program. In addition, CBO estimates that some of
those loans would not be repaid by the borrowers. The combination
of defaults and lack of interest income result in a subsidy rate of
37 percent and total subsidy costs of $124 million over the 2025–
2035 period, CBO estimates.
Other Loan Effects. In addition to the costs described above,
CBO expects that the partial claims payments under section 3
would reduce the number of foreclosures on guaranteed loans. As
a result, they would reduce the net amount that VA pays related
to defaults on those guaranteed loans by an estimated $294 million
over the 2025–2035 period.
Taken together, CBO estimates that enacting section 3 would de-
crease net direct spending by $170 million over the 2025–2035 pe-
riod.

Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go proce-
dures are shown in Table 2.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting H.R. 1815 would not increase net direct spend-
ing or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year peri-
ods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: H.R. 1815 contains an intergovernmental and private-
sector mandate, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). By not allowing judicial review of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs decision to obtain secured interest in a veteran’s de-
faulted home loan, the bill would eliminate an existing right of ac-
tion for any public or private entity that would otherwise be able
to seek judicial review. There is no cost associated with this man-
date because judicial review does not result in monetary damages;
the cost is therefore well below the thresholds established in
UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($103
million and $206 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually
for inflation).
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Paul B.A. Holland; Man-
dates: Grace Watson.
Estimate reviewed by: David Newman, Chief, Defense, Inter-
national Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost Estimates Unit; Kath-
leen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; Chris-
tina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.

Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT

trol Act (as amended by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandate
Reform Act, P.L. 104–4 is inapplicable to H.R. 1815, as amended.

No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act would be created by H.R. 1815, as
amended.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H.R. 1815, as amended, does not relate

STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1815, as amended, would establish or reauthorize a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section would establish the short title of the bill as the ‘‘VA
Home Loan Program Reform Act.’’
Section 2. Authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take cer-
tain actions in the case of a default on the home loan guaran-
teed by the Secretary
This section would amend 38 U.S.C. §3732 by adding in a sub-
section that would grant VA the authority to establish ae partial
claim option as part of the loss mitigation waterfall process before
foreclosure. Under this subsection the VA Secretary shall, on a ran-
dom sampling basis, post a payment audit to ensure compliance
with the requirements. The VA Secretary would also be required
to establish a mandatory sequence for the loss mitigation waterfall
within the VA Home Loan program.
Section 3. Partial claim program of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs
This section would amend Subchapter III of chapter 37 of Title
38 in order to establish and implement a partial claim program at
VA. The payments made to a lender under the partial claim pro-
gram to bring a mortgage loan up-to-date would not count against
the 25% that VA guarantees to pay the original lender if there is
a foreclosure. The partial claim would pay up to 25% of the unpaid
principal balance to the lender to bring a loan up-to-date. This sec-
tion would also provide disaster relief if the President declares a
major disaster. A veteran or servicemember would be eligible for an
additional partial claim of 25% during the duration of the declara-
tion, or for 120 days after the President declares the major dis-
aster. Specific individuals who were working through other loss
mitigation options due to COVID–19 up until May 1, 2025, may
also qualify for a partial claim up to 30% of their unpaid principal
balance to account for extra arrears that may exist because of the
foreclosure moratorium that existed during that time period. This
section would establish the right to recovery by VA when an indi-
vidual defaults on their mortgage payment even after using a par-
tial claim. This section would terminate the program five years
after the enactment of this law.
Section 4: Strategy of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding
the effect of certain litigation
This section would require that no later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act that the VA Secretary shall submit

to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans’ Affairs a report
on the strategy the VA Secretary will use to ensure that veterans
remain competitive in the real estate market and secure represen-
tation to ensure that veterans are not at a disadvantage in the
marketplace.
Section 5: Increase authorizations of appropriations for comprehen-
sive service programs for homeless veterans
This section would authorize funding for the Grant Per Diem
(GPD) program by amending 38 U.S.C. §2016 in paragraph 7 by
striking ‘‘fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent year after’’ and in-
serting ‘‘each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2024.’’ Adding in a
new subsection that would increase authorizations from
$257,000,000 to $344,000,000 for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026. Be-
ginning in 2027, authorizations would return to $257,000,000.

§3732. Procedure on default
(a)(1) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaran-
teed under this chapter, the holder of the øobligation¿ loan shall
notify the Secretary of such default. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Secretary may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, pay to
such holder the guaranty not in excess of the pro rata portion of
the amount originally guaranteed. Except as provided in section
3703(e) of this title, if the Secretary makes such a payment, the
Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the øob-
ligation¿ loan to the extent of the amount paid on the guaranty.
(2)ø(A) Before suit or foreclosure the holder of the obligation
shall notify the Secretary of the default, and within thirty days
thereafter the Secretary may, at the Secretary’s option, pay the
holder of the obligation the unpaid balance of the obligation plus
accrued interest and receive an assignment of the loan and secu-
rity. Nothing in this section shall preclude any forebearance for the
benefit of the veteran as may be agreed upon by the parties to the
loan and approved by the Secretary.¿ (A) The Secretary may, under
terms and conditions determined by the Secretary—
(i) pay the holder of a loan guaranteed under this chapter an
amount necessary to avoid the foreclosure of such loan;
(ii) require the holder of the loan and the veteran obligated
on the loan to execute all documents necessary to ensure the
Secretary obtains a secured interest in the property covered by
the loan; and
(iii) require the holder of the loan to take any actions nec-
essary to carry out this paragraph, including preparing, exe-
cuting, transmitting, receiving, and recording documents, and
requiring the holder of the loan to place the loan in forbearance.
(B) In the event that a housing loan guaranteed under this chap-
ter is modified under the authority provided under section 1322(b)
of title 11, the Secretary may pay the holder of the øobligation¿
housing loan the unpaid principal balance of the øobligation¿ hous-
ing loan due, plus accrued interest, as of the date of the filing of
the petition under title 11, but only upon the assignment, transfer,
and delivery to the Secretary (in a form and manner satisfactory
to the Secretary) of all rights, interest, claims, evidence, and
records with respect to the housing loan.
(C)(i) Any decision by the Secretary under this paragraph is final
and is not subject to judicial review.
(ii) For purposes of section 511 of this title, any decision under
this paragraph shall not be treated as a decision under a law that
affects the provision of benefits.
(D)(i) The Secretary may establish standards for processing pay-
ments under this paragraph based on a certification by a holder of
a loan guaranteed under this chapter that the holder has complied
with all applicable requirements established by the Secretary.
(ii) The Secretary shall carry out, on a random-sampling basis,
post-payment audits to ensure compliance with all requirements de-
scribed in clause (i).
(3) The Secretary may establish the date, not later than the date
of judgment and decree of foreclosure or sale, upon which accrual
of interest or charges shall cease.
(4)(A) Upon receiving a notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
subsection, the Secretary shall—

(i) provide the veteran with information and, to the extent
feasible, counseling regarding—
(I) alternatives to foreclosure, as appropriate in light of
the veteran’s particular circumstances, including possible
methods of curing the default, conveyance of the property
to the Secretary by means of a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
and the actions authorized by paragraph (2) of this sub-
section; and
(II) what the Department of Veterans Affairs’ and the
veteran’s liabilities would be with respect to the loan in
the event of foreclosure; and
(ii) advise the veteran regarding the availability of such
counseling;
except with respect to loans made by a lender which the Secretary
has determined has a demonstrated record of consistently pro-
viding timely and accurate information to veterans with respect to
such matters.
(B) The Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of appro-
priations, ensure that sufficient personnel are available to admin-
ister subparagraph (A) of this paragraph effectively and efficiently.
(5) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed
or insured under this chapter in which a partial payment has been
tendered by the veteran concerned and refused by the holder, the
holder of the øobligation¿ loan shall notify the Secretary as soon
as such payment has been refused. The Secretary may require that
any such notification include a statement of the circumstances of
the default, the amount tendered, the amount of the indebtedness
on the date of the tender, and the reasons for the holder’s refusal.
(b) With respect to any loan made under section 3711 which has
not been sold as provided in subsection (g) of such section, if the
Secretary finds, after there has been a default in the payment of
any installment of principal or interest owing on such loan, that
the default was due to the fact that the veteran who is obligated
under the loan has become unemployed as the result of the closing
(in whole or in part) of a Federal installation, the Secretary shall
(1) extend the time for curing the default to such time as the Sec-
retary determines is necessary and desirable to enable such vet-
eran to complete payments on such loan, including an extension of
time beyond the stated maturity thereof, or (2) modify the terms
of such loan for the purpose of changing the amortization provi-
sions thereof by recasting, over the remaining term of the loan, or
over such longer period as the Secretary may determine, the total
unpaid amount then due with the modification to become effective
currently or upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of
the period for curing the default.
(c)(1) For purposes of this øsubsection—¿ subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘defaulted loan’’ means a loan that is guaran-
teed under this chapter, that was made for a purpose described
in section 3710(a) of this title, and that is in default.
(B) The term ‘‘liquidation sale’’ means a judicial sale or other
disposition of real property to liquidate a defaulted loan that
is secured by such property.
(C) The term ‘‘net value’’, with respect to real property,
means the amount equal to (i) the fair market value of the
property, minus (ii) the total of the amounts which the Sec-

retary estimates the Secretary would incur (if the Secretary
were to acquire and dispose of the property) for property taxes,
assessments, liens, property maintenance, property improve-
ment, administration, resale (including losses sustained on the
resale of the property), and other costs resulting from the ac-
quisition and disposition of the property, excluding any amount
attributed to the cost to the Government of borrowing funds.
(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of paragraph
(10) of this subsection, the term ‘‘total indebtedness’’, with re-
spect to a defaulted loan, means the amount equal to the total
of (i) the unpaid principal of the loan, (ii) the interest on the
loan as of the date applicable under paragraph (10) of this sub-
section, and (iii) such reasonably necessary and proper charges
(as specified in the loan instrument and permitted by regula-
tions prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection)
associated with liquidation of the loan, including advances for
taxes, insurance, and maintenance or repair of the real prop-
erty securing the loan.
(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph,
this subsection applies to any case in which the holder of a de-
faulted loan undertakes to liquidate the loan by means of a liquida-
tion sale.
(B) This subsection does not apply to a case in which the Sec-
retary proceeds under subsection (a)(2) of this section.
(3)(A) Before carrying out a liquidation sale of real property se-
curing a defaulted loan, the holder of the loan shall notify the Sec-
retary of the proposed sale. Such notice shall be provided in accord-
ance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement
this subsection.
(B) After receiving a notice described in subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph, the Secretary shall determine the net value of the prop-
erty securing the loan and the amount of the total indebtedness
under the loan and shall notify the holder of the loan of the deter-
mination of such net value.
(4) A case referred to in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of this sub-
section as being described in this paragraph is a case in which the
net value of the property securing a defaulted loan exceeds the
amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount
guaranteed under this chapter.
(5) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the
holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan
at a liquidation sale for an amount that does not exceed the lesser
of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness under the
loan—
(A) the holder shall have the option to convey the property
to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of
an amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebt-
edness; and
(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty
under this chapter shall be limited to the amount of such total
indebtedness minus the net value of the property.

net value of the property, whichever is greater.
(7) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the
holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan
at the liquidation sale for an amount that exceeds the lesser of the
total indebtedness under the loan or the net value and—
(A)(i) the amount was the minimum amount for which,
under applicable State law, the property was permitted to be
sold at the liquidation sale, the holder shall have the option to
convey the property to the United States in return for payment
by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of the
amount for which the holder acquired the property or the total
indebtedness under the loan; or
(ii) there was no minimum amount for which the property

law, the holder shall have the option to convey the property to
the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an

ness; and
(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty

(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty
shall be limited to the amount of the total indebtedness under
the loan minus the amount realized by the holder of the loan
incident to the sale at a liquidation sale of the property.
(9) In no event may the liability of the United States under a
guaranteed loan exceed the amount guaranteed with respect to
that loan under section 3703(b) of this title. All determinations
under this subsection of net value and total indebtedness shall be
made by the Secretary.
(10)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this
paragraph, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this sub-
section shall be the date of the liquidation sale of the property se-
curing the loan (or such earlier date following the expiration of a
reasonable period of time for such sale to occur as the Secretary
may specify pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to
implement this subsection).
(B)(i) Subject to division (ii) of this subparagraph, in any case in
which there is a substantial delay in such sale caused by the holder
of the loan exercising øforebearance¿ forbearance at the request of
the Secretary, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this
subsection shall be such date, on or after the date on which
øforebearance¿ forbearance was requested and prior to the date of

timely fashion); or
(ii) by a voluntary case commenced under title 11, United

(D) For the purpose of determining the liability of the United
States under a loan guaranty under paragraphs (5)(B), (6), (7)(B),
and (8)(B), the amount of the total indebtedness with respect to

tion of such total indebtedness as a result of the specification of an
earlier date under subparagraph (C)(i) of this paragraph.

foreclosure of such loan. The Secretary may not purchase an entire
such loan until the veteran has completed such sequence.

resolve a default.
(5) The Secretary may enter into a contract with an appropriate

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
The creation of the GI Bill during World War II offered returning
servicemembers significant assistance as they began the readjust-
ment to civilian life. In addition to the educational benefit that
could provide job training and improved employment outcomes, the
GI Bill offered these newly transitioned veterans a leg up to buy
a home. The first ten years of this benefit represented twenty per-
cent of all U.S. home purchases.1 The terms of the program offered
veterans a way to close on a home with limited money down, com-
petitive mortgage rates, and expanded protections to prevent fore-
closure.
Historically, VA has used the authorities granted as part of the
VA Loan Guarantee program to historically keep foreclosure rates
as the lowest among major loan types.2 However, these low rates
of foreclosure were a reflection of existing authorities and their de-
pendence on consistently low 30-year mortgage rates from banks.
During the COVID–19 pandemic, there was a severe rise in the
number of missed mortgage payments among veterans. Combined
with rising 30-year mortgage rates, the long-used VA foreclosure
mitigation measures lost their effectiveness. This led to the Biden
Administration to use several existing authorities to help as many
veterans as possible to avoid foreclosure. According to VA data, in
2023 alone, these authorities helped over 145,000 veterans and
their families avoid foreclosure.3
In 2024, President Biden built off these successes at VA and of-
fered veterans and servicemembers with delinquencies a new pro-
gram to avoid foreclosure, the Veteran Affairs Servicing Purchase
(VASP) program. This program offered the delinquent payers a way
to refinance into rates not available in the open market. From pro-
gram creation, 18,000 borrowers used VASP prior to the Trump
Administration abruptly ending this program on May 1, 2025.
DIRE RISK TO VETERAN FORECLOSURES
According to lenders and housing trade groups, upwards of
60,000 to 85,000 VA borrowers are still severely delinquent on
their mortgage payments. This means they have missed more than
three consecutive months of payments. As mortgage rates in the
open market remain high compared to recent years, and with the
closure of the VASP program, the only options available to these
borrowers are either selling their home or being foreclosed upon. As

VASP was the program of last resort, ending VASP has accelerated
the risk to these borrowers.
Subcommittee Chairman Van Orden has called VASP a ‘‘dis-
aster,’’ referred to a veteran facing foreclosure as ‘‘bum loan,’’ and
has repeatedly urged VA to end the program—even as officials in
the Trump VA and other witnesses testified to the program’s suc-
cesses. As recently as March 11, 2025, the VA reported, ‘‘We con-
tinue to see strong performance from our VA portfolio. Matter of
fact, we’re up in every category from a loan guarantee standpoint.
We are up a year over year in purchase and refinance as well as,
you know, our comparative default ratios versus other programs.
So, we’re continuing to see VA perform very well against its com-
petition.’’4
The Mortgage Bankers Association also testified on March 11,
2025, that VASP ‘‘has provided critical relief to thousands of vet-
erans whose loan payments became unaffordable in today’s higher
rate environment. While partial claims should be the first line of
defense, VASP has been an essential safety net for borrowers who
had no other options. Without VASP, VA would have foreclosed on
tens of thousands of borrowers.’’5 That is the reality borrowers now
face.
Democratic Members of the Committee continue to call on VA to
reinstate VASP6 (at least in the interim and until an alternative
program is offered) and offer the program to these tens of thou-
sands of borrowers. Helping veteran borrowers upholds the goals
and ideals of the VA Loan Guarantee program—which promised
veterans an easy entry point to home ownership. Further, the pro-
gram is meant to offer protections to veterans to only allow fore-
closure in the most extreme circumstances. As of the date of this
report, President Trump and Secretary Collins have refused to offer
these borrowers any options beyond already exhausted program op-
tions.
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
Based on prior Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports,7
foreclosures cost VA an estimated $60,000 per loan and are always
the most expensive option for the agency. Short of VA reinstating
VASP or putting in place a foreclosure moratorium prior to enact-
ment and implementation of H.R. 1815 as amended into law, the
agency is likely to incur significant costs while placing even more
financial and emotional costs on veterans.
Committee on House Veterans’ Affairs Democrats urge the
Trump administration to take all possible administration actions,
including but not necessarily limited to, reinstating VASP, or
issuing a foreclosure moratorium while this legislation works its
way through Congress and potentially becomes law and is imple-
mented.

Veterans who are at risk of foreclosure, and who would use the
authorities granted by H.R. 1815, as amended, to avoid such fore-
closure, should be offered assistance instead of being unfairly pun-
ished by the unknown timetable to move H.R. 1815, as amended,
from law to functional program.
GRANT PER DIEM FUNDING
Public Law 118–210, the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century
Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act authorized in-
creased per diem payments from VA to homeless providers.8 How-
ever, while S. 141 included offsets identified by the Congressional
Budget Office and required by Republican House Rules to cover the
cost of these per diem payments for the next three years, VA
shared with Congress that they lack authorities to carry out this
portion of law.
H.R. 1815 as amended includes authorization for funding for the
next two years of these payments, however the Committee holds
that these provisions should not require a second offset when they
have already been offset as part of S. 141. Committee Democrats
recommend that the House Budget Committee not require further
offsets for Fiscal Year 2027. The three years of increased funding
granted by S. 141, along with H.R. 1815, as amended, for grant per
diem payments in lieu of a permanent authorization of these au-
thorities is based on an agreement between House and Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committees (Majority and Minority) to determine a
more appropriate method to calculate adequate payments to pro-
viders in the future.
