Purpose and Summary
H.R. 2243, the LEOSA Reform Act, introduced by Rep. Don
Bacon (R–NE), would allow qualified active and retired law en-
forcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition in
school zones, national parks, private property that is open to the
public, and in some federal facilities that are open to the public.
The bill also reduces the frequency with which retired law enforce-
ment officers are required to meet certain qualification standards.
Background and Need for the Legislation
In 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Law Enforcement
Officers’ Safety Act (LEOSA) into law.1 The purpose of LEOSA is
to exempt qualified active and retired law enforcement officers car-
rying a LEOSA photographic identification card from local and
state prohibitions on the carrying of concealed firearms, with cer-
tain restrictions and exceptions.2 Congress amended LEOSA in the
Law Enforcement Officers’ Safety Act Improvement Act of 2010
and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013.3 These
amendments clarified who can qualify as a law enforcement officer
under LEOSA and also made minor changes to the certification re-
quirements for qualified retired law enforcement officers.4 For ex-
ample, the LEOSA Improvements Act of 2010 reduced the number
of years of service needed for a retired law enforcement officer to
be qualified under LEOSA from 15 to 10 years.5
LEOSA preempts state and local laws regarding the concealed
carrying of a firearm with two important exceptions. LEOSA does
not supersede or limit state laws that ‘‘permit private persons or
entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms
on their property,’’6 such as bars, amusement parks, and clubs.7
Additionally, LEOSA does not supersede or limit state laws that
‘‘prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local
government property, installation, building, base, or park.’’8

Qualified Active or Retired Law Enforcement Officer
In order to have the right to carry a concealed firearm under
LEOSA, a person must be either a ‘‘qualified active law enforce-
ment officer’’ or a ‘‘qualified retired law enforcement officer.’’9
LEOSA defines a ‘‘qualified active law enforcement officer’’ as an
employee of a governmental agency who: (1) is authorized by law
to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation,
prosecution, or the incarceration of any person for any violation of
law; (2) has statutory powers of arrest or apprehension under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); (3) is authorized by the
agency to carry a firearm; (4) is not the subject of any disciplinary
action by the agency which could result in suspension or loss of po-
lice powers; (5) meets the standards, if any, established by the
agency which require the employee to regularly qualify in the use
of a firearm; (6) is not under the influence of alcohol or another in-
toxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance; and (7) is not prohib-
ited by federal law from possessing a firearm.10
LEOSA defines a ‘‘qualified retired law enforcement officer’’ as
an individual who: (1) separated from service in good standing from
a public agency as a law enforcement officer; (2) was authorized by
law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investiga-
tion, prosecution, or the incarceration of any person for any viola-
tion of law; (3) served as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate
of 10 years or more or was separated from service due a service-
connected disability; (4) in the past 12 months has met the stand-
ards for qualification in firearms training for active law enforce-
ment officers as determined by the former agency of the individual
or the state in which the individual resides or, if the state has not
established such standards, either a law enforcement agency with-
in the state in which the individual resides or the standards used
by a certified firearms instructor qualified to conduct a firearms
qualification test for active duty LEOs within that state; (5) has
not been officially found by a qualified medical professional em-
ployed by the agency to be unqualified for reasons relating to men-
tal health; (6) is not under the influence of alcohol or another in-
toxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance; and (7) is not prohib-
ited by federal law from possessing a firearm.11
LEOSA Reform Act
The LEOSA Reform Act will make several necessary and impor-
tant changes to LEOSA to support America’s active and retired law
enforcement officers.
• First, it amends the Gun-Free School Zones Act (GFSZA)
to provide an exemption for law enforcement officers certified
under LEOSA to carry a concealed firearm in a gun-free school
zone. Some states currently allow individuals with a concealed
carry license to carry a concealed firearm in a gun-free school
zone in the state in which they are licensed.12 However, under
current law, LEOSA-certified law enforcement officers are pro-
hibited from carrying a concealed firearm in a gun-free school

zone. For example, a law enforcement officer who retired from
the police force after twenty-five years and is otherwise in good
standing and compliant under LEOSA would be prohibited by
federal law from carrying a concealed firearm to his child’s
sports event at a local high school even though the state’s con-
cealed carry law would allow it. This legislation would fix this
discrepancy.
• Second, the LEOSA Reform Act would allow law enforce-
ment officers certified under LEOSA to carry concealed fire-
arms on ‘‘common or contract carriers’’ like public transpor-
tation and also allow them to carry concealed firearms in na-
tional parks.
• Third, it would clarify that law enforcement officers who
are certified under LEOSA are not subject to state or local
laws that restrict magazine capacity.
• Fourth, the bill allows states to require LEOSA-certified
retired law enforcement officers to certify in firearms training
up to every 36 months, as opposed to current law which re-
quires a certification in firearms training every 12 months.
• Fifth, the bill allows LEOSA-certified law enforcement offi-
cers to carry in certain federal facilities that are determined to
be a Facility Security Level I or II civilian public access facil-
ity. The facility security level is set by the Department of
Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service and the Gen-
eral Services Administration in consultation with the client
agency.13 A facility that receives a Level I or Level II deter-
mination are deemed to be low or medium risk for adversarial
threats.14 These facilities include U.S. Post Offices or Social
Security Administration Offices. Currently, law enforcement of-
ficers can only enter these federal facilities while armed when
acting in an ‘‘official capacity,’’ such as a call for service.15
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 2243: ‘‘The Right to Self
Defense’’ a hearing held on March 4, 2025, before Subcommittee on
Crime and Federal Government Surveillance of the Committee on
the Judiciary. The Subcommittee heard testimony from the fol-
lowing witnesses:
• Doug Ritter, Founder and Chair of Knife Rights, Inc. and
Knife Rights Foundation;
• Diana Muller, Founder of Women for Gun Rights;
• Dave McDermott, Founding Partner of McDermott Law
Group and USCCA Network Attorney; and
• Gregory Jackson, Jr., Former Deputy Director, White
House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
The hearing examined the individual’s right to self-defense, pro-
tected by the Second Amendment, and also examined the efficacy
of gun control policies and the related effect on public safety. In

Committee Oversight Findings
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of House rule XIII, the Com-
mittee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to filing of the report and is included in the report.
Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2243 from the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office:
H.R. 2243 would expand the authority for some current off-duty
and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms.
Under the bill, those officers could carry concealed firearms in
school zones, national parks, certain federal facilities, and private
property and property owned by state and local governments that
is open to the public or used for transportation purposes. Under
current law, carrying a firearm in those locations is generally un-
lawful. H.R. 2243 also would allow states to reduce the frequency
for which retired law enforcement officers must be certified to carry
a concealed firearm.
Because the bill would not have a significant effect on the scope
of work conducted by federal law enforcement officers, CBO esti-
mates that implementing the bill would have no significant cost;

any related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
H.R. 2243 would impose private-sector and intergovernmental
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). The bill expands an existing preemption of state and local
laws by allowing qualified current and retired law enforcement offi-
cers to carry concealed firearms on public transport, certain gov-
ernment owned properties, and on public and private transpor-
tation carriers. That preemption of state law also imposes a pri-
vate-sector mandate by restricting a private party’s right to pro-
hibit firearms on private property.
Although it would limit the application of state and local laws,
CBO estimates that the preemption would impose no costs. There
also are no costs associated with the private-sector mandate.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Jeremy Crimm (for
federal costs) and Erich Dvorak (for mandates). The estimate was
reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
Committee Estimate of Budgetary Effects
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee adopts
as its own the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974.
Duplication of Federal Programs
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House rule XIII, no provision of H.R.
2243 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another federal program.
Performance Goals and Objectives
The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House
rule XIII, H.R. 2243 would allow qualified active and retired law
enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition in
school zones, national parks, private property that is open to the
public, and in some federal facilities that are open to the public.
Advisory on Earmarks
In accordance with clause 9 of House rule XXI, H.R. 2243 does
not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits as defined in clauses 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of
House rule XXI.
Federal Mandates Statement
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.

Advisory Committee Statement
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
Applicability to Legislative Branch

gressional Accountability Act (Pub. L. 104–1).

Section 8:
Section-by-Section Analysis
Sec. 1. Short Title. The ‘‘LEOSA Reform Act.’’
Sec. 2. Conforming the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act and
the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. This section amends the
Gun-Free School Zones Act to allow qualified active and retired law
enforcement officers authorized to carry under LEOSA the ability
to carry a concealed firearm in a gun-free school zone.
Sec. 3. Making Improvements to the Law Enforcement Officer
Safety Act. This section amends LEOSA to allow qualified active
and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms on
‘‘common or contract carriers,’’ such as public transportation and
also allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to
carry concealed firearms in national parks. This section also clari-
fies that qualified active and retired law enforcement officers are
exempt from magazine capacity restrictions imposed by state and
local law. Furthermore, this section allows states to require quali-
fied retired law enforcement officers to certify every 36 months, as
opposed to current law which requires a certification in firearms
training every 12 months. Lastly, this section clarifies that a cer-
tification in firearms training can be conducted by (1) the officer’s
former agency, (2) the state in which the officer resides, (3) any law
enforcement agency within the state in which the officer resides, or
(4) a firearms instructor certified by the state in which the officer
resides to conduct active-duty firearms training.
Sec. 4. Permitting Qualified Current and Retired Law Enforce-
ment Officers to Carry Firearms in Certain Federal Facilities. This

Section 9:
section allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers
to carry a concealed firearm in certain federal facilities, including
a U.S. Post Office, Social Security Administration Office, Veterans
Affairs Office, or similar federal facilities.

(o)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful

(2) This subsection does not apply with respect to—
(A) a transfer to or by, or possession by or under the author-
ity of, the United States or any department or agency thereof
or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision
thereof; or

(A) that, after removal of grips, stocks, and magazines, is not
as detectable as the Security Exemplar, by walk-through metal

plar; or
(B) any major component of which, when subjected to inspec-
tion by the types of x-ray machines commonly used at airports,
does not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape
of the component. Barium sulfate or other compounds may be
used in the fabrication of the component.
(2) For purposes of this subsection—
(A) the term ‘‘firearm’’ does not include the frame or receiver
of any such weapon;
(B) the term ‘‘major component’’ means, with respect to a
firearm, the barrel, the slide or cylinder, or the frame or re-
ceiver of the firearm; and
(C) the term ‘‘Security Exemplar’’ means an object, to be fab-
ricated at the direction of the Attorney General, that is—
(i) constructed of, during the 12-month period beginning
on the date of the enactment of this subsection, 3.7 ounces

bling a handgun; and
(ii) suitable for testing and calibrating metal detectors:
Provided, however, That at the close of such 12-month period, and
at appropriate times thereafter the Attorney General shall promul-
gate regulations to permit the manufacture, importation, sale, ship-
ment, delivery, possession, transfer, or receipt of firearms pre-
viously prohibited under this subparagraph that are as detectable
as a ‘‘Security Exemplar’’ which contains 3.7 ounces of material

and regulations adopted pursuant to this paragraph do not impair
the manufacture of prototype firearms or the development of new
technology.
(4) The Attorney General shall permit the conditional importa-
tion of a firearm by a licensed importer or licensed manufacturer,
for examination and testing to determine whether or not the uncon-
ditional importation of such firearm would violate this subsection.
(5) This subsection shall not apply to any firearm which—
(A) has been certified by the Secretary of Defense or the Di-
rector of Central Intelligence, after consultation with the Attor-
ney General and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration, as necessary for military or intelligence applica-
tions; and
(B) is manufactured for and sold exclusively to military or in-
telligence agencies of the United States.
(6) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any firearm
manufactured in, imported into, or possessed in the United States
before the date of the enactment of the Undetectable Firearms Act
of 1988.
(q)(1) The Congress finds and declares that—
(A) crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, is a
pervasive, nationwide problem;
(B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate
movement of drugs, guns, and criminal gangs;
(C) firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate com-
merce and have been found in increasing numbers in and
around schools, as documented in numerous hearings in both
the Committee on the Judiciary the House of Representatives
and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;
(D) in fact, even before the sale of a firearm, the gun, its
component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from
which they are made have considerably moved in interstate
commerce;
(E) while criminals freely move from State to State, ordinary
citizens and foreign visitors may fear to travel to or through
certain parts of the country due to concern about violent crime
and gun violence, and parents may decline to send their chil-
dren to school for the same reason;
(F) the occurrence of violent crime in school zones has re-
sulted in a decline in the quality of education in our country;
(G) this decline in the quality of education has an adverse
impact on interstate commerce and the foreign commerce of
the United States;
(H) States, localities, and school systems find it almost im-
possible to handle gun-related crime by themselves—even
States, localities, and school systems that have made strong ef-
forts to prevent, detect, and punish gun-related crime find
their efforts unavailing due in part to the failure or inability
of other States or localities to take strong measures; and
(I) the Congress has the power, under the interstate com-
merce clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact
measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation’s
schools by enactment of this subsection.

sess a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects inter-

has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.
(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the possession of a fire-
arm—
(i) on private property not part of school grounds;
(ii) if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do
so by the State in which the school zone is located or a political
subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or political
subdivision requires that, before an individual obtains such a
license, the law enforcement authorities of the State or polit-

public or private lands open to hunting, if the entry on school
premises is authorized by school authoritiesø.¿; or
(viii) by an individual authorized by section 926B or 926C to
carry a concealed firearm.

ful for any person, knowingly or with reckless disregard for the
safety of another, to discharge or attempt to discharge a firearm
that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign
commerce at a place that the person knows is a school zone.
(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the discharge of a fire-
arm—

zone, by an individual who is participating in the program;
(iii) by an individual in accordance with a contract entered
into between a school in a school zone and the individual or an
employer of the individual; or
(iv) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official
capacity.
(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preempting
or preventing a State or local government from enacting a statute
establishing gun free school zones as provided in this subsection.
(r) It shall be unlawful for any person to assemble from imported
parts any semiautomatic rifle or any shotgun which is identical to
any rifle or shotgun prohibited from importation under section
925(d)(3) of this chapter as not being particularly suitable for or
readily adaptable to sporting purposes except that this subsection

for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer
to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun (other than the return of a

Dissenting Views
I oppose H.R. 2243, the LEOSA Reform Act.
In 2004, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Officer Safety
Act (LEOSA), a law that allows both off-duty and retired law en-
forcement officers to carry concealed firearms irrespective of state
law. LEOSA preempted states’ judgments about what was best for
their communities and their residents, forcing all states to allow
off-duty and retired law enforcement to carry concealed firearms
under the terms set by Congress.
As Congress debated LEOSA more than 20 years ago, Members
of this Committee on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns
about how the bill violated the principles of federalism and under-
mined states’ rights. The Republican Chairman of the Judiciary
Committee at the time, Congressman Sensenbrenner, opposed
LEOSA for this reason.1 Several police groups also opposed this
legislation and expressed concerns about how it would affect officer
safety, how it could create more confusion in responding to active
shooters, how it might expose their agencies to more liability when
officers carried under LEOSA, and the insufficiency of require-
ments for retired officers.
Despite these concerns, LEOSA became law—though it did in-
clude some important limitations and imposed commonsense train-
ing requirements, which have been in place for more than 20 years.
H.R. 2243, the LEOSA Reform Act, would end what little right
states have to limit when and where individuals may carry con-
cealed firearms under LEOSA. It would force states to allow retired
and current officers to carry concealed firearms onto private prop-
erty open to the public, including restaurants, bars, parks, and
playgrounds. It would also force states to allow off-duty and retired
officers to carry concealed firearms on buses, trains, and subways.
And it would even force states to allow for the concealed carry of
firearms in Gun-Free School Zones. H.R. 2243 also allows off-duty
and retired law enforcement officers to completely disregard state
laws prohibiting high-capacity magazines.
This legislation not only supersedes the judgment of the states,
but it also threatens the safety and security of federal agencies by
forcing them to allow concealed carry under LEOSA in many fed-
eral buildings. Forcing federal offices and buildings to allow con-
cealed carry in these places is a completely unnecessary risk.
Another troubling aspect of this legislation is that it weakens
training standards. Under current law, a person carrying a firearm
under LEOSA must meet state training requirements every year,
but H.R. 2243 would allow individuals to concealed carry with
training certification as sparingly as every three years. This is
troubling given that the bill extends nationwide concealed carry to
retired officers who are no longer receiving the training that accom-
panies their employment.
All of these expansions are profoundly risky given the large num-
ber of people this new law would apply to: we know there are more
than 700,000 active law enforcement officers nationwide.2 And

while we don’t know the exact number of retired officers in the
United States, we know this number has increased significantly in
recent years as many police departments across the country have
faced sharp increases in retirement rates. One study found that
there are four retired officers and four resigned officers for every
100 active officers each year.3 Therefore, the universe of people this
bill would apply to is substantial.
Of course, our colleagues wish it were the case that a ‘‘good guy’’
with a gun is the answer to a ‘‘bad guy’’ with a gun, but the re-
search does not bear this out. Studies show that individuals suc-
cessfully defend themselves with a gun in less than 1% of crimes
involving personal contact.4 Gun accidents and unnecessary esca-
lation are pervasive threats.
We have dozens of legislative proposals that we know would
make our communities safer, while still respecting states’ rights.
This bill is not one of them.
I urge all my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

Purpose and Summary
H.R. 2243, the LEOSA Reform Act, introduced by Rep. Don
Bacon (R–NE), would allow qualified active and retired law en-
forcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition in
school zones, national parks, private property that is open to the
public, and in some federal facilities that are open to the public.
The bill also reduces the frequency with which retired law enforce-
ment officers are required to meet certain qualification standards.
Background and Need for the Legislation
In 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Law Enforcement
Officers’ Safety Act (LEOSA) into law.1 The purpose of LEOSA is
to exempt qualified active and retired law enforcement officers car-
rying a LEOSA photographic identification card from local and
state prohibitions on the carrying of concealed firearms, with cer-
tain restrictions and exceptions.2 Congress amended LEOSA in the
Law Enforcement Officers’ Safety Act Improvement Act of 2010
and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013.3 These
amendments clarified who can qualify as a law enforcement officer
under LEOSA and also made minor changes to the certification re-
quirements for qualified retired law enforcement officers.4 For ex-
ample, the LEOSA Improvements Act of 2010 reduced the number
of years of service needed for a retired law enforcement officer to
be qualified under LEOSA from 15 to 10 years.5
LEOSA preempts state and local laws regarding the concealed
carrying of a firearm with two important exceptions. LEOSA does
not supersede or limit state laws that ‘‘permit private persons or
entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms
on their property,’’6 such as bars, amusement parks, and clubs.7
Additionally, LEOSA does not supersede or limit state laws that
‘‘prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local
government property, installation, building, base, or park.’’8

Qualified Active or Retired Law Enforcement Officer
In order to have the right to carry a concealed firearm under
LEOSA, a person must be either a ‘‘qualified active law enforce-
ment officer’’ or a ‘‘qualified retired law enforcement officer.’’9
LEOSA defines a ‘‘qualified active law enforcement officer’’ as an
employee of a governmental agency who: (1) is authorized by law
to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation,
prosecution, or the incarceration of any person for any violation of
law; (2) has statutory powers of arrest or apprehension under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); (3) is authorized by the
agency to carry a firearm; (4) is not the subject of any disciplinary
action by the agency which could result in suspension or loss of po-
lice powers; (5) meets the standards, if any, established by the
agency which require the employee to regularly qualify in the use
of a firearm; (6) is not under the influence of alcohol or another in-
toxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance; and (7) is not prohib-
ited by federal law from possessing a firearm.10
LEOSA defines a ‘‘qualified retired law enforcement officer’’ as
an individual who: (1) separated from service in good standing from
a public agency as a law enforcement officer; (2) was authorized by
law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investiga-
tion, prosecution, or the incarceration of any person for any viola-
tion of law; (3) served as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate
of 10 years or more or was separated from service due a service-
connected disability; (4) in the past 12 months has met the stand-
ards for qualification in firearms training for active law enforce-
ment officers as determined by the former agency of the individual
or the state in which the individual resides or, if the state has not
established such standards, either a law enforcement agency with-
in the state in which the individual resides or the standards used
by a certified firearms instructor qualified to conduct a firearms
qualification test for active duty LEOs within that state; (5) has
not been officially found by a qualified medical professional em-
ployed by the agency to be unqualified for reasons relating to men-
tal health; (6) is not under the influence of alcohol or another in-
toxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance; and (7) is not prohib-
ited by federal law from possessing a firearm.11
LEOSA Reform Act
The LEOSA Reform Act will make several necessary and impor-
tant changes to LEOSA to support America’s active and retired law
enforcement officers.
• First, it amends the Gun-Free School Zones Act (GFSZA)
to provide an exemption for law enforcement officers certified
under LEOSA to carry a concealed firearm in a gun-free school
zone. Some states currently allow individuals with a concealed
carry license to carry a concealed firearm in a gun-free school
zone in the state in which they are licensed.12 However, under
current law, LEOSA-certified law enforcement officers are pro-
hibited from carrying a concealed firearm in a gun-free school

zone. For example, a law enforcement officer who retired from
the police force after twenty-five years and is otherwise in good
standing and compliant under LEOSA would be prohibited by
federal law from carrying a concealed firearm to his child’s
sports event at a local high school even though the state’s con-
cealed carry law would allow it. This legislation would fix this
discrepancy.
• Second, the LEOSA Reform Act would allow law enforce-
ment officers certified under LEOSA to carry concealed fire-
arms on ‘‘common or contract carriers’’ like public transpor-
tation and also allow them to carry concealed firearms in na-
tional parks.
• Third, it would clarify that law enforcement officers who
are certified under LEOSA are not subject to state or local
laws that restrict magazine capacity.
• Fourth, the bill allows states to require LEOSA-certified
retired law enforcement officers to certify in firearms training
up to every 36 months, as opposed to current law which re-
quires a certification in firearms training every 12 months.
• Fifth, the bill allows LEOSA-certified law enforcement offi-
cers to carry in certain federal facilities that are determined to
be a Facility Security Level I or II civilian public access facil-
ity. The facility security level is set by the Department of
Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service and the Gen-
eral Services Administration in consultation with the client
agency.13 A facility that receives a Level I or Level II deter-
mination are deemed to be low or medium risk for adversarial
threats.14 These facilities include U.S. Post Offices or Social
Security Administration Offices. Currently, law enforcement of-
ficers can only enter these federal facilities while armed when
acting in an ‘‘official capacity,’’ such as a call for service.15
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 2243: ‘‘The Right to Self
Defense’’ a hearing held on March 4, 2025, before Subcommittee on
Crime and Federal Government Surveillance of the Committee on
the Judiciary. The Subcommittee heard testimony from the fol-
lowing witnesses:
• Doug Ritter, Founder and Chair of Knife Rights, Inc. and
Knife Rights Foundation;
• Diana Muller, Founder of Women for Gun Rights;
• Dave McDermott, Founding Partner of McDermott Law
Group and USCCA Network Attorney; and
• Gregory Jackson, Jr., Former Deputy Director, White
House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
The hearing examined the individual’s right to self-defense, pro-
tected by the Second Amendment, and also examined the efficacy
of gun control policies and the related effect on public safety. In

Committee Oversight Findings
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of House rule XIII, the Com-
mittee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to filing of the report and is included in the report.
Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2243 from the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office:
H.R. 2243 would expand the authority for some current off-duty
and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms.
Under the bill, those officers could carry concealed firearms in
school zones, national parks, certain federal facilities, and private
property and property owned by state and local governments that
is open to the public or used for transportation purposes. Under
current law, carrying a firearm in those locations is generally un-
lawful. H.R. 2243 also would allow states to reduce the frequency
for which retired law enforcement officers must be certified to carry
a concealed firearm.
Because the bill would not have a significant effect on the scope
of work conducted by federal law enforcement officers, CBO esti-
mates that implementing the bill would have no significant cost;

any related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
H.R. 2243 would impose private-sector and intergovernmental
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). The bill expands an existing preemption of state and local
laws by allowing qualified current and retired law enforcement offi-
cers to carry concealed firearms on public transport, certain gov-
ernment owned properties, and on public and private transpor-
tation carriers. That preemption of state law also imposes a pri-
vate-sector mandate by restricting a private party’s right to pro-
hibit firearms on private property.
Although it would limit the application of state and local laws,
CBO estimates that the preemption would impose no costs. There
also are no costs associated with the private-sector mandate.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Jeremy Crimm (for
federal costs) and Erich Dvorak (for mandates). The estimate was
reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
Committee Estimate of Budgetary Effects
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee adopts
as its own the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974.
Duplication of Federal Programs
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House rule XIII, no provision of H.R.
2243 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another federal program.
Performance Goals and Objectives
The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House
rule XIII, H.R. 2243 would allow qualified active and retired law
enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition in
school zones, national parks, private property that is open to the
public, and in some federal facilities that are open to the public.
Advisory on Earmarks
In accordance with clause 9 of House rule XXI, H.R. 2243 does
not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits as defined in clauses 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of
House rule XXI.
Federal Mandates Statement
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.

Advisory Committee Statement
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
Applicability to Legislative Branch
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Pub. L. 104–1).
Section-by-Section Analysis
Sec. 1. Short Title. The ‘‘LEOSA Reform Act.’’
Sec. 2. Conforming the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act and
the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. This section amends the
Gun-Free School Zones Act to allow qualified active and retired law
enforcement officers authorized to carry under LEOSA the ability
to carry a concealed firearm in a gun-free school zone.
Sec. 3. Making Improvements to the Law Enforcement Officer
Safety Act. This section amends LEOSA to allow qualified active
and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms on
‘‘common or contract carriers,’’ such as public transportation and
also allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to
carry concealed firearms in national parks. This section also clari-
fies that qualified active and retired law enforcement officers are
exempt from magazine capacity restrictions imposed by state and
local law. Furthermore, this section allows states to require quali-
fied retired law enforcement officers to certify every 36 months, as
opposed to current law which requires a certification in firearms
training every 12 months. Lastly, this section clarifies that a cer-
tification in firearms training can be conducted by (1) the officer’s
former agency, (2) the state in which the officer resides, (3) any law
enforcement agency within the state in which the officer resides, or
(4) a firearms instructor certified by the state in which the officer
resides to conduct active-duty firearms training.
Sec. 4. Permitting Qualified Current and Retired Law Enforce-
ment Officers to Carry Firearms in Certain Federal Facilities. This
section allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers
to carry a concealed firearm in certain federal facilities, including
a U.S. Post Office, Social Security Administration Office, Veterans
Affairs Office, or similar federal facilities.

ity of, the United States or any department or agency thereof
or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision
thereof; or

(p)(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, import,

(A) that, after removal of grips, stocks, and magazines, is not
as detectable as the Security Exemplar, by walk-through metal
detectors calibrated and operated to detect the Security Exem-
plar; or
(B) any major component of which, when subjected to inspec-
tion by the types of x-ray machines commonly used at airports,
does not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape
of the component. Barium sulfate or other compounds may be
used in the fabrication of the component.
(2) For purposes of this subsection—
(A) the term ‘‘firearm’’ does not include the frame or receiver
of any such weapon;
(B) the term ‘‘major component’’ means, with respect to a
firearm, the barrel, the slide or cylinder, or the frame or re-
ceiver of the firearm; and
(C) the term ‘‘Security Exemplar’’ means an object, to be fab-
ricated at the direction of the Attorney General, that is—
(i) constructed of, during the 12-month period beginning
on the date of the enactment of this subsection, 3.7 ounces

bling a handgun; and
(ii) suitable for testing and calibrating metal detectors:
Provided, however, That at the close of such 12-month period, and
at appropriate times thereafter the Attorney General shall promul-
gate regulations to permit the manufacture, importation, sale, ship-
ment, delivery, possession, transfer, or receipt of firearms pre-
viously prohibited under this subparagraph that are as detectable
as a ‘‘Security Exemplar’’ which contains 3.7 ounces of material

of-the-art developments in weapons detection technology.
(3) Under such rules and regulations as the Attorney General
shall prescribe, this subsection shall not apply to the manufacture,
possession, transfer, receipt, shipment, or delivery of a firearm by
a licensed manufacturer or any person acting pursuant to a con-

and regulations adopted pursuant to this paragraph do not impair
the manufacture of prototype firearms or the development of new
technology.
(4) The Attorney General shall permit the conditional importa-
tion of a firearm by a licensed importer or licensed manufacturer,
for examination and testing to determine whether or not the uncon-
ditional importation of such firearm would violate this subsection.
(5) This subsection shall not apply to any firearm which—
(A) has been certified by the Secretary of Defense or the Di-
rector of Central Intelligence, after consultation with the Attor-
ney General and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration, as necessary for military or intelligence applica-
tions; and
(B) is manufactured for and sold exclusively to military or in-
telligence agencies of the United States.
(6) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any firearm
manufactured in, imported into, or possessed in the United States
before the date of the enactment of the Undetectable Firearms Act
of 1988.
(q)(1) The Congress finds and declares that—
(A) crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, is a
pervasive, nationwide problem;
(B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate
movement of drugs, guns, and criminal gangs;
(C) firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate com-
merce and have been found in increasing numbers in and
around schools, as documented in numerous hearings in both
the Committee on the Judiciary the House of Representatives
and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;
(D) in fact, even before the sale of a firearm, the gun, its
component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from
which they are made have considerably moved in interstate
commerce;
(E) while criminals freely move from State to State, ordinary
citizens and foreign visitors may fear to travel to or through
certain parts of the country due to concern about violent crime
and gun violence, and parents may decline to send their chil-
dren to school for the same reason;
(F) the occurrence of violent crime in school zones has re-
sulted in a decline in the quality of education in our country;
(G) this decline in the quality of education has an adverse
impact on interstate commerce and the foreign commerce of
the United States;
(H) States, localities, and school systems find it almost im-
possible to handle gun-related crime by themselves—even
States, localities, and school systems that have made strong ef-
forts to prevent, detect, and punish gun-related crime find
their efforts unavailing due in part to the failure or inability
of other States or localities to take strong measures; and
(I) the Congress has the power, under the interstate com-
merce clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact
measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation’s
schools by enactment of this subsection.

sess a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects inter-

has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.
(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the possession of a fire-
arm—
(i) on private property not part of school grounds;
(ii) if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do
so by the State in which the school zone is located or a political
subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or political
subdivision requires that, before an individual obtains such a
license, the law enforcement authorities of the State or polit-

public or private lands open to hunting, if the entry on school
premises is authorized by school authoritiesø.¿; or
(viii) by an individual authorized by section 926B or 926C to
carry a concealed firearm.
(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), it shall be unlaw-
ful for any person, knowingly or with reckless disregard for the
safety of another, to discharge or attempt to discharge a firearm
that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign
commerce at a place that the person knows is a school zone.
(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the discharge of a fire-
arm—
(i) on private property not part of school grounds;
(ii) as part of a program approved by a school in the school
zone, by an individual who is participating in the program;
(iii) by an individual in accordance with a contract entered
into between a school in a school zone and the individual or an
employer of the individual; or
(iv) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official
capacity.
(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preempting
or preventing a State or local government from enacting a statute
establishing gun free school zones as provided in this subsection.
(r) It shall be unlawful for any person to assemble from imported
parts any semiautomatic rifle or any shotgun which is identical to
any rifle or shotgun prohibited from importation under section
925(d)(3) of this chapter as not being particularly suitable for or
readily adaptable to sporting purposes except that this subsection

actment of this subsection and ending on the day before the date
that is 60 months after such date of enactment, it shall be unlawful
for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer
to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun (other than the return of a

that the information available to such official does not indicate

Dissenting Views
I oppose H.R. 2243, the LEOSA Reform Act.
In 2004, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Officer Safety
Act (LEOSA), a law that allows both off-duty and retired law en-
forcement officers to carry concealed firearms irrespective of state
law. LEOSA preempted states’ judgments about what was best for
their communities and their residents, forcing all states to allow
off-duty and retired law enforcement to carry concealed firearms
under the terms set by Congress.
As Congress debated LEOSA more than 20 years ago, Members
of this Committee on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns
about how the bill violated the principles of federalism and under-
mined states’ rights. The Republican Chairman of the Judiciary
Committee at the time, Congressman Sensenbrenner, opposed
LEOSA for this reason.1 Several police groups also opposed this
legislation and expressed concerns about how it would affect officer
safety, how it could create more confusion in responding to active
shooters, how it might expose their agencies to more liability when
officers carried under LEOSA, and the insufficiency of require-
ments for retired officers.
Despite these concerns, LEOSA became law—though it did in-
clude some important limitations and imposed commonsense train-
ing requirements, which have been in place for more than 20 years.
H.R. 2243, the LEOSA Reform Act, would end what little right
states have to limit when and where individuals may carry con-
cealed firearms under LEOSA. It would force states to allow retired
and current officers to carry concealed firearms onto private prop-
erty open to the public, including restaurants, bars, parks, and
playgrounds. It would also force states to allow off-duty and retired
officers to carry concealed firearms on buses, trains, and subways.
And it would even force states to allow for the concealed carry of
firearms in Gun-Free School Zones. H.R. 2243 also allows off-duty
and retired law enforcement officers to completely disregard state
laws prohibiting high-capacity magazines.
This legislation not only supersedes the judgment of the states,
but it also threatens the safety and security of federal agencies by
forcing them to allow concealed carry under LEOSA in many fed-
eral buildings. Forcing federal offices and buildings to allow con-
cealed carry in these places is a completely unnecessary risk.
Another troubling aspect of this legislation is that it weakens
training standards. Under current law, a person carrying a firearm
under LEOSA must meet state training requirements every year,
but H.R. 2243 would allow individuals to concealed carry with
training certification as sparingly as every three years. This is
troubling given that the bill extends nationwide concealed carry to
retired officers who are no longer receiving the training that accom-
panies their employment.
All of these expansions are profoundly risky given the large num-
ber of people this new law would apply to: we know there are more
than 700,000 active law enforcement officers nationwide.2 And

while we don’t know the exact number of retired officers in the
United States, we know this number has increased significantly in
recent years as many police departments across the country have
faced sharp increases in retirement rates. One study found that
there are four retired officers and four resigned officers for every
100 active officers each year.3 Therefore, the universe of people this
bill would apply to is substantial.
Of course, our colleagues wish it were the case that a ‘‘good guy’’
with a gun is the answer to a ‘‘bad guy’’ with a gun, but the re-
search does not bear this out. Studies show that individuals suc-
cessfully defend themselves with a gun in less than 1% of crimes
involving personal contact.4 Gun accidents and unnecessary esca-
lation are pervasive threats.
We have dozens of legislative proposals that we know would
make our communities safer, while still respecting states’ rights.
This bill is not one of them.
I urge all my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
