PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 2458, the ‘‘Secure Space Act of 2025’’ would amend the Se-
cure and Trusted Communications Network Act of 2019 by adding
a new section preventing the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) from granting a license for, or a petition for declaratory rul-
ing to access the United States market using, a geostationary orbit
(GSO) satellite system or a non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) sat-
ellite system, or an authorization to use an individually licensed
earth station or a blanket-licensed earth station, if the license,
grant of market access, or authorization would be held or controlled
by an entity that produces or provides any communications equip-
ment or service on the FCC’s covered list (a list identifying commu-
nications equipment and services that pose a unacceptable risk to
U.S. national security) or an affiliate of such entity (as defined in
the Communications Act of 1934). H.R. 2458 would also require the
FCC to issue rules one year after the bill’s enactment to implement
this legislation.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
In the last few years, the United States has seen significant ad-
vancements in the ability of satellites to provide broadband inter-
net and other critical services to consumers and businesses
throughout the country and the world. In fact, American satellite
operators are leading the world in developing next-generation space
technologies, services, and applications. These developments have
been especially beneficial to Americans living in areas where other
types of technologies have not been built yet to provide communica-
tions services to American homes and businesses due to geographic
considerations and other factors.
However, it is also the case that other countries, including for-
eign adversaries of the United States, are making aggressive moves
to dominate the satellite industry. Indeed, the Chinese Communist
Party has placed satellite internet in its list of priorities for new
infrastructure,1 signaling increased investment in this burgeoning
sector. And in the last few years, the combined satellite fleets of
China and Russia have grown by approximately 70 percent.2
In light of these developments, it is imperative that Congress
take the necessary steps to ensure that satellite networks providing
service in the United States are secure and protected (along with
their relevant supply chains) from threats by untrusted actors. The
United States cannot risk having its satellite networks face the
same national security challenges that certain domestic terrestrial
communications networks have faced, especially given the global
nature of satellite network operations. Accordingly, H.R. 2458 ad-
dresses these concerns by preventing an entity producing or pro-
viding communications equipment or services that have been iden-
tified as a national security risk (or an affiliate as defined in the
Communications Act of 1934) from gaining access to the U.S. sat-
ellite marketplace.
