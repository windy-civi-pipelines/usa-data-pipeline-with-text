ADVANCING DIGITAL SUPPORT FOR
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT
JUNE24, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 414]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 414) to require covered digital ad-
vertising platforms to report their public service advertisements,
having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an
amendment (in the nature of a substitute) and recommends that
the bill (as amended) do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 414 is to require social media platforms that
derive revenue from advertising to submit an annual report to the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that provides certain statistics,
including the number, percentage, and value of public service ad-
vertisements on the platform. The FTC is required to submit to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
Representatives a publicly available report summarizing the infor-
mation reported by the platforms.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Children, especially young girls, face unique challenges amid an
ongoing mental health crisis in the United States that are exacer-
bated by social media. Data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey
conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
show that 77 percent of high school students reported frequent so-

cial media use.1 Of those who were identified as frequent social
media users, 55 percent of high school girls and 29 percent of high
school boys felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021. Frequent so-
cial media users also reported high suicide risk, with 22 percent of
all high school students—and nearly a third of high school girls—
reporting they had seriously considered attempting suicide in the
preceding year.2
A May 2023 advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General stated that up
to 95 percent of youth between ages 13 and 17 reported using so-
cial media, with over a third using it ‘‘almost constantly.’’3 Teens
who spend more than 3 hours per day on social media face twice
the risk of poor mental health outcomes, including symptoms of de-
pression and anxiety.4
Harm, including mental health harm, to children from social
media has also been a focus of this Committee as the subject of
multiple hearings before the full Committee and the Subcommittee
on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security.
On October 5, 2021, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection,
Product Safety, and Data Security heard from a whistleblower and
former Facebook (now Meta) employee who testified that Meta
prioritized user engagement, which fueled growth and profit, over
the well-being of young users. The witness also testified that
Meta’s policies, practices, and research on the harms its platforms
cause to youth are not transparent, either to the public or inde-
pendent researchers.5
The subcommittee held other hearings on September 30, 2021,6
October 26, 2021,7 and December 8, 2021,8 to examine how online
platforms—particularly social media platforms—harm young users.
The hearings revealed that external oversight and regulation is
needed to ensure the safety of minors online because the platforms
have not sufficiently protected them on their own.
The purpose of S. 414 is to respond, in part, to concerns that on-
line platforms have not taken appropriate steps to protect children
or teens online. The bill would require transparency regarding pub-

lic service advertisements provided by the platforms. By increasing
transparency, S. 414 would incentivize platforms to promote men-
tal health public service advertisements and other healthy re-
sources and messages.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 414 would do the following:
• Require covered digital advertising platforms to submit to the
FTC an annual report that includes data on the number, per-
centage, and value estimates of public service advertisements
promoting mental or behavioral health resources on the plat-
form in the preceding year, and how such advertisements meet
the Act’s definition for public service advertisement. The report
would also include information on the number of public service
advertisements that promote local or regional or free mental or
behavioral health care resources.
• Require the FTC to submit to the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation and House Committee on
Energy and Commerce a publicly available report summarizing
the information reported by the platforms.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, was introduced
on February 5, 2025, by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senator
Peters) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate. On March 12, 2025, the Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered
S. 414 to be reported favorably with an amendment (in the nature
of a substitute).
118th Congress
S. 2423, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, was introduced
on July 20, 2023, by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senator
Peters) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,

ESTIMATED COSTS
In compliance with subsection (a)(3) of paragraph 11 of rule
XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee has de-
termined the preliminary cost estimate provided by the Congres-
sional Budget Office is sufficient to dispense with the requirements
of subparagraphs (1) and (2).
The Committee notes that the Congressional Budget Office pro-
vided the following informal cost estimate by email:
