ican postsecondary education system. The hearing investigated how
to prevent foreign adversaries from abusing America’s academic
system to steal sensitive intellectual property, limit free expression,
control curriculum, and indoctrinate students. Testifying before the
Committee were Mr. Paul Moore, J.D., Senior Counsel, Defense of
Freedom Institute, Washington, D.C.; Mr. John C. Yang, President
and Executive Director, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Wash-
ington, D.C.; Mr. Craig Singleton, China Program Deputy Director
and Senior Fellow, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Wash-
ington, D.C.

The bill was referred solely to the Committee on Education and
Workforce. On February 12, 2025, the Committee considered H.R.
1048 in legislative session and reported it favorably, as amended,
to the House of Representatives by a recorded vote of 20–14. The
Committee considered the following amendments to H.R. 1048:
1. Ranking Member Scott offered an Amendment in the Na-
ture of a Substitute (ANS) that would double the reporting
threshold for contracts to $100,000 and allow gifts under
$250,000 over a three-year span to be unreported. The ANS
would also prevent the disclosure of the names of foreign
sources and the names of gift recipients at institutions and ex-
empt all clinical trials. Further, the ANS would reduce pen-
alties for violations to as low as $250. The ANS failed by a re-
corded vote of 14–20.
2. Representative Alma S. Adams (D–NC) offered an amend-
ment to restrict access by any ‘‘outside person’’ to information
submitted or maintained by the Department of Education pur-
suant to section 117 unless the sharing of the information is
specifically authorized or required by section 117 or required
to be made publicly available under section 117. The amend-
ment defines ‘‘outside person’’ as any person who is not a direct
employee of the Department of Education, including any per-
son who is a political appointee, special government employee,
or employee detailed from any agency outside the Department
of Education. The amendment failed by a recorded vote of 14–
20.
3. Representative Summer L. Lee (D–PA) offered an amend-
ment to require the U.S. Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to initiate a study into whether the provisions in the bill
would result in a decline of international research collabora-
tions or an increase in hostility on college campuses for inter-
national students or faculty or students of color. The amend-
ment failed by a recorded vote of 14–20.
4. Ranking Member Scott offered an amendment to exclude
receptions, widely-attended events, charity events, or gifts of
personal hospitality from being classified as ‘‘gifts’’ for report-
ing purposes. The amendment was withdrawn.
COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Foreign enemies like the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are in-
filtrating America’s colleges and universities to subvert United
States’ interests. Foreign adversaries recognize the value of Amer-
ican education and research and continually seek to exert their in-
fluence on students and faculty. To combat these threats, section
117 of the Higher Education Act (HEA) requires institutions that
receive federal financial assistance to disclose semiannually to the
U.S. Department of Education (ED or Department) any gifts re-
ceived from and/or contracts with a foreign source or foreign gov-
ernment that are valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.
The revisions made to section 117 by H.R. 1048 are necessary due
to section 117’s current loose legislative language, the Biden-Harris
administration’s blatant crippling of enforcement efforts, and insti-
tutions’ refusal to adhere to the law, which together have resulted

in billions of dollars in foreign funds infiltrating the country unde-
tected. The DETERRENT Act brings much-needed transparency,
accountability, and clarity to foreign gift reporting requirements for
colleges and universities across the nation.
Section 117 Background
Section 117 was enacted during the HEA reauthorization in
1986. The American Jewish Congress drafted and sponsored what
was then-called section 1207 in response to large gifts from foreign
governments, including gifts from Arab governments to Georgetown
University for the purpose of creating a Center for Contemporary
Arab Studies.1
Section 117 details the contents of required disclosures as well
as penalties. Each reported gift or contract from a foreign source
needs to contain the aggregate dollar amount as well as the coun-
try of origin.2 The statute also requires institutions owned or con-
trolled by a foreign entity to report additional information.3 If an
institution fails to properly disclose foreign gifts, the Attorney Gen-
eral may open a civil action to compel compliance, and institutions
can be found liable to pay for the subsequent investigation and en-
forcement costs.
Section 117 Limitations
Although the disclosure requirements of section 117 have been in
place for over 30 years, the loose language in statute, poor federal
enforcement, and lack of congressional oversight have collectively
resulted in very few and vague disclosures from institutions.
Most institutions fail to disclose the majority of foreign gifts they
have received. A 2019 Senate report found that up to 70 percent
of all institutions failed to comply with section 117 and that those
that do comply often underreport.4 Investigations by the first
Trump administration discovered $6.5 billion in previously undis-
closed gifts and contributions provided to elite colleges from coun-
tries that pose serious national security threats.5
Even when data is submitted, the accuracy of the reported
amounts of funding and the breadth of relationships are unclear.
All data submitted is self-reported by institutions and there is no
requirement that the numbers be audited for accuracy by an inde-
pendent body such as the Department’s Inspector General or the
GAO.6 In 2022, research from the Lincoln Policy Network found
that nearly 30 percent of reported payments had no receipt date,
making it hard to discern when payments began or to notice any
changes over time.7 The statute also allows institutions to report
gift sources as ‘‘anonymous.’’ In 2020, the Department estimated
that schools had anonymized $8.4 billion in foreign money over the

past decade.8 Finally, several colleges and universities have affili-
ated nonprofit foundations or other entities that receive gifts for
the university, and section 117 does not explicitly extend its re-
quirements to such entities.9
Section 117 also has no requirements for individual faculty or
staff to report foreign gifts and contracts they receive. However,
other federal agencies, in accordance with National Security Presi-
dential Memorandum-33 (NSPM–33),10 have different disclosure
requirements for individuals to disclose information that could re-
veal conflicts of interest and foreign entanglements.11 The following
are a few examples of problematic faculty relationships that were
investigated by the Department of Justice:
• In April 2023 the former Chair of Harvard University’s
Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department was sentenced to
prison for lying about his affiliation with and income from the
Wuhan University of Technology in Wuhan, China.12
• In October 2023, in a settlement agreement with the De-
partment of Justice, Stanford University agreed to pay $1.9
million over allegations that faculty members failed to disclose
foreign research support they were receiving.13
• In July 2024, in a settlement with the Department of Jus-
tice, the University of Maryland, College Park agreed to pay
$500,000 for failing to disclose foreign funding from the Chi-
nese companies of three researchers who simultaneously re-
ceived federal grants.14
• In September 2024, in a settlement agreement with the
Department of Justice, the Research Foundation of the State
University of New York agreed to pay $313,574 after a sci-
entist failed to disclose Chinese support.15
• In December 2024, in a settlement with the Department of
Justice, the University of Delaware agreed to pay $700,000 for
not disclosing that a faculty member receiving a NASA grant
taught at a Chinese university.16
These investigations and enforcement are encouraging, but there
are several problems. First, they often occur years after the re-
search has been potentially compromised and the grant funds have

of compromised faculty that have remained undetected. Addition-
ally, because the current section 117 requirements do not cover fac-
ulty, even if such disclosures had been made under other federal
disclosure requirements, they would not have been available for the
American public in the same transparent manner as section 117
disclosures.
Problems of Foreign Influence
American universities often resemble multinational corporations
and collaborate with global partners. International partnerships
may have academic and research advantages; however, not all for-
eign partnerships are innocuous. Over 60 percent of foreign money
given to U.S. universities comes from four sources: China, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.17 Without trans-
parency, foreign funds can pose a heightened security risk. Foreign
actors with ill-intent shroud their contracts and gifts in secrecy, en-
abling foreign nations to steal intellectual property, restrict aca-
demic freedom, recruit foreign agents, and monitor students on
campus.
China
China is one of the largest contributors to universities, with part-
nerships occurring in many forms. One of the most common is Con-
fucius Institutes (CIs), Chinese government-funded centers on col-
lege campuses that claim to foster intercultural exchange through
language classes and cultural celebrations. The Chinese govern-
ment provides American campuses with funding and partnerships
with Chinese institutions in return for hosting CIs. At the pro-
gram’s peak in 2017, there were nearly 120 CIs in the United
States; China spent over $158 million on CIs between 2006 and
2019.18
Because the Chinese government provides the funding for CIs,
they pose risks for U.S. host institutions regarding academic free-
dom, freedom of expression, governance, and national security.19 A
2019 Senate report further found that the Chinese government ‘‘ap-
proves all teachers, events, and speakers’’ at CIs and sometimes
limits discussion of political topics unfavorable to China such as
the independence of Taiwan or the Tiananmen Square massacre.20
A 2019 GAO report also revealed that some schools were hesitant
to reveal details of CI contracts and that some of these contracts
even included nondisclosure agreements.21
Increased political attention to CIs at the state and federal levels
caused a vast majority to close, leaving an estimated fewer than
five still operating in the United States as of October 2023.22 How-
ever, the National Association of Scholars estimates that at least
28 schools simply replaced their CI with a similar program and at

least 58 still have close relationships with their former CI part-
ner.23
A 2024 joint investigation between the House Select Committee
on the Chinese Communist Party (Select Committee) and this Com-
mittee found 21 joint US–Chinese education institutes. A case
study of two such institutes, the University of California, Berkeley
(UC Berkeley) and Georgia Tech University (Georgia Tech), re-
vealed both institutions failed to properly disclose under section
117, including disclosure of research with clear military applica-
tions.24 In 2014, UC Berkeley created the Tsinghua-Berkeley
Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) in collaboration with the Chinese uni-
versity Tsinghua University and the Chinese city of Shenzen.25 In
April 2023, TBSI supported a Chinese research lab that success-
fully optimized advance chip technology. TBSI’s work on semi-
conductors and imaging technology raises concerns about foreign
access to U.S. research in sensitive areas with clear military appli-
cations. UC Berkeley did not disclose many contracts with TBSI.26
Not dissimilar from UC Berkeley, Georgia Tech and Tianjin Uni-
versity entered into a 20-year enabling agreement in 2016 to create
the Georgia Tech Tianjin University Shenzhen Institute (GTSI).
GTSI provided degrees in computer science, electrical engineering,
and other research areas with military use. Georgia Tech similarly
did not disclose millions in GTSI contracts when they occurred.27
The investigation found 19 other similar joint institutes across
the nation.28 Shockingly, the most recent section 117 data reported
to the Department reveals that six of these universities have still
not reported a single gift or contract received from China despite
maintaining a joint Chinese institute.29 The general pattern of
funding structures for these kinds of institutes raises serious ques-
tions about the involvement of Chinese funds and as such the need
for proper section 117 compliance.
Middle East
Countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar,
also are some of the largest foreign contributors to American uni-
versities. In 2017 alone, Saudi individuals, companies, and the
Kingdom itself spent over $89 million on gifts and contracts to
IHEs including Columbia University, Tufts University, and the
University of Southern California.30
Countries from the Middle East have a history of large contribu-
tions to fund academic centers (often known as Middle East Stud-
ies Centers, or MESCs) on college campuses. MESCs, whose stated
goal is to promote Middle Eastern studies, have been criticized for

giving students a biased perspective on issues pertaining to the
Middle East, including Islam, women’s rights, terrorism, and slav-
ery.31 Additionally, the Network Contagion Research Institute
found that institutions that received and did not report funding
from Middle Eastern donors had, on average, 300 percent more
antisemitic incidents than other institutions.32
Administration Response
Under the first Trump administration, then-Secretary Betsy
DeVos took many steps to increase transparency and combat for-
eign influence. Secretary DeVos opened over a dozen section 117 in-
vestigations, issued guidance on section 117 reporting, and modern-
ized the online section 117 portal to make compliance easier.33 The
first Trump administration also issued improved disclosure require-
ments, including requiring the names of foreign sources to be list-
ed.34
Although foreign influence continued to be a major issue on
American campuses, the Biden-Harris administration failed to view
foreign influence as a serious threat. Former Secretary Miguel
Cardona said little about this issue and failed to build on the work
done in the previous administration. The Biden-Harris administra-
tion failed to issue any notices of investigations or open any addi-
tional section 117 investigations while in office.35 In August 2022,
the American Council on Education sent a letter thanking Presi-
dent Biden after learning that ‘‘ED plans to close the outstanding
section 117 investigations that remain open.’’36
The Biden-Harris administration transferred section 117 enforce-
ment away from the Office of General Counsel and into the Office
of Federal Student Aid (FSA).37 Due to FSA’s workload, the move
of section 117 enforcement raises concerns about the Department’s
resource allocation and prioritization. This was evidenced when
FSA became embroiled in many legal, technical, and other chal-
lenges demanding its attention during the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration, including the delayed launch of the 2025–2026 Free Appli-
cation for Federal Student Aid38 and the legal challenges blocking
its illegal Income Driven Repayment (known as ‘‘SAVE’’) plan.39
Committee Members sent a letter in April 2023 requesting detailed
information on the budget and staff resources dedicated by ED to
section 117 enforcement, but the Department refused to provide
this information.40

In June 2024, the Biden-Harris administration announced it
would be decommissioning FSA’s then-existing section 117 inter-
active data due to a ‘‘contract change.’’41 Although prior years’ re-
ported data remains technically available on several different
spreadsheets, the data table became more difficult for the public to
access.42 On July 24, 2024, the Department informed the Com-
mittee that the interactive table was ‘‘out of scope and out of budg-
et’’ for the Department’s ‘‘ED.gov Modernization Go-Live’’ project
and that it would ‘‘work[] with an FSA contractor to develop—sub-
ject to identification of available funding—a more fulsome Section
117 platform to address stakeholder concerns and operational
needs.’’43 The absence of any mention of the foregoing in the De-
partment’s FY 2025 budget request, its equivocation about ‘‘identi-
fication of available funding,’’ and its lack of any mention of re-
programming funds raised significant questions about the Biden-
Harris administration’s commitment to section 117 enforcement.
DETERRENT Act
On October 11, 2023, Representative Steel introduced the DE-
TERRENT Act.44 The Senate companion to DETERRENT (S. 3362)
was introduced on November 29, 2023, by Senator Thom Tillis (R–
NC).45 On December 6, 2023, DETERRENT passed the House in a
246–170 vote, with 215 Republicans and 31 Democrats sup-
porting.46 The Biden-Harris administration did not issue a state-
ment of administration policy on DETERRENT.47
On February 6, 2025, Representative Baumgartner and Chair-
man Walberg re-introduced DETERRENT as H.R. 1048.48 The leg-
islation brings much-needed transparency, accountability, and clar-
ity to foreign gift reporting requirements for colleges and univer-
sities across the nation in five key policies.
First, the bill slashes the foreign gift reporting threshold. The
bill lowers the annual threshold from $250,000 to $50,000 for all
foreign sources and lowers the threshold further to $0 for countries
of concern49 (China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) or foreign enti-
ties of concern50 such as foreign terrorist organizations, individuals
engaged in espionage, and academic institutions violating research
integrity. The bill also prohibits all contracts with a foreign country
of concern or entity of concern, except with an annual waiver from
ED.
Second, the bill closes reporting loopholes and provides trans-
parency. The bill requires institutions to submit names and ad-
dresses of foreign donors. Institutions also must submit the in-
tended use of the gift or contract and maintain at least one, and
up to three, compliance officers who personally certify the accuracy

of reports. The bill also requires institutions to report foreign gifts
given to their affiliated entities, such as university foundations.
Third, the bill requires disclosures of foreign gifts or contracts to
individual research faculty at institutions receiving more than $50
million annually in federal funds or receiving international edu-
cation funds under Title VI of the HEA by requiring their faculty
involved in research to report foreign gifts and contracts. These in-
dividual faculty reports would be published on the institution’s
website.
Fourth, the bill requires disclosures of troubling foreign invest-
ments in private endowments. The bill requires private institutions
with endowments above $6 billion or with investments of concern
above $250 million to report the value of those investments annu-
ally. Investments of concern are defined as investments in a coun-
try of concern or an entity of concern.
Finally, the bill establishes increasing penalties for noncompli-
ance. If an institution is found to be in willful violation after an
ED investigation and subsequent court order, the institution is re-
quired to pay the full cost of the court fees as well as a financial
penalty that increases after the first violation. Institutions with
three separate violations of any section 117 requirement (one of
which includes a repeated violation of a requirement) loses HEA
Title IV eligibility for a minimum of two years.
Comments of support for H.R. 1048 were received by the Combat
Antisemitism Movement, the Foundation for Defense of Democ-
racies, the Institute for Global Antisemitism & Policy, the Defense
of Freedom Institute, Heritage Action for America, Jewish Students
for America, the James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal,
Middle East Forum, the North American Values Institute, the
Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the Zachor
Legal Institute, the CLARITy Coalition, and Paul R. Moore, former
Chief Investigative Counsel at the U.S. Department of Education.
CONCLUSION
America’s foreign adversaries are targeting the nation’s students
and threatening national security by stealing research, pushing
propaganda, and censoring free speech. Colleges and universities
are on the frontlines facing this malign foreign interference. Sec-
tion 117 of the HEA is a key tool for combatting the threats posed
by foreign adversaries, but the Biden-Harris administration failed
to take the foreign influence seriously, and many of the most
prominent U.S. institutions continue in this error. The DETER-
RENT Act brings much needed transparency to the financial ties
between postsecondary education and foreign entities. This bill will
keep America’s adversaries at bay and hold U.S. institutions to a
higher standard.

forms section 117 to strengthen enforcement, particularly for coun-
tries of concern, to close reporting loopholes, and to clarify require-
ments for institutions. The goal of these reforms is to give much-
needed transparency to deter malicious foreign actors and rebuild
trust in our institutions.
Section 117—Disclosures of Foreign Gifts

quires biannual reports for gifts or contracts above $250,000. The
new section 117 created by the bill includes the following new re-
quirements.
• An institution shall file a disclosure report annually on
July 31 following a year when:

or contracts with foreign governments will also contain:
» the name of the government;
» the department, agency, office, or division of the for-
eign government that approved the gift or contract;

retary shall transmit an unredacted copy of such report (that

EXPLANATION OF AMENDMENTS
The amendments, including the amendment in the nature of a
substitute, are explained in the body of this report.
APPLICATION OF LAW TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104–1 requires a description of
the application of this bill to the legislative branch. H.R. 1048 re-
quires institutions of higher education to include additional infor-
mation in disclosures of foreign gifts and contracts from foreign
sources, restricts contracts with certain foreign entities and foreign
countries of concern, requires certain staff and faculty to report for-
eign gifts and contracts, and requires disclosure of certain foreign
investments within endowments. H.R. 1048 applies only to institu-
tions of higher education and therefore does not apply to the Legis-
lative Branch.
UNFUNDED MANDATE STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344 (as amended
by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee adopts as its own the cost esti-
mate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974.
EARMARK STATEMENT
H.R. 1048 does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9 of
House rule XXI.
ROLL CALL VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1048 is to bring much
needed transparency to the financial ties between postsecondary

eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

H.R. 1048 would expand disclosure and reporting requirements
for all institutions of higher education that receive gifts from or
enter into contracts with foreign countries or entities. Institutions
that fail to meet the new requirements could be assessed civil pen-
alties or lose eligibility for federal student financial aid. Specifi-
cally, H.R. 1048 would:
• Reduce from $250,000 to $50,000 the value of gifts and
contracts from foreign sources that institutions would need to
disclose annually in reports to the Department of Education,
• Prohibit institutions from entering into contracts with any
foreign entity of concern (China or Russia, for example) with-
out obtaining a waiver,
• Require certain institutions to report on gifts or contracts
between faculty members and foreign entities, and
• Require private institutions with endowments greater than
$6 billion or more than $250 million in specified investments
to file investment disclosure reports annually.
In addition, H.R. 1048 would require the Department of Edu-
cation to create a searchable database with information about insti-
tutions’ foreign gifts, contracts, and investments.
Finally, the bill would require the Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) to study how to improve coordination among federal
agencies for implementing and enforcing the bill’s provisions.
H.R. 1048 would require the Secretary of Education to inves-
tigate potential noncompliance, which could result in civil actions
against institutions that knowingly or willfully fail to comply with
the new requirements. Such institutions could be assessed fines
and be required to pay to the Treasury any costs the government
incurred to ensure the institution complied with the new rules.
Those fines and penalties are recorded in the budget as revenues.
Additionally, institutions that were subject to three separate civil
actions would lose access to federal student financial aid for at
least two years. Outlays for some federal student aid programs,
such as the federal student loan program, are recorded in the budg-

et as direct spending; other programs, such as the Federal Work-
Study Program, are funded through annual appropriations.
CBO expects that institutions would generally comply with the
new requirements, and that any increases in revenues from fines
or other civil penalties or decreases in spending on federal student
aid over the 2025–2035 period would be insignificant.
Using information about the cost of similar activities, CBO esti-
mates that it would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 pe-
riod to implement the bill. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 1048 would impose intergovernmental and private-sector
mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). As a condition of receiving federal funding, institutions of
higher education are subject to certain reporting requirements
under current law. The bill would extend those requirements to all
institutions of higher education, regardless of their receipt of fed-
eral funding. The bill also would prohibit these institutions from
entering contracts with certain foreign countries and entities. If a
country or entity is newly classified as one ‘‘of concern,’’ institutions
with existing contracts with them would be required to cancel them
within 60 days.
CBO cannot determine the costs of the mandates because there
is no information available on the number of institutions that
would become subject to the new reporting requirements nor the
number and value of contracts that might have to be terminated
in the future.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Leah Koestner. The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1048. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
In compliance with clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,
as reported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omit-
ted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italics,

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1048, the Defending Education Transparency and Ending
Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions (DETER-
RENT) Act would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA)
to impose increased reporting requirements for foreign gifts and
contracts. If enacted, H.R. 1048 would force institutions of higher
education to comply with overly burdensome and duplicative re-
porting requirements with no discernable increase in security or
oversight. Further, H.R. 1048 would jeopardize the essential global
partnerships among institutions that play a critical role in the
United States’ social, economic, and technological progress.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION
Institutions of higher education (institutions) have long been in-
cubators of research and development that advances the scientific
knowledge of the United States. Institutions conduct innovative,
collaborative, multidisciplinary research with the goal to improve
the economy, international competitiveness, and quality of life for
individuals.1 Federal investment has played a key role in this col-
laborative process for over 80 years. The National Science Founda-
tion was established in 1950 growing out of federal government
sponsorship of university research to aid the Allied effort in World
War II; the first federal student loans were authorized to increase
technical and scientific knowledge of U.S. scientists to help prevail
in the Cold War.2 By underwriting scientific work at universities,
the United States has received a wealth of research knowledge ap-
plicable in multiple industries, and the benefits of a national infra-
structure of research laboratories it did not have to build itself. In
return, institutions have received steady streams of funding to con-
duct research in the public interest.
However, the system has evolved to a point where institutions
rely heavily on federal investments to advance their research and
development priorities. The federal government, via grants from a
multitude of federal agencies, provides over $30 billion annually to
institutions to support research and development efforts, and this
federal funding accounts for roughly 60 percent of institutions’ re-

search and development budgets.3 Institutions also collaborate with
a range of international entities on federal grants through partner-
ships with foreign universities and faculty. The research commu-
nity and Committee Democrats agree: to advance complex research,
it is essential to have a ‘‘diversity of research capabilities, perspec-
tives, and access to resources.’’4
ADDRESSING UNDUE FOREIGN INFLUENCE IN RESEARCH
Due to the inherent international nature of research, protecting
against undue foreign influence is important for institutions and
the federal government.5 Institutions recognize they have a respon-
sibility to safeguard research and protect against intellectual prop-
erty theft, but unwarranted or overinflated concerns of foreign in-
fluence can inhibit the ability of institutions and individual schol-
ars to develop a global perspective in their research and teaching.
Unfortunately, these unjustifiable concerns may also often lead to
the fueling of xenophobic rhetoric and behaviors, particularly to-
wards Asians, Asian Americans, and Middle Eastern Americans
conducting research in the United States or in collaboration with
American partners. This rhetoric is extremely harmful, and it con-
tributes to the diminishing of the United States’ ‘‘superpower of at-
tracting global scientific talent.’’6
Committee Republicans argue that institutions refuse ‘‘to adhere
to the law’’ with respect to foreign influence,7 but this could not be
further from reality. The country’s leading research universities
have proven they are committed to securing federally funded re-
search and are demonstrating that commitment by constantly
working to ensure compliance with foreign influence laws and regu-
lations. In 2020, the Association of American Universities (AAU)
and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU)
conducted a survey that found institutions are consistently working
to improve their disclosure policies, enhancing training around for-
eign security risks, and developing robust risk mitigation strategies
and assessments.8 Further, a recent letter signed by six of the lead-
ing higher education organizations emphasized that institutions
have increasingly strengthened relationships with federal research

FEDERAL POLICIES ON FOREIGN INFLUENCE
Institutions have expressed that to better address research secu-
rity at institutions, intentional federal interagency coordination is
essential.10 As described in detail below, the federal government
has acted on this concern and established robust coordinated poli-
cies to ensure institutions can address undue foreign influence in
a manner that is not overly duplicative or burdensome. While Com-
mittee Republicans argue the Department of Education (ED)
should be leading the fight against foreign influence, this argument
fails to recognize that the overwhelming majority of research fund-
ing flowing to our institutions are coming from agencies and de-
partments other than ED. This push to centralize operations at the
ED ignores the multitude of policies and initiatives within the fed-
eral government that already exist to address research security and
protect institutions from undue foreign influence. Through these
policies and initiatives, most of which are outside the jurisdiction
of this Committee, the Biden Administration was committed to es-
tablishing one cohesive compliance process across federal agencies.
The adoption of H.R. 1048 would needlessly complicate the
progress the Biden Administration made.
OFFICE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY AND NSPM–33
FEDERAL GUIDANCE
The White House Office for Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP) advises the President on matters related to Science and
Technology.11 OSTP coordinates with federal agencies, Congress,
and external partners, including institutions, to support research,
regulation, and innovation.12 In January 2021, President Trump
issued the Presidential Memorandum on United States Govern-
ment-Supported Research and Development National Security Pol-
icy (NSPM–33) to direct ‘‘action to strengthen protections of United
States Government-supported Research and Development against
foreign government interference and exploitation.’’13 This guidance,
implemented by President Biden establishes the priorities of OSTP
and other agencies involved in enforcing disclosures of funds, for-

eign influence, and other research security risks.14 NSPM–33 out-
lines the central priorities of enforcement on foreign influence for
all institutions including: sharing awareness of risks and disclosure
requirements, limiting access and vetting foreign students, and
providing research to ‘‘protect federally funded R&D from foreign
government interference.’’15 NSPM–33 plays an integral role ‘‘in
advancing American competitiveness and keeping America at the
forefront of innovation and technological development.’’ Through
engaging with the U.S. research community, this guidance estab-
lishes robust requirements to safeguard against undue foreign in-
fluence.16
CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT
The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 designated the National
Science Foundation (NSF) as the primary agency charged with co-
ordinating research security initiatives, since it provides the rel-
evant prohibitions, guidance, and disclosure requirements ‘‘around
foreign talent recruitment programs and potential conflicts of inter-
est.’’17 NSF is required to create policies, protocols, and resources
to identify and address any potential security risks to research in-
tegrity for institutions.18 Furthermore, the Act requires NSF to cre-
ate a Research Security and Policy Office to coordinate all security
policies and conduct due diligence regarding compliance with any
security standards set forth.19 Similarly, CHIPS and Science Act
requires that all institutions must annually report to NSF in any
financial information associated with a foreign country of concern
and directs NSF to create guardrails around foreign talent pro-
grams.20

FEDERAL INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED SINCE CONSIDERATION OF THE
DETERRENT ACT IN 2023
While Republicans claim that the Biden Administration was
‘‘crippling’’ enforcement of foreign influence laws,21 it is evident
that the Biden Administration was committed to implementing a
cohesive interagency plan to combat undue foreign influence by
signing robust provisions doing so into law and building upon those
laws to enhance the responsibilities of federal agencies.
Since the Committee last considered the DETERRENT Act in the
118th Congress, federal research agencies have taken significant
steps to address foreign influence risks.22 Specifically:
• In February 2024, OSTP released a memo to federal agen-
cies requiring the use of the common disclosure form for fed-
eral research, which requires additional details on foreign af-
filiations, relationships, and financial interests.23
• In June 2024, the NSF announced a new risk mitigation
framework for assessing grant proposals for potential national
security risks.24 The Trusted Research Using Safeguards and
Transparency (TRUST) framework created a process to evalu-
ate and mitigate risks for both U.S. scholars and international
collaborators prior to awarding federal grants.
• In July 2024, the NSF also announced a $67 million in-
vestment to establish the Safeguarding the Entire Community
of the U.S. Research Ecosystem (SECURE) Center.25 The cen-
ter is designed to communicate information to institutions on
research security risks, provide training of institutions, and
generally serve as a bridge between the research community
and government agencies.
• In November 2024, the Department of Energy’s Office of
Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) an-
nounced a framework to provide institutions with financial as-
sistance to improve their ability to make risk-based research
decisions and increase transparency about partnerships.26
Unfortunately, Committee Republicans refuse to acknowledge the
progress the Biden Administration made to intentionally support
institutions as they develop thoughtful research security protocols

and transparency and instead continue to accuse the Biden Admin-
istration of being less tough on foreign influence in higher edu-
cation.27
Recommendations from the National Academies for the Sciences
on Foreign Influence In 2020, the National Defense Authorization
Act of FY21 directed the National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine (NAS), through a contract with the Department
of Defense, to produce a Consensus Study Report regarding the re-
cruitment and retention of U.S.- and foreign-born researchers for
the advancement of the U.S. STEM workforce.28 At this directive,
NAS issued a report in 2024 analyzing the challenges in balancing
increasing international talent with protecting against undue for-
eign influence.29 Several recommendations made in the report align
with the recent work of institutions and federal research agencies
to address this topic. These include:
• Recognizing OSTP as the obvious hub for a whole of gov-
ernment strategy for dealing with international research policy
and practice;30
• Prioritizing robust international research but insisting on
increased transparency and research security safeguards;31
• Maximizing talent attraction and collaboration, but not
without managing security concerns and risks with individual-
ized, comprehensive assessments;32
• Addressing the lingering chilling effects to research col-
laboration initiated by the first Trump Administration;33
• Providing policymakers with more information on the im-
portance of recruiting foreign talent to retain a robust research
environment, and updates on the steps they are taking cur-
rently to maintain research security.34

SECTION 117 OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT
While other federal agencies may dominate the research security
space, ED does have a role to play. HEA section 117 requires insti-
tutions receiving federal financial assistance to disclose any gifts
received from, and contracts with, foreign sources valued at
$250,000 or more per year.35 This disclosure is designed to ‘‘pro-
mote public transparency about the role of foreign funding in U.S.
higher education’’ and protect government-funded activities from
foreign influence.36 Although Congress first required institutions to
report foreign gifts and contracts to the Department in 1986, insti-
tutions only recently received formal guidance from the Depart-
ment on Section 117 compliance through the creation of a website
containing written guidance, webinars, and other resources to as-
sist institutions.37
SECTION 117 ENFORCEMENT AND CHANGES
Under the first Trump Administration, ED’s Office of General
Counsel (OGC) initiated 12 civil investigations to ensure Section
117 compliance.38 These investigations did not ultimately lead to
charges of criminal activity by any institution. In 2020, the Depart-
ment created an online portal for institutions to submit reports on
contracts with, and gifts from, foreign sources. Currently, gift and
contract report submissions occur through the portal, rather than
through the institution’s process for accessing federal student aid
program participation required in H.R. 1048. This was a strong
step forward for streamlining the reporting requirements, and mov-
ing to the process required under H.R. 1048 would force institu-
tions to modify their compliance regime unnecessarily.
Section 117 oversight was the sole responsibility of the Office of
Federal Student Aid (FSA) at ED until 2020, at which time OGC
assumed responsibility for most aspects of Section 117 administra-
tion. However, in June 2022, ED moved oversight of this require-
ment back to FSA and assured stakeholders that FSA would work
with OGC to ensure robust compliance.39 The Department at the
time believed that FSA was well positioned to execute this respon-
sibility because of its robust auditing and review expertise, given
that FSA was previously been responsible for the systems used to
collect Section 117 data and its established data collection practices

from institutions participating in federal student aid programs.40
ED also committed to collaborating with other federal agencies to
continue enhancing interagency initiatives through the NSPM–33
guidance.41 And while Committee Republicans have argued that
Section 117 is ‘‘the single biggest enforcement tool to protect
against the threats posed by foreign adversaries,’’42 Section 117 is
merely one piece of the collective foreign influence work done
across the federal government.
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS SEEN AN INCREASE IN SECTION
117 COMPLIANCE
Committee Republicans have also expressed concern over reports
of unreported foreign gifts in recent years and continued to push
ED to more forcefully implement Section 117 reporting.43 It is
worth noting, however, that under the Biden Administration, ED
oversaw the most robust compliance reporting ever with the effort
led by FSA.44 As of October 2024, institutions reported foreign
gifts, contracts and real estate totaling over $57.97 billion, which
is significantly more than what was reported under the first Trump
Administration.45 Further improvements of Section 117 enforce-
ment under FSA include the conducting of investigations and initi-
ating a new data collection effort.46 Given these drastic improve-
ments to institutional reporting, it is disingenuous at best to say
H.R. 1048 is needed because the Biden Administration and institu-
tions have not been committed to ensuring Section 117 compliance.
H.R. 1048 PARTIALLY STREAMLINES SECTION 117 REPORTING
Committee Republicans claim the DETERRENT Act will address
what they argue are outstanding compliance issues caused by re-
porting failures of institutions and enforcement failures of ED.47
While most of H.R. 1048 is cause for alarm, as detailed below, it
is worth noting the provisions that Committee Democrats were
pleased to see included. First, the bill would make Section 117 re-

porting an annual requirement. This improves upon the current bi-
annual reporting requirement and aligns with the new NSF report-
ing obligations.48 Second, H.R. 1048 would require the Department
to establish and maintain a searchable, public database containing
details on all disclosure reports submitted. The database, in con-
junction with the new portal introduced in 2020, would streamline
the reporting process for institutions. Finally, the bill would re-
quire the Department to designate a single point of contact for Sec-
tion 117 communications. This would allow institutions to have a
clear understanding of who they can reach out to for questions and
concerns related to initial reporting, updates to reports, and any
issues around the database. Unfortunately, these are the only com-
ponents of H.R. 1048 that meaningfully improve Section 117. Com-
mittee Democrats offered a Democratic Amendment in the Nature
of a Substitute (Substitute) that included these streamlined
changes, in addition to other sensible updates to Section 117, but
the amendment was defeated.
H.R. 1048 DOES NOT PROMOTE SECTION 117 COMPLIANCE
Despite its beneficial provisions, H.R. 1048 would pile on unnec-
essary and unmeaningful requirements that will make it harder for
institutions to comply with Section 117, ignoring the significant
strides taken by the Biden Administration to align research secu-
rity protocols across federal agencies.
UNWORKABLE WAIVERS
One example of the lack of workability of H.R. 1048 surrounds
the waiver process for collaborating with foreign entities of concern
outlined in the newly proposed HEA Section 117a. The provision
would require institutions to obtain a waiver from ED before enter-
ing into any contracts with foreign entities of concern. This as-
sumes that ED has the expertise to review detailed contracts fo-
cused on scientific research in a uniform, timely fashion. It is
strange to expect a federal agency focused on education to also
have the technical expertise to assess potential risks associated
with research and technologies at the center of these partnerships.
Rather, Congress should be encouraging institutions to comply with
the existing export-control requirements maintained by NSF and
the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and State.49
ENFORCEMENT
The enforcement structure under the newly proposed HEA Sec-
tion 117d is also deeply concerning. The bill would force immediate
and harsh enforcement penalties onto institutions without offering

any measures to support institutions. For example, first-time viola-
tions of Section 117 would automatically trigger a fine not less
than $50,000 and could lead to a sanction of millions of dollars for
large scale contracts. These sanctions do not take into consider-
ation the potential for mistakes, which are bound to occur; under
the higher reporting standards mandated by H.R. 1048, including
broader definitions of ‘‘reportable gifts’’ and ‘‘contracts’’, institutions
could be submitting hundreds of reports to the Department every
year. The Democratic Substitute offered a sensible enforcement pol-
icy that gives the Department discretion to determine fines and
would require institutions to establish robust plans to address any
compliance concerns identified by the Department.
Another troubling component of the enforcement structure is that
it ties violations of Section 117 to the loss of federal student aid
funding under Title IV of the HEA. This means students, who often
have limited connections to research decisions at institutions, could
be punished for de minimis errors in their institution’s foreign gift
reporting. The NAS report on foreign influence discussed earlier in
these views emphasized that the best way to protect against undue
influence in federally funded research is to focus on compliance,
rather than persecution50, and H.R. 1048 does the exact opposite.
If the purpose of H.R. 1048 is to improve institutional compliance,
it is hard to see how such inflexible and harsh sanctions, in con-
junction with the misalignment with other federal policies, reach
this goal.
H.R. 1048 WOULD CREATE A CHILLING EFFECT FOR INTERNATIONAL
RESEARCH AND SCHOLARS
Institutions of higher education recognize the importance of cre-
ating diverse campus communities by supporting international stu-
dents and scholars on their campuses. Fostering a positive campus
climate helps create a learning and social environment which bene-
fits all students and scholars.51 Additionally, it is clear xenophobic
attitudes have contributed to the decreased safety of international
students and scholars.52 Due to the continued, heightened discrimi-
nation against students of color and international scholars, exacer-
bated by recent executive actions such as threats of visa revocation
for international students53, it is imperative that we do not inad-
vertently perpetuate more hatred when developing policy to ad-
dress foreign influence on college campuses.
There have been a multitude of cases where international schol-
ars have been wrongfully accused of inciting undue foreign influ-
ence, and the consequences are damning. A 2022 study published
by NAS surveying over 1,300 Asian American faculty found that al-
though the majority (89 percent) of these faculty desire to con-

tribute to U.S. advancements in science and technology, many (72
percent) feel unsafe conducting research in the U.S.54 One poignant
example—the experience of Dr. Greg Chen—highlights the signifi-
cant negative impact these wrongful accusations. A former Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology professor, Dr. Chen, was wrong-
fully accused of espionage, and chose to no longer continue his re-
search studies due to fear and anxiety around being racially
profiled.55 As a Chinese immigrant, Dr. Chen emphasized how this
wrongful accusation has caused damage and will be difficult to
overcome.56
H.R. 1048 would create a chilling effect for international scholars
and research by encouraging these types of attacks. The newly pro-
posed HEA Section 117b would require institutions to maintain a
public database of gifts to, and contracts with, individual faculty
and staff—a database that would include personal information of
faculty and staff. Not only does this provision create an egregious
amount of insignificant and unnecessary data collection, but it
would also perpetuate a misguided and heightened scrutiny of
international scholars. Due to the lack of clarity in the bill, faculty
and staff will struggle to know when to report common interactions
with their international colleagues that don’t pose national security
threats, such as attending events in their personal capacity and ac-
cepting collegial hospitality.
The NAS suggests such scrutiny and targeting of colleagues with
specific nationalities—like that under the Trump Administration’s
China Initiative57—has a chilling effect on attracting and retaining
international talent due to ‘‘fear of and actual harassment and in-
timidation.’’58 Committee Democrats and the higher education
community previously raised these concerns during previous con-
sideration of this bill, but no meaningful progress has been made
to address these concerns. Ultimately, ignoring these concerns will
lead to international scholars being avoided by their colleagues
merely for fear of being connected to international funding. This
perpetuates the idea that collaborations with foreign partners are
fundamentally problematic, which cannot be further from the goals
of research at institutions.
Committee Democrats are committed to maintaining a welcoming
campus for all, including international students, faculty, and schol-
ars. During the markup, Rep. Lee (D–PA) offered an amendment
that would study the potential negative impacts of H.R. 1048 on
international research collaborations and campus climate for inter-
national students, international scholars, and students of color.
Committee Republicans voted down this amendment, painting a
clear picture that protecting scholars from foreign targeting or ra-
cial harassment is not a priority. Their refusal to accept this and

other Democratic amendments shows that H.R. 1048 is not a seri-
ous attempt to actually address the topic of national security and
ensure that such attempts do not negatively impact campus cli-
mates.
RECENT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS SHOW QUESTIONABLE ABILITY TO
IMPLEMENT H.R. 1048
It is important to acknowledge the backdrop in which H.R. 1048,
if enacted, would be implemented by the Trump Administration.
During the markup, Committee Democrats raised significant con-
cern over the Trump Administration’s recent executive actions im-
pacting institutions’ ability to conduct research, collaborate with
international partners, and protect their students. These concerns
were all exacerbated by President Trump’s plan to dismantle ED.59
Beyond the immediate harm this would cause to students and in-
stitutions receiving federal aid, it creates significant confusion as
to how federal laws, such as Section 117, would be enforced. Dur-
ing the markup, Committee Republicans did not provide any con-
text for how H.R. 1048 would be implemented without the ED.
Committee Democrats also expressed concerns over the widely
reported privacy breaches60, mass firings61, and funding cuts62 by
the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by
the unelected Elon Musk, that may impact research security ef-
forts. For example, under H.R. 1048, the Section 117 point of con-
tact will have direct access to a large database full of personally
identifiable information and sensitive financial data. We are con-
cerned this sensitive data could be subject to DOGE access for pur-
poses antithetical to the goals of protecting against foreign influ-
ence. To address this concern, Higher Education and Workforce De-
velopment Subcommittee Ranking Member Adams (D–NC) offered
an amendment that would protect Section 117 data by limiting
which federal employees have access to reports submitted by insti-
tutions. It was voted down along party lines. Democrats also ex-
pressed concern over the Committee’s consideration of H.R. 1048
while DOGE and the Trump Administration have frozen or elimi-
nated funding for billions of dollars in federal research done by in-
stitutions.63 In combination with the chilling effect H.R. 1048
would have on international research, these funding cuts will in-
herently hurt the United States’ ability to conduct scientific re-
search and be competitive in the international economy.

It is also unclear whether the Trump Administration will con-
tinue the collaborative inter-agency approach to research security
they themselves authored that was implemented by the Biden Ad-
ministration. The White House has not created a website for OSTP
or commented on its future, so it is unclear at the time of this re-
port what the administration’s plans for continuing the implemen-
tation of NSPM–33. However, the administration is taking other
steps to dismantle federal foreign influence oversight. Most nota-
bly, on February 5, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded
the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force to ‘‘free resources to ad-
dress more pressing priorities.’’64 The task force, established under
the first Trump Administration, was responsible for investigating
individuals and entities accused of malign foreign influence. The
FBI is crucial in combatting foreign influence and coordinating rel-
evant law enforcement activities with other research-oriented fed-
eral agencies.
Together, these actions and uncertainty create significant con-
cern among Committee Democrats over the Trump Administra-
tion’s ability to faithfully implement meaningful Section 117 com-
pliance and research security policies in general.
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1048
Committee Democrats put forward two discrete amendments to
improve the underlying bill. These amendments would have
streamlined Section 117 reporting and protected the privacy of fac-
ulty and staff. Democrats also offered an Amendment in the Na-
ture of a Substitute to create a HEA Section 117 that recognizes
its role as part of, but not the center of undue foreign influence and
research security framework. Committee Republicans rejected all of
the Democratic amendments that were considered.

CONCLUSION
H.R. 1048 is an attempt to overcorrect problems that are cur-
rently being addressed across the federal government. Institutions
of higher education have shown their efforts to comply with all fed-
eral foreign influence laws and regulations, including Section 117
of the Higher Education Act, and the Department of Education has
shown its commitment to help institutions remain in compliance.
While Committee Republicans argue this legislation will deter ne-
farious actions, H.R. 1048 merely deters institutions from making
