TO AMEND THE INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT
ACT TO ALLOW INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE SCHOLAR-
SHIP AND LOAN RECIPIENTS TO FULFILL SERVICE OB-
LIGATIONS THROUGH HALF-TIME CLINICAL PRACTICE,
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
MAY12, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Ms. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Indian Affairs,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 632]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill
(S. 632), to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to
allow Indian Health Service scholarship and loan recipients to ful-
fill service obligations through half-time clinical practice, and for
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon, without amendment and recommends that the bill do
pass.
PURPOSE
S. 632 would amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to
permit recipients of the Indian Health Service’s Health Professions
Scholarship and Loan Repayment programs to fulfill service obliga-
tions through half-time practice in order to increase the recruit-
ment and retention of clinicians in areas experiencing high vacancy
rates.
BACKGROUND AND NEED
The Indian Health Care Improvement Act authorizes the Indian
Health Service (IHS) to offer scholarships and loan repayments to
eligible health care professionals in exchange for a full-time, two-
year service commitment within an Indian health program, includ-
ing those contracted or compacted under the Indian Self Deter-

mination and Education Assistance Act.1 The IHS Indian Health
Professions Scholarship Program (IHS Scholarship Program) pro-
vides qualified American Indian and Alaska Native health profes-
sions students with financial support of a monthly stipend, full tui-
tion assistance, or other educational expenses, in exchange for a
minimum two-year service commitment of a chosen health profes-
sional discipline within an IHS Indian health program.2 The IHS
Loan Repayment Program (LRP) provides funding to health profes-
sionals to repay, up to $50,000, of their eligible health professions
education loans, in exchange for an initial two-year service commit-
ment, with opportunity to extend annually, to practice in health fa-
cilities serving American Indian and Alaska Native communities.3
Similar programs, such as the National Health Service Corps
(NHSC) Loan Repayment program, do not condition eligibility on
committing to practice on a full-time basis.4
S. 632 is modeled on the NHSC Loan Repayment Program and
Scholarship Programs. These NHSC programs provide loan repay-
ment and scholarship recipients with the ability to satisfy their
service obligations through half-time clinical work for double the
amount of service time or to accept half the amount of loan repay-
ment award in exchange for a two-year service obligation. S. 632
would provide similar flexibilities to the IHS Scholarship Program
and the LRP by extending the current two-year obligation under
both programs for full-time health professionals to a four-year obli-
gation for half-time health professionals or reduce the amount of
the award in both programs for eligible half-time health profes-
sionals who select a two-year obligation.
As a largely rural health care provider, the IHS has well-docu-
mented difficulty recruiting and retaining health care profes-
sionals.5 Further exacerbating the workforce challenges within the
IHS, the agency experiences high vacancy rates in several key oc-
cupations including physicians, advanced practice nurses, and be-
havioral health clinicians.6 The IHS’s current full-time work re-
quirement for eligible individuals to access its scholarship and loan
repayment programs is a barrier to recruitment and retention of
health professionals in Tribal communities.7 Providing flexibility to
allow half-time health professionals to qualify for the IHS scholar-
ship and loan repayments programs could increase the number of
providers interested in serving at an Indian health program, there-
by strengthening recruitment and retention outcomes.8

SUMMARY OF S. 632
S. 632 would amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to
allow IHS scholarship and loan repayment recipients to fulfill serv-
ice obligations through half-time clinical practice. This change to
existing law creates parity between IHS scholarship and loan re-
payment programs and the NHSC programs and enables IHS to
make better use of these tools to recruit and retain key profes-
sionals in a highly competitive employment environment.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 632 was introduced by Senators Cortez Masto and Mullin on
February 19, 2025.
In the 118th Congress, a similar bill, S. 3022, was introduced by
Senators Cortez Masto and Mullin. The Committee held a hearing
on S. 3022 on February 8, 2024.9 The Committee, in an open busi-
ness meeting on May 1, 2024, by a majority voice vote of a quorum
present, ordered S. 3022, as amended, favorably reported by voice
vote (S. Rept. 118–240).10 The Senate passed S. 3022, as amended,
by voice vote on December 17, 2024.11
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, in an open business
meeting on March 5, 2025, by a majority voice vote of a quorum
present, recommends that the Senate pass S. 632.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1—Short title
This section provides the short title for the bill, the ‘‘IHS Work-
force Parity Act of 2025.’’
Section 2—Indian Health Service Scholarship and loan recipients
Section 2(a) amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to:
• permit recipients of an Indian Health Professions Scholar-
ship to meet their service obligations through half-time prac-
tice if they agree in writing to serve for double the period of
obligated service set for full-time practice; and
• clarify that when an Indian Health Professions Scholar-
ship recipient fails to begin or complete their service obligation,
the recipient is subject to breach of contract provisions in the
Indian Health Care and Improvement Act and the periods of
service completed in half-time practice shall be converted to
their full-time equivalents for purposes of determining breach
of contract damages.
Section 2(b) amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to:
• expand participation in the IHS Loan Repayment program
to individuals who have contracted to serve in clinical practice
with an Indian health program for at least four years if at half-
time service and subject to certain conditions, or for two years
at half-time service if the individual’s loan payment is equal to

COST AND BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS
The Committee has requested, but has not yet received, the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s estimate of the cost of S. 632 as ordered
reported. When the Congressional Budget Office completes its cost
estimate, it will be posted on the Internet at www.cbo.gov., and
printed in the Congressional Record.
EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services from the February 8, 2024 hearing on S. 3022 fol-
lows:
Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair Mur-
kowski, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the
opportunity to provide testimony on two important legisla-
tive proposals before your Committee, and for your contin-
ued support for Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS or Department) efforts to improve the health
and well-being of American Indians and Alaska Natives
(AI/AN). Your consideration today of Senator Cortez
Masto’s IHS Workforce Parity Act of 2023, and Senator
Bennet’s Tribal Access to Clean Water Act of 2023 under-
scores that commitment to improving the quality of life in
Indian Country.
I am Melanie Anne Egorin, the Assistant Secretary for
Legislation (ASL) at HHS. My office serves as the primary
link between the Department and Congress. The Office of
the ASL provides technical assistance on legislation to
Members of Congress and their staff, facilitates informa-
tional briefings relating to Department programs to sup-
port policy development by Congress, and supports imple-
mentation of legislation passed by Congress.
The Department has been pleased to collaborate with
Congress and this Committee to investigate the many
challenges facing Indian Country. We have been engaged
specifically in recent months as the Committee has exam-
ined issues with water access in Native communities, and
operational challenges such as workforce recruitment and
retention, and the direct and secondary impacts that the
Indian Health Service has faced in combatting the growing
fentanyl crisis. As both IHS Director Roselyn Tso and Dep-
uty Director Benjamin Smith have respectively testified to
this committee, we remain committed to working with
Congress to improve health for AI/AN communities includ-
ing finding solutions to challenges related to clean water
access and workforce shortages. We are deeply appre-
ciative of the work of Senators Cortez Masto and Bennet

to draft legislation that aims to tackle some of these ur-
gent problems in Indian Country.
The IHS, as a rural health care provider, experiences
difficulty recruiting and retaining health care profes-
sionals. In particular, recruiting physicians and other pri-
mary care clinicians has been especially challenging. There
are currently over 1,856 IHS vacancies for health care pro-
fessionals including: physicians, dentists, nurses, phar-
macists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.
Staffing shortages are particularly prevalent in the behav-
ioral and mental health fields, which has only exacerbated
the concurrent substance use crisis and suicide crisis that
tribes across the country are facing in their communities.
AI/ANs overdose mortality rates and suicide rates remain
the highest compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
Workforce challenges—and the impacts on care that
come with them—are one of the top concerns raised to the
Department by tribes. The IHS continues to support new
strategies to develop the workforce and leverage advanced
practice providers and paraprofessionals to improve the ac-
cess to quality care in AI/AN communities. Ultimately, the
Indian Health Service needs additional authorities and re-
sources to build out their workforce pipeline. That is why
the President’s budget has included a number of proposals
dating back to Fiscal Year 2019 that have sought to make
the IHS more competitive with other federal agencies in
their hiring process and reduce systemic barriers to re-
cruitment and retention. HHS looks forward to working
with Congress on policy solutions to this effect, several of
which are outlined below.
I want to also reiterate that the Biden-Harris Adminis-
tration agrees that water is a sacred resource that must be
protected. The Administration and HHS have worked hard
to make good on decades of chronic underinvestment in in-
frastructure for AI/AN communities. The bipartisan efforts
of Congress—including many champions in this room—
helped to ensure that critical funds for clean drinking
water and modern wastewater and sanitation systems
were included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (IIJA). The Department of Health and Human Services
and the IHS are grateful for this partnership with Con-
gress, and our shared commitment to ensure that this his-
toric funding is implemented successfully and that these
dollars reach Indian Country as quickly as possible. That
being said, too many tribal families still do not have access
to clean water and reliable wastewater infrastructure.
S. 3022, IHS Workforce Parity Act of 2023
The IHS Workforce Parity Act, would amend the Indian
Health Care Improvement Act to allow recipients of the
IHS scholarship and loan programs to fulfill their service
obligations through half-time clinical practice.
Under current law, the Indian Health Care Improvement
Act requires recipients of IHS Health Professions Scholar-
ships or loan repayments to provide clinical services on a

full-time basis. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) was
amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (ACA) to permit certain National Health Service Corps
(NHSC) loan repayment and scholarship recipients to sat-
isfy their service obligations through half-time clinical
practice for double the amount of service time or, for
NHSC loan repayment recipients, to accept half the loan
repayment award amount in exchange for a two-year serv-
ice obligation fulfilled on a half-time basis. The PHSA de-
fines ‘‘full-time’’ clinical practice as a minimum of 40 hours
per week, for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. It also de-
fines ‘‘half-time’’ as a minimum of 20 hours per week, for
a minimum of 45 weeks per year.
The Indian Health Care Improvement Act would permit
both IHS Health Professions Scholarship and loan repay-
ment recipients to fulfill service obligations through half-
time clinical practice, under authority similar to that now
available to the NHSC Loan Repayment Program (LRP)
and Scholarship Program. Thus, if similar authority pro-
vided in section 331(i) of the PHSA were extended to IHS,
IHS loan repayment and scholarship recipients would have
more options and flexibility to satisfy their service obliga-
tions through half-time clinical work for double the
amount of service time or to accept half the amount of loan
repayment award in exchange for a two-year service obli-
gation. This legislative change would create parity be-
tween IHS and the NHSC programs and enable IHS to
make better use of these tools to recruit and retain key
professionals in a highly competitive environment.
S. 3022 as drafted attempts to model the language used
in the NHSC demonstration language. It should be noted,
however, that the NHSC language combines the two pro-
grams—Scholarship and LRP—in their language whereas
S. 3022 separates Scholarship and LRP. Additionally, IHS
is still examining how the text in S. 3022 might apply to
the IHS Health Professions Scholarship, a tool that plays
a significant role in the recruitment and retention of the
health care professionals needed to fill workforce vacan-
cies. Lastly, the NHSC language goes further in that the
recipient has to agree to the conversion to full-time equiva-
lents in determining damages if a breach occurs. IHS
would like to work with the drafters of S. 3022 to ensure
the language fits within the IHS Scholarship and Loan Re-
payment Program.
The IHS Workforce Parity Act is certainly aligned with
the goals of the IHS in many respects. The Fiscal Year
(FY) 2024 President’s Budget includes a similar proposal
to permit both IHS scholarship and loan repayment recipi-
ents to fulfill service obligations through half-time clinical
practice. The ability to provide scholarship and loan repay-
ment awards for half-time clinical service would make
these recruitment and retention tools more flexible and
cost-effective, providing incentives for an additional pool of
clinicians and other medical providers that otherwise may
not consider a commitment to the IHS federal, tribal, and

urban Indian sites. Having similar authority as the NHSC
would increase the ability of the IHS to recruit and retain
health care clinicians to provide primary health care and
specialty services and otherwise support the IHS and HHS
priorities.
Additional half-time direct care employees could also re-
duce the number and cost of Purchased/Referred Care pro-
gram referrals, especially at sites that do not need full-
time specialty care services. There are also a number of
smaller rural IHS sites where clinicians will be able to
provide a minimum of half-time clinical services with the
remainder of their time devoted to much needed adminis-
trative/management responsibilities. This proposal will
provide flexibility for providers who might not otherwise
consider service in the IHS by allowing part-time practice
in IHS to coincide with a part-time private practice, as
well as part-time practice in the IHS combined with part-
time administrative duties within the IHS.
Human Resources Proposals
As the IHS continues to prioritize recruitment and re-
tention of providers in our system, we would encourage
members of this Committee to review other proposals in
the FY 2024 President’s Budget that would better enable
the IHS to attract top talent. Many of these proposals are
budget neutral—small fixes that would have a major im-
pact on the efficacy and quality of the IHS. For example,
the IHS seeks a tax exemption for Indian Health Service
Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment Pro-
grams. Exempting the IHS Loan Repayment Program
would allow the IHS to award an additional 190 loan re-
payment contracts in a given year. Thus, the IHS would
be better able to increase the number of health care pro-
viders entering and remaining within the IHS to provide
primary health care and specialty services.
The agency is also seeking the discretionary use of all
Title 38 Personnel authorities that are currently available
to the Veterans Health Administration to pay higher sala-
ries and offer more flexible time off to their providers.
Typically, the private sector can offer candidates better
scheduling options and paid time off—particularly impor-
tant benefits to providers who serve in remote and rural
locations. The VHA has demonstrated the impact of these
authorities on public sector’s ability to hire for these crit-
ical roles, particularly in rural areas. As such, the IHS
faces specific public sector competition in the area of an-
nual leave accrual. Supervisors report anecdotally that the
IHS has lost many candidates to the private sector and
VHA due to this difference in accrual rates.
The IHS also seeks permanent authority to hire and pay
experts and consultants. Hiring experts and consultants is
another tool IHS can use to strengthen its workforce and
better serve the AI/AN population. These highly special-
ized individuals can bring added skills, knowledge, and ex-
pertise to meet mission-critical tasks. To combat future

pandemics, emergencies, and unique health-care chal-
lenges, it would be beneficial to hire experts and consult-
ants to provide additional high-level resources to the IHS
unavailable within the current workforce.
Additionally, the IHS seeks legislative authority to con-
duct mission critical emergency hiring needs beyond 30-
day appointments. Critical hiring occurs when an agency
needs to fill positions to meet agency requirements
brought on by natural disasters, emergencies, or threats.
The IHS has previously used this hiring authority to fill
positions in nursing, facility management, radiology, and
many other critical areas to ensure the operation of IHS
facilities and quality patient care.
Lengthening emergency hire appointments from 30 to 60
days would better enable the IHS to effectively provide
services and staff health care facilities from both an oper-
ational and budgetary perspective. The effort to hire, on-
board, and vet candidates through the pre-clearance and
background investigation process is significant, reducing
the benefit of this hiring tool.
REGULATORY AND PAPERWORK IMPACT STATEMENT
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regu-
latory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying
out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 632, as reported, will
have minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In the opinion of the Committee, it is necessary to dispense with
the requirements of subsection 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate to expedite business of the Senate.
