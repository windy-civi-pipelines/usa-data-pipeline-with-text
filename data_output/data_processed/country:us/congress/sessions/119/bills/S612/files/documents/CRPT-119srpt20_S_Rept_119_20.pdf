R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 612]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill,
S. 612, a bill to amend the Native American Tourism and Improv-
ing Visitor Experience Act to authorize grants to Indian tribes,
tribal organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations, and for
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon without amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE
S. 612 would amend the Native American Tourism and Improv-
ing Visitor Experience Act (NATIVE Act) to clarify in more detail
that federal agencies have the authority to issue grants to Indian
Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations,
and to authorize appropriations for those purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED
In 2016, Congress enacted the NATIVE Act to provide grants,
loans, and technical assistance to Indian Tribes, Tribal organiza-
tions, and Native Hawaiian organizations, to assist in developing
tourism in Native communities and provide opportunities for visi-
tors to learn about Native American history, cultures, languages,
and ways of life.1
The NATIVE Act provides funding for grants to meet the pur-
poses of the law, but it does not clearly authorize the Department
1Native American Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act, Pub. L. No. 114–221, 130
Stat. 847 (2016).

of Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of
Native Hawaiian Relations (ONHR) to issue the grants, which led
to implementation challenges.2 S. 612 addresses this issue by
amending the NATIVE Act to provide authorization to the BIA and
ONHR, along with several other federal agencies, to issue grants
to Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, or Native Hawaiian organi-
zations. S. 612 would also authorize appropriations of $35 million
for fiscal years 2025 to 2029 to carry out the grant program.
SUMMARY
S. 612 amends the NATIVE Act to redesignate an existing sec-
tion and insert a new section to clarify BIA, ONHR, and other
named federal agencies have the authority to issue NATIVE Act
grants and enter into agreements with Indian Tribes, Tribal orga-
nizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations. The bill also author-
izes $35 million in appropriations for fiscal years 2025 to 2029 to
implement the grant program.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 612 was introduced by Senators Schatz and Murkowski on
February 18, 2025.
In the 118th Congress, an identical bill, S. 385, was introduced
by Senators Schatz and Murkowski on February 9, 2023. The Com-
mittee held a business meeting to consider S. 385 on February 15,
2023 and ordered the bill to be reported without amendment favor-
ably (S. Rept. 118–9).3 The Senate passed S. 385 without amend-
ment by voice vote on November 21, 2024.4
In the 117th Congress, a similar bill, S. 3789, was introduced by
Senator Schatz on March 10, 2022. The Committee held a hearing
on S. 3789 on March 23, 2022.5 On May 17, 2022, Senator Mur-
kowski joined as a cosponsor. The Committee, in an open business
meeting on May 18, 2022, by a majority voice vote of a quorum
present, ordered S. 3789, as amended, favorably reported by voice
vote.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in an open business
meeting on March 5, 2025, by a majority voice vote of a quorum
present, recommends that the Senate pass S. 612.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1—Native American tourism grant programs
This section amends the NATIVE Act (25 U.S.C. 4351 et seq.) to
redesignate section 6 (25 U.S.C. 4355) as section 7; and inserts a
new section 6 following section 5 (25 U.S.C. 4354). As described in
section 6(a) of S. 612, the BIA may make grants to and enter into
agreements with Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations. In section
2For example, in FY 2022, the Department of the Interior partnered with the National Park
Service to issue NATIVE Act grants to eligible Native Hawaiian organizations because ONHR
currently does not have grant issuing authority.

6(b), the ONHR may make grants to and enter into agreements
with Native Hawaiian organizations. Section 6(c) clarifies that
heads of other federal agencies, including the Secretaries of Com-
merce, Transportation, Agriculture, Health and Human Services,
and Labor, may also make grants to and enter into agreements
with Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Native Hawaiian or-
ganizations to carry out the purposes of the NATIVE Act. This sec-
tion authorizes appropriations in the amount of $35 million to im-
plement the grant program for fiscal years 2025 through 2029.
COST AND BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS
S. 612 would authorize the appropriation of $35 million over the
2025–2029 period for a grant program to support Native American
tourism. Under the bill, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of
Native Hawaiian Relations, and other federal agencies would
award grants to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Native Ha-
waiian organizations.
The bill does not specify how much would be authorized for any
given year. For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be
enacted in fiscal year 2025 and that the authorized amount will be
provided in 2025. Based on spending patterns for similar programs,
CBO estimates that implementing S. 612 would cost $35 million
over the 2025–2030 period, assuming appropriation of the author-
ized amount.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 450 (community and regional development).

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior
from the March 23, 2022 hearing on S. 3789 follows:
INTRODUCTION
Aanii (hello) and good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice
Chair Murkowski, and members of the Committee. My
name is Bryan Newland, and I serve as the Assistant Sec-
retary for Indian Affairs at the U.S. Department of the In-
terior (Department). Thank you for the opportunity to
present the Department’s views on . . . S. 3789, a bill to
amend the Native American Tourism and Improving Vis-
itor Experience Act to authorize grants to Indian tribes,
tribal organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations,
and for other purposes . . .
S. 3789, A BILL TO AMEND THE NATIVE AMERICAN TOURISM
AND IMPROVING VISITOR EXPERIENCE ACT TO AUTHORIZE
GRANTS TO INDIAN TRIBES, TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND
NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS, AND FOR OTHER PUR-
POSES
S. 3789 would amend the Native American Tourism and
Improving Visitors Experience (NATIVE) Act (P.L. 114–
221) by creating a new section 6 (redesignating the current
section 6 as section 7) that would allow the Director of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs to make grants to Indian Tribes
and tribal organizations, and the Director of the Office of
Native Hawaiian Relations to make grants to Native Ha-
waiian organizations. The NATIVE Act, signed into law in
2016, requires the Department of Commerce, the Depart-
ment of the Interior, and federal agencies with rec-
reational travel or tourism functions to update their man-
agement plans to include Indian tribes, tribal organiza-
tions, and Native Hawaiian organizations. The Depart-
ment supports this bill.
CONCLUSION
Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and Members
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide

the Department’s views on these important bills. I look for-
ward to answering any questions.
REGULATORY AND PAPERWORK IMPACT STATEMENT
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regu-
latory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying
out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 612, as reported, will
have minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In the opinion of the Committee, it is necessary to dispense with
the requirements of subsection 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate to expedite business of the Senate.
