SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Access to Small Business Information
Act’’.
SEC. 2. EXCLUSION FROM THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT.
Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended
by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(10) EXCLUSIONFROMTHEPAPERWORKREDUCTIONACT.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Actions taken by the Advocate for Small Business
Capital Formation under this subsection shall not be a ‘collection of infor-
mation’ for purposes of subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 44, United States
Code (commonly known as the ‘Paperwork Reduction Act’).
‘‘(B) EXCEPTIONS.—Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the requirements
under subsections (c)(1), (c)(4), and (i) of section 3506 of title 44, United
States Code, and section 3507(a)(1)(A) of such title shall apply to actions
taken by the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation under this
subsection, except that the Commission shall not be required—
‘‘(i) to submit a collection of information by the Advocate to the Direc-
tor of the Office of Management and Budget, as referenced under sec-
tion 3506(c)(1)(A) of such title;
‘‘(ii) to display a control number on a collection of information by the
Advocate, as described under section 3506(c)(1)(B)(i) of such title (or to
inform a person receiving a collection of information from the Advocate
that the collection of information needs to display a control number, as
described under section 3506(c)(1)(B)(iii)(V) of such title); or
‘‘(iii) to indicate a collection of information by the Advocate is in ac-
cordance with the clearance requirements of section 3507 of such title,
as described under section 3506(c)(1)(B)(ii) of such title.’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3351, the Improving Access to Small Business Information
Act, was introduced on May 13, 2025, by Representative Young
Kim (CA–40). The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
to specify that actions of the Advocate for Small Business Capital
Formation are not a collection of information under the Paperwork
Reduction Act.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Advocate for
Small Business Capital Formation (‘‘the Advocate’’) is an important
independent voice at the SEC for American entrepreneurs, small
businesses, and capital formation more broadly. Each year, the Ad-
vocate and its staff host events around the country to support
emerging, privately held companies up to small public companies
and better understand their most pressing capital raising issues.
Such interactions help the Advocate analyze the potential impact
of policy changes likely to significantly affect small businesses and
their investors.
Under current law, the Advocate may not collect information—
such as through surveys or studies—from small businesses and en-
trepreneurs without triggering the Paperwork Reduction Act. This
in turn introduces a host of regulatory hurdles. By clarifying that
such actions of the Advocate are not a collection of information
under the Paperwork Reduction Act, H.R. 3351 will enable the Ad-
vocate to engage with American small businesses more easily
around the country to better understand the capital formation chal-
lenges they face, especially as they relate to policymaking in Wash-
ington. This simple fix will allow the Advocate to be a more effec-
tive voice in support of American entrepreneurs and capital forma-
tion.

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3351 is to ensure that the ac-
tions of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation are not
a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3351. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 3351 as the ‘‘Improving Access to Small
Business Information Act.’’

fy that actions taken by the SEC’s Advocate for Small Business
Capital Formation are not a ‘‘collection of information’’ under the

burdensome requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act.
