HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 for the ac-
tivities under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Legislative
Branch totals $5,005,964,900.
These appropriations support the operations of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the care and preservation of the historic buildings in
which Congress works, and the various agencies that assist the leg-
islative process.
In keeping with longstanding practice under which each chamber
of Congress determines its housekeeping requirements and the
other concurs without intervention, the bill does not include funds
for the Senate or Senate office buildings. Similarly, the Senate will
consider a legislative branch appropriations bill that addresses
Senate but not House funding.
The bill provides the legislative branch the ability to develop leg-
islation to meet national needs, maintain and build analytical ca-
pacity to support oversight of government operations, address high-
priority technology and security needs, and assist constituents in
their dealings with government while also showing responsible fis-
cal restraint.
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH-WIDE MATTERS
RESULTS, OVERSIGHT, TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Committee on Appropriations of the House (hereinafter ‘‘the
Committee’’) recognizes that effective programs, projects, and ac-
tivities must set transparent goals and measure progress toward
those goals using tangible, data-driven methods.
The recommendation continues to prioritize the proper manage-
ment of taxpayer dollars, including strong internal controls, re-
duced inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and waste, fraud, or abuse, and
a focus on results, and customer service for all agencies under the
jurisdiction of this Act. The Committee continues its focus on re-
ducing unnecessary expenditures and expects the agencies funded
by this Act to identify cost savings and efficiencies where possible.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
The Committee believes that development of organizational pri-
ority goals and outcomes, such as performance outcome measures,
output measures, and efficiency measures, is important for all
agencies funded under this bill. The Committee also notes the im-
portance of implementing proper customer service standards for
agencies that provide direct services to the public. Development of
these service standards should include identifying and surveying
target customers and measuring internal performance against
those standards. The Committee notes the creation of the Agency
Connection Center in the Longworth House Office Building and re-
minds agencies hosted within the center to maintain proper staff-
ing and hours.

In addition, the Committee understands that, as the largest ad-
vertiser in the United States, the Federal government should work
to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small, dis-
advantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and
women. The Committee directs each agency under the jurisdiction
of this Act to include the following information in its fiscal year
2027 budget justification: expenditures for fiscal year 2025 and ex-
pected expenditures for fiscal year 2026, respectively, for (1) all
contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the adver-
tising services of (a) socially and economically disadvantaged small
business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Busi-
ness Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)), and (b) women- and minority-owned
businesses disaggregated by race and gender.
REPROGRAMMING, NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION,
AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Committee expects all agencies to notify the Committee of
any significant departures from budget plans presented to the
Committee in any of the agencies’ budget justifications. The Com-
mittee recommendation grants limited reprogramming authorities
to ensure that funds are devoted to the highest priorities, particu-
larly due to changes in circumstances. Agencies funded through
this bill are required to notify the Committee prior to any re-
programming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10 percent or
$750,000 between programs, projects or activities, or in excess of
$750,000 between object classifications (except for shifts within the
pay categories, object class 11, 12, and 13 or as further specified
in each agency’s respective section). This includes cumulative
reprogrammings that together total at least $750,000 from or to a
particular program, activity, or object classification as well as re-
programming full-time equivalents (FTE) or funds to create new or-
ganizational entities within the agency or to restructure entities
that already exist.
In addition, the Committee must be notified of reprogramming
actions that involve less than the above-mentioned amounts if such
actions would have the effect of changing an agency’s funding re-
quirements in future years or if programs or projects specifically
cited in the Committees’ reports are affected.
Prior to initial obligation or reallocation of funds, all congres-
sional reprogramming notifications shall, to the maximum extent
practicable, contain detailed information about the sources of the
funds and why such funds are no longer intended to be used as
previously justified. The Committee emphasizes that all reports are
required to be completed in the timeframe noted in each respective
directive. Moreover, the Committee expects that the conditions as-
sociated with funding appropriated by this Act shall be accom-
plished in the manner as directed in the report, consistent with
congressional intent.
STAFFING DATA IN BUDGET DOCUMENTS
The Committee continues to direct the Legislative Branch agen-
cies to include in their budget justifications data on FTE levels that
would be supported by the associated request or enacted funding
levels. The Committee also continues to expect the Legislative

Branch Financial Managers Council to coordinate plans for align-
ing FTE levels with the legislative branch agencies for consistency
in reporting.
ZERO BASE BUDGETING
While the Committee continues to direct all agencies of the legis-
lative branch to develop budget requests from a zero-base, the
Committee is concerned that the zero-based budget documents still
lack sufficient detail for making funding decisions. The Committee
continues to see room for improvement and directs House agencies
to work with the Committee to ensure budget documents contain
the necessary information for meaningful savings.
CONGRESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LEGISLATIVE BRANCH CYBER
AND PHYSICAL DATA SECURITY
The Committee continues to reiterate that legislative branch
agencies should take proactive steps to protect critical Information
Technology (IT) infrastructure to secure and protect their data or
collections and to plan for disaster recovery. Consistent with the di-
rective in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the Legis-
lative Branch Appropriations Act, 2023, agencies are encouraged to
prioritize compliance to assure continuity of operations for the leg-
islative branch.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
The Committee notes the rapid development of artificial intel-
ligence (AI) tools and the opportunity for this advanced technology
to improve productivity and efficiency across all legislative branch
agencies. The Committee emphasizes the high value potential that
Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing resources contained with-
in agencies such as the Library of Congress (LOC), including Con-
gressional Research Service (CRS), the Government Accountability
Office (GAO), and even the Congressional Budget Office (CBO),
could play in accelerating the knowledge, efficiency, and operation
of each agency, as well as the entire Congress. The Committee en-
courages the LOC, CRS, GAO, and CBO to collaborate with the ap-
propriate congressional entities on common policy standards, in-
cluding privacy and security protections, and ways in which AI, in-
cluding LLMs, may be integrated, developed, and shared among
agencies funded within the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill.
CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM REPORTING AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
The Committee recognizes the critical importance of robust cy-
bersecurity practices across the Legislative Branch, particularly in
light of persistent and evolving cyber threats. To support consistent
oversight and continuous improvement, the Committee directs each
agency funded in this Act to submit a brief report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the
Senate within 180 days of enactment of this Act describing the sta-
tus of its cybersecurity program. Each report shall include a high-
level summary of the agency’s cybersecurity strategy, governance
structure, major initiatives, and resourcing; a description of which
cybersecurity frameworks or standards the agency uses to guide its

program (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800–53,
FISMA metrics, etc.), and how the agency evaluates its maturity or
progress; a brief summary of the agency’s top cybersecurity risks
or focus areas for the coming year (e.g., endpoint security, identity
management, cloud security, supply chain); and any unique cyber-
security challenges faced by the agency or organization.

and the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) to continue to work toward a solu-
tion to streamline and standardize the current system.
Congressionally Mandated Reports.—The Committee recognizes
the value of making statute-required reports more readily available
and discoverable. The Committee looks forward to receiving the re-
port, led by the Office of the Clerk and requested in House Report
118–555, describing the opportunities and challenges of making

lative branch is the creator and steward of invaluable information
in the form of data that is utilized by Congress, federal agencies,
and the public to ensure access to a historical record of legislative
action. The Committee looks forward to receiving an inventory of

Closed Captioning of House Floor Proceedings.—The Committee
understands that roughly 11 million Americans consider them-
selves deaf or have serious difficulty hearing. The Committee ap-
preciates the efforts of the Office of the Clerk, CAO, and Office of
Congressional Accessibility Services (OCAS) to provide live closed
captioning of the House Floor proceedings, which can be accessed
on a mobile device or in the House gallery. Further, the Committee
encourages the respective offices to continue their efforts in broad-
ening accommodations for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing commu-
nities.
Image Feasibility Study.—The Committee directs the Office of
the Clerk in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentarian,
Office of Legislative Counsel of the House, and the Office of Law
Revision Counsel to conduct a study on the feasibility of adding il-
lustrations, such as blueprints and webpage layouts, to the bill
drafting process. If the findings of the study are favorable, the Of-
fices may develop an implementation plan.

The Committee recommends $40,606,000 for the salaries and ex-
penses of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms. This amount is an
increase of $6,465,000 from fiscal year 2025.

current level of security measures across the Capitol campus, par-
ticularly when Members of Congress are travelling across the Cap-
itol Plaza to vote. The Committee directs the SAA to provide a re-
port to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee
on House Administration on additional ways to increase security
protocols for Members of Congress.
Family Friendly Campus.—Not later than 90 days after the en-
actment of this Act, the SAA shall provide a report to the House
Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on House Admin-
istration providing recommendations on designated parking spaces
for expectant mothers.
Member Office Safety Policy.—The Committee is aware that
there is occasionally a need for Members to bar individuals from
offices due to safety concerns. To address this need, the SAA is di-
rected to submit a report to the House Committee on Appropria-
tions and the Committee on House Administration within 90 days
after issuance of this report, identifying appropriate methods that
the SAA’s office could implement to address these concerns.
District Office Emergency Preparedness.—The Committee recog-
nizes the unique demands placed on district offices as they are lo-
cated in various settings and not on the Capitol Complex. Not later
than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, the House Sergeant
at Arms, in partnership with the Chief Administrative Officer,
shall provide a report to the House Committee on Appropriations
and the Committee on House Administration including rec-
ommendations on assisting district staff with developing and imple-
menting emergency action plans for significant threats, natural dis-
asters, extreme weather, hazardous materials, and medical emer-
gencies; developing emergency drills, including evacuation and
lockdown drills; and provision of emergency kits or supplies to dis-
trict staff.

Innovative Security Technologies.—The Committee encourages
the SAA to continue to work with the USCP to investigate whether
available innovative security technologies, such as firearm detec-
tion software, would complement the existing security infrastruc-
ture at member district offices, as well as evaluate the feasibility
of a voluntary program for member residences as a part of broader
security enhancement options.
Office of the Chief Administrative Officer........................................ $234,248,000
The Committee recommends $234,248,000 for the salaries and
expenses of the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. This
amount is an increase of $21,176,000 from the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee notes the high level of in-
terest among Members in AI, including appropriate privacy proto-
cols and sufficient training for AI users. The Committee continues
to look for ways in which the responsible use of AI can improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of House operations. The CAO is di-
rected, as part of their AI working group, to provide quarterly up-
dates to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Com-
mittee on House Administration on the progress of promoting AI
within the House. The Committee reminds Members and staff that
the CAO has established AI policies and calls on the CAO to con-
tinue to be responsive to Members interested in the implementa-
tion and training on AI.
Food Safety in House Dining Facilities.—The Committee under-
scores the importance of providing an accessible workplace for
those with food allergies and celiac disease. The CAO should
prioritize working with campus food service providers to ensure
that food is available, prepared, stored, and labeled appropriately.
International Travel with House Devices.—The Committee is in
receipt of the report ordered in House Report 118–120 calling on
the CAO with advisement from the SAA to examine additional
ways in which the House network and electronic devices may be
kept even more secure during Member and staff international trav-
el. The Committee appreciates the diligence of both the CAO and
the SAA in working directly with Members and staff to provide
temporary travel devices and important training sessions to edu-
cate them on best practices for ensuring device security and en-
courages all to utilize these resources.
Casework Assistance for Member Offices.—The Committee com-
mends the ongoing efforts by the CAO to assist Member offices
with casework through programs including the CAO Coaches, dis-
trict office conferences, and the development of the Case Compass
project to anonymize and aggregate constituent casework data. The
Committee looks forward to continuing to receive updates about the
progress of the Case Compass working group. The Committee also
looks forward to receiving the report requested in House Report
118–555 in which the CAO is directed to further examine what ad-
ditional assistance could be provided to Member offices to more ef-
fectively assist constituents with casework.

average salary ensures these employment opportunities are com-
petitive, the program continues to experience a decline in applica-
tions. The Committee encourages the CAO to work with the Com-
mittee on House Administration to potentially broaden the pool of
applicants through programmatic changes, such as allowing active-
duty spouses to be incorporated into the program and allowing
Members to request extensions for participants.

ommendations will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
House of Representatives so that it can better serve the American
people. The account continues to be funded at an amount that is
reflective of expenditure trends. The Committee reminds House en-
tities that any future funding requirements for modernization
projects, following initial funding from this account, should be in-
cluded in their annual budget request.

tive branch entity participation and directs the CAO to keep the

crease of $1,346,000 above fiscal year 2025.
The JCT operates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and
its predecessors dating to the Revenue Act of 1926. It has responsi-
bility to (1) investigate the operation and effects of internal rev-
enue taxes and the administration of such taxes, (2) investigate
measures and methods for the simplification of such taxes, (3)
make reports to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the
Senate Committee on Finance (or to the House of Representatives
and the Senate) on the results of such investigations and studies
and to make recommendations, and (4) review any proposed refund
or credit of income or estate and gift taxes or certain other taxes
set forth in U.S. Code section 6405 in excess of $2,000,000
($5,000,000 in the case of a C corporation). In addition to these
functions that are specified in the Internal Revenue Code, the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the JCT to provide revenue
estimates for all tax legislation considered by either the House or
the Senate.

UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE
SALARIES
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $603,627,000
Budget request, fiscal year 2026 ....................................................... 687,355,000
Committee recommendation .............................................................. 687,355,000
Change from enacted level ......................................................... +83,728,000
Change from request ................................................................... 0
The Committee recommends $687,355,000 for the personnel sala-
ries, benefits, student loan repayment, and overtime requirements,
to include the cost of overtime necessary for providing training of
the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP).
The Committee notes that the timing of this report coincides
with the selection of a new Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. The
Committee looks forward to working with the new Chief to carry
out the primary mission of the Department to ensure the safety
and security of the Capitol campus for the Members, staff, and the
millions of visitors it receives each year. Central to this mission is
the appropriate level of sworn officers and supporting civilian em-
ployees, and thus the recommendation provides the full request for
sworn and civilians. The recommendation does not provide ap-
proval of the Department’s proposed distribution of the new sworn
positions. The Committee directs the Chief to confer with the Cap-
itol Police Board to establish the appropriate assignments based on
the core priorities of protecting Members of Congress and securing
the Capitol complex.
Risk-Based Protections for Members of Congress.—The Com-
mittee continues to expect the Chief to continue working closely
with the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms and local law en-
forcement partners on the USCP strategy for Members’ protection
within the National Capitol Region (NCR) while outside the Capitol
Grounds and to educate Member offices on this topic. The Com-
mittee instructs the Chief to coordinate with the House and Senate
Sergeants at Arms to direct patrols to buildings or locations where
the Members tend to congregate in order to fulfill its mission under
2 U.S.C. 1966.
Overtime.—The Committee has supported significant increases in
sworn personnel and continues to support the use of Contract Secu-
rity Officers with the goal of decreasing the dangerous amount of
overtime required of officers. Meanwhile, the Department has yet
to demonstrate a corresponding decrease in the amount of over-
time. The recommendation provides the same amount of funding
for overtime as was provided in FY25. The Committee reminds the
Department that its primary responsibility is to protect the Mem-
bers and Capitol campus seven days per week throughout the year
and that overtime should not be used for routine weekend staffing.
Accordingly, the Department is directed to provide a report to the

Capitol Police Board and the Committee on Appropriations within
two weeks of when 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total overtime fund-
ing has been expended. Such report shall include the total use of
overtime by division, the justification for authorization of overtime,
and any other information directed by the Capitol Police Board.
Civilian Staffing.—The recommendation provides funding to sup-
port the requested level of civilian employees. It is the expectation
of the Committee that the Department will hire the requested
number of civilian employees to properly support the work of the
sworn force.
Budget Justification.—The Committee directs the Chief, in co-
ordination with the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), to revise
the Congressional Budget Justification to provide sufficient detail.
The Committee directs the Chief to work directly with the Capitol
Police Board in developing the parameters of the justification and
the appropriate level of detail for submission.
Concept of Operations Plan.—The Committee is pleased that the
USCP continues to implement its Concept of Operations Plan with
the establishment of a Workforce Management Office (WMO). The
Committee expects the Department to fully support the office with
appropriate staffing and funding levels and directs sworn officials
to promptly reply to requests for information and follow the WMO’s
guidance. The Committee looks forward to learning about the
WMO’s recommendations regarding staffing, overtime manage-
ment, and cost savings. Additionally, the Committee encourages
the new Chief to review the Concept of Operations Plan and report
to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on
House Administration within 60 days of the issuance of this report
on his recommendations for implementation.
Merit-Based Bonuses.—Included in the recommendation are
funds to support merit-based bonuses. It is the intent of the Com-
mittee that these funds be used to retain sworn personnel. When
appropriate, these funds may be used for civilians when approved
by the Capitol Police Board.
Crossing Guard.—The Committee directs the Department to pro-
vide a crossing guard at the intersection of New Jersey Avenue
S.E. and C Street S.E., as well as at the intersection of New Jersey
Avenue S.E. and D Street S.E., from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on days
when the House is in session. The Committee defers to the Depart-
ment in consultation with the Capitol Police Board as to the most
cost-effective method for providing these positions.
Parking Regulations.—The Committee encourages the USCP to
enforce parking regulations, in coordination with the SAA, along
First Street S.E., issue violations in a timely manner and imple-
ment towing services when appropriate.
Motorized Devices.—The Committee notes the continued interest
of Members, staff, and visitors to the Capitol campus in utilizing
scooters as a form of transportation. Therefore, the Committee rec-
ommends that the Capitol Police Board review the current motor-
ized device policy, considering the safety and protection of the Cap-
itol grounds and pedestrians.
Use of Grounds.—As instructed in House Report 117–389, the
USCP should continue to forebear enforcement of 2 U.S.C. 1963
and the Traffic Regulations for the United States Capitol Grounds
when encountering snow sledders on the grounds.

USCP Office of Inspector General.—The Committee includes no
less than $850,000 and supports no fewer than 15 FTE within the
USCP Office of Inspector General (OIG).
GENERAL EXPENSES
Appropriation, fiscal year 2025 ......................................................... $202,846,000
Budget request, fiscal year 2026 ....................................................... 280,404,000
Committee recommendation .............................................................. 203,546,000
Change from enacted level ......................................................... +700,000
Change from request ................................................................... ¥76,858,000
The Committee recommends $203,546,000 for general expenses
to support the responsibilities for law enforcement, Capitol complex
physical and technological security, dignitary protection, intel-
ligence analysis, event management, hazardous material/devices,
IT, and other specialized responses, as well as logistical and admin-
istrative support. Of the total, $10,000,000 shall be available until
September 30, 2030, for mutual aid reimbursements.
While the Committee supports resourcing the Department to
meet its essential needs and fulfill its mission, it has chosen to re-
duce general expenses funding. The Capitol Police’s budget has
seen a significant increase in recent years, which has been widely
supported, but the Committee acknowledges that full execution of
funding has been a challenge. The recommendation should not be
taken as a lack of support for the Capitol Police or its mission, but
rather in line with a requirement for prudent fiscal decisions.
Mutual Aid.—The recommendation includes $10,000,000 in
multi-year funds for mutual aid reimbursements. The Committee
notes that while the Department requested multi-year funds at an
annual average of $5,000,000 per year, the recommendation in-
cludes double the amount. It is the intent of the Committee to pro-
vide multi-year mutual aid funds on an annual basis to ensure suf-
ficient funding is available based on expenditure trends.
Fleet Management.—The Committee is concerned about the ever-
increasing number of vehicles in the USCP fleet, especially home-
to-work vehicles. The recommendation provides no funds for the
purchase or lease of new home-to-work vehicles and directs the
new Chief to review the current fleet and implement a pool-based
policy for assigned on call officers. The Committee fails to see any
value in home-to-work vehicles for civilian employees and expects
to see a responsible reduction in the number of all home-to-work
vehicles. The Committee directs the Department to submit a quar-
terly report on the reduction of the fleet.
Contractors.—The Committee notes the large number of contrac-
tors that the Department employs while falling short of civilian hir-
ing goals. The Committee directs the USCP to explore opportuni-
ties to recruit and convert existing contractors to civilian FTEs
within the requested number of civilian positions funded within
this recommendation. The Committees directs the Department to
submit a report, in consultation with the WMO, on the findings
within 120 days of the issuance of this report.
Body-Worn Cameras.—The Committee commends the USCP for
piloting a body-worn camera pilot program. Body-worn cameras can
not only protect officers but will also aid in the protection of Mem-
bers, staff, and the general public visiting the Capitol. The Com-

mittee looks forward to reviewing the interim report and its rec-
ommendations as directed in House Report 117–389.
Field Offices.—While offices were set up in strategic locations
several years ago as a pilot program, upon review by the Capitol
Police Board there has been insufficient return on investment for
this program. At the advice of the Board, the recommendation does
not include funding for continuation of this program. The Com-
mittee remains supportive of the work provided by the Special As-
sistant United States Attorneys (SAUSAs).
USCP Uniform Standards.—The Committee is aware of interest
in affording the USCP the opportunity to utilize regionally rep-
resentative headwear. The Committee recommends the Capitol Po-
lice Board review the uniform policies to consider potential flexi-
bility.
USCP Office of the Inspector General Report Disclosure.—In re-
sponse to previous House Reports, the Committee is encouraged
that the Office of the Inspector General has begun making its re-
ports publicly available whenever practicable and has started pub-
lishing reports on its website.
Wellness Programs for Law Enforcement.—The Committee appre-
ciates the role of the Howard C. ‘Howie’ Liebengood Center for
Wellness in carrying out a holistic wellness and resiliency program
for the USCP workforce. The Committee is pleased with the infor-
mation contained in the report directed in House Report 118–120
including the multiple programs the center offers and the level of
engagement in which the workforce participates. It encourages the
center to continue strengthening its support for PTSD and acute
stress disorder challenges that can often arise among officers and
staff engaged in security and protection work.

The Committee recommends $72,000,000 for salaries and ex-
penses of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO is re-
sponsible for producing independent analyses of budgetary and eco-
nomic issues to support the congressional budget process. Each
year, the agency produces dozens of reports, including its outlook
on the budget and economy, and hundreds of cost estimates for pro-
posed legislation.
Enhanced Estimate Transparency.—The Committee recognizes
the testimony of Phillip L. Swagel before the Subcommittee on the
Legislative Branch on April 29, 2025, that focused on the CBO’s ef-
forts to enhance transparency in estimate methodology and access
to data. As such, the Committee encourages the CBO to release a
section describing the basis of every cost estimate to be released at
the same time as the cost estimate. This section would include, but
is not limited to, the general approach, overview of methodology,
time taken to complete the estimate, and one potential limit of the
methodology.

The Committee recommends $701,358,000 for the activities of the
Architect of the Capitol (AOC). The recommendation is
$411,860,000 less than the request. (These totals do not include ap-
propriations for Senate Office Buildings requested at $223,296,000
which are traditionally left for consideration of the Senate.) The
Architect is responsible for the maintenance, operation, develop-
ment, and preservation of the United States Capitol complex. This
includes mechanical and structural maintenance of the Capitol,
congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings,
the United States Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power Plant, and
other facilities, as well as the upkeep and improvement of the
grounds surrounding the Capitol complex.

portance of proactive pest management and mitigation to ensure a
safe, healthy, and productive workplace and continues to support
proactive pest control measures for the House Office Buildings.

mittee recognizes the importance transportation studies have on
the safety of our roadways and pedestrian traffic and looks forward
to receiving the report and briefing as directed in House Report
118–555.

cerned about the increased regularity of elevator outages in the
House Office Buildings. The Committee appreciates the ongoing ef-
forts of the AOC to continue modernizing the underlying systems.

savings performance contracts at the Capitol, House, Senate, and
Library of Congress have resulted in roughly $200,000,000 in cost
avoidance and serve as an important effort in grid resiliency and
domestic renewable energy production. The AOC is encouraged to

Ongoing Security Projects.—The Committee has provided signifi-
cant funding to the Architect of the Capitol for security projects
over recent fiscal years that remains unexpended. Historically, the
Office of the Chief Security Officer (OCSO) has struggled to com-
plete these projects in a timely fashion; meanwhile, costs to com-
plete these projects continue to increase. The Committee directs the
OCSO to defer to the Capitol Police Board in determining security
project priorities for the Capitol campus and reiterates the impor-
tance of executing these projects in a more timely manner.

the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). The CVC was established to pro-
vide a secure public environment to welcome and manage the large
number of visitors and to protect the Capitol, its occupants, and
guests in an atmosphere of open access.
Dome Tour Transparency.—The Committee understands the spe-
cial privilege afforded only to Members of Congress to schedule
tours of the U.S. Capitol Dome. Due to the uniqueness of this op-
portunity and the volume of requests, it has become increasingly
challenging for Member offices to reserve a Dome tour. The Com-
mittee looks forward to receiving the report as directed in House
Report 118–555.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
Section 118 prohibits payment of bonuses to contractors behind
schedule or over budget during fiscal year 2026.

tions.—The Committee recognizes the cultural contributions of the
American diasporic groups from nations and communities of the
former Soviet Union and its Republics and appreciates the value in
preserving their histories and traditions. The Committee com-
mends the important work the Library of Congress is doing to iden-
tify, collect, and archive stories, documents, and other historical
materials from cultural and ethnic diasporas across Europe and re-
quests the Library further strengthen its partnerships with muse-
ums, non-profits, and ethnic heritage centers across the country to

cordings from families and institutions dedicated to Eastern and
Central European historical collections, and encourages the Library

fices to determine appropriate contacts for casework. The Com-
mittee is in receipt of the report directed in House Report 118–555
requesting CRS to examine the feasibility of expanding the legisla-
tive liaison list to include localized and regional agency contact in-
formation, as well as including agency policies regarding Privacy

continues to be pleased with the success of the Congressional Legal
Education Forum and provides $1,000,000 to continue the program.

rived from reimbursements for conducting financial audits of gov-
ernment corporations and the rental of space in the GAO building.
Agency Responsiveness to Congressional Inquires on Behalf of
Constituents.—The Committee looks forward to receiving the report
as directed in House Report 118–555 studying the current status
of responsiveness to House of Representative office inquiries on be-
half of constituents seeking assistance at select federal agencies.
Driving Implementation of Open GAO Recommendations.—GAO
report recommendations have the potential to save billions of dol-
lars and greatly improve government operations. The Committee
believes that a way to increase recommendation implementation
and hold agencies accountable for implementing them in a timely
way is for GAO to establish a timeframe in which a recommenda-
tion should be able to be fully implemented. As such the Committee
directs GAO to develop and implement a pilot to evaluate the effi-
cacy of including implementation timeframes when it makes rec-
ommendations. Among other things, the pilot will examine whether
including this information increases agencies’ implementation rates
and timeliness. GAO should brief the Committee on the results of
this pilot and make recommendations of whether the pilot should
be made permanent within two years of the start of the pilot. The
Committee expects agencies to provide GAO the necessary informa-
tion to develop implementation timeframes.
Eliminating Waste, Fraud, and Abuse.—The Committee con-
tinues to support GAO’s efforts to identify and report on inefficien-
cies in federal programs. To strengthen this work, the Committee
encourages GAO to enhance interagency data-sharing, promote
government-wide coordination, and expand the implementation of
GAO’s recommendations. The Committee believes such partner-
ships can further reduce redundancy, improve program outcomes,
and maximize the efficient use of taxpayer funds.
GAO Office of Inspector General.—The Committee includes no
less than $2,451,000 to support no fewer than 14 FTE within the
GAO OIG. The Committee believes that independence between leg-
islative branch OIGs and their respective reporting agencies is im-
portant and reminds the GAO that the budget and FTE amounts
in the report are expected to be provided as a floor for the OIG to
conduct its oversight mission. Additionally, the Committee is aware
of the OIG’s request to separate its budget from the agency and
continues to request that the IG provide the Committee with a
quarterly spend plan as the Committee considers this request.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
Section 121 limits the availability of funding related to civil ac-
tion.

MINORITY VIEWS
We appreciate the efforts of Chairman Valadao and his staff to
produce the Legislative Branch bill for the Fiscal Year 2026. Al-
though the bill includes Democratic requests, this bill, like many
others that the House Appropriations Committee recently reported,
continues the Majority’s proclivity to include divisive, partisan pol-
icy riders that aim to polarize our Congressional body and have no
place in the Legislative Branch bill.
The bill includes $5 billion in discretionary appropriations to
fund the offices of the House of Representatives and joint legisla-
tive branch items, a decrease of $275 million (or 5%) below the
FY25 enacted level. In keeping with longstanding practice whereby
each chamber of Congress determines its housekeeping require-
ments and the other concurs without intervention, the House bill
does not include funds for the Senate or Senate office buildings.
The funding levels and divisive policy riders in the Legislative
Branch bill are unworkable, and Democrats cannot support this
bill. The bill proposes nearly a 50 percent cut to the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) and a 10 percent reduction to the Li-
brary of Congress. The continued success of these institutions is
vital to the functioning of Congress. These severe cuts make their
success unattainable.
The Committee considered two amendments directly tied to the
reporting and oversight powers of the GAO. While both of those
amendments failed—first, a proposal offered by Mr. Quigley to
strike the second proviso under the GAO heading concerning the
agency’s self initiated activities, and second, an amendment to
strike section 121 concerning the agency’s authority to bring suit
under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974—the retention of the
underlying provisions implicitly reiterate GAO’s current law au-
thorities: the second proviso under the GAO heading demonstrates
that the agency is fully empowered, to the extent it does not con-
flict with their responsiveness to statutory direction and Congres-
sional requests, to initiate any work the agency believes furthers
its broader mission to support the Congress.
The retention of section 121—a condition placed on GAO’s appro-
priations in the bill—demonstrates with clarity that under current
law, the Comptroller General of the Unites States or the Deputy
Comptroller General carrying out the Comptroller’s duties, may
unilaterally decide, and is expressly empowered, to bring suit in
the United States District Court of the District of Columbia to seek
any decree, judgment, or order, which may be necessary or appro-
priate to make enacted funding available for obligation under the
Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Current law states that the
Comptroller General—consistent with the independent nature of
the Government Accountability Office’s mission—may exercise this
authority after satisfying a mere notification requirement to Con-
(67)

gress. The Committee notes that this authority has been in place
for over 50 years and was explicitly reaffirmed in 1987, over a year
after the Supreme Court’s 1986 decision in Bowsher v. Synar (478
U.S. 714). This bill, a stark reflection of the Majority’s misguided
priorities, imposes deep cuts to the Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO). While the Majority claims these cuts would eliminate
‘‘waste, fraud, and abuse,’’ it is ironic to decrease funding for the
very agency charged with doing just that. Our concern is height-
ened by the fact that the GAO currently has forty open investiga-
tions into whether the White House illegally withheld funds appro-
priated in the FY25 cycle, furthering an assessment that the Ma-
jority acts as a rubber stamp for the Executive Branch, rather than
an independent steward representing the People through the ap-
propriations process.
Further, the Majority’s refusal to adopt an amendment that
would support new mothers who work at the House signals a dis-
regard for staff, well-being, and the autonomy of House employees.
Additionally, the rejection of an amendment to publicly display a
plaque in honor of the valiant efforts of Capitol Police officers who
were injured or killed defending the Capitol on January 6th, 2021,
is both troubling and telling. The Majority’s decision not to ac-
knowledge these officers stands in great contrast to their usual pos-
ture of unwavering support for law enforcement. It is especially
ironic given their continued defense of President Trump’s par-
doning of individuals involved in the January 6th insurrection—
many of whom harmed and endangered the lives of officers. This
decision was nothing short of a disservice to the Capitol Police and
their families.
The bill does not do enough to enhance Member security. Threats
against members are increasing. The Capitol Police reports over
seven thousand threat assessment cases so far this year. We are
on track to far surpass the 2024 total of over nine thousand cases.
This is not a partisan issue, and it calls for a nonpartisan response.
We are glad that Leader Jeffries and Committee on House Admin-
istration Ranking Member Joe Morelle met with Republican leader-
ship and reached an agreement to work together on this matter.
While this bill falls short in promoting key areas of institutional
respect and support for major institutions and their staff, we com-
mend the Committee for including language that allows Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program participants to re-
ceive compensation as Legislative Branch employees. The adoption
of this amendment offers a glimmer of progress toward a future of
bipartisanship and camaraderie.
The Legislative Branch Bill should never be a place for divisive
politics. The Legislative Branch bill should be used to ensure Con-
gress has the tools to legislate and support the constituents we
serve.
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
This bill has been considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since President Trump took office in
January 2025 the executive branch has been engaged in a ramp-
ant, unlawful, and unconstitutional disregard for spending laws. In
particular, the Office of Management and Budget has been at the

center of a government-wide effort to thwart the intent of this
Committee’s laws in its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to
publish the agency’s legally-binding budget decisions (known as ap-
portionments) in contravention of an unambiguous and constitu-
tionally sound assertion of the Congress’s authority to impose
transparency requirements upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all Democrats on the Committee, the
debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just as former
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States William
Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney General
with the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any funds in the bill, so too does the Committee decide
the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the Com-
mittee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or upper
limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does so in
contrast to every other instance where it has included a specific
amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear intent to
be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
This subcommittee has a historic tradition of bipartisanship, and
we will work in good faith with our colleagues as we proceed
through the appropriations process with the hope of restoring bi-
partisan priorities in this bill. By working together, we can best ad-
dress the needs of the Legislative Branch for fiscal year 2026.
