TO AMEND THE TRIBAL FOREST PROTECTION ACT OF
2004 TO IMPROVE THAT ACT, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
MAY12, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 719]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill,
(S. 719), to amend the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to im-
prove that Act, and for other purposes, having considered the same,
reports favorably thereon, without amendment and recommends
that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE
S. 719 would amend the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004
(TFPA) to expand the lands and activities eligible for inclusion in
the TFPA program and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED
In 2002 and 2003, catastrophic wildfires, originating on national
forests and other federal lands, swept across the West and dev-
astated many Tribal forest resources and communities. The Tribal
Forest Protection Act of 20041 (TFPA) was passed in the aftermath
of these wildfires as a tool for Tribes to propose work to protect In-
dian forest lands and resources from various threats, including
wildfires. The TFPA authorizes the Forest Service (USFS) or the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to enter into contracts and
agreements with Tribes to carry out Tribally-designed land man-
agement activities on USFS or BLM administered forest lands or
rangelands that are ‘‘bordering or adjacent to’’ lands under Tribal
jurisdiction. The TFPA was intended to facilitate treatment and

collaboration between the USFS, BLM and Tribes to manage and
restore healthy forests on a landscape scale to mitigate wildfire
threats to Tribal lands. The Congressional intent of the TFPA has
gone largely unfulfilled for nearly two decades as the tool has been
under-utilized with few projects proposed and successfully imple-
mented.2
In 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 20183 (2018 Farm
Bill) provided the USFS (for the first time) and the BLM the au-
thority to execute ‘‘638’’ contracts and agreements to undertake the
administrative and management functions of programs imple-
menting TFPA work under the Indian Self-Determination Edu-
cation and Assistance Act (ISDEAA).4 The Forest Service’s ISDEAA
‘‘638’’ authority was initiated as a demonstration effort.
Like the ISDEAA, the TFPA authorizes Alaska Native Corpora-
tions (ANCs) as well as federally recognized Tribes to enter into
contracts and agreements with the BLM and USFS—however the
reference to trust or restricted fee lands in the definition of ‘‘Indian
Forest Lands’’ in the TFPA, and the requirement that the lands be
under the jurisdiction of the Tribe, has practically excluded ANCs
from participation under the statute.
Legislation is needed to expand the definition of ‘‘Indian forest
land or rangeland’’ in the TFPA statute to provide clarity for the
use of TFPA by ANCs.
Removing the barrier in the TFPA statute requiring TFPA
projects occur on federal lands that are ‘‘bordering or adjacent’’ to
Indian forest land and rangelands, and replacing it with a require-
ment that the federal lands present or involve a special geographic,
historic, or cultural significance to the Tribe, will permit Tribes and
ANCs to conduct landscape-scale management projects throughout
federal lands, more fully realizing the congressional intent of the
TFPA to provide Tribes and ANCs a greater voice in management
strategies to reduce threats to Indian forest lands and rangelands
and nearby communities, trust resources, and values.
SUMMARY
S. 719 would amend the TFPA to expand the definition of ‘‘In-
dian forest or rangeland’’ to include lands held by ANCs, eliminate
the requirement that projects take place on federal lands that are
‘‘bordering or adjacent to’’ Indian forest or rangeland’’ and replace
it with a requirement that the federal lands present or involve a
special geographic, historical, or cultural significance to a Tribe or
ANC, and it allows for TFPA projects to be carried out on Indian
forest or rangeland. S. 719 also provides an authorization of $15
million in annual appropriations for each of Fiscal Years 2026
through 2031 for TFPA implementation.

Section 4:
Section 2—Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 amendments
This section amends section 2 of the TFPA to:
• Add land in the state of Alaska held by Alaska Native Cor-
porations pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to the definition of Indian Forest
Land or Rangeland;
• Expand the authority of the Secretary to enter into agree-
ments or contracts with Tribes to protect Indian forest or
rangeland to include forest and watershed restoration activi-
ties;
• Expand the authority of Tribes and ANCs to carry out pro-
tection and restoration projects directly on Indian forest and
rangeland;
• Remove the requirement that Indian forest or rangeland
border or be adjacent to USFS or BLM lands, and replace it
with a requirement that the federal land eligible for TFPA
agreements have special geographic, historical, or cultural sig-
nificance to a Tribe or ANC;
• Update the program reporting requirement to require the
Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to USFS land, and the
Secretary of Interior, with respect to BLM land, to submit a re-
port to Congress not later than four years after the date of en-
actment of this bill5 that describes Tribal requests received
and agreements or contracts that have been entered into under
this bill; and
• Authorize appropriations of $15 million per year, from Fis-
cal Years 2026 through 2031.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 719 was introduced by Senators Murkowski and Heinrich on
February 25, 2025.
In the 118th Congress, a similar bill, S. 4370, was introduced by
Senator Murkowski on May 21, 2024. Senator Sullivan and Senator
Heinrich later joined as cosponsors. The Committee held a hearing
on S. 4370 on July 25, 2024 (S. Hrg. 118–532). The Committee, in
an open business meeting on September 25, 2024, by a majority
voice vote of a quorum present, ordered S. 4370, as amended, favor-
ably reported by voice vote (S. Rept. 118–249).6 The Senate passed
S. 4370 with an amendment by voice vote on December 12, 2024.7
COST AND BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS
The Committee has requested, but has not yet received, the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s estimate of the cost of S. 719 as ordered
reported. When the Congressional Budget Office completes its cost
estimate, it will be posted on the Internet at www.cbo.gov, and
printed in the Congressional Record.
5Section 2(g) of the TFPA (Pub. L. 108–278) states, ‘‘the date of enactment of this Act.’’ Cor-
responding text of the U.S. Code at 25 U.S.C. 3115a(g) was changed by the Office of the Law
Revision Counsel to read, ‘‘4 years after July 22, 2004’’ for clarity purposes.

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
from the July 25, 2024 hearing on S. 4370 follows:
Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and Mem-
bers of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
appear before you today to discuss the views of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Federally recognized Indian Tribes are sovereign nations
with long-standing government-to-government relation-
ships with the Federal Government. We acknowledge that
many of the Federal lands and waters managed by the
USDA and the Department of the Interior are the tradi-
tional territories of American Indians and Alaska Natives.
These lands are home to sacred sites and burial sites,
wildlife, and other sources of indigenous foods and medi-
cines. Many of these lands are in areas where Tribes have
reserved rights to hunt, fish, gather, and practice their tra-
ditional ceremonies pursuant to statutes and ratified trea-
ties and agreements with the Federal Government.
Forest Service policy honors the Federal trust relation-
ship with Tribes, promotes protection of these ancestral
lands and waters, and enhances co-stewardship opportuni-
ties with Tribes based on a suite of treaties, Federal laws
and regulations, court decisions, executive orders and
memorandums, interagency agreements, and agency-spe-
cific direction. These include but are not limited to the
Tribal Forest Protection Act, Good Neighbor Authority,
Stewardship Contracting Authority, Wyden Amendment,
Service First, Executive Order 14096 on Revitalizing Our
Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All,
and the Presidential Memorandum on Tribal Consultation
and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships.
The Forest Service’s recent expansion of work is con-
sistent with our general trust responsibility and honors
Tribal sovereignty. It has taken many forms:
• Tribal co-stewardship agreements developed in re-
sponse to Joint Secretarial Order 3403 promote an ap-
proach to managing national forests and grasslands
that seeks to protect the treaty, religious, subsistence
and cultural interests of federally recognized Indian
Tribes. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, the Forest Service
and Tribes executed more than 120 agreements, rep-
resenting a total investment of approximately $68 mil-
lion, more than triple the $19.8 million invested in FY

Section 5:
2022. These agreements implement vegetation man-
agement projects to protect Tribal land and commu-
nities and reduce hazardous fuels in critical and cul-
tural landscapes while strengthening our government-
to-government relationships with Tribal Nations.
• The 2018 Farm Bill also expanded the Good
Neighbor Authority (GNA) to Tribes. GNA allows the
Forest Service to enter into cooperative agreements
and contracts with Indian Tribes, States, and counties
to perform forest, rangeland, and watershed restora-

tion services on the National Forest System. Since FY
2018, Tribes have entered 30 GNA agreements, total-
ing $7.3 million, to accomplish a variety of restoration
work, including addressing wildfires, pest control, cli-
mate change vulnerability assessments, and cultural
resource protection.
• In FY 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) made additional funds available for In-
dian Tribes and states to implement forest manage-
ment and wildfire mitigation projects on Federal lands
pursuant to the GNA or the Tribal Forest Protection
Act (TFPA). The IIJA provided the Forest Service with
$5.5 billion to reduce wildfire risk and create healthy
and resilient ecosystems across Tribal, Federal, State,
and private lands. This included the first-ever Tribal
program appropriations for the Forest Service, in-
creased eligibility for Tribes, and opportunity for pri-
ority allocations for Tribes.
Several statutes and implementing regulations authorize
the Forest Service to enter into agreements and contracts
with and/or provide grants to Indian Tribes to protect
Tribal land, communities, and resources. The Tribal Forest
Protection Act of 2004 (TFPA) provides authority for the
Forest Service to enter into agreements or contracts to
carry out projects on the National Forest System that pro-
tect bordering or adjacent Indian forest land and range-
land from threats such as fire, insects, and disease while
being informed by Tribal knowledge. Tribes may submit
requests to the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into
agreements or contracts. The 2018 Farm Bill provided ad-
ditional opportunity, with a new Tribal forestry self-deter-
mination demonstration authority, for increased Tribal
participation in the co-stewardship of the National Forest
System.
TFPA has been a key authority available to the Forest
Service to collaborate with Tribes to protect Tribal forest
lands, rangelands, and communities from threats that
originate from the National Forest System and to restore
National Forest System lands that encompass treaty
rights, traditional use, and other areas of Tribal signifi-
cance. Notwithstanding the import of the TFPA in bring-
ing Indigenous Knowledge and Tribal voices to Federal
management of the National Forest System, some have ob-
served that there are aspects of the authority that limit its
application.
Some have argued that TFPA’s structure has limited the
program’s utilization and ability to meet Congress’ intent
of protecting and restoring Tribal lands. S. 4370, the Trib-
al Forest Protection Act Amendments Act of 2024, would
amend existing law to:

Section 6:
1. Expand the definition of ‘‘Indian forest land or range-
land’’ to include lands held by Alaska Native Corporations.
Under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA),
Congress did not place Native land in Alaska into trust or
restricted status. Instead, land was conveyed to Alaska

Native Corporations (ANCs) to manage for their share-
holders. TFPA’s current definition of ‘‘Indian forest land
and rangeland’’ prevents nearly 44 million acres of ANCSA
Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service
and Bureau of Land Management. In addition, the TFPA
requires that the land be ‘‘under the jurisdiction’’ of a
Tribe, which further prevents ANSCA lands from quali-
fying. There are four ANCs that hold lands pursuant to
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.) that border or are adjacent to the Chugach and
Tongass National Forests and/or may be proximate to po-
tential threats from those National Forests. Expansion of
TFPA to those lands under ANC oversight would create
opportunity for Sealaska and Chugach Alaska Corpora-
tions, and potentially Ahtna, Inc. and Cook Inlet Region,
Inc. The Forest Service does not have a presence outside
of southeast Alaska.

Section 7:
2. Strike the requirement that Indian lands ‘‘border on or
be adjacent to Forest Service or Bureau of Land Manage-
ment lands.’’ The bill instead requires the Forest Service
or Bureau of Land Management land to have a special geo-
graphic, historical, or cultural significance to an Indian
Tribe. Tribes have sacred sites, cultural landscapes, and
other resources on federal lands that they want to protect
or restore, but the lands on which those resources exist are
not always bordering on or adjacent to Indian lands.
Some have observed that a limitation of TFPA is the re-
quirement that the Indian forest land or rangeland border
or be adjacent to lands in the National Forest System.
This reduces participation for Tribes without an existing,
or no, land base that meets these criteria.
The TFPA currently includes the following Tribally-re-
lated factors in evaluating the proposal of the Indian
Tribe:
• the status of the Indian Tribe as an Indian Tribe;
• the trust status of the Indian forest land or range-
land of the Indian Tribe;
• the cultural, traditional, and historical affiliation
of the Indian Tribe with the land subject to the pro-
posal;
• the treaty rights or other reserved rights of the
Indian Tribe relating to the land subject to the pro-
posal;
• the Indigenous Knowledge and skills of members
of the Indian Tribe;
• the features of the landscape subject to the pro-
posal, including watersheds and vegetation types;
• the working relationships between the Indian
Tribe and Federal agencies in coordinating activities
affecting the land subject to the proposal; and the ac-
cess by members of the Indian tribe to the land sub-
ject to the proposal.
Amending the bordering or adjacency criteria to include
Indian forest land or rangeland and Tribal communities
that are reasonably proximate to a threat from the Na-

tional Forest System may be a more effective framework
to expand eligibility and to implement, as it can include
factors such as the type and extent of the risk to Tribal
lands, resources, and communities. For example, wildland
fire travels over many acres; disease can flow downstream
over many miles; insects can pervade over great distances.
Therefore, the scope of reasonable proximity to the threat
will expand the range of eligible Indian forest land or
rangelands so that more Tribes will be able to submit
TFPA proposals for work on National Forest System land.
Amending the bordering or adjacency requirement to in-
stead allow for proximity, amending the definition of In-
dian forest land and rangeland to include ANCSA lands,
and clarifying when Tribes must exercise jurisdiction over
the lands, may achieve the desired goals of establishing
Tribal relationships to the landscapes of interest and allow
ANCs to participate. If the Committee would like to dis-
cuss additional/different criteria to establish ‘‘special geo-
graphic, historical, and cultural relationships’’ or other ap-
proaches to define the Tribal relationship to the lands
within the National Forest System, the Forest Service
would welcome that conversation.

Section 8:
3. Expand program eligibility to allow for work on In-
dian forest land or rangelands. The current program only
applies to work conducted on Federal lands under the ju-
risdiction of the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. The TFPA came into being after the fire season of
2003 when 18 reservations were affected by wildfire from
federal lands. To help reduce the threat of future trage-
dies, the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 established
a process to allow Tribes to perform hazardous fuels reduc-
tion operations and other forest health projects on U.S.
Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands
bordering or adjacent to their own.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has authority and respon-
sibilities as trustee to manage Tribal forest lands pursuant
to the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act
(25 U.S.C. Chapter 33). Given this, the Forest Service
would like to work with the Committee to discuss the legal
and administrative impacts of changing the scope of the
TFPA, including how such changes may benefit by clari-
fying the role for each of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, For-
est Service, and Bureau of Land Management as agencies
with the different missions, obligations, and equities re-
garding work on the same Tribal landscapes.

Section 9:
4. Add/update reporting on the program. Although the
TFPA is a process authority and not a program, the Forest
Service takes no issue with instituting a reporting regime
to monitor and assess the performance outcomes of work
performed under the TFPA.

Section 10:
5. Add a five-year authorization of appropriations of $15
million per year. The Forest Service received its first-ever
TFPA appropriations in the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act, of up to $8 million per year for TFPA (Division
J) and $32 million per year (40804(b)(2)) for both States

and Tribes to implement TFPA and Good Neighbor Au-
thority. In FY 2024, more than $185 million was requested
by Forest Service field units to execute these authorities
with Tribes on the National Forest System.
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior
from the July 25, 2024 hearing on S. 4370 follows:
Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and Mem-
bers of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to
present testimony on S. 4370, Tribal Forest Protection Act
Amendments Act . . .
S. 4370, TRIBAL FOREST PROTECTION ACT AMENDMENTS ACT
The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows federally
recognized Tribes to propose forest or rangeland projects to
be conducted on lands managed by the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) and U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Forest Service to reduce threats to adjacent Tribal
lands, trust resources, and values. S. 4370 would amend
the TFPA to provide for participation of Alaska Native
Corporations (ANC), remove the requirement that projects
to achieve land management goals occur on lands bor-
dering or adjacent to Tribal lands, and extend application
of TFPA to projects occurring on Indian forest land or
rangeland.
On November 15, 2021, Secretary of the Interior
Haaland and Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack issued Sec-
retary’s Order 3403, Joint Secretarial Order on Fulfilling
the Trust Responsibility to Indian Tribes in the Steward-
ship of Federal Lands and Waters (S.O. 3403, Order). At
the Tribal Nations Summit on November 22, 2022, Sec-
retary of Commerce Raimondo joined S.O. 3403.
S.O. 3403 affirms the trust relationship between the
United States and Tribes and acknowledges that the
United States would benefit from the land management
expertise and practices Tribal Nations have developed over
centuries. The Order is also a commitment ‘‘to ensure that
Tribal governments play an integral role in decision mak-
ing related to the management of [F]ederal lands and
waters through consultation, capacity building, and other
means consistent with applicable authority.’’
The Department of the Interior (Department) recognizes
that forest and ecosystem health does not stop at the bor-
der of Tribal lands. The Department is committed to im-
proving the stewardship of our Nation’s Federal forest
lands by strengthening the role of Tribal communities in
Federal land management, honoring Tribal sovereignty,
and supporting the priorities of Tribal Nations. S. 4370
aligns with these important Administration priorities, and
the Department supports the bill.
The Department defers to the USDA regarding impacts
to lands managed by the USDA Forest Service.

BACKGROUND
The TFPA authorizes the Department to enter into a
contract or agreement with Tribes to carry out projects to
protect Indian forest land or rangeland, including pro-
posals to restore Federal land that borders on or is adja-
cent to Indian forest land or rangeland. The statute de-
fines ‘‘Indian forest land or rangeland’’ as ‘‘land that . . .
is held in trust by, or with a restriction against alienation
by, the United States for an Indian tribe or a member of
an Indian tribe,’’ and is ‘‘forest land . . .; or . . . has a
cover of grasses, brush, or any similar vegetation; or . . .
formerly had a forest cover or vegetative cover that is ca-
pable of restoration.’’ Covered projects must meet certain
criteria, including that the BLM-managed lands involved
must be adjacent to the Tribe’s trust or restricted fee
lands; those lands must be under the jurisdiction of the
Tribe; pose a fire, disease, or other threat to those trust
lands or be in need of land restoration activities; and
present or involve a feature or circumstance unique to that
Tribe (including treaty rights or biological, archaeological,
historical, or cultural circumstances). The TFPA requires
that the Department respond to such projects within 120
days of receiving a proposal. If the Department denies a
Tribe’s request to enter into an agreement, the TFPA re-
quires the agency to provide the Tribe with an explanation
for its decision, and to propose consultation with the Tribe.
Under the TFPA, Tribes and the Department have en-
gaged in mutually beneficial work to improve forest and
grassland conditions and protect Tribal lands and commu-
nities from risks.
Projects proposed by a Tribe under the TFPA may be
carried out through an Indian Self-Determination and
Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) funding agreement.
Like the ISDEAA, the TFPA may extend to ANCs as well
as federally recognized Tribes—although the reference to
trust or restricted lands, and the requirement that the
lands be under the jurisdiction of the Tribe, means that
ANCs are practically excluded from participation under
the statute.
ANALYSIS
S. 4370 would expand the definition of ‘‘Indian forest
land or rangeland’’ to include land in the state of Alaska
that is held by an ANC under the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) or has ‘‘a special
geographic, historical, or cultural significance to the Indian
tribe.’’ The bill also removes the requirement that projects
occur on Federal lands managed by the BLM or the USDA
Forest Service that are adjacent to Tribal lands. Rather, S.
4370 requires Federal lands present or involve a special
geographic, historic, or cultural significance to the Tribe.
Expanding the definition of ‘‘Indian forest land or range-
land’’ provides clarity for the use of TFPA by ANCs. Fur-
ther, removing the requirement that projects occur on Fed-

eral lands bordering or adjacent to Tribal lands removes
ambiguity pertaining to proximity. The BLM supports
these amendments to reduce the threats to Tribal forest
lands and rangeland, trust resources, and values.
S. 4370 also expands the lands on which Tribes may
carry out land management activities to include Indian
forest land or rangeland; requires the Department to sub-
mit to Congress a report describing the Tribal requests re-
ceived and agreements or contracts that have been entered
into; and authorizes the appropriation of $15 million per
year from 2026 through 2031 to carry out the Act. The
TFPA has been successfully used to address management
of lands administered by the BLM and USDA Forest Serv-
ice that are a priority to Tribes due to their associated
risks to Tribal forest land resources. The Department
notes that without more specificity in the proposed bill’s
definition, there is a risk that expanding the TFPA to in-
clude Tribal lands could potentially result in duplicate ef-
forts and the comingling of trustee obligations by the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs (BIA), USDA Forest Service, and the
BLM, as the BIA administers programs including forest
management and wildfire fuels reduction on lands held in
trust for Tribes. However, in any format, this proposal
would further Tribal ability to protect and restore forest
lands across boundaries as threats to and the overall
health of these lands do not stop at the boundaries of Trib-
al and Federal lands.
S. 4370 could allow for a TFPA project to occur in part
or in whole on trust lands managed under the authority of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). We would welcome the
opportunity to work with the Sponsor and the Committee
on revisions to clearly define the role of the BIA for such
projects. Finally, the Department would welcome the op-
portunity to work with the Sponsor on revisions that clar-
ify agency financial responsibility for cross-jurisdictional
projects.
The Department would welcome the opportunity to work
with the Sponsor and the Committee to ensure that the ex-
pansion of the TFPA to apply to Tribal lands results in
complementary, rather than duplicative, efforts.
REGULATORY AND PAPERWORK IMPACT STATEMENT
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regu-
latory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying
out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 719, as reported, will
have minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In the opinion of the Committee, it is necessary to dispense with
the requirements of subsection 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing

119THCONGRESS REPORT
1st Session " SENATE ! 119–23
TO AMEND THE TRIBAL FOREST PROTECTION ACT OF
2004 TO IMPROVE THAT ACT, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
MAY12, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Ms. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Indian Affairs,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 719]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill,
(S. 719), to amend the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to im-
prove that Act, and for other purposes, having considered the same,
reports favorably thereon, without amendment and recommends
that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE
S. 719 would amend the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004
(TFPA) to expand the lands and activities eligible for inclusion in
the TFPA program and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED
In 2002 and 2003, catastrophic wildfires, originating on national
forests and other federal lands, swept across the West and dev-
astated many Tribal forest resources and communities. The Tribal
Forest Protection Act of 20041 (TFPA) was passed in the aftermath
of these wildfires as a tool for Tribes to propose work to protect In-
dian forest lands and resources from various threats, including
wildfires. The TFPA authorizes the Forest Service (USFS) or the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to enter into contracts and
agreements with Tribes to carry out Tribally-designed land man-
agement activities on USFS or BLM administered forest lands or
rangelands that are ‘‘bordering or adjacent to’’ lands under Tribal
jurisdiction. The TFPA was intended to facilitate treatment and

collaboration between the USFS, BLM and Tribes to manage and
restore healthy forests on a landscape scale to mitigate wildfire
threats to Tribal lands. The Congressional intent of the TFPA has
gone largely unfulfilled for nearly two decades as the tool has been
under-utilized with few projects proposed and successfully imple-
mented.2
In 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 20183 (2018 Farm
Bill) provided the USFS (for the first time) and the BLM the au-
thority to execute ‘‘638’’ contracts and agreements to undertake the
administrative and management functions of programs imple-
menting TFPA work under the Indian Self-Determination Edu-
cation and Assistance Act (ISDEAA).4 The Forest Service’s ISDEAA
‘‘638’’ authority was initiated as a demonstration effort.
Like the ISDEAA, the TFPA authorizes Alaska Native Corpora-
tions (ANCs) as well as federally recognized Tribes to enter into
contracts and agreements with the BLM and USFS—however the
reference to trust or restricted fee lands in the definition of ‘‘Indian
Forest Lands’’ in the TFPA, and the requirement that the lands be
under the jurisdiction of the Tribe, has practically excluded ANCs
from participation under the statute.
Legislation is needed to expand the definition of ‘‘Indian forest
land or rangeland’’ in the TFPA statute to provide clarity for the
use of TFPA by ANCs.
Removing the barrier in the TFPA statute requiring TFPA
projects occur on federal lands that are ‘‘bordering or adjacent’’ to
Indian forest land and rangelands, and replacing it with a require-
ment that the federal lands present or involve a special geographic,
historic, or cultural significance to the Tribe, will permit Tribes and
ANCs to conduct landscape-scale management projects throughout
federal lands, more fully realizing the congressional intent of the
TFPA to provide Tribes and ANCs a greater voice in management
strategies to reduce threats to Indian forest lands and rangelands
and nearby communities, trust resources, and values.
SUMMARY
S. 719 would amend the TFPA to expand the definition of ‘‘In-
dian forest or rangeland’’ to include lands held by ANCs, eliminate
the requirement that projects take place on federal lands that are
‘‘bordering or adjacent to’’ Indian forest or rangeland’’ and replace
it with a requirement that the federal lands present or involve a
special geographic, historical, or cultural significance to a Tribe or
ANC, and it allows for TFPA projects to be carried out on Indian
forest or rangeland. S. 719 also provides an authorization of $15
million in annual appropriations for each of Fiscal Years 2026
through 2031 for TFPA implementation.

Section 2—Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 amendments
This section amends section 2 of the TFPA to:
• Add land in the state of Alaska held by Alaska Native Cor-
porations pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to the definition of Indian Forest
Land or Rangeland;
• Expand the authority of the Secretary to enter into agree-
ments or contracts with Tribes to protect Indian forest or
rangeland to include forest and watershed restoration activi-
ties;
• Expand the authority of Tribes and ANCs to carry out pro-
tection and restoration projects directly on Indian forest and
rangeland;
• Remove the requirement that Indian forest or rangeland
border or be adjacent to USFS or BLM lands, and replace it
with a requirement that the federal land eligible for TFPA
agreements have special geographic, historical, or cultural sig-
nificance to a Tribe or ANC;
• Update the program reporting requirement to require the
Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to USFS land, and the
Secretary of Interior, with respect to BLM land, to submit a re-
port to Congress not later than four years after the date of en-
actment of this bill5 that describes Tribal requests received
and agreements or contracts that have been entered into under
this bill; and
• Authorize appropriations of $15 million per year, from Fis-
cal Years 2026 through 2031.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 719 was introduced by Senators Murkowski and Heinrich on
February 25, 2025.
In the 118th Congress, a similar bill, S. 4370, was introduced by
Senator Murkowski on May 21, 2024. Senator Sullivan and Senator
Heinrich later joined as cosponsors. The Committee held a hearing
on S. 4370 on July 25, 2024 (S. Hrg. 118–532). The Committee, in
an open business meeting on September 25, 2024, by a majority
voice vote of a quorum present, ordered S. 4370, as amended, favor-
ably reported by voice vote (S. Rept. 118–249).6 The Senate passed
S. 4370 with an amendment by voice vote on December 12, 2024.7
COST AND BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS
The Committee has requested, but has not yet received, the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s estimate of the cost of S. 719 as ordered
reported. When the Congressional Budget Office completes its cost
estimate, it will be posted on the Internet at www.cbo.gov, and
printed in the Congressional Record.
5Section 2(g) of the TFPA (Pub. L. 108–278) states, ‘‘the date of enactment of this Act.’’ Cor-
responding text of the U.S. Code at 25 U.S.C. 3115a(g) was changed by the Office of the Law
Revision Counsel to read, ‘‘4 years after July 22, 2004’’ for clarity purposes.

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
from the July 25, 2024 hearing on S. 4370 follows:
Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and Mem-
bers of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
appear before you today to discuss the views of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Federally recognized Indian Tribes are sovereign nations
with long-standing government-to-government relation-
ships with the Federal Government. We acknowledge that
many of the Federal lands and waters managed by the
USDA and the Department of the Interior are the tradi-
tional territories of American Indians and Alaska Natives.
These lands are home to sacred sites and burial sites,
wildlife, and other sources of indigenous foods and medi-
cines. Many of these lands are in areas where Tribes have
reserved rights to hunt, fish, gather, and practice their tra-
ditional ceremonies pursuant to statutes and ratified trea-
ties and agreements with the Federal Government.
Forest Service policy honors the Federal trust relation-
ship with Tribes, promotes protection of these ancestral
lands and waters, and enhances co-stewardship opportuni-
ties with Tribes based on a suite of treaties, Federal laws
and regulations, court decisions, executive orders and
memorandums, interagency agreements, and agency-spe-
cific direction. These include but are not limited to the
Tribal Forest Protection Act, Good Neighbor Authority,
Stewardship Contracting Authority, Wyden Amendment,
Service First, Executive Order 14096 on Revitalizing Our
Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All,
and the Presidential Memorandum on Tribal Consultation
and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships.
The Forest Service’s recent expansion of work is con-
sistent with our general trust responsibility and honors
Tribal sovereignty. It has taken many forms:
• Tribal co-stewardship agreements developed in re-
sponse to Joint Secretarial Order 3403 promote an ap-
proach to managing national forests and grasslands
that seeks to protect the treaty, religious, subsistence
and cultural interests of federally recognized Indian
Tribes. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, the Forest Service
and Tribes executed more than 120 agreements, rep-
resenting a total investment of approximately $68 mil-
lion, more than triple the $19.8 million invested in FY
2022. These agreements implement vegetation man-
agement projects to protect Tribal land and commu-
nities and reduce hazardous fuels in critical and cul-
tural landscapes while strengthening our government-
to-government relationships with Tribal Nations.
• The 2018 Farm Bill also expanded the Good
Neighbor Authority (GNA) to Tribes. GNA allows the
Forest Service to enter into cooperative agreements
and contracts with Indian Tribes, States, and counties
to perform forest, rangeland, and watershed restora-

tion services on the National Forest System. Since FY
2018, Tribes have entered 30 GNA agreements, total-
ing $7.3 million, to accomplish a variety of restoration
work, including addressing wildfires, pest control, cli-
mate change vulnerability assessments, and cultural
resource protection.
• In FY 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) made additional funds available for In-
dian Tribes and states to implement forest manage-
ment and wildfire mitigation projects on Federal lands
pursuant to the GNA or the Tribal Forest Protection
Act (TFPA). The IIJA provided the Forest Service with
$5.5 billion to reduce wildfire risk and create healthy
and resilient ecosystems across Tribal, Federal, State,
and private lands. This included the first-ever Tribal
program appropriations for the Forest Service, in-
creased eligibility for Tribes, and opportunity for pri-
ority allocations for Tribes.
Several statutes and implementing regulations authorize
the Forest Service to enter into agreements and contracts
with and/or provide grants to Indian Tribes to protect
Tribal land, communities, and resources. The Tribal Forest
Protection Act of 2004 (TFPA) provides authority for the
Forest Service to enter into agreements or contracts to
carry out projects on the National Forest System that pro-
tect bordering or adjacent Indian forest land and range-
land from threats such as fire, insects, and disease while
being informed by Tribal knowledge. Tribes may submit
requests to the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into
agreements or contracts. The 2018 Farm Bill provided ad-
ditional opportunity, with a new Tribal forestry self-deter-
mination demonstration authority, for increased Tribal
participation in the co-stewardship of the National Forest
System.
TFPA has been a key authority available to the Forest
Service to collaborate with Tribes to protect Tribal forest
lands, rangelands, and communities from threats that
originate from the National Forest System and to restore
National Forest System lands that encompass treaty
rights, traditional use, and other areas of Tribal signifi-
cance. Notwithstanding the import of the TFPA in bring-
ing Indigenous Knowledge and Tribal voices to Federal
management of the National Forest System, some have ob-
served that there are aspects of the authority that limit its
application.
Some have argued that TFPA’s structure has limited the
program’s utilization and ability to meet Congress’ intent
of protecting and restoring Tribal lands. S. 4370, the Trib-
al Forest Protection Act Amendments Act of 2024, would
amend existing law to:
1. Expand the definition of ‘‘Indian forest land or range-
land’’ to include lands held by Alaska Native Corporations.
Under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA),
Congress did not place Native land in Alaska into trust or
restricted status. Instead, land was conveyed to Alaska

Native Corporations (ANCs) to manage for their share-
holders. TFPA’s current definition of ‘‘Indian forest land
and rangeland’’ prevents nearly 44 million acres of ANCSA
Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service
and Bureau of Land Management. In addition, the TFPA
requires that the land be ‘‘under the jurisdiction’’ of a
Tribe, which further prevents ANSCA lands from quali-
fying. There are four ANCs that hold lands pursuant to
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.) that border or are adjacent to the Chugach and
Tongass National Forests and/or may be proximate to po-
tential threats from those National Forests. Expansion of
TFPA to those lands under ANC oversight would create
opportunity for Sealaska and Chugach Alaska Corpora-
tions, and potentially Ahtna, Inc. and Cook Inlet Region,
Inc. The Forest Service does not have a presence outside
of southeast Alaska.
2. Strike the requirement that Indian lands ‘‘border on or
be adjacent to Forest Service or Bureau of Land Manage-
ment lands.’’ The bill instead requires the Forest Service
or Bureau of Land Management land to have a special geo-
graphic, historical, or cultural significance to an Indian
Tribe. Tribes have sacred sites, cultural landscapes, and
other resources on federal lands that they want to protect
or restore, but the lands on which those resources exist are
not always bordering on or adjacent to Indian lands.
Some have observed that a limitation of TFPA is the re-
quirement that the Indian forest land or rangeland border
or be adjacent to lands in the National Forest System.
This reduces participation for Tribes without an existing,
or no, land base that meets these criteria.
The TFPA currently includes the following Tribally-re-
lated factors in evaluating the proposal of the Indian
Tribe:
• the status of the Indian Tribe as an Indian Tribe;
• the trust status of the Indian forest land or range-
land of the Indian Tribe;
• the cultural, traditional, and historical affiliation
of the Indian Tribe with the land subject to the pro-
posal;
• the treaty rights or other reserved rights of the
Indian Tribe relating to the land subject to the pro-
posal;
• the Indigenous Knowledge and skills of members
of the Indian Tribe;
• the features of the landscape subject to the pro-
posal, including watersheds and vegetation types;
• the working relationships between the Indian
Tribe and Federal agencies in coordinating activities
affecting the land subject to the proposal; and the ac-
cess by members of the Indian tribe to the land sub-
ject to the proposal.
Amending the bordering or adjacency criteria to include
Indian forest land or rangeland and Tribal communities
that are reasonably proximate to a threat from the Na-

tional Forest System may be a more effective framework
to expand eligibility and to implement, as it can include
factors such as the type and extent of the risk to Tribal
lands, resources, and communities. For example, wildland
fire travels over many acres; disease can flow downstream
over many miles; insects can pervade over great distances.
Therefore, the scope of reasonable proximity to the threat
will expand the range of eligible Indian forest land or
rangelands so that more Tribes will be able to submit
TFPA proposals for work on National Forest System land.
Amending the bordering or adjacency requirement to in-
stead allow for proximity, amending the definition of In-
dian forest land and rangeland to include ANCSA lands,
and clarifying when Tribes must exercise jurisdiction over
the lands, may achieve the desired goals of establishing
Tribal relationships to the landscapes of interest and allow
ANCs to participate. If the Committee would like to dis-
cuss additional/different criteria to establish ‘‘special geo-
graphic, historical, and cultural relationships’’ or other ap-
proaches to define the Tribal relationship to the lands
within the National Forest System, the Forest Service
would welcome that conversation.
3. Expand program eligibility to allow for work on In-
dian forest land or rangelands. The current program only
applies to work conducted on Federal lands under the ju-
risdiction of the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. The TFPA came into being after the fire season of
2003 when 18 reservations were affected by wildfire from
federal lands. To help reduce the threat of future trage-
dies, the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 established
a process to allow Tribes to perform hazardous fuels reduc-
tion operations and other forest health projects on U.S.
Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands
bordering or adjacent to their own.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has authority and respon-
sibilities as trustee to manage Tribal forest lands pursuant
to the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act
(25 U.S.C. Chapter 33). Given this, the Forest Service
would like to work with the Committee to discuss the legal
and administrative impacts of changing the scope of the
TFPA, including how such changes may benefit by clari-
fying the role for each of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, For-
est Service, and Bureau of Land Management as agencies
with the different missions, obligations, and equities re-
garding work on the same Tribal landscapes.
4. Add/update reporting on the program. Although the
TFPA is a process authority and not a program, the Forest
Service takes no issue with instituting a reporting regime
to monitor and assess the performance outcomes of work
performed under the TFPA.
5. Add a five-year authorization of appropriations of $15
million per year. The Forest Service received its first-ever
TFPA appropriations in the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act, of up to $8 million per year for TFPA (Division
J) and $32 million per year (40804(b)(2)) for both States

and Tribes to implement TFPA and Good Neighbor Au-
thority. In FY 2024, more than $185 million was requested
by Forest Service field units to execute these authorities
with Tribes on the National Forest System.
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior
from the July 25, 2024 hearing on S. 4370 follows:
Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and Mem-
bers of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to
present testimony on S. 4370, Tribal Forest Protection Act
Amendments Act . . .
S. 4370, TRIBAL FOREST PROTECTION ACT AMENDMENTS ACT
The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows federally
recognized Tribes to propose forest or rangeland projects to
be conducted on lands managed by the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) and U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Forest Service to reduce threats to adjacent Tribal
lands, trust resources, and values. S. 4370 would amend
the TFPA to provide for participation of Alaska Native
Corporations (ANC), remove the requirement that projects
to achieve land management goals occur on lands bor-
dering or adjacent to Tribal lands, and extend application
of TFPA to projects occurring on Indian forest land or
rangeland.
On November 15, 2021, Secretary of the Interior
Haaland and Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack issued Sec-
retary’s Order 3403, Joint Secretarial Order on Fulfilling
the Trust Responsibility to Indian Tribes in the Steward-
ship of Federal Lands and Waters (S.O. 3403, Order). At
the Tribal Nations Summit on November 22, 2022, Sec-
retary of Commerce Raimondo joined S.O. 3403.
S.O. 3403 affirms the trust relationship between the
United States and Tribes and acknowledges that the
United States would benefit from the land management
expertise and practices Tribal Nations have developed over
centuries. The Order is also a commitment ‘‘to ensure that
Tribal governments play an integral role in decision mak-
ing related to the management of [F]ederal lands and
waters through consultation, capacity building, and other
means consistent with applicable authority.’’
The Department of the Interior (Department) recognizes
that forest and ecosystem health does not stop at the bor-
der of Tribal lands. The Department is committed to im-
proving the stewardship of our Nation’s Federal forest
lands by strengthening the role of Tribal communities in
Federal land management, honoring Tribal sovereignty,
and supporting the priorities of Tribal Nations. S. 4370
aligns with these important Administration priorities, and
the Department supports the bill.
The Department defers to the USDA regarding impacts
to lands managed by the USDA Forest Service.

BACKGROUND
The TFPA authorizes the Department to enter into a
contract or agreement with Tribes to carry out projects to
protect Indian forest land or rangeland, including pro-
posals to restore Federal land that borders on or is adja-
cent to Indian forest land or rangeland. The statute de-
fines ‘‘Indian forest land or rangeland’’ as ‘‘land that . . .
is held in trust by, or with a restriction against alienation
by, the United States for an Indian tribe or a member of
an Indian tribe,’’ and is ‘‘forest land . . .; or . . . has a
cover of grasses, brush, or any similar vegetation; or . . .
formerly had a forest cover or vegetative cover that is ca-
pable of restoration.’’ Covered projects must meet certain
criteria, including that the BLM-managed lands involved
must be adjacent to the Tribe’s trust or restricted fee
lands; those lands must be under the jurisdiction of the
Tribe; pose a fire, disease, or other threat to those trust
lands or be in need of land restoration activities; and
present or involve a feature or circumstance unique to that
Tribe (including treaty rights or biological, archaeological,
historical, or cultural circumstances). The TFPA requires
that the Department respond to such projects within 120
days of receiving a proposal. If the Department denies a
Tribe’s request to enter into an agreement, the TFPA re-
quires the agency to provide the Tribe with an explanation
for its decision, and to propose consultation with the Tribe.
Under the TFPA, Tribes and the Department have en-
gaged in mutually beneficial work to improve forest and
grassland conditions and protect Tribal lands and commu-
nities from risks.
Projects proposed by a Tribe under the TFPA may be
carried out through an Indian Self-Determination and
Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) funding agreement.
Like the ISDEAA, the TFPA may extend to ANCs as well
as federally recognized Tribes—although the reference to
trust or restricted lands, and the requirement that the
lands be under the jurisdiction of the Tribe, means that
ANCs are practically excluded from participation under
the statute.
ANALYSIS
S. 4370 would expand the definition of ‘‘Indian forest
land or rangeland’’ to include land in the state of Alaska
that is held by an ANC under the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) or has ‘‘a special
geographic, historical, or cultural significance to the Indian
tribe.’’ The bill also removes the requirement that projects
occur on Federal lands managed by the BLM or the USDA
Forest Service that are adjacent to Tribal lands. Rather, S.
4370 requires Federal lands present or involve a special
geographic, historic, or cultural significance to the Tribe.
Expanding the definition of ‘‘Indian forest land or range-
land’’ provides clarity for the use of TFPA by ANCs. Fur-
ther, removing the requirement that projects occur on Fed-

eral lands bordering or adjacent to Tribal lands removes
ambiguity pertaining to proximity. The BLM supports
these amendments to reduce the threats to Tribal forest
lands and rangeland, trust resources, and values.
S. 4370 also expands the lands on which Tribes may
carry out land management activities to include Indian
forest land or rangeland; requires the Department to sub-
mit to Congress a report describing the Tribal requests re-
ceived and agreements or contracts that have been entered
into; and authorizes the appropriation of $15 million per
year from 2026 through 2031 to carry out the Act. The
TFPA has been successfully used to address management
of lands administered by the BLM and USDA Forest Serv-
ice that are a priority to Tribes due to their associated
risks to Tribal forest land resources. The Department
notes that without more specificity in the proposed bill’s
definition, there is a risk that expanding the TFPA to in-
clude Tribal lands could potentially result in duplicate ef-
forts and the comingling of trustee obligations by the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs (BIA), USDA Forest Service, and the
BLM, as the BIA administers programs including forest
management and wildfire fuels reduction on lands held in
trust for Tribes. However, in any format, this proposal
would further Tribal ability to protect and restore forest
lands across boundaries as threats to and the overall
health of these lands do not stop at the boundaries of Trib-
al and Federal lands.
S. 4370 could allow for a TFPA project to occur in part
or in whole on trust lands managed under the authority of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). We would welcome the
opportunity to work with the Sponsor and the Committee
on revisions to clearly define the role of the BIA for such
projects. Finally, the Department would welcome the op-
portunity to work with the Sponsor on revisions that clar-
ify agency financial responsibility for cross-jurisdictional
projects.
The Department would welcome the opportunity to work
with the Sponsor and the Committee to ensure that the ex-
pansion of the TFPA to apply to Tribal lands results in
complementary, rather than duplicative, efforts.
REGULATORY AND PAPERWORK IMPACT STATEMENT
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regu-
latory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying
out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 719, as reported, will
have minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In the opinion of the Committee, it is necessary to dispense with
the requirements of subsection 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
