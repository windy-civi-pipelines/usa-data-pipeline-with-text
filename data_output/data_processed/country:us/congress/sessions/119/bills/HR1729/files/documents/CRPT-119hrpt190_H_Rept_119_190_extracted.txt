BOLTS DITCH ACT
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 1729]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 1729) to amend the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation,
Management, and Recreation Act to allow for additional entities to
be eligible to complete the maintenance work on Bolts Ditch and
the Bolts Ditch Headgate within the Holy Cross Wilderness, Colo-
rado, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with-
out amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 1729 is to amend the John D. Dingell, Jr.
Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act to allow for addi-
tional entities to be eligible to complete the maintenance work on
Bolts Ditch and the Bolts Ditch Headgate within the Holy Cross
Wilderness, Colorado.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Bolts Ditch and the Bolts Ditch headgate are water facilities lo-
cated near the Town of Minturn, Colorado, that divert water into
Bolts Lake.1 In 1980, Congress established the Holy Cross Wilder-
ness in the White River and San Isabel National Forests and inad-
vertently failed to include Bolts Ditch among a list of existing
water facilities excluded from the designation, meaning the struc-

ture could not be rebuilt or repaired for more than three decades.2
The inability to rehabilitate and rebuild the Bolts Ditch headgate
stymied any development in the area, as any new development
would require the expansion of Bolts Lake to provide a water sup-
ply for surrounding homes.3
In 2019, Congress passed the ‘‘John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation,
Management, and Recreation Act’’ (Dingell Act), which included a
provision allowing the Town of Minturn to access the Bolts Ditch
headgate for ‘‘the diversion of water and use, maintenance, and re-
pair of such ditch and headgate.’’4 H.R. 1729, the ‘‘Bolts Ditch Act,’’
amends the Dingell Act to allow the Eagle River Water and Sanita-
tion District, a Colorado Special District, and the Upper Eagle Re-
gional Water Authority to also conduct maintenance and repairs on
the ditch and headgate. This commonsense change will improve the
efficiency and operation of the headgate and lead to greater eco-
nomic opportunity for the community of Minturn.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 1729 was introduced on February 27, 2025, by Representa-
tive Joe Neguse (D–CO). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources. On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural
Resources met to consider the bill. The bill was then ordered favor-
ably reported to the House of Representatives by unanimous con-
sent.

lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing in the 118th Congress by the Subcommittee on Federal Lands
held on January 31, 2024.
