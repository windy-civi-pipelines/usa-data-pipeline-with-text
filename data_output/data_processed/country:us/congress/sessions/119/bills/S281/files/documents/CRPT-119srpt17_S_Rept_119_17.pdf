TICKETING ACT
APRIL29, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 281]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 281) to require sellers of event tick-
ets to disclose comprehensive information to consumers about tick-
et prices and related fees, to prohibit speculative ticketing, and for
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon with amendments and recommends that the bill, as
amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 281, the TICKET Act, is to require sellers of
event tickets to implement a number of pro-consumer policies with-
in the live event ticketing marketplace, including requirements to
disclose comprehensive information up front to consumers about
ticket prices and related fees, ban the sale of speculative event tick-
ets, and provide refunds for certain canceled or postponed live
events.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Drip pricing is the practice of advertising only part of a product’s
price up front and revealing additional charges later as a consumer
goes through the purchasing process. When drip pricing is used in
the sale of event tickets, purchasers will likely experience addi-
tional mandatory charges or fees on their purchase, which are not
disclosed to the consumer with the initial price. As a result of drip

pricing, consumers may pay significantly more for an event ticket
than the advertised price. A 2019 report by Consumer Reports
found that at least 85 percent of Americans have encountered an
unexpected or hidden fee for a service they had used in the past
2 years.1
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has long expressed con-
cerns with drip pricing, noting that such advertisements decep-
tively lower consumers’ estimates of how much they expect to (and
will) pay for a product or service. In 2012, the FTC hosted a con-
ference to examine drip pricing.2 FTC staff made a recommenda-
tion for upfront pricing for hotels in a 2017 staff report.3 The De-
partment of Transportation requires airlines to advertise the full
fare for air transportation.4
In 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) studied the
ticket market and concluded that, on average, 27 percent of the
total price for a ticket is comprised of fees, and in some cases that
percentage can climb as high as 75 percent. GAO further noted
similar issues with drip pricing by both primary and secondary
ticket sales, finding that of the events reviewed, in more than 60
percent of sales in the primary ticket market, consumers could as-
certain the amount of fees only by: (1) selecting a seat; (2) clicking
through one or two additional screens; (3) creating a user name
and password (or logging in); and (4) clicking an icon labeled Order
Details which displayed the ticket’s face-value price and the fees.
In the secondary market, GAO found that for 7 out of 11 websites,
ticket fees were only disclosed at the very end of the purchase proc-
ess.5 This is one reason why GAO suggested Congress consider a
requirement that the all-in-price should be disclosed to consumers
up front.
In June 2019, the FTC held a workshop exploring the online
event ticket marketplace. All workshop panelists that discussed
event ticket fees—including participating ticket sellers—supported
legislation or rulemaking to require that event ticket prices be in-
clusive of additional fees up front and deterring violators through
strong enforcement with meaningful penalties.6
Studies show that consumers only look at the advertised or listed
price when making purchase decisions; sellers are thereby
incentivized to hide as many fees as possible to compete with other
sellers.7 Disclosing the all-in price up front allows consumers to

shop more efficiently, by allowing them to effectively comparison
shop and avoid spending more than they intended to.
In June 2023, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Prod-
uct Safety, and Data Security of the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on ‘‘Protecting
Consumers from Junk Fees,’’ which highlighted the need for legis-
lative action, including in the event ticketing space.8 Hidden fees
are particularly common for event ticketing, where consumers often
learn of additional fees after selecting a seat for a particular event
and entering their information. Drip pricing is especially problem-
atic for sports fans and concert goers who are shopping for a finite
number of tickets with a deadline to buy their tickets before an
event commences or sells out. These consumers are impeded by im-
perfect information and cannot adequately comparison shop—they
risk losing out on making the best (i.e. lowest price) purchase be-
fore another buyer swoops in and buys the ticket instead. As a re-
sult of such hidden fees, and the confusion they inject into the pur-
chasing process, consumers tend to buy more expensive products
than they otherwise would have, such as a closer, pricier seat at
a concert.9 Additionally, competitors who choose to display such
fees up front are at a competitive disadvantage as their prices ap-
pear to be more expensive at first glance. Legislation is needed to
ensure that all competitors are held to the same standard and con-
sumers are concretely protected from hidden fees.
In addition, S. 281 would include a prohibition on speculative
tickets and certain mandatory refunds for ticket purchasers that
reflect provisions of H.R. 3950 (118th Congress), which was passed
by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 15, 2024.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 281, as amended, would do the following:
• Require ticket issuers, secondary market ticket issuers, or sec-
ondary market ticket exchanges to disclose the all-in price,
which is the price inclusive of all ticket fees including service
fees, order processing fees, delivery fees, facility charge fees,
and taxes, among other charges.
• Require such disclosure for tickets for events, defined as any
live concert, theatrical performance, sporting event, show, or
similarly scheduled live activity, taking place in a venue with
a seating or attendance capacity exceeding 200 persons that is
open to the general public and is promoted, advertised, or mar-
keted in interstate commerce or for which event tickets are
generally sold or distributed in interstate commerce.
• Require such disclosure to occur (1) in any advertisement, mar-
keting, or price list where a price is displayed; and (2) at the
beginning of a transaction and throughout the ticket pur-
chasing process.

• Require ticket issuers, secondary market ticket issuers, or sec-
ondary market ticket exchanges to provide an itemized list of
the base ticket price and each ticket fee.
• Prohibit ticket issuers, secondary market ticket issuers, or sec-
ondary market ticket exchanges from selling or offering for sale

issuer, secondary market ticket issuer, or secondary market ex-
change is affiliated or endorsed by a venue, team, or artist un-
less an agreement has been executed or if the issuer or ex-
change has consent of the applicable venue, team, or artist.
• Prohibit a ticket issuer, secondary market ticket issuer, or sec-
ondary market ticket exchange from including the name of a
venue, including any misspellings of any such name, in a do-
main name, or any subdomain thereof, in the URL of the
issuer or exchange unless authorized by the owner of the
venue.
• Require ticket issuers, secondary market ticket issuers, or sec-
ondary market ticket exchanges to provide refunds or replace-
ment tickets for canceled or postponed events (except for post-
ponements for causes beyond the reasonable control of the
issuer) in certain circumstances.
• Require the Federal Trade Commission to submit to Congress
a report on enforcement of the Better Online Ticket Sales Act
of 201610 within 6 months of enactment.
• Authorize the Federal Trade Commission to enforce violations
of the Act.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 281, the TICKET Act, was introduced on January 28, 2025, by
Senator Schmitt (for himself and Senator Markey) and was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open
Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 281 reported favor-
ably with amendments.
118th Congress
S. 1303, the TICKET Act, was introduced on April 26, 2023, by
Senator Cruz (for himself and Senator Cantwell) and was referred
to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
Senate. On July 27, 2023, the Committee met in open Executive
Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 1303 reported favorably with
an amendment (in the nature of a substitute). On September 12,
2023, that bill was reported and placed on the Senate Calendar. On
April 11, 2024, Senator Rounds was added as a cosponsor.

H.R. 3950, a House companion bill to S. 1303, was introduced on
June 9, 2023, by Representative Bilirakis (for himself and Rep-
resentative Schakowsky) and was referred to the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce in the House of Representatives. Sixteen co-
sponsors were later added. H.R. 3950, as amended, passed its Com-
mittee with a recorded vote of 45–0 on December 6, 2023, and that
bill passed the House on May 15, 2024. However, H.R. 3950 had
significant differences from the Senate version of the TICKET Act.
During the Senate Committee’s markup, members decided to com-
bine S. 1303 with H.R. 6568, the Speculative Ticketing Oversight
and Prohibition Act, which adopted additional ticketing provisions,
including a ban on speculative ticketing and guaranteed refunds.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
Summary of legislation: On February 5, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
a total of 17 bills. This document provides estimates for 5 of those
bills.
S. 99, S. 195, and S. 245 would require the Department of Com-
merce to study supply chains, promote music tourism, and estab-
lish a working group on cyber insurance; S. 281 and S. 314 would
direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce new prohibi-
tions related to ticket prices for live events and hotel prices.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs do not include any
effects of interactions among the bills. If all five bills were com-
bined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the estimated
costs could be different from the sum of the separate estimates, al-
though CBO expects that any differences would be small. The costs

of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and
housing credit).
Basis of estimate: For these estimates, CBO assumes that the
bills will be enacted near the middle of fiscal year 2025 and that
the estimated amounts will be appropriated each year. CBO esti-
mates that all five bills would affect spending subject to appropria-
tion and that S. 281 and S. 314 would affect revenues.
S. 99, Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act,
would require the Department of Commerce to contract with the
National Academy of Public Administration to study programs op-
erated by the department that aim to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains and provide technical assistance to U.S. manu-
facturers. The report would identify interagency gaps and duplica-
tive responsibilities among offices and recommend improvements.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO esti-
mates that completing the study would cost $2 million over the
2025–2030 period, including employee and contracting costs. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 195, American Music Tourism Act of 2025, would require the
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to pro-
mote music tourism in the United States and periodically report to
the Congress. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary received $3.5 mil-
lion to carry out the requirements of the Visit America Act, a 2022
law to promote travel and tourism in the United States.
Using information about the Assistant Secretary’s responsibil-
ities under current law, CBO estimates that implementing the re-
quirements in the bill would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
S. 245, Insure Cybersecurity Act of 2025, would require the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration to es-
tablish an interagency working group on cyber insurance, composed
of members from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology, and the FTC. The
working group would be required to report to the Congress no later
than one year after it forms.
Using information about the cost of similar working groups, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than $500,000
over the 2025–2026 period. Any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 281, TICKET Act, would require companies that issue tickets
or that sell tickets on the secondary market to clearly display the
total price of any ticket, including itemizing any fees not included
in the base ticket price. The bill also would prohibit entities from
offering or advertising tickets that they do not possess, require en-
tities to clearly disclose if a ticket is for re-sale, and direct ticket
sellers to refund buyers if an event is cancelled. Those require-
ments would apply to live events at venues with an attendance ca-
pacity of 200 people or more. The FTC would enforce those require-
ments.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any

related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would require pro-
viders of short-term lodging and websites that advertise or offer
such lodging to display upfront the full lodging price and each
mandatory fee required to complete a booking. The FTC would en-
force those requirements.
Based on the cost of similar provisions, CBO estimates imple-
menting the bill would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue guidance and to monitor and enforce violations. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
could increase civil penalty collections, which are recorded in the
budget as revenues, by an insignificant amount.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: CBO estimates that enacting S.
281 and S. 314 would each increase revenues by less than $500,000
over the 2025–2035 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures
apply to those bills.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that none of the bills would increase net direct spending or
deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in
2036.
Mandates: Two of the bills ordered reported by the committee
contain mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act (UMRA).
S. 281, TICKET Act, would impose private-sector mandates as
defined in UMRA on ticket sellers and resellers by requiring cer-
tain changes, including new refund policies to the ticketing process.
CBO estimates the aggregate cost to comply with the mandates
would be above the threshold established in UMRA for private-sec-
tor mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for infla-
tion).
Under the bill, if an event is cancelled, ticket sellers and re-
sellers would be required to provide a refund of the full ticket price,
including taxes and fees, to ticket purchasers. If an event is post-
poned, sellers and resellers would be required to provide customers
either a full refund or a replacement ticket, if available, subject to
the customer’s preference. Sellers also would be required to disclose
this refund policy. The bill allows for exceptions to this policy in
cases where the cancellation or postponement is beyond the control
of the ticket issuer, such as natural disasters. Based on discussions
with industry sources, a substantial share of sellers and resellers
already provide full refunds for cancelled events but few offer re-
funds for postponed events. Considerable uncertainty surrounds
the ways that federal regulations might define what is within the
control of the issuer in the event of a cancellation or postponement
or what might constitute comparable replacement events. Given
the large size of the industry and the amount of revenue generated
by ticketed events, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate
would exceed the threshold for private-sector mandates.
S. 281 also would require ticket sellers and resellers to make cer-
tain up-front disclosures to consumers. They would need to disclose
the ticket prices, including taxes and fees. Those disclosures would

occur at the time a ticket is first displayed to a consumer and in
any advertisements or marketing. The bill also would require ticket
sellers and resellers to provide an itemized list of the base price
and all fees. Information from industry sources indicates that most
ticket sellers have already begun to provide the total cost to con-
sumers in advance; thus, CBO expects the additional requirements
in the bill to have small costs.
The bill also would require ticket resellers to disclose to con-
sumers that they are resellers before any purchase is complete.
Sellers and resellers would be prohibited from selling or adver-
tising any ticket that the seller does not have actually or construc-
tively possess. In certain instances, sellers also would be prohibited
from revealing to consumers and using the name of venues, teams,
artists, and events in their online domain names. CBO expects that
those disclosures and prohibitions would impose minimal costs on
the sellers.
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
S. 314, Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025, would impose inter-
governmental and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.
CBO estimates that the cost to comply with those mandates would
not exceed thresholds established in UMRA ($103 million and $206
million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would preempt state and local laws governing the dis-
play of prices for short-term lodging. Although the preemptions
would limit the application of state and local laws, it would impose
no duty on state or local governments that would result in signifi-
cant spending or loss of revenues.
The bill would require hotels, short-term rentals, online booking
websites, and any other third-party temporary accommodation sell-
ers to disclose upfront the total price of lodging, including any gov-
ernment-imposed fees. Information from industry sources and the
FTC indicates that several lodging providers already comply with
provisions in the bill. In addition, an FTC final rule, set to go into
effect in April, will require short-term lodging sellers to disclose all
associated fees to customers. CBO expects the cost for other enti-
ties to comply would be small because many providers already com-
ply and those who do not already possess the fee information re-
quired to be displayed.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs and revenues: David
Hughes; Mandates: Grace Watson and Rachel Austin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss,

Number of Persons Covered
S. 281 would cover the following entities and any employees re-
tained by them:
• Ticket issuers, as defined in the Better Online Ticket Sales Act
of 2016;11
• Any person for which it is in the regular course of the trade
or business of the person to resell or make a secondary sale of
a ticket to an event (as the term ‘‘event’’ is defined in the Act);
• Any person for which it is in the regular course of trade or
business of that person to operate a platform or exchange for
advertising, listing, or selling resale tickets, on behalf of itself,
vendors, or a secondary market ticket issuer; and
• The Federal Trade Commission.
Economic Impact
Based on industry sources, compliance costs associated with S.
281’s requirements are expected to be minimal and would be heav-
ily outweighed by the benefits to consumers. By increasing trans-
parency in the event ticketing market, S. 281 would allow con-
sumers to more effectively comparison shop and select the best-
priced tickets. Therefore, the bill is expected to save consumers
both time and money.
Privacy
S. 281 is not anticipated to impact the personal privacy of indi-
viduals.
Paperwork
S. 281 is not anticipated to generate any additional paperwork.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
