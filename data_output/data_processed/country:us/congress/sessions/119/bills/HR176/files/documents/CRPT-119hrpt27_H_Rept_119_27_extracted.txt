Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:

Section 3:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act
of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. ALIENS WHO CARRIED OUT, PARTICIPATED IN, PLANNED, FINANCED, SUPPORTED, OR
OTHERWISE FACILITATED ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL.
(a) PARTICIPANTS IN HAMAS TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL.—Section 212(a)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) is amended—
(1) in subparagraph (B)(i), in the matter following subclause (IX)—
(A) by inserting ‘‘Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or Hamas’’ after ‘‘Palestine
Liberation Organization’’; and
(B) by inserting ‘‘member,’’ after ‘‘representative,’’; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(H) PARTICIPANTS IN HAMAS TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL.—Any alien who
carried out, participated in, planned, financed, afforded material support to,
or otherwise facilitated any of the attacks against Israel initiated by Hamas
beginning on October 7, 2023, is inadmissible.’’.
(b) INELIGIBILITY FOR RELIEF.—Section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(D) INELIGIBILITY FOR RELIEF.—Any alien who carried out, participated
in, planned, financed, afforded material support to, or otherwise facilitated
any of the attacks against Israel initiated by Hamas beginning on October
7, 2023, shall be ineligible for any relief under the immigration laws, in-
cluding under this section, section 208, and section 2242 of the Omnibus
Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (and
any regulations issued pursuant to such section).’’.
(c) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(B)) is amended by striking ‘‘subparagraph (B) or
(F)’’ and inserting ‘‘subparagraph (B), (F), or (H)’’.
(d) REPORT REQUIRED ON PARTICIPANTS IN HAMAS TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL.—
Beginning not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and
each year thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to
Congress, including the number of aliens who were—
(1) found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(H) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(H)); and
(2) described in section 212(a)(3)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(H)) and found to be removable pursuant to section
237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(B)).
Purpose and Summary
H.R. 176, the No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act
of 2025, introduced by Rep. Tom McClintock (R–CA), would create
a ground of inadmissibility and a ground of removability for aliens
who participated in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel
and members and officials of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The bill would also make such aliens ineligible for immigration re-
lief.
Background and Need for the Legislation
Hamas terror attack and the threat of copycat attacks
Beginning in the early hours of October 7, 2023, Hamas initiated
a brutal terrorist attack against Israel.1 One thousand, two hun-
dred people, primarily innocent Israeli civilians—including small
children, women, and the elderly—were brutally assaulted, tor-

tured, and murdered at the hands of Hamas terrorists.2 According
to press reports, Hamas also kidnapped at least 240 hostages,3 in-
cluding 10 Americans.4
Following the attacks, Hamas leaders called for a Global Day of
Jihad, which led to pro-Hamas demonstrations across the globe.5
Then-Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Wray warned of in-
creasing threats to the nation in the aftermath: ‘‘Here in the U.S.,
we cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other
foreign terrorist organizations could exploit the conflict to call on
their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil.’’6 In its 2024
Homeland Threat Assessment, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity acknowledged that ‘‘[t]errorists and criminal actors may exploit
the elevated flow and increasingly complex security environment to
enter the United States.’’7 The report also highlighted that
‘‘[i]ndividuals with terrorism connections are interested in using es-
tablished travel routes and permissive environments to facilitate
access to the United States.’’8
In Europe, these threats quickly materialized. On October 16,
2023, the city of Brussels, Belgium, ‘‘raised its terror threat level
to 4, the maximum on the scale,’’ after a Tunisian national ‘‘staying
illegally’’ in Belgium shot three people, killing two, in an Islamic
extremist terrorist attack.9 According to authorities, the terrorist
previously applied for asylum, but was denied in 2019 and later or-
dered to be removed from Belgium.10 The perpetrator—who filmed
himself admitting to the killings saying he was a ‘‘fighter for
Allah’’—was reportedly motivated by a desire to ‘‘avenge the death’’
of a 6-year-old Palestinian boy shot in the United States.11 In Ber-
lin, Germany, a synagogue that houses a community center, kin-
dergarten, and a school was firebombed with ‘‘two Molotov cock-
tails’’ in October 2023.12 At least one suspect was arrested: a man

who, according to police, ‘‘resisted and shouted anti-Israeli slo-
gans,’’ when police apprehended him.13
On December 3, 2023, a 26-year-old French national born to Ira-
nian parents stabbed three people at the base of the Eiffel Tower,
killing one and critically injuring two others.14 Prior to the attack,
the assailant posted a video on social media in which he ‘‘swore al-
legiance to [the] Islamic State and supported its jihadists in dif-
ferent areas from Africa to Iraq, Syria and Pakistan.’’15 In 2016,
he was ‘‘sentenced to four years in prison for planning another at-
tack.’’16 According to the French Interior Minister, there were more
than 800 antisemitic attacks in France within one month of
Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel.17 More recently, in Mu-
nich, Germany, on February 13, 2025, an Afghan national pre-
viously denied asylum in the country rammed his car into a crowd
of people, killing a two-year-old and her mother and injuring doz-
ens.18 Upon his arrest, the suspect said to police, ‘‘Allahu Akbar.’’19
These attacks led some European leaders to call for stronger bor-
ders and increased immigration enforcement. The Prime Minister
of Sweden, for example, called on Sweden and the European Union
to ‘‘better protect their borders and ensure that dangerous individ-
uals could not stay illegally,’’ stating, ‘‘This is a time for more secu-
rity, we can’t be na¨ıve.’’20 France announced it would ‘‘double the
number of security agents at the [French-Belgian] border’’ following
an attack in Brussels,21 while Denmark confirmed it would
‘‘extend[] border controls’’ on the Danish-German border for six ad-
ditional months citing, in part, ‘‘Islamist terrorist threat[s].’’22
The terrorist threats have spread to the United States. In No-
vember 2023, a threat assessment by the New York State Intel-
ligence Center warned of ‘‘an increasing terror threat to [New York
State].’’23 The assessment outlined how ‘‘[t]he expansion of Israeli
operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and increase in civil-
ian casualties raises the likelihood that violent extremist threat ac-
tors will seek to conduct attacks against targets in the West, with

New York State being a focus.’’24 In addition, in early December
2023, authorities arrested a 16-year-old in Las Vegas for threat-
ening a ‘‘lone wolf’’ terrorist attack and proclaiming his support for
the Islamic State.25 In a subsequent search of his home, police
found ‘‘components to build an explosive device,’’ ‘‘bomb-making
recipes and instructions,’’ and ‘‘terrorist propaganda.’’26 In Hous-
ton, a Jordanian man was arrested for plotting a terrorist attack
on the local Jewish community.27 According to reports, the man
had been radicalized, ‘‘stud[ied] how to build bombs,’’ and ‘‘posted
about his support for killing Jews.’’28 Although his non-immigrant
visa expired in 2019, he had ‘‘applied for asylum and obtained work
authorization in the United States until 2025.’’29
The Biden-Harris Administration’s open southwest border only
fueled the terror threat to the homeland. During four years of the
Biden-Harris Administration, Border Patrol agents encountered
along the southwest and northern borders at least 392 illegal aliens
on the terrorist watchlist.30 Many of those potential terrorists were
released into the United States. The Committee reported in August
2024 that, ‘‘of the more than 250 illegal aliens on the terrorist
watchlist who were encountered by Border Patrol at the southwest
border between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, DHS [] released into
American communities at least 99.’’31 Even aliens initially not
found on the terrorist watchlist can pose significant national secu-
rity threats. In March 2023, for instance, an illegal alien from
Mauritania entered the United States and ‘‘was screened by border
agents before he was released into the country.’’32 Although ‘‘au-
thorities didn’t find any criminal or terrorist histories linked to
him’’ at the time of his encounter at the border, just 19 months
later, in October 2024, the illegal alien ‘‘shot and wounded a 39-
year-old Jewish man’’ in Chicago in an antisemitic terrorist at-
tack.33 The illegal alien, who shouted ‘‘Allahu Akbar’’ before shoot-
ing at police responding to the attack, had ‘‘planned to target Jew-
ish community members leading up to the shooting.’’34
Seventeen months after the Hamas attack on Israel, the risk of
terrorism around the world remains high. On January 1, 2025, an
ISIS-inspired terrorist drove his truck into crowds on Bourbon
Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people and injuring dozens.35

Inadmissibility grounds in the Immigration and Nationality Act
Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act provides inad-
missibility grounds relating to security concerns, including partici-
pation in terrorist activities.37 While being an officer, official, rep-
resentative, or spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion currently constitutes being engaged in terrorist activity for the
purpose of inadmissibility, U.S. immigration law does not similarly
classify participation in an official capacity in Hamas or Pales-
tinian Islamic Jihad as engaging terrorist activity.38 H.R. 176
changes that by ensuring that aliens who are officers, officials, rep-
resentatives, spokesmen, or members of Hamas or Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad are considered to have engaged in terrorist activity.
In addition, H.R. 176 creates a new ground of removability and
a new ground of inadmissibility for aliens who carried out, partici-
pated in, planned, financed, afforded material support to, or other-
wise facilitated any of the attacks against Israel beginning on Octo-
ber 7, 2023. In doing so, the bill treats the atrocities of October 7
on par with the immigration laws’ treatment of Nazi persecution,
genocide, torture, and extrajudicial killings.39 Finally, the bill en-
sures that no Hamas terrorist can receive any immigration relief,
including asylum, under U.S. immigration law.
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 176: ‘‘Restoring Immi-
gration Enforcement in America,’’ a hearing held on January 22,
2025, before the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security,
and Enforcement of the Committee on the Judiciary. The Sub-
committee heard testimony from the following witnesses:
• John Fabbricatore, Former Field Office Director, U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Re-
moval Operations; Visiting Fellow, The Heritage Foundation;
• Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies, Center for Im-
migration Studies (CIS);
• Grant Newman, Director of Government Relations, Immi-
gration Accountability Project; and
• David Bier, Director of Immigration Studies, CATO Insti-
tute.
The hearing addressed how the Trump Administration can restore
immigration enforcement in the United States and reverse the
Biden-Harris Administration’s open-borders, no-consequences im-
migration policies.

Duplication of Federal Programs
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House rule XIII, no provision of H.R.
176 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another federal program.
Performance Goals and Objectives
The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House
rule XIII, H.R. 176 would create a ground of inadmissibility and a
ground of removability for aliens who participated in the October
7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel and members and officials of
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The bill would also make
such aliens ineligible for immigration relief.
Advisory on Earmarks
In accordance with clause 9 of House rule XXI, H.R. 176 does not
contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited
tariff benefits as defined in clauses 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of House rule
XXI.

after approval by the Attorney General of a recommendation by the
Secretary of State or by the consular officer that the alien be ad-
mitted temporarily despite his inadmissibility, be granted such a
visa and may be admitted into the United States temporarily as a
nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney General, or (ii) who
is inadmissible under subsection (a) (other than paragraphs
(3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and clauses (i) and (ii) of
paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), but who is in possession of
appropriate documents or is granted a waiver thereof and is seek-
ing admission, may be admitted into the United States temporarily
as a nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney General. The
Attorney General shall prescribe conditions, including exaction of
such bonds as may be necessary, to control and regulate the admis-
sion and return of inadmissible aliens applying for temporary ad-
mission under this paragraph.
(B)(i) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Attorney
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary
of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
State and the Attorney General, may determine in such Secretary’s
sole unreviewable discretion that subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not
apply with respect to an alien within the scope of that subsection
or that subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) shall not apply to a group within
the scope of that subsection, except that no such waiver may be ex-
tended to an alien who is within the scope of subsection
(a)(3)(B)(i)(II), no such waiver may be extended to an alien who is
a member or representative of, has voluntarily and knowingly en-
gaged in or endorsed or espoused or persuaded others to endorse

tarily and knowingly received military-type training from a ter-
rorist organization that is described in subclause (I) or (II) of sub-

Section 13:
section (a)(3)(B)(vi), and no such waiver may be extended to a
group that has engaged terrorist activity against the United States
or another democratic country or that has purposefully engaged in
a pattern or practice of terrorist activity that is directed at civil-
ians. Such a determination shall neither prejudice the ability of the
United States Government to commence criminal or civil pro-
ceedings involving a beneficiary of such a determination or any
other person, nor create any substantive or procedural right or ben-
efit for a beneficiary of such a determination or any other person.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatu-
tory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus
provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall

role into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he
may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian
reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admis-
sion to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not
be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes
of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland
Security, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be
returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter
his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that
of any other applicant for admission to the United States.
(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security may not parole into the
United States an alien who is a refugee unless the Secretary of
Homeland Security determines that compelling reasons in the pub-
lic interest with respect to that particular alien require that the
alien be paroled into the United States rather than be admitted as
a refugee under section 207.
(C) The attorney general of a State, or other authorized State of-
ficer, alleging a violation of the limitation under subparagraph (A)
that parole solely be granted on a case-by-case basis and solely for
urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, that
harms such State or its residents shall have standing to bring an
action against the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of
such State or the residents of such State in an appropriate district
court of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.
The court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition
of a civil action filed under this subparagraph to the greatest ex-
tent practicable. For purposes of this subparagraph, a State or its
residents shall be considered to have been harmed if the State or
its residents experience harm, including financial harm in excess of
$100.
(7) The provisions of subsection (a) (other than paragraph (7))
shall be applicable to any alien who shall leave Guam, the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the
Virgin Islands of the United States, and who seeks to enter the
continental United States or any other place under the jurisdiction
of the United States. Any alien described in this paragraph, who
is denied admission to the United States, shall be immediately re-
moved in the manner provided by section 241(c) of this Act.

subsection (a) of this section.
(11) The Attorney General may, in his discretion for humani-
tarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in
the public interest, waive application of clause (i) of subsection
(a)(6)(E) in the case of any alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not

United States as a returning resident under section 211(b) and in
the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment of status as
an immediate relative or immigrant under section 203(a) (other
than paragraph (4) thereof), if the alien has encouraged, induced,
assisted, abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of
such action was the alien’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and
no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.
(12) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
General for humanitarian purposes or to assure family unity, waive

wise admissible to the United States as a returning resident
under section 211(b), and

of status under section 201(b)(2)(A) or under section 203(a),
if no previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien

aid, or support the alien’s spouse or child (and not another indi-
vidual). No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the
Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver under this paragraph.
(13)(A) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine
whether a ground for inadmissibility exists with respect to a non-
immigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(T), except that the
ground for inadmissibility described in subsection (a)(4) shall not
apply with respect to such a nonimmigrant.
(B) In addition to any other waiver that may be available under
this section, in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(T), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, in the Attorney General’s discretion, may waive the applica-
tion of—
(i) subsection (a)(1); and
(ii) any other provision of subsection (a) (excluding para-
graphs (3), (4), (10)(C), and (10(E)) if the activities rendering
the alien inadmissible under the provision were caused by, or
were incident to, the victimization described in section
101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I).

be in the public or national interest to do so.
(e) No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J) or acquiring
such status after admission (i) whose participation in the program
for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or
in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of
the United States or by the government of the country of his na-
tionality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or
acquisition of status under section 101(a)(15)(J) was a national or
resident of a country which the Director of the United States Infor-
mation Agency pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, had des-
ignated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the
field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was en-
gaged, or (iii) who came to the United States or acquired such sta-
tus in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall
be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent resi-
dence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or

section 101(a)(15)(L) until it is established that such person has re-
sided and been physically present in the country of his nationality
or his last residence for an aggregate of a least two years following
departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favor-
able recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an
interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an
alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the request of a State
Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Commis-
sioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined
that departure from the United States would impose exceptional
hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse or child
is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully resident alien), or
that the alien cannot return to the country of his nationality or last
residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of
race, religion, or political opinion, the Attorney General may waive
the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the
case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by
the Attorney General to be in the public interest except that in the
case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public Health,
or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an inter-
ested United States Government agency on behalf of an alien de-
scribed in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the require-
ments of section 214(l): And provided further, That, except in the
case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may,
upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such
two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the
foreign country of the alien’s nationality or last residence has fur-
nished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection
to such waiver in the case of such alien.

of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental
to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and
for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of
all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants,
or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to
be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a com-

title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations) certifies, ac-
cording to such regulations as the Secretary of Health and
Human Services may prescribe, that such vaccination
would not be medically appropriate, or
(C) under such circumstances as the Attorney General
provides by regulation, with respect to whom the require-
ment of such a vaccination would be contrary to the alien’s
religious beliefs or moral convictions; or

No waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of
an alien who has been convicted of (or who has admitted commit-
ting acts that constitute) murder or criminal acts involving torture,

such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the cit-
izen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such an alien or, in
the case of a VAWA self-petitioner, the alien demonstrates extreme
hardship to the alien or the alien’s United States citizen, lawful
permanent resident, or qualified alien parent or child.
(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision or action
of the Attorney General regarding a waiver under paragraph (1).

tion or agency, except that, in the case of such an agreement
by a school of medicine, any one or more of its affiliated hos-
pitals which are to participate in the provision of the graduate
medical education or training must join in the agreement.
(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has
been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of
medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for
the purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of
whether such school of medicine is in the United States); or
(ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Med-
ical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as
determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services),
(II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be
able to adapt to the educational and cultural environment in
which he will be receiving his education or training, and (IV)
has adequate prior education and training to participate satis-
factorily in the program for which he is coming to the United
States. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an alien who is
a graduate of a medical school shall be considered to have
passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Exam-
iners examination if the alien was fully and permanently li-
censed to practice medicine in a State on January 9, 1978, and
was practicing medicine in a State on that date.
(C) The alien has made a commitment to return to the coun-
try of his nationality or last residence upon completion of the

need in that country for persons with the skills the alien will
acquire in such education or training.
(D) The duration of the alien’s participation in the program
of graduate medical education or training for which the alien
is coming to the United States is limited to the time typically
required to complete such program, as determined by the Di-
rector of the United States Information Agency at the time of
the alien’s admission into the United States, based on criteria
which are established in coordination with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services and which take into consideration
the published requirements of the medical specialty board
which administers such education or training program; except
that—
(i) such duration is further limited to seven years unless
the alien has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Direc-
tor that the country to which the alien will return at the
end of such specialty education or training has an excep-
tional need for an individual trained in such specialty, and
(ii) the alien may, once and not later than two years
after the date the alien is admitted to the United States
as an exchange visitor or acquires exchange visitor status,
change the alien’s designated program of graduate medical
education or training if the Director approves the change
and if a commitment and written assurance with respect
to the alien’s new program have been provided in accord-
ance with subparagraph (C).

(A) the alien is coming pursuant to an invitation from a pub-
lic or nonprofit private educational or research institution or
agency in the United States to teach or conduct research, or
both, at or for such institution or agency, or
(B)(i) the alien has passed the Federation licensing examina-
tion (administered by the Federation of State Medical Boards
of the United States) or an equivalent examination as deter-
mined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
(ii)(I) has competency in oral and written English or (II) is
a graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a
body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of
Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in
the United States).
(3) The Director of the United States Information Agency annu-
ally shall transmit to the Congress a report on aliens who have
submitted affidavits described in paragraph (1)(E), and shall in-
clude in such report the name and address of each such alien, the
medical education or training program in which such alien is par-
ticipating, and the status of such alien in that program.
(k) Any alien, inadmissible from the United States under para-
graph (5)(A) or (7)(A)(i) of subsection (a), who is in possession of an
immigrant visa may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in the
discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General is satis-
fied that inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have
been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the im-
migrant before the time of departure of the vessel or aircraft from
the last port outside the United States and outside foreign contig-
uous territory or, in the case of an immigrant coming from foreign
contiguous territory, before the time of the immigrant’s application

should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
(A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may obtain
the waiver also provided by this subsection, except that
such regulations shall provide for a listing of any country
from which the Commonwealth has received a significant
economic benefit from the number of visitors for pleasure
within the one-year period preceding the date of enactment
of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, unless
the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such
country’s inclusion on such list would represent a threat to
the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its
territories; and
(B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or
all of those countries who may present an increased risk
of overstays or other potential problems, if different from
such requirements otherwise provided by law for non-
immigrant visitors.
(4) FACTORS.—In determining whether to grant or continue
providing the waiver under this subsection to nationals of any
country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State,
shall consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant, in-
cluding electronic travel authorizations, procedures for report-
ing lost and stolen passports, repatriation of aliens, rates of re-
fusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems,
and information exchange.
(5) SUSPENSION.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to Guam and
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under

this subsection. If the Secretary determines that such admis-
sions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors from
a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unlawfully obtaining
entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking with-
holding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country
pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of Guam
or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or of
the United States (including the interest in the enforcement of
the immigration laws of the United States), the Secretary shall
suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this
subsection. The Secretary of Homeland Security may in the
Secretary’s discretion suspend the Guam and Northern Mar-
iana Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-
by-country basis, for other good cause.
(6) ADDITION OF COUNTRIES.—The Governor of Guam and the
Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to add a particular country to the
list of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity may grant such request after consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may pro-
mulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of that coun-
try and any special requirements the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the Secretary’s sole discretion, may impose prior to
allowing nationals of that country to obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection.
(m)(1) The qualifications referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
with respect to an alien who is coming to the United States to per-
form nursing services for a facility, are that the alien—

professional nursing in the country where the alien obtained
nursing education or has received nursing education in the
United States;

regulations promulgated in consultation with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services) or has a full and unrestricted li-
cense under State law to practice professional nursing in the
State of intended employment; and
(C) is fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including
such temporary or interim licensing requirements which au-
thorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of in-
tended employment to engage in the practice of professional
nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to
the United States and is authorized under such laws to be em-
ployed by the facility.
(2)(A) The attestation referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
with respect to a facility for which an alien will perform services,
is an attestation as to the following:
(i) The facility meets all the requirements of paragraph (6).
(ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the
wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly
employed.

(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage
rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.
(iv) The facility has taken and is taking timely and signifi-
cant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered
nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are
authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as
quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on
nonimmigrant registered nurses.
(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a reg-
istered nurse employed by the facility within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing
of any visa petition, and the employment of such an alien is
not intended or designed to influence an election for a bar-
gaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.
(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered
nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), notice of the filing has
been provided by the facility to the bargaining representative
of the registered nurses at the facility or, where there is no
such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been
provided to the registered nurses employed at the facility
through posting in conspicuous locations.
(vii) The facility will not, at any time, employ a number of
aliens issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) that exceeds 33 percent of the
total number of registered nurses employed by the facility.
(viii) The facility will not, with respect to any alien issued a
visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c)—
(I) authorize the alien to perform nursing services at any
worksite other than a worksite controlled by the facility; or
(II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from
one worksite to another.
Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility
to have taken significant steps described in such clause before
the date of the enactment of the Nursing Relief for Disadvan-
taged Areas Act of 1999. A copy of the attestation shall be pro-
vided, within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered nurses
employed at the facility on the date of filing.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the following
shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit
and retain registered nurses:
(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the
facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
program for registered nurses elsewhere.
(ii) Providing career development programs and other meth-
ods of facilitating health care workers to become registered
nurses.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than
currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in
the geographic area.
(iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary
advancement by registered nurses.
The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered
to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken

to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv). Nothing in this sub-
paragraph shall require a facility to take more than one step if the
facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reason-
able.
(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subpara-
graph (A)—
(i) shall expire on the date that is the later of—
(I) the end of the one-year period beginning on the date
of its filing with the Secretary of Labor; or
(II) the end of the period of admission under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the last alien with respect to whose
admission it was applied (in accordance with clause (ii));
and
(ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year period
beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor
if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to
comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph
with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.
(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a
list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for non-
immigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) and, for each such fa-
cility, a copy of the facility’s attestation under subparagraph (A)
(and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by
the facility.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including
reasonable time limits, for the receipt, investigation, and disposi-
tion of complaints respecting a facility’s failure to meet conditions
attested to or a facility’s misrepresentation of a material fact in an
attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or or-
ganization (including bargaining representatives, associations
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties
as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary
shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reason-
able cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested
to. Subject to the time limits established under this clause, this
subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation is
expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in
clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the
Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the in-
terested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint
within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has
failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepre-
sentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall no-
tify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, im-
pose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary
penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per viola-
tion, with the total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation) as
the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such

notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with
respect to a facility during a period of at least one year for nurses
to be employed by the facility.
(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv), if
the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under
subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at
the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to
provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be re-
quired to comply with such condition.
(F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing an
attestation under subparagraph (A) a filing fee, in an amount pre-
scribed by the Secretary based on the costs of carrying out the Sec-
retary’s duties under this subsection, but not exceeding $250.
(ii) Fees collected under this subparagraph shall be deposited in
a fund established for this purpose in the Treasury of the United
States.
(iii) The collected fees in the fund shall be available to the Sec-
retary of Labor, to the extent and in such amounts as may be pro-
vided in appropriations Acts, to cover the costs described in clause
(i), in addition to any other funds that are available to the Sec-
retary to cover such costs.
(3) The period of admission of an alien under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) shall be 3 years.
(4) The total number of nonimmigrant visas issued pursuant to
petitions granted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) in each fiscal
year shall not exceed 500. The number of such visas issued for em-
ployment in each State in each fiscal year shall not exceed the fol-
lowing:
(A) For States with populations of less than 9,000,000, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 25 visas.
(B) For States with populations of 9,000,000 or more, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 50 visas.
(C) If the total number of visas available under this para-
graph for a fiscal year quarter exceeds the number of qualified
nonimmigrants who may be issued such visas during those
quarters, the visas made available under this paragraph shall
be issued without regard to the numerical limitation under
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph during the last fiscal
year quarter.
(5) A facility that has filed a petition under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) to employ a nonimmigrant to perform nursing
services for the facility—
(A) shall provide the nonimmigrant a wage rate and working
conditions commensurate with those of nurses similarly em-
ployed by the facility;
(B) shall require the nonimmigrant to work hours commen-
surate with those of nurses similarly employed by the facility;
and
(C) shall not interfere with the right of the nonimmigrant to
join or organize a union.
(6) For purposes of this subsection and section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
the term ‘‘facility’’ means a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in

Section 16:
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
1395ww(d)(1)(B))) that meets the following requirements:

(A) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a
health professional shortage area (as defined in section 332 of
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).
(B) Based on its settled cost report filed under title XVIII of
the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period beginning
during fiscal year 1994—
(i) the hospital has not less than 190 licensed acute care
beds;
(ii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were entitled to benefits under part A of such title is not

acute care inpatient days for such period; and
(iii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan ap-
proved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, is not
less than 28 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period.
(7) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(v), the term ‘‘lay off’’,
with respect to a worker—
(A) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(B) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit an employee’s
or an employer’s rights under a collective bargaining agree-
ment or other employment contract.
(n)(1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as an H–1B
nonimmigrant in an occupational classification unless the employer
has filed with the Secretary of Labor an application stating the fol-
lowing:
(A) The employer—
(i) is offering and will offer during the period of author-
ized employment to aliens admitted or provided status as
an H–1B nonimmigrant wages that are at least—
(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all
other individuals with similar experience and quali-
fications for the specific employment in question, or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the application, and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-
immigrant that will not adversely affect the working condi-
tions of workers similarly employed.

(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute in the occupational classification at the place of em-
ployment.
(C) The employer, at the time of filing the application—
(i) has provided notice of the filing under this paragraph
to the bargaining representative (if any) of the employer’s
employees in the occupational classification and area for
which aliens are sought, or
(ii) if there is no such bargaining representative, has

through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
locations at the place of employment or electronic notifica-
tion to employees in the occupational classification for
which H–1B nonimmigrants are sought.
(D) The application shall contain a specification of the num-
ber of workers sought, the occupational classification in which

ing 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition sup-
ported by the application.
(ii) An application described in this clause is an application
filed on or after the date final regulations are first promul-
gated to carry out this subparagraph, and before by an H–1B-
dependent employer (as defined in paragraph (3)) or by an em-
ployer that has been found, on or after the date of the enact-
ment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Im-
provement Act of 1998, under paragraph (2)(C) or (5) to have
committed a willful failure or misrepresentation during the 5-
year period preceding the filing of the application. An applica-
tion is not described in this clause if the only H–1B non-
immigrants sought in the application are exempt H–1B non-
immigrants.
(F) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
(E)(ii), the employer will not place the nonimmigrant with an-
other employer (regardless of whether or not such other em-
ployer is an H–1B-dependent employer) where—
(i) the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part
at one or more worksites owned, operated, or controlled by
such other employer; and
(ii) there are indicia of an employment relationship be-
tween the nonimmigrant and such other employer;
unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to
whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of the

States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards
and offering compensation that is at least as great as that
required to be offered to H–1B nonimmigrants under sub-
paragraph (A), United States workers for the job for which
the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
(II) has offered the job to any United States worker who
applies and is equally or better qualified for the job for
which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are
sought.
(ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to
an application filed with respect to the employment of an H–
1B nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or
(C) of section 203(b)(1).
The employer shall make available for public examination, within
one working day after the date on which an application under this
paragraph is filed, at the employer’s principal place of business or
worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying
documents as are necessary). The Secretary shall compile, on a cur-
rent basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of
the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include
the wage rate, number of aliens sought, period of intended employ-
ment, and date of need. The Secretary shall make such list avail-
able for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of
Labor shall review such an application only for completeness and
obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the applica-
tion is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall pro-
vide the certification described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) within
7 days of the date of the filing of the application. The application
form shall include a clear statement explaining the liability under
subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer de-
scribed in such subparagraph displaces a United States worker as
described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G) shall
be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate selec-
tion criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the
type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a
discriminatory manner.
(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall establish
a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of com-
plaints respecting a petitioner’s failure to meet a condition specified
in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner’s
misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Com-
plaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (in-
cluding bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing
shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or mis-
representation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respec-
tively. The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this
paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure
or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding
described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that

556 of title 5, United States Code, within 60 days after the date
of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary
shall make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60
days after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the
hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E),
or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
(1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material fact
in an application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be employed by the
employer.
(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a willful
misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a violation
of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or a
willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in the
course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced
a United States worker employed by the employer within the pe-
riod beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date
of filing of any visa petition supported by the application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.

strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,

cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise
a process under which an H–1B nonimmigrant who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an H–1B non-
immigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the em-
ployer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the em-
ployer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment
is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
State law.
(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an alien who is the
subject of a petition filed under section 214(c)(1), for which a fee
is imposed under section 214(c)(9), to reimburse, or otherwise com-
pensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is
a violation of this clause for such an employer otherwise to accept
such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.
(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause,
the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for
each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the
return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this
clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring pay-
ment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection
and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
employee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the em-
ployer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as
lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant’s lack of a permit or li-
cense, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accord-
ance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and
who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time em-
ployee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the employer
with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has en-
tered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status
under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such
a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such petition
consistent with the rate of pay identified on such petition.

(III) In the case of an H–1B nonimmigrant who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
application under this subsection, and a petition under section
214(c)(1), with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of sub-
clauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days
after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United
States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the non-
immigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer (in the case
of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date
of the approval of the petition).
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an
H–1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-re-
lated factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant
for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant un-
able to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to an
H–1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to H–1B nonimmigrants and
United States workers in the same occupational classification an
annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to
fail to offer to an H–1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant’s
period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for bene-
fits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life, dis-
ability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in
retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and noncash com-
pensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on perform-
ance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria,
as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level speci-
fied under the application and required under paragraph (1), the
Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of such
amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the re-
quirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under sub-
paragraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) If an H–1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H–1B
nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph
(1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United
States worker employed by such other employer during the period
described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered
for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer,
to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under
paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a

sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i), (C)(ii),
or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing em-
ployer—
(i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the
time of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other em-
ployer; or
(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph
based upon a previous placement of an H–1B nonimmigrant
with the same other employer.
(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an em-
ployer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, begin-
ning on the date (on or after the date of the enactment of the
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of
1998) on which the employer is found by the Secretary to have
committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or
has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful
failure to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have
made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application.
The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of
whether or not the employer is an H–1B-dependent employer. The
authority of the Secretary under this subparagraph shall not be
construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of sub-
paragraph (A).
(G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of any
employer that employs nonimmigrants described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) if the Secretary of Labor has reasonable cause to
believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection.
In the case of an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of
Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case of the absence of dis-
ability of the Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that rea-
sonable cause exists and shall approve commencement of the inves-
tigation. The investigation may be initiated for reasons other than
completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in com-
plying with this subsection.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible information
from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer’s
practices or employment conditions, or an employer’s compliance
with the employer’s labor condition application under paragraph
(1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, and
such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the em-
ployer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of para-
graph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged
in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has
committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that af-
fects multiple employees, the Secretary of Labor may conduct an
investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of
Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer,
and the source’s identity shall not be subject to disclosure under

Section 17:
section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any
person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information de-
scribed in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the
basis for the commencement of an investigation described in such
clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed
and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on be-

of the Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the re-
quirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the
Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the per-
son).
(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of
Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies
the requirements of such clause and that—
(I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor; or
(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the
course of lawfully conducting another Department of Labor in-
vestigation under this Act of any other Act.
(v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information sub-
mitted by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary of
Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) shall not be considered a re-
ceipt of information for purposes of clause (ii).
(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing described
in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be conducted with
respect to information about a failure to meet a condition described
in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the informa-
tion not later than 12 months after the date of the alleged failure.
(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer
with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an inves-
tigation described in clauses (i) or (ii), prior to the commencement
of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an
investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and
shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond to
the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Sec-
retary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the
Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere with
an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the em-
ployer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall be no
judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor under
this clause.
(viii) An investigation under clauses (i) or (ii) may be conducted
for a period of up to 60 days. If the Secretary of Labor determines
after such an investigation that a reasonable basis exists to make
a finding that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet
a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or
(1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet
such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to meet
such a condition that affects multiple employees, the Secretary of
Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the inter-
ested parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with

Section 18:
section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 120 days after the
date of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Sec-
retary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the matter by not
later than 120 days after the date of the hearing.
(H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or enti-
ty is considered to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to
meet such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to com-
ply with the requirements.

(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if—
(I) the Department of Labor (or another enforcement agency)
has explained to the person or entity the basis for the failure;
(II) the person or entity has been provided a period of not
less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the ex-
planation) within which to correct the failure; and
(III) the person or entity has not corrected the failure volun-
tarily within such period.
(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation,
is found to have violated the prevailing wage requirements set
forth in paragraph (1)(A), shall not be assessed fines or other
penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish
that the manner in which the prevailing wage was calculated
was consistent with recognized industry standards and prac-
tices.
(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity
that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
willful violations of this subsection.
(I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.
(3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘H–1B-dependent
employer’’ means an employer that—
(i)(I) has 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees who are
employed in the United States; and (II) employs more than 7
H–1B nonimmigrants;
(ii)(I) has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time equiva-
lent employees who are employed in the United States; and (II)
employs more than 12 H–1B nonimmigrants; or
(iii)(I) has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are
employed in the United States; and (II) employs H–1B non-
immigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent
of the number of such full-time equivalent employees.
(B) For purposes of this subsection—
(i) the term ‘‘exempt H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an H–1B
nonimmigrant who—
(I) receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar
compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000;
or
(II) has attained a master’s or higher degree (or its
equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employ-
ment; and
(ii) the term nonexempt H–1B nonimmigrant means an H–
1B nonimmigrant who is not an exempt H–1B nonimmigrant.
(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
(i) in computing the number of full-time equivalent employ-
ees and the number of H–1B nonimmigrants, exempt H–1B
nonimmigrants shall not be taken into account during the
longer of—
(I) the 6-month period beginning on the date of the en-
actment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce
Improvement Act of 1998; or

ment Act of 1998 and ending on the date final regulations
are issued to carry out this paragraph; and
(ii) any group treated as a single employer under subsection
(b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 shall be treated as a single employer.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the H–1B nonimmigrant is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more
H–1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is consid-
ered to ‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the em-
ployer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the
equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or non-
immigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to
be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves es-
sentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States
worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experi-
ence, and is located in the same area of employment as the
other job.
(C) The term ‘‘H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an alien admit-
ted or provided status as a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).
(D)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract (other than a temporary employment contract en-
tered into in order to evade a condition described in sub-
paragraph (E) or (F) of paragraph (1)); but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
(or, in the case of a placement of a worker with another
employer under paragraph (1)(F), with either employer de-
scribed in such paragraph) at equivalent or higher com-
pensation and benefits than the position from which the
employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the
employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an em-
ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(E) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee
who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 207, is
granted asylum under section 208, or is an immigrant oth-
erwise authorized, by this Act or by the Attorney General,
to be employed.

(5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A)
through (E) of paragraph (2) in the case of a violation described in
subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect the
authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect to
any other violation.
(B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the re-
ceipt, initial review, and disposition in accordance with this para-
graph of complaints respecting an employer’s failure to meet the
condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner’s misrepresenta-
tion of material facts with respect to such condition. Complaints
may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has submitted a
re´sume´ or otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for the job
that is the subject of the condition. No proceeding shall be con-
ducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a fail-
ure or misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines
that the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the
date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
(C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been filed
in accordance with subparagraph (B) and there is reasonable cause
to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described in
such complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate
binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Medi-
ation and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the
roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure
and rules of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such
arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney Gen-
eral shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a
failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B) oc-
curred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or misrepresentation
was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding to that effect. The
arbitrator may not find such a failure or misrepresentation (or that
such a failure or misrepresentation was willful) unless the com-
plainant demonstrates such a failure or misrepresentation (or its
willful character) by clear and convincing evidence. The arbitrator
shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion to the
parties to the arbitration and the Attorney General. Such findings
shall be final and conclusive, and, except as provided in this sub-
paragraph, no official or court of the United States shall have
power or jurisdiction to review any such findings.
(ii) The Attorney General may review and reverse or modify the
findings of an arbitrator only on the same bases as an award of an
arbitrator may be vacated or modified under section 10 or 11 of
title 9, United States Code.
(iii) With respect to the findings of an arbitrator, a court may re-
view only the actions of the Attorney General under clause (ii) and
may set aside such actions only on the grounds described in sub-
paragraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 706(a)(2) of title 5, United
States Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such judi-
cial review may only be brought in an appropriate United States
court of appeals.

under this paragraph that an employer has failed to meet the con-
dition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or has misrepresented a material

edies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
exceed $1,000 per violation or $5,000 per violation in the case
of a willful failure or misrepresentation) as the Attorney Gen-
eral determines to be appropriate; and
(ii) the Attorney General is authorized to not approve peti-
tions filed, with respect to that employer and for aliens to be
employed by the employer, under section 204 or 214(c)—
(I) during a period of not more than 1 year; or
(II) in the case of a willful failure or willful misrepresen-
tation, during a period of not more than 2 years.
(F) The Attorney General shall not delegate, to any other em-
ployee or official of the Department of Justice, any function of the
Attorney General under this paragraph, until 60 days after the At-
torney General has submitted a plan for such delegation to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.
(o) An alien who has been physically present in the United
States shall not be eligible to receive an immigrant visa within
ninety days following departure therefrom unless—
(1) the alien was maintaining a lawful nonimmigrant status
at the time of such departure, or
(2) the alien is the spouse or unmarried child of an indi-
vidual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status
under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality
Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986 at any date, who—
(A) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse
of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent
resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986;
(B) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, re-
sided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a
lawful permanent resident; and

gration Act of 1990.

Section 20:
sections (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) shall be 100 per-
cent of the wage determined pursuant to those sections.
(4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to em-
ployers, a governmental survey to determine the prevailing wage,
such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commensurate
with experience, education, and the level of supervision. Where an
existing government survey has only 2 levels, 2 intermediate levels
may be created by dividing by 3, the difference between the 2 levels
offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the first level and
subtracting that quotient from the second level.
(q) Any alien admitted under section 101(a)(15)(B) may accept an
honorarium payment and associated incidental expenses for a
usual academic activity or activities (lasting not longer than 9 days
at any single institution), as defined by the Attorney General in
consultation with the Secretary of Education, if such payment is of-
fered by an institution or organization described in subsection
(p)(1) and is made for services conducted for the benefit of that in-
stitution or entity and if the alien has not accepted such payment
or expenses from more than 5 institutions or organizations in the
previous 6-month period.

enter the United States for the purpose of performing labor as a
nurse who presents to the consular officer (or in the case of an ad-
justment of status, the Attorney General) a certified statement
from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (or
an equivalent independent credentialing organization approved for
the certification of nurses under subsection (a)(5)(C) by the Attor-
ney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and
Human Services) that—

receive an immigrant visa or otherwise to adjust to the status of
permanent resident by reason of subsection (a)(4), the consular offi-
cer or the Attorney General shall not consider any benefits the
alien may have received that were authorized under section 501 of
the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1641(c)).

(2)(A) The employer shall make available for public examination,
within one working day after the date on which an attestation
under this subsection is filed, at the employer’s principal place of
business or worksite, a copy of each such attestation (and such ac-
companying documents as are necessary).
(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile, on a current basis,
a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of the attes-
tations filed under this subsection. Such list shall include, with re-
spect to each attestation, the wage rate, number of aliens sought,
period of intended employment, and date of need.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall make such list available for pub-
lic examination in Washington, D.C.

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) within 7 days of the date of the filing of the attes-
tation.
(3)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the re-

be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bar-
gaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be con-
ducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresenta-
tion unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after

representation has occurred.
(B) Under the process described in subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary of Labor shall provide, within 30 days after the date a com-
plaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reason-

If the Secretary of Labor determines that such a reasonable basis
exists, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such deter-
mination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing
on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, United
States Code, within 60 days after the date of the determination. If
such a hearing is requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a
finding concerning the matter by not later than 60 days after the
date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints respecting the
same applicant, the Secretary of Labor may consolidate the hear-
ings under this subparagraph on such complaints.

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 1 year for aliens to
be employed by the employer.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1),
a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, or a
violation of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$5,000 per violation as the Secretary of Labor determines to be
appropriate; and

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 2 years for aliens
to be employed by the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)
or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, in
the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer dis-
placed a United States worker employed by the employer within
the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the
date of filing of any visa petition or application supported by the
attestation—

an attestation under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-

includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or

cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity shall devise a process under which a nonimmigrant under sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an attestation under this subsection to require a nonimmigrant
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) to pay
a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date
agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of
Labor shall determine whether a required payment is a penalty
(and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.
(II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this
clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil monetary penalty
of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order
requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in
violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located,
requiring payment of any such amount to the general fund of the
Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or

Section 22:
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a full-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status due to a decision by the
employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the non-
immigrant’s lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the non-
immigrant full-time wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for
all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or

Section 23:
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a part-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status under circumstances
described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a nonimmigrant for
such hours as are designated on the attestation consistent with the
rate of pay identified on the attestation.
(III) In the case of a nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
attestation under this subsection with respect to the non-
immigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to
the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant
first is admitted into the United States, or 60 days after the date
the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer in the
case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the
date of the approval of the attestation filed with the Secretary of
Labor.

(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) for nonproductive time due to non-work-related
factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an
absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to
work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to nonimmigrants under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and United States
workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in
disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to
fail to offer to a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or

Section 24:
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii), during the nonimmigrant’s period of au-
thorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including
the opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other
insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and
savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such
as stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the
same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the em-
ployer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage
level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph (1),
the Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for pay-
ment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply
with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty
under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject
an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years,
beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the Sec-
retary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a condi-
tion of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful misrepresentation
of material fact in an attestation. The authority of the Secretary of
Labor under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be subject
to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).
(F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.

normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location

where the work of the nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more
nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) by an employer, the employer is considered to
‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the employer
lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent
of the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or
are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially
equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the
same responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with
substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is
located in the same area of employment as the other job.
(C)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an em-
ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(D) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee
who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 207 of
this title, is granted asylum under section 208, or is an im-
migrant otherwise authorized, by this Act or by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, to be employed.
(t)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted
under section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I), or acquiring such status after ad-
mission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant status, an im-
migrant visa, or permanent residence under this Act until it is es-
tablished that such person has resided and been physically present
in the person’s country of nationality or last residence for an aggre-
gate of at least 2 years following departure from the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the require-
ment of such 2-year foreign residence abroad if the Secretary deter-
mines that—
(A) departure from the United States would impose excep-
tional hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse
or child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence); or

(d)(1) If the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that an
application for nonimmigrant status under subparagraph (T) or (U)

an alien who is a stowaway or who is ordered removed either
without a hearing under section 235(a)(1) or 235(c) or pursuant

(ii) ALIENS DESCRIBED.—An alien described in this
clause is an alien who—
(I) is admitted to the United States (other than
lawfully admitted for permanent residence) and is
ordered removed within 5 years of the date of ad-
mission based on a ground that existed before or
at the time of admission, or
(II) is an alien crewman permitted to land tem-
porarily under section 252 and is ordered removed

is financially unable to depart at the alien’s own expense
and whose removal the Attorney General deems to be in
the best interest of the United States, the expense of such
removal may be paid from the appropriation for the en-
forcement of this Act.
(f) ALIENS REQUIRING PERSONAL CARE DURING REMOVAL.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—If the Attorney General believes that an
alien being removed requires personal care because of the
alien’s mental or physical condition, the Attorney General may
employ a suitable person for that purpose who shall accompany
and care for the alien until the alien arrives at the final des-
tination.
(2) COSTS.—The costs of providing the service described in
paragraph (1) shall be defrayed in the same manner as the ex-
pense of removing the accompanied alien is defrayed under
this section.
(g) PLACES OF DETENTION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Attorney General shall arrange for ap-
propriate places of detention for aliens detained pending re-
moval or a decision on removal. When United States Govern-
ment facilities are unavailable or facilities adapted or suitably
located for detention are unavailable for rental, the Attorney
General may expend from the appropriation ‘‘Immigration and
Naturalization Service—Salaries and Expenses’’, without re-
gard to section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5),
amounts necessary to acquire land and to acquire, build, re-
model, repair, and operate facilities (including living quarters
for immigration officers if not otherwise available) necessary
for detention.
(2) DETENTION FACILITIES OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATU-
RALIZATION SERVICE.—Prior to initiating any project for the
construction of any new detention facility for the Service, the
Commissioner shall consider the availability for purchase or
lease of any existing prison, jail, detention center, or other
comparable facility suitable for such use.
(h) STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section shall be
construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit
that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States
or its agencies or officers or any other person.

(1) If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if appropriate,
a political subdivision of the State) exercising authority with

respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien
submits a written request to the Attorney General, the Attor-
ney General shall, as determined by the Attorney General—
(A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides
for compensation to the State or a political subdivision of
the State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incar-
ceration of the undocumented criminal alien; or
(B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the cus-
tody of the Federal Government and incarcerate the alien.
(2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the aver-
age cost of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State as
determined by the Attorney General.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘undocumented
criminal alien’’ means an alien who—
(A) has been convicted of a felony or two or more mis-
demeanors; and
(B)(i) entered the United States without inspection or at
any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney
General;
(ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation pro-
ceedings at the time he or she was taken into custody by
the State or a political subdivision of the State; or
(iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he
or she was taken into custody by the State or a political
subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the non-
immigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to
which it was changed under section 248, or to comply with
the conditions of any such status.
(4)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General
shall give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocu-
mented criminal aliens who have committed aggravated felo-
nies.
(B) The Attorney General shall ensure that undocumented
criminal aliens incarcerated in Federal facilities pursuant to
this subsection are held in facilities which provide a level of se-
curity appropriate to the crimes for which they were convicted.
(5) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this
subsection—
(A) $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;
(B) $850,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and
(C) $950,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008
through 2011.
(6) Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of
appropriations in paragraph (5) that are distributed to a State
or political subdivision of a State, including a municipality,
may be used only for correctional purposes.

The terrorist atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel on October

a colossal human catastrophe. We hope in the coming weeks that
a ceasefire can be negotiated so that we will see the return of all

the hostages to their families and an end to the gruesome violence
and suffering.
At markup, we agreed to advance this bill, which passed the
House with near-unanimous support last Congress. No one affili-
ated with Hamas, nor anyone involved in the horrific attacks of Oc-
tober 7th, should be admissible to the United States or eligible for
any immigration benefits, whatsoever. That is an obvious political
and moral statement.
This is, however, another missed opportunity for us to work
across the aisle in a bipartisan manner. As noted at our markup,
this is essentially a visa sanctions bill. For decades, we have relied
on pre-negotiated, bipartisan, and bicameral text for every visa
sanctions bill. H.R. 176 departs from this bipartisan practice by di-
rectly amending the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to im-
pose visa sanctions. To put into perspective just how unusual this
approach is, consider our response to the September 11th attacks.
In the aftermath of that national tragedy, we revised our immigra-
tion laws to overhaul significant parts of our immigration system,
and we created the Department of Homeland Security. Yet, even
then, we did not amend the INA to specifically reference the events
of September 11th, or to bar the individuals involved in the plan-
ning or commission of those attacks from entering or remaining in
the United States.
The reason for that is plain: the laws we have in place already
bar noncitizens who engage in terrorism or are involved with ter-
rorist organizations, from entering the United States. And for any
of those noncitizens who happen to be here, our laws allow us to
remove them and prevent them from obtaining any immigration
benefits. These laws were designed to apply broadly to any indi-
vidual or organization engaged in terrorism, without having to
specify them by reference to specific events and attacks.
Under sections 212(a)(3)(B) and 237(a)(4)(B) of the INA, any non-
citizen who has engaged in terrorist activity, provided material
support to terrorists, or is a member or representative of a terrorist
organization or a group that endorses or espouses terrorist activity,
is inadmissible to the United States and deportable. Hamas has
been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997. So, we al-
ready have the legal tools to keep any noncitizen involved with
Hamas, as well as any noncitizen who was involved in the horrific
attacks of October 7th out of this country or deport them if they
are already here.
The Committee’s standard visa sanctions language—which was
carefully crafted in collaboration with all four corners of the Judici-
ary Committees staff—would allow us to achieve the aims of this
legislation without departing from negotiated sanctions language
and amendingthe INA in an unprecedented and incongruous way.
Amending the INA to impose visa sanctions sets a dangerous
precedent where new statutory language becomes necessary every
time a new terrorist group emerges. This ad hoc pastiche approach
will lead to unintended consequences.

The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act
of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. ALIENS WHO CARRIED OUT, PARTICIPATED IN, PLANNED, FINANCED, SUPPORTED, OR
OTHERWISE FACILITATED ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL.
(a) PARTICIPANTS IN HAMAS TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL.—Section 212(a)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) is amended—
(1) in subparagraph (B)(i), in the matter following subclause (IX)—
(A) by inserting ‘‘Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or Hamas’’ after ‘‘Palestine
Liberation Organization’’; and
(B) by inserting ‘‘member,’’ after ‘‘representative,’’; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(H) PARTICIPANTS IN HAMAS TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL.—Any alien who
carried out, participated in, planned, financed, afforded material support to,
or otherwise facilitated any of the attacks against Israel initiated by Hamas
beginning on October 7, 2023, is inadmissible.’’.
(b) INELIGIBILITY FOR RELIEF.—Section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(D) INELIGIBILITY FOR RELIEF.—Any alien who carried out, participated
in, planned, financed, afforded material support to, or otherwise facilitated
any of the attacks against Israel initiated by Hamas beginning on October
7, 2023, shall be ineligible for any relief under the immigration laws, in-
cluding under this section, section 208, and section 2242 of the Omnibus
Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (and
any regulations issued pursuant to such section).’’.
(c) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(B)) is amended by striking ‘‘subparagraph (B) or
(F)’’ and inserting ‘‘subparagraph (B), (F), or (H)’’.
(d) REPORT REQUIRED ON PARTICIPANTS IN HAMAS TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL.—
Beginning not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and
each year thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to
Congress, including the number of aliens who were—
(1) found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(H) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(H)); and
(2) described in section 212(a)(3)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(H)) and found to be removable pursuant to section
237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(B)).
Purpose and Summary
H.R. 176, the No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act
of 2025, introduced by Rep. Tom McClintock (R–CA), would create
a ground of inadmissibility and a ground of removability for aliens
who participated in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel
and members and officials of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The bill would also make such aliens ineligible for immigration re-
lief.
Background and Need for the Legislation
Hamas terror attack and the threat of copycat attacks
Beginning in the early hours of October 7, 2023, Hamas initiated
a brutal terrorist attack against Israel.1 One thousand, two hun-
dred people, primarily innocent Israeli civilians—including small
children, women, and the elderly—were brutally assaulted, tor-

tured, and murdered at the hands of Hamas terrorists.2 According
to press reports, Hamas also kidnapped at least 240 hostages,3 in-
cluding 10 Americans.4
Following the attacks, Hamas leaders called for a Global Day of
Jihad, which led to pro-Hamas demonstrations across the globe.5
Then-Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Wray warned of in-
creasing threats to the nation in the aftermath: ‘‘Here in the U.S.,
we cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other
foreign terrorist organizations could exploit the conflict to call on
their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil.’’6 In its 2024
Homeland Threat Assessment, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity acknowledged that ‘‘[t]errorists and criminal actors may exploit
the elevated flow and increasingly complex security environment to
enter the United States.’’7 The report also highlighted that
‘‘[i]ndividuals with terrorism connections are interested in using es-
tablished travel routes and permissive environments to facilitate
access to the United States.’’8
In Europe, these threats quickly materialized. On October 16,
2023, the city of Brussels, Belgium, ‘‘raised its terror threat level
to 4, the maximum on the scale,’’ after a Tunisian national ‘‘staying
illegally’’ in Belgium shot three people, killing two, in an Islamic
extremist terrorist attack.9 According to authorities, the terrorist
previously applied for asylum, but was denied in 2019 and later or-
dered to be removed from Belgium.10 The perpetrator—who filmed
himself admitting to the killings saying he was a ‘‘fighter for
Allah’’—was reportedly motivated by a desire to ‘‘avenge the death’’
of a 6-year-old Palestinian boy shot in the United States.11 In Ber-
lin, Germany, a synagogue that houses a community center, kin-
dergarten, and a school was firebombed with ‘‘two Molotov cock-
tails’’ in October 2023.12 At least one suspect was arrested: a man

who, according to police, ‘‘resisted and shouted anti-Israeli slo-
gans,’’ when police apprehended him.13
On December 3, 2023, a 26-year-old French national born to Ira-
nian parents stabbed three people at the base of the Eiffel Tower,
killing one and critically injuring two others.14 Prior to the attack,
the assailant posted a video on social media in which he ‘‘swore al-
legiance to [the] Islamic State and supported its jihadists in dif-
ferent areas from Africa to Iraq, Syria and Pakistan.’’15 In 2016,
he was ‘‘sentenced to four years in prison for planning another at-
tack.’’16 According to the French Interior Minister, there were more
than 800 antisemitic attacks in France within one month of
Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel.17 More recently, in Mu-
nich, Germany, on February 13, 2025, an Afghan national pre-
viously denied asylum in the country rammed his car into a crowd
of people, killing a two-year-old and her mother and injuring doz-
ens.18 Upon his arrest, the suspect said to police, ‘‘Allahu Akbar.’’19
These attacks led some European leaders to call for stronger bor-
ders and increased immigration enforcement. The Prime Minister
of Sweden, for example, called on Sweden and the European Union
to ‘‘better protect their borders and ensure that dangerous individ-
uals could not stay illegally,’’ stating, ‘‘This is a time for more secu-
rity, we can’t be na¨ıve.’’20 France announced it would ‘‘double the
number of security agents at the [French-Belgian] border’’ following
an attack in Brussels,21 while Denmark confirmed it would
‘‘extend[] border controls’’ on the Danish-German border for six ad-
ditional months citing, in part, ‘‘Islamist terrorist threat[s].’’22
The terrorist threats have spread to the United States. In No-
vember 2023, a threat assessment by the New York State Intel-
ligence Center warned of ‘‘an increasing terror threat to [New York
State].’’23 The assessment outlined how ‘‘[t]he expansion of Israeli
operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and increase in civil-
ian casualties raises the likelihood that violent extremist threat ac-
tors will seek to conduct attacks against targets in the West, with

New York State being a focus.’’24 In addition, in early December
2023, authorities arrested a 16-year-old in Las Vegas for threat-
ening a ‘‘lone wolf’’ terrorist attack and proclaiming his support for
the Islamic State.25 In a subsequent search of his home, police
found ‘‘components to build an explosive device,’’ ‘‘bomb-making
recipes and instructions,’’ and ‘‘terrorist propaganda.’’26 In Hous-
ton, a Jordanian man was arrested for plotting a terrorist attack
on the local Jewish community.27 According to reports, the man
had been radicalized, ‘‘stud[ied] how to build bombs,’’ and ‘‘posted
about his support for killing Jews.’’28 Although his non-immigrant
visa expired in 2019, he had ‘‘applied for asylum and obtained work
authorization in the United States until 2025.’’29
The Biden-Harris Administration’s open southwest border only
fueled the terror threat to the homeland. During four years of the
Biden-Harris Administration, Border Patrol agents encountered
along the southwest and northern borders at least 392 illegal aliens
on the terrorist watchlist.30 Many of those potential terrorists were
released into the United States. The Committee reported in August
2024 that, ‘‘of the more than 250 illegal aliens on the terrorist
watchlist who were encountered by Border Patrol at the southwest
border between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, DHS [] released into
American communities at least 99.’’31 Even aliens initially not
found on the terrorist watchlist can pose significant national secu-
rity threats. In March 2023, for instance, an illegal alien from
Mauritania entered the United States and ‘‘was screened by border
agents before he was released into the country.’’32 Although ‘‘au-
thorities didn’t find any criminal or terrorist histories linked to
him’’ at the time of his encounter at the border, just 19 months
later, in October 2024, the illegal alien ‘‘shot and wounded a 39-
year-old Jewish man’’ in Chicago in an antisemitic terrorist at-
tack.33 The illegal alien, who shouted ‘‘Allahu Akbar’’ before shoot-
ing at police responding to the attack, had ‘‘planned to target Jew-
ish community members leading up to the shooting.’’34
Seventeen months after the Hamas attack on Israel, the risk of
terrorism around the world remains high. On January 1, 2025, an
ISIS-inspired terrorist drove his truck into crowds on Bourbon
Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people and injuring dozens.35

Inadmissibility grounds in the Immigration and Nationality Act
Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act provides inad-
missibility grounds relating to security concerns, including partici-
pation in terrorist activities.37 While being an officer, official, rep-
resentative, or spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion currently constitutes being engaged in terrorist activity for the
purpose of inadmissibility, U.S. immigration law does not similarly
classify participation in an official capacity in Hamas or Pales-
tinian Islamic Jihad as engaging terrorist activity.38 H.R. 176
changes that by ensuring that aliens who are officers, officials, rep-
resentatives, spokesmen, or members of Hamas or Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad are considered to have engaged in terrorist activity.
In addition, H.R. 176 creates a new ground of removability and
a new ground of inadmissibility for aliens who carried out, partici-
pated in, planned, financed, afforded material support to, or other-
wise facilitated any of the attacks against Israel beginning on Octo-
ber 7, 2023. In doing so, the bill treats the atrocities of October 7
on par with the immigration laws’ treatment of Nazi persecution,
genocide, torture, and extrajudicial killings.39 Finally, the bill en-
sures that no Hamas terrorist can receive any immigration relief,
including asylum, under U.S. immigration law.
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 176: ‘‘Restoring Immi-
gration Enforcement in America,’’ a hearing held on January 22,
2025, before the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security,
and Enforcement of the Committee on the Judiciary. The Sub-
committee heard testimony from the following witnesses:
• John Fabbricatore, Former Field Office Director, U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Re-
moval Operations; Visiting Fellow, The Heritage Foundation;
• Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies, Center for Im-
migration Studies (CIS);
• Grant Newman, Director of Government Relations, Immi-
gration Accountability Project; and
• David Bier, Director of Immigration Studies, CATO Insti-
tute.
The hearing addressed how the Trump Administration can restore
immigration enforcement in the United States and reverse the
Biden-Harris Administration’s open-borders, no-consequences im-
migration policies.

states that no roll call votes occurred during consideration of H.R
176.
Committee Oversight Findings
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of House rule XIII, the Com-
mittee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to the require-
ments of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of
1974, the Committee has requested but not received a cost estimate
for this bill from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office a statement as to whether this
bill contains any new budget authority, spending authority, credit
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expendi-
tures. The Chairman of the Committee shall cause such estimate
and statement to be printed in the Congressional Record upon its
receipt by the Committee.
Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, a cost estimate provided
by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was not made available to the
Committee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of

Duplication of Federal Programs
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House rule XIII, no provision of H.R.
176 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another federal program.
Performance Goals and Objectives
The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House
rule XIII, H.R. 176 would create a ground of inadmissibility and a
ground of removability for aliens who participated in the October
7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel and members and officials of
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The bill would also make
such aliens ineligible for immigration relief.
Advisory on Earmarks
In accordance with clause 9 of House rule XXI, H.R. 176 does not
contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited
tariff benefits as defined in clauses 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of House rule
XXI.
Federal Mandates Statement
An estimate of federal mandates prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of the
Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congres-
sional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
Advisory Committee Statement
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
Applicability to Legislative Branch
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Pub. L. 104–1).
Section-by-Section Analysis
Section 1. Short Title. The ‘‘No Immigration Benefits for Hamas
Terrorists Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Aliens Who Carried Out, Participated In, Planned, Fi-
nanced, Supported, or Otherwise Facilitated Attacks Against Israel.
This section ensures that members, officers, officials, representa-
tives, and spokespeople for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad
are found to be ‘‘engaged in terrorist activity’’ for purposes of inad-
missibility. It also creates a new ground of inadmissibility and re-
movability specifically for aliens who carried out, participated in,
planned, financed, afforded material support to, or otherwise facili-
tated the Hamas-led attacks against Israel. The section makes
such aliens ineligible for all immigration relief, including asylum,
withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention
Against Torture. The section also requires an annual report to Con-

a refugee under section 207.

ficer, alleging a violation of the limitation under subparagraph (A)

action against the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of
such State or the residents of such State in an appropriate district
court of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.

101(a)(15)(T), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, in the Attorney General’s discretion, may waive the applica-

(3)(E)) in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(U), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the public or national interest to do so.
(e) No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J) or acquiring
such status after admission (i) whose participation in the program
for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or
in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of
the United States or by the government of the country of his na-
tionality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or
acquisition of status under section 101(a)(15)(J) was a national or
resident of a country which the Director of the United States Infor-
mation Agency pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, had des-
ignated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the
field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was en-
gaged, or (iii) who came to the United States or acquired such sta-
tus in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall
be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent resi-
dence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or
section 101(a)(15)(L) until it is established that such person has re-
sided and been physically present in the country of his nationality
or his last residence for an aggregate of a least two years following
departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favor-
able recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an
interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an
alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the request of a State
Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Commis-
sioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined
that departure from the United States would impose exceptional
hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse or child
is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully resident alien), or
that the alien cannot return to the country of his nationality or last
residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of
race, religion, or political opinion, the Attorney General may waive
the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the
case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by
the Attorney General to be in the public interest except that in the
case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public Health,
or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an inter-
ested United States Government agency on behalf of an alien de-
scribed in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the require-
ments of section 214(l): And provided further, That, except in the
case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may,
upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such
two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the
foreign country of the alien’s nationality or last residence has fur-
nished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection
to such waiver in the case of such alien.
(f) Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or
of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental
to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and
for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of
all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants,
or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to
be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a com-

physician (as those terms are defined by section 34.2 of
title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations) certifies, ac-
cording to such regulations as the Secretary of Health and
Human Services may prescribe, that such vaccination
would not be medically appropriate, or
(C) under such circumstances as the Attorney General
provides by regulation, with respect to whom the require-
ment of such a vaccination would be contrary to the alien’s
religious beliefs or moral convictions; or

(ii) the admission to the United States of such alien
would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or se-
curity of the United States, and
(iii) the alien has been rehabilitated; or
(B) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, parent,
son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or an alien

nial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the
United States citizen or lawfully resident spouse, parent, son,
or daughter of such alien; or
(C) the alien is a VAWA self-petitioner; and

No waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of
an alien who has been convicted of (or who has admitted commit-
ting acts that constitute) murder or criminal acts involving torture,
or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act in-
volving torture. No waiver shall be granted under this subsection
in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the
United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
dence if either since the date of such admission the alien has been
convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully re-
sided continuously in the United States for a period of not less
than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of pro-
ceedings to remove the alien from the United States. No court shall
have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to
grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.
(i)(1) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
General, waive the application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(C)
in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, son, or daughter
of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for per-
manent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the Attor-
ney General that the refusal of admission to the United States of
such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the cit-
izen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such an alien or, in
the case of a VAWA self-petitioner, the alien demonstrates extreme
hardship to the alien or the alien’s United States citizen, lawful
permanent resident, or qualified alien parent or child.
(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision or action
of the Attorney General regarding a waiver under paragraph (1).
(j)(1) The additional requirements referred to in section
101(a)(15)(J) for an alien who is coming to the United States under
a program under which he will receive graduate medical education
or training are as follows:
(A) A school of medicine or of one of the other health profes-
sions, which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the
purpose by the Secretary of Education, has agreed in writing
to provide the graduate medical education or training under
the program for which the alien is coming to the United States
or to assume responsibility for arranging for the provision
thereof by an appropriate public or nonprofit private institu-

tion or agency, except that, in the case of such an agreement
by a school of medicine, any one or more of its affiliated hos-
pitals which are to participate in the provision of the graduate
medical education or training must join in the agreement.
(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has
been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of
medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for
the purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of
whether such school of medicine is in the United States); or
(ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Med-
ical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as
determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services),
(II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be
able to adapt to the educational and cultural environment in
which he will be receiving his education or training, and (IV)
has adequate prior education and training to participate satis-
factorily in the program for which he is coming to the United
States. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an alien who is
a graduate of a medical school shall be considered to have
passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Exam-
iners examination if the alien was fully and permanently li-
censed to practice medicine in a State on January 9, 1978, and
was practicing medicine in a State on that date.
(C) The alien has made a commitment to return to the coun-
try of his nationality or last residence upon completion of the
education or training for which he is coming to the United
States, and the government of the country of his nationality or
last residence has provided a written assurance, satisfactory to
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that there is a
need in that country for persons with the skills the alien will
acquire in such education or training.
(D) The duration of the alien’s participation in the program
of graduate medical education or training for which the alien
is coming to the United States is limited to the time typically
required to complete such program, as determined by the Di-
rector of the United States Information Agency at the time of
the alien’s admission into the United States, based on criteria
which are established in coordination with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services and which take into consideration
the published requirements of the medical specialty board
which administers such education or training program; except
that—
(i) such duration is further limited to seven years unless
the alien has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Direc-
tor that the country to which the alien will return at the
end of such specialty education or training has an excep-
tional need for an individual trained in such specialty, and
(ii) the alien may, once and not later than two years
after the date the alien is admitted to the United States
as an exchange visitor or acquires exchange visitor status,
change the alien’s designated program of graduate medical
education or training if the Director approves the change
and if a commitment and written assurance with respect
to the alien’s new program have been provided in accord-
ance with subparagraph (C).

(E) The alien furnishes the Attorney General each year with
an affidavit (in such form as the Attorney General shall pre-
scribe) that attests that the alien (i) is in good standing in the
program of graduate medical education or training in which
the alien is participating, and (ii) will return to the country of
his nationality or last residence upon completion of the edu-
cation or training for which he came to the United States.
(2) An alien who is a graduate of a medical school and who is
coming to the United States to perform services as a member of the
medical profession may not be admitted as a nonimmigrant under
section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) unless—
(A) the alien is coming pursuant to an invitation from a pub-
lic or nonprofit private educational or research institution or
agency in the United States to teach or conduct research, or
both, at or for such institution or agency, or
(B)(i) the alien has passed the Federation licensing examina-
tion (administered by the Federation of State Medical Boards
of the United States) or an equivalent examination as deter-
mined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
(ii)(I) has competency in oral and written English or (II) is
a graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a
body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of
Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in
the United States).
(3) The Director of the United States Information Agency annu-
ally shall transmit to the Congress a report on aliens who have
submitted affidavits described in paragraph (1)(E), and shall in-
clude in such report the name and address of each such alien, the
medical education or training program in which such alien is par-
ticipating, and the status of such alien in that program.
(k) Any alien, inadmissible from the United States under para-
graph (5)(A) or (7)(A)(i) of subsection (a), who is in possession of an
immigrant visa may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in the
discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General is satis-
fied that inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have
been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the im-
migrant before the time of departure of the vessel or aircraft from
the last port outside the United States and outside foreign contig-
uous territory or, in the case of an immigrant coming from foreign
contiguous territory, before the time of the immigrant’s application
for admission.
(l) GUAM AND NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS VISA WAIVER PRO-
GRAM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The requirement of subsection (a)(7)(B)(i)
may be waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the
case of an alien applying for admission as a nonimmigrant vis-
itor for business or pleasure and solely for entry into and stay
in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands for a period not to exceed 45 days, if the Secretary of
Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior, the Secretary of State, the Governor of Guam and
the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, determines that—

(A) an adequate arrival and departure control system
has been developed in Guam and the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; and
(B) such a waiver does not represent a threat to the wel-
fare, safety, or security of the United States or its terri-
tories and commonwealths.
(2) ALIEN WAIVER OF RIGHTS.—An alien may not be provided
a waiver under this subsection unless the alien has waived any
right—
(A) to review or appeal under this Act an immigration
officer’s determination as to the admissibility of the alien
at the port of entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; or
(B) to contest, other than on the basis of an application
for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of this
Act or under the Convention Against Torture, or an appli-
cation for asylum if permitted under section 208, any ac-
tion for removal of the alien.
(3) REGULATIONS.—All necessary regulations to implement
this subsection shall be promulgated by the Secretary of Home-
land Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior
and the Secretary of State, on or before the 180th day after the
date of enactment of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act
of 2008. The promulgation of such regulations shall be consid-
ered a foreign affairs function for purposes of section 553(a) of
title 5, United States Code. At a minimum, such regulations
should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
(A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may obtain
the waiver also provided by this subsection, except that
such regulations shall provide for a listing of any country
from which the Commonwealth has received a significant
economic benefit from the number of visitors for pleasure
within the one-year period preceding the date of enactment
of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, unless
the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such
country’s inclusion on such list would represent a threat to
the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its
territories; and
(B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or
all of those countries who may present an increased risk
of overstays or other potential problems, if different from
such requirements otherwise provided by law for non-
immigrant visitors.
(4) FACTORS.—In determining whether to grant or continue
providing the waiver under this subsection to nationals of any
country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State,
shall consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant, in-
cluding electronic travel authorizations, procedures for report-
ing lost and stolen passports, repatriation of aliens, rates of re-
fusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems,
and information exchange.
(5) SUSPENSION.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to Guam and
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under

this subsection. If the Secretary determines that such admis-
sions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors from
a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unlawfully obtaining
entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking with-
holding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country
pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of Guam
or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or of
the United States (including the interest in the enforcement of
the immigration laws of the United States), the Secretary shall
suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this
subsection. The Secretary of Homeland Security may in the
Secretary’s discretion suspend the Guam and Northern Mar-
iana Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-
by-country basis, for other good cause.
(6) ADDITION OF COUNTRIES.—The Governor of Guam and the
Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to add a particular country to the
list of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity may grant such request after consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may pro-
mulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of that coun-
try and any special requirements the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the Secretary’s sole discretion, may impose prior to
allowing nationals of that country to obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection.
(m)(1) The qualifications referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),

such temporary or interim licensing requirements which au-
thorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of in-
tended employment to engage in the practice of professional
nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to
the United States and is authorized under such laws to be em-
ployed by the facility.

(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage
rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.
(iv) The facility has taken and is taking timely and signifi-
cant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered
nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are
authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as
quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on
nonimmigrant registered nurses.
(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a reg-
istered nurse employed by the facility within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing
of any visa petition, and the employment of such an alien is
not intended or designed to influence an election for a bar-
gaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.
(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered
nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), notice of the filing has

such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been
provided to the registered nurses employed at the facility
through posting in conspicuous locations.
(vii) The facility will not, at any time, employ a number of
aliens issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) that exceeds 33 percent of the
total number of registered nurses employed by the facility.
(viii) The facility will not, with respect to any alien issued a
visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c)—
(I) authorize the alien to perform nursing services at any
worksite other than a worksite controlled by the facility; or
(II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from
one worksite to another.
Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility
to have taken significant steps described in such clause before
the date of the enactment of the Nursing Relief for Disadvan-
taged Areas Act of 1999. A copy of the attestation shall be pro-
vided, within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered nurses
employed at the facility on the date of filing.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the following
shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit
and retain registered nurses:
(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the
facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
program for registered nurses elsewhere.
(ii) Providing career development programs and other meth-
ods of facilitating health care workers to become registered
nurses.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than
currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in
the geographic area.
(iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary
advancement by registered nurses.
The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered
to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken

to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv). Nothing in this sub-
paragraph shall require a facility to take more than one step if the
facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reason-
able.
(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subpara-
graph (A)—
(i) shall expire on the date that is the later of—
(I) the end of the one-year period beginning on the date
of its filing with the Secretary of Labor; or
(II) the end of the period of admission under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the last alien with respect to whose
admission it was applied (in accordance with clause (ii));
and
(ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year period
beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor
if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to
comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph
with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.
(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a
list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for non-
immigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) and, for each such fa-
cility, a copy of the facility’s attestation under subparagraph (A)
(and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by
the facility.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including
reasonable time limits, for the receipt, investigation, and disposi-
tion of complaints respecting a facility’s failure to meet conditions
attested to or a facility’s misrepresentation of a material fact in an
attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or or-
ganization (including bargaining representatives, associations
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties
as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary
shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reason-
able cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested
to. Subject to the time limits established under this clause, this
subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation is
expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in
clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the
Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the in-
terested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint
within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has

tion, with the total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation) as
the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such

notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with
respect to a facility during a period of at least one year for nurses
to be employed by the facility.
(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv), if
the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under
subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at
the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to
provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be re-
quired to comply with such condition.
(F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing an
attestation under subparagraph (A) a filing fee, in an amount pre-
scribed by the Secretary based on the costs of carrying out the Sec-
retary’s duties under this subsection, but not exceeding $250.
(ii) Fees collected under this subparagraph shall be deposited in
a fund established for this purpose in the Treasury of the United
States.
(iii) The collected fees in the fund shall be available to the Sec-
retary of Labor, to the extent and in such amounts as may be pro-
vided in appropriations Acts, to cover the costs described in clause
(i), in addition to any other funds that are available to the Sec-
retary to cover such costs.
(3) The period of admission of an alien under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) shall be 3 years.
(4) The total number of nonimmigrant visas issued pursuant to
petitions granted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) in each fiscal
year shall not exceed 500. The number of such visas issued for em-
ployment in each State in each fiscal year shall not exceed the fol-
lowing:
(A) For States with populations of less than 9,000,000, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 25 visas.
(B) For States with populations of 9,000,000 or more, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 50 visas.
(C) If the total number of visas available under this para-
graph for a fiscal year quarter exceeds the number of qualified
nonimmigrants who may be issued such visas during those
quarters, the visas made available under this paragraph shall
be issued without regard to the numerical limitation under
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph during the last fiscal
year quarter.
(5) A facility that has filed a petition under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) to employ a nonimmigrant to perform nursing
services for the facility—
(A) shall provide the nonimmigrant a wage rate and working
conditions commensurate with those of nurses similarly em-
ployed by the facility;
(B) shall require the nonimmigrant to work hours commen-
surate with those of nurses similarly employed by the facility;
and
(C) shall not interfere with the right of the nonimmigrant to
join or organize a union.
(6) For purposes of this subsection and section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
the term ‘‘facility’’ means a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.

(A) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a
health professional shortage area (as defined in section 332 of
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).
(B) Based on its settled cost report filed under title XVIII of
the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period beginning
during fiscal year 1994—
(i) the hospital has not less than 190 licensed acute care
beds;
(ii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were entitled to benefits under part A of such title is not
less than 35 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period; and
(iii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan ap-
proved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, is not
less than 28 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period.
(7) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(v), the term ‘‘lay off’’,
with respect to a worker—
(A) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(B) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit an employee’s
or an employer’s rights under a collective bargaining agree-
ment or other employment contract.
(n)(1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as an H–1B
nonimmigrant in an occupational classification unless the employer
has filed with the Secretary of Labor an application stating the fol-
lowing:
(A) The employer—
(i) is offering and will offer during the period of author-
ized employment to aliens admitted or provided status as
an H–1B nonimmigrant wages that are at least—
(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all
other individuals with similar experience and quali-
fications for the specific employment in question, or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the application, and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-
immigrant that will not adversely affect the working condi-
tions of workers similarly employed.

(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute in the occupational classification at the place of em-
ployment.
(C) The employer, at the time of filing the application—
(i) has provided notice of the filing under this paragraph
to the bargaining representative (if any) of the employer’s
employees in the occupational classification and area for
which aliens are sought, or
(ii) if there is no such bargaining representative, has
provided notice of filing in the occupational classification
through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
locations at the place of employment or electronic notifica-
tion to employees in the occupational classification for
which H–1B nonimmigrants are sought.
(D) The application shall contain a specification of the num-
ber of workers sought, the occupational classification in which
the workers will be employed, and wage rate and conditions
under which they will be employed.
(E)(i) In the case of an application described in clause (ii),
the employer did not displace and will not displace a United
States worker (as defined in paragraph (4)) employed by the
employer within the period beginning 90 days before and end-
ing 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition sup-
ported by the application.
(ii) An application described in this clause is an application
filed on or after the date final regulations are first promul-
gated to carry out this subparagraph, and before by an H–1B-
dependent employer (as defined in paragraph (3)) or by an em-
ployer that has been found, on or after the date of the enact-
ment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Im-
provement Act of 1998, under paragraph (2)(C) or (5) to have
committed a willful failure or misrepresentation during the 5-
year period preceding the filing of the application. An applica-
tion is not described in this clause if the only H–1B non-
immigrants sought in the application are exempt H–1B non-
immigrants.
(F) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
(E)(ii), the employer will not place the nonimmigrant with an-
other employer (regardless of whether or not such other em-
ployer is an H–1B-dependent employer) where—
(i) the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part
at one or more worksites owned, operated, or controlled by
such other employer; and
(ii) there are indicia of an employment relationship be-
tween the nonimmigrant and such other employer;
unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to
whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of the
placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer, the
other employer has displaced or intends to displace a United
States worker employed by the other employer.

(E)(ii), subject to clause (ii), the employer, prior to filing the ap-
plication—

(I) has taken good faith steps to recruit, in the United
States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards
and offering compensation that is at least as great as that
required to be offered to H–1B nonimmigrants under sub-
paragraph (A), United States workers for the job for which
the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
(II) has offered the job to any United States worker who
applies and is equally or better qualified for the job for
which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are
sought.
(ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to
an application filed with respect to the employment of an H–
1B nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or
(C) of section 203(b)(1).
The employer shall make available for public examination, within
one working day after the date on which an application under this
paragraph is filed, at the employer’s principal place of business or
worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying
documents as are necessary). The Secretary shall compile, on a cur-
rent basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of
the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include
the wage rate, number of aliens sought, period of intended employ-
ment, and date of need. The Secretary shall make such list avail-
able for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of
Labor shall review such an application only for completeness and
obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the applica-
tion is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall pro-
vide the certification described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) within
7 days of the date of the filing of the application. The application
form shall include a clear statement explaining the liability under
subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer de-
scribed in such subparagraph displaces a United States worker as
described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G) shall
be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate selec-
tion criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the
type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a
discriminatory manner.
(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall establish
a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of com-
plaints respecting a petitioner’s failure to meet a condition specified
in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner’s
misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Com-
plaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (in-
cluding bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing
shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or mis-
representation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respec-
tively. The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this
paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure
or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding
described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that
such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for no-

tunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section
556 of title 5, United States Code, within 60 days after the date
of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary
shall make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60
days after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the
hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E),
or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
(1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material fact
in an application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be employed by the
employer.
(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a willful
misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a violation
of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or a
willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in the
course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced
a United States worker employed by the employer within the pe-
riod beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date
of filing of any visa petition supported by the application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-
strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,

includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise
a process under which an H–1B nonimmigrant who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an H–1B non-
immigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the em-
ployer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the em-
ployer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment
is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
State law.
(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an alien who is the
subject of a petition filed under section 214(c)(1), for which a fee
is imposed under section 214(c)(9), to reimburse, or otherwise com-
pensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is
a violation of this clause for such an employer otherwise to accept
such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.
(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause,
the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for
each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the
return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this
clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring pay-
ment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection
and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
employee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the em-
ployer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as
lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant’s lack of a permit or li-
cense, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accord-
ance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and
who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time em-
ployee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the employer
with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has en-
tered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status
under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such
a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such petition
consistent with the rate of pay identified on such petition.

(III) In the case of an H–1B nonimmigrant who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
application under this subsection, and a petition under section
214(c)(1), with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of sub-
clauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days
after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United
States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the non-
immigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer (in the case
of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date
of the approval of the petition).
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an
H–1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-re-
lated factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant
for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant un-
able to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to an
H–1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to H–1B nonimmigrants and
United States workers in the same occupational classification an
annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to
fail to offer to an H–1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant’s
period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for bene-
fits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life, dis-
ability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in
retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and noncash com-
pensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on perform-
ance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria,
as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level speci-
fied under the application and required under paragraph (1), the
Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of such
amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the re-
quirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under sub-
paragraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) If an H–1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H–1B
nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph
(1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United
States worker employed by such other employer during the period
described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered
for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer,
to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under
paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a

sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i), (C)(ii),
or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing em-
ployer—
(i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the
time of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other em-
ployer; or
(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph
based upon a previous placement of an H–1B nonimmigrant
with the same other employer.
(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an em-
ployer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, begin-
ning on the date (on or after the date of the enactment of the
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of
1998) on which the employer is found by the Secretary to have
committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or
has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful
failure to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have
made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application.
The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of
whether or not the employer is an H–1B-dependent employer. The
authority of the Secretary under this subparagraph shall not be
construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of sub-
paragraph (A).
(G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of any
employer that employs nonimmigrants described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) if the Secretary of Labor has reasonable cause to
believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection.
In the case of an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of
Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case of the absence of dis-
ability of the Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that rea-
sonable cause exists and shall approve commencement of the inves-
tigation. The investigation may be initiated for reasons other than
completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in com-
plying with this subsection.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible information
from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer’s
practices or employment conditions, or an employer’s compliance
with the employer’s labor condition application under paragraph
(1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, and
such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the em-
ployer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of para-
graph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged
in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has
committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that af-
fects multiple employees, the Secretary of Labor may conduct an
investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of
Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer,
and the source’s identity shall not be subject to disclosure under
section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any
person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information de-
scribed in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the
basis for the commencement of an investigation described in such
clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed
and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on be-

of the Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the re-
quirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the
Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the per-
son).
(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of
Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies
the requirements of such clause and that—
(I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor; or
(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the
course of lawfully conducting another Department of Labor in-
vestigation under this Act of any other Act.
(v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information sub-
mitted by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary of
Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) shall not be considered a re-
ceipt of information for purposes of clause (ii).
(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing described
in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be conducted with
respect to information about a failure to meet a condition described
in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the informa-
tion not later than 12 months after the date of the alleged failure.
(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer
with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an inves-
tigation described in clauses (i) or (ii), prior to the commencement
of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an
investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and
shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond to
the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Sec-
retary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the
Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere with
an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the em-
ployer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall be no
judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor under
this clause.
(viii) An investigation under clauses (i) or (ii) may be conducted
for a period of up to 60 days. If the Secretary of Labor determines
after such an investigation that a reasonable basis exists to make
a finding that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet
a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or
(1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet
such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to meet
such a condition that affects multiple employees, the Secretary of
Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the inter-
ested parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with
section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 120 days after the
date of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Sec-
retary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the matter by not
later than 120 days after the date of the hearing.
(H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or enti-
ty is considered to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to
meet such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to com-
ply with the requirements.

(III) the person or entity has not corrected the failure volun-
tarily within such period.
(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation,
is found to have violated the prevailing wage requirements set

penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish
that the manner in which the prevailing wage was calculated
was consistent with recognized industry standards and prac-
tices.
(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity
that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
willful violations of this subsection.
(I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.
(3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘H–1B-dependent
employer’’ means an employer that—
(i)(I) has 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees who are
employed in the United States; and (II) employs more than 7
H–1B nonimmigrants;
(ii)(I) has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time equiva-
lent employees who are employed in the United States; and (II)
employs more than 12 H–1B nonimmigrants; or
(iii)(I) has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are
employed in the United States; and (II) employs H–1B non-
immigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent
of the number of such full-time equivalent employees.
(B) For purposes of this subsection—
(i) the term ‘‘exempt H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an H–1B
nonimmigrant who—
(I) receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar
compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000;

ees and the number of H–1B nonimmigrants, exempt H–1B
nonimmigrants shall not be taken into account during the
longer of—
(I) the 6-month period beginning on the date of the en-

ment Act of 1998 and ending on the date final regulations
are issued to carry out this paragraph; and
(ii) any group treated as a single employer under subsection
(b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 shall be treated as a single employer.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the H–1B nonimmigrant is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more
H–1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is consid-
ered to ‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the em-
ployer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the
equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or non-
immigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to
be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves es-
sentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States
worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experi-
ence, and is located in the same area of employment as the
other job.
(C) The term ‘‘H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an alien admit-
ted or provided status as a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).
(D)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract (other than a temporary employment contract en-
tered into in order to evade a condition described in sub-
paragraph (E) or (F) of paragraph (1)); but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
(or, in the case of a placement of a worker with another
employer under paragraph (1)(F), with either employer de-
scribed in such paragraph) at equivalent or higher com-
pensation and benefits than the position from which the
employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the
employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an em-
ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(E) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee
who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 207, is
granted asylum under section 208, or is an immigrant oth-
erwise authorized, by this Act or by the Attorney General,
to be employed.

(5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A)
through (E) of paragraph (2) in the case of a violation described in
subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect the
authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect to
any other violation.
(B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the re-
ceipt, initial review, and disposition in accordance with this para-
graph of complaints respecting an employer’s failure to meet the
condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner’s misrepresenta-
tion of material facts with respect to such condition. Complaints
may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has submitted a
re´sume´ or otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for the job
that is the subject of the condition. No proceeding shall be con-
ducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a fail-
ure or misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines
that the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the
date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
(C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been filed
in accordance with subparagraph (B) and there is reasonable cause
to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described in
such complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate
binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Medi-
ation and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the
roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure
and rules of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such
arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney Gen-
eral shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a
failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B) oc-
curred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or misrepresentation
was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding to that effect. The
arbitrator may not find such a failure or misrepresentation (or that
such a failure or misrepresentation was willful) unless the com-
plainant demonstrates such a failure or misrepresentation (or its
willful character) by clear and convincing evidence. The arbitrator
shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion to the
parties to the arbitration and the Attorney General. Such findings
shall be final and conclusive, and, except as provided in this sub-
paragraph, no official or court of the United States shall have
power or jurisdiction to review any such findings.
(ii) The Attorney General may review and reverse or modify the
findings of an arbitrator only on the same bases as an award of an
arbitrator may be vacated or modified under section 10 or 11 of
title 9, United States Code.
(iii) With respect to the findings of an arbitrator, a court may re-
view only the actions of the Attorney General under clause (ii) and
may set aside such actions only on the grounds described in sub-
paragraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 706(a)(2) of title 5, United
States Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such judi-
cial review may only be brought in an appropriate United States
court of appeals.
(E) If the Attorney General receives a finding of an arbitrator
under this paragraph that an employer has failed to meet the con-
dition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or has misrepresented a material

verses or modifies the finding under subparagraph (D)(ii)—
(i) the Attorney General may impose administrative rem-
edies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
exceed $1,000 per violation or $5,000 per violation in the case
of a willful failure or misrepresentation) as the Attorney Gen-
eral determines to be appropriate; and
(ii) the Attorney General is authorized to not approve peti-
tions filed, with respect to that employer and for aliens to be
employed by the employer, under section 204 or 214(c)—
(I) during a period of not more than 1 year; or
(II) in the case of a willful failure or willful misrepresen-
tation, during a period of not more than 2 years.
(F) The Attorney General shall not delegate, to any other em-
ployee or official of the Department of Justice, any function of the
Attorney General under this paragraph, until 60 days after the At-
torney General has submitted a plan for such delegation to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.
(o) An alien who has been physically present in the United
States shall not be eligible to receive an immigrant visa within
ninety days following departure therefrom unless—
(1) the alien was maintaining a lawful nonimmigrant status
at the time of such departure, or
(2) the alien is the spouse or unmarried child of an indi-
vidual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status
under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality
Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986 at any date, who—
(A) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse
of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent
resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986;
(B) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, re-
sided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a
lawful permanent resident; and

classification in an area of employment for purposes of subsections
(a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) in the case of an em-
ployee of—
(A) an institution of higher education (as defined in section
101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or a related or af-
filiated nonprofit entity; or
(B) a nonprofit research organization or a Governmental re-
search organization,
the prevailing wage level shall only take into account employees at
such institutions and organizations in the area of employment.
(2) With respect to a professional athlete (as defined in sub-
section (a)(5)(A)(iii)(II)) when the job opportunity is covered by pro-
fessional sports league rules or regulations, the wage set forth in
those rules or regulations shall be considered as not adversely af-

be considered the prevailing wage.
(3) The prevailing wage required to be paid pursuant to sub-
sections (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) shall be 100 per-
cent of the wage determined pursuant to those sections.
(4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to em-
ployers, a governmental survey to determine the prevailing wage,
such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commensurate
with experience, education, and the level of supervision. Where an
existing government survey has only 2 levels, 2 intermediate levels
may be created by dividing by 3, the difference between the 2 levels
offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the first level and
subtracting that quotient from the second level.
(q) Any alien admitted under section 101(a)(15)(B) may accept an
honorarium payment and associated incidental expenses for a
usual academic activity or activities (lasting not longer than 9 days
at any single institution), as defined by the Attorney General in
consultation with the Secretary of Education, if such payment is of-
fered by an institution or organization described in subsection
(p)(1) and is made for services conducted for the benefit of that in-
stitution or entity and if the alien has not accepted such payment
or expenses from more than 5 institutions or organizations in the
previous 6-month period.
(r) Subsection (a)(5)(C) shall not apply to an alien who seeks to
enter the United States for the purpose of performing labor as a
nurse who presents to the consular officer (or in the case of an ad-
justment of status, the Attorney General) a certified statement
from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (or
an equivalent independent credentialing organization approved for
the certification of nurses under subsection (a)(5)(C) by the Attor-
ney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and
Human Services) that—

in a State where the alien intends to be employed and such
State verifies that the foreign licenses of alien nurses are au-
thentic and unencumbered;

Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999, based on
such commission’s assessment that the quality of
nursing education in that country, and the English
language proficiency of those who complete such pro-
grams in that country, justify the country’s designa-
tion; or

unanimous agreement of such commission and any
equivalent credentialing organizations which have
been approved under subsection (a)(5)(C) for the cer-
tification of nurses under this subsection; and

(s) In determining whether an alien described in subsection
(a)(4)(C)(i) is inadmissible under subsection (a)(4) or ineligible to
receive an immigrant visa or otherwise to adjust to the status of
permanent resident by reason of subsection (a)(4), the consular offi-
cer or the Attorney General shall not consider any benefits the
alien may have received that were authorized under section 501 of
the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1641(c)).
(t)(1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as a non-
immigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) in an occupational classification unless the em-
ployer has filed with the Secretary of Labor an attestation stating
the following:
(A) The employer—
(i) is offering and will offer during the period of author-
ized employment to aliens admitted or provided status
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) wages that are at least—
(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all
other individuals with similar experience and quali-
fications for the specific employment in question; or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the attestation; and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-
immigrant that will not adversely affect the working condi-
tions of workers similarly employed.
(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute in the occupational classification at the place of em-
ployment.
(C) The employer, at the time of filing the attestation—

tion to employees in the occupational classification for
which nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) are sought.

cupational classification in which the workers will be em-

under this subsection is filed, at the employer’s principal place of
business or worksite, a copy of each such attestation (and such ac-
companying documents as are necessary).
(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile, on a current basis,

tations filed under this subsection. Such list shall include, with re-
spect to each attestation, the wage rate, number of aliens sought,
period of intended employment, and date of need.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall make such list available for pub-
lic examination in Washington, D.C.
(C) The Secretary of Labor shall review an attestation filed under

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) within 7 days of the date of the filing of the attes-
tation.
(3)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the re-
ceipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting the
failure of an employer to meet a condition specified in an attesta-
tion submitted under this subsection or misrepresentation by the
employer of material facts in such an attestation. Complaints may
be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bar-
gaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be con-
ducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresenta-
tion unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after
the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively. The Sec-
retary of Labor shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph
if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure or mis-
representation has occurred.
(B) Under the process described in subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary of Labor shall provide, within 30 days after the date a com-
plaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reason-
able basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (C).
If the Secretary of Labor determines that such a reasonable basis
exists, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such deter-
mination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing
on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, United
States Code, within 60 days after the date of the determination. If
such a hearing is requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a

for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1),
a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, or a
violation of clause (iv)—

(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$5,000 per violation as the Secretary of Labor determines to be
appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 2 years for aliens
to be employed by the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)
or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, in
the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer dis-
placed a United States worker employed by the employer within

plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an attestation under this subsection to require a nonimmigrant
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) to pay
a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date
agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of
Labor shall determine whether a required payment is a penalty
(and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.
(II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this
clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil monetary penalty
of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order
requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in

who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a full-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status due to a decision by the
employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the non-
immigrant’s lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the non-
immigrant full-time wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for
all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an

(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) for nonproductive time due to non-work-related
factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an
absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to
work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to nonimmigrants under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and United States
workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in
disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to
fail to offer to a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii), during the nonimmigrant’s period of au-
thorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including
the opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other
insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and
savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such
as stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the
same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the em-
ployer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage
level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph (1),
the Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for pay-
ment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply
with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty
under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject
an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years,
beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the Sec-
retary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a condi-
tion of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful misrepresentation
of material fact in an attestation. The authority of the Secretary of
Labor under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be subject
to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).
(F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:

normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location

where the work of the nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more
nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) by an employer, the employer is considered to
‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the employer
lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent
of the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or
are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially
equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the
same responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with
substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is
located in the same area of employment as the other job.
(C)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an em-
ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(D) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee
who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 207 of
this title, is granted asylum under section 208, or is an im-
migrant otherwise authorized, by this Act or by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, to be employed.
(t)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted
under section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I), or acquiring such status after ad-
mission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant status, an im-
migrant visa, or permanent residence under this Act until it is es-
tablished that such person has resided and been physically present
in the person’s country of nationality or last residence for an aggre-
gate of at least 2 years following departure from the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the require-
ment of such 2-year foreign residence abroad if the Secretary deter-
mines that—
(A) departure from the United States would impose excep-
tional hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse
or child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence); or

(B) CREDIBLE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED.—In acting on ap-
plications under this paragraph, the Attorney General

cation. The determination of what evidence is credible and
the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the
sole discretion of the Attorney General.
(b) An alien, admitted as an nonimmigrant under the provisions

tion 101(a)(27)(J) based upon circumstances that existed before the
date the alien was provided such special immigrant status.
(d)(1) If the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that an
application for nonimmigrant status under subparagraph (T) or (U)
of section 101(a)(15) filed for an alien in the United States sets
forth a prima facie case for approval, the Secretary may grant the
alien an administrative stay of a final order of removal under sec-
tion 241(c)(2) until—
(A) the application for nonimmigrant status under such sub-
paragraph (T) or (U) is approved; or
(B) there is a final administrative denial of the application
for such nonimmigrant status after the exhaustion of adminis-
trative appeals.

under this subsection shall not preclude the alien from applying for
a stay of removal, deferred action, or a continuance or abeyance of
removal proceedings under any other provision of the immigration
laws of the United States.
(3) During any period in which the administrative stay of re-
moval is in effect, the alien shall not be removed.
(4) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to limit the au-
thority of the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney Gen-
eral to grant a stay of removal or deportation in any case not de-
scribed in this subsection.

ney General shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance

237(a)(2) or 237(a)(4)(B).
(B) ENFORCEMENT BY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF A STATE.—
The attorney general of a State, or other authorized State
officer, alleging a violation of the detention requirement
under subparagraph (A) that harms such State or its resi-
dents shall have standing to bring an action against the
Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of such State or
the residents of such State in an appropriate district court
of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.
The court shall advance on the docket and expedite the
disposition of a civil action filed under this subparagraph
to the greatest extent practicable. For purposes of this sub-
paragraph, a State or its residents shall be considered to
have been harmed if the State or its residents experience
harm, including financial harm in excess of $100.

graph (2), the Attorney General may not remove an alien
who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is re-
leased from imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, pro-
bation, or possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is
not a reason to defer removal.
(B) EXCEPTION FOR REMOVAL OF NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS

accordance with applicable procedures under this Act be-
fore the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment—

LEGALLY REENTERING.—If the Attorney General finds that an
alien has reentered the United States illegally after having

nity or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be
detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be
subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).
(7) EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION.—No alien ordered removed
shall be eligible to receive authorization to be employed in the
United States unless the Attorney General makes a specific
finding that—

receive the alien, or
(B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or
contrary to the public interest.

granted voluntary departure under section 240B and who
is financially unable to depart at the alien’s own expense
and whose removal the Attorney General deems to be in
the best interest of the United States, the expense of such
removal may be paid from the appropriation for the en-
forcement of this Act.
(f) ALIENS REQUIRING PERSONAL CARE DURING REMOVAL.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—If the Attorney General believes that an
alien being removed requires personal care because of the
alien’s mental or physical condition, the Attorney General may
employ a suitable person for that purpose who shall accompany
and care for the alien until the alien arrives at the final des-
tination.
(2) COSTS.—The costs of providing the service described in
paragraph (1) shall be defrayed in the same manner as the ex-
pense of removing the accompanied alien is defrayed under
this section.
(g) PLACES OF DETENTION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Attorney General shall arrange for ap-
propriate places of detention for aliens detained pending re-
moval or a decision on removal. When United States Govern-
ment facilities are unavailable or facilities adapted or suitably
located for detention are unavailable for rental, the Attorney
General may expend from the appropriation ‘‘Immigration and
Naturalization Service—Salaries and Expenses’’, without re-
gard to section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5),
amounts necessary to acquire land and to acquire, build, re-
model, repair, and operate facilities (including living quarters
for immigration officers if not otherwise available) necessary
for detention.
(2) DETENTION FACILITIES OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATU-
RALIZATION SERVICE.—Prior to initiating any project for the
construction of any new detention facility for the Service, the
Commissioner shall consider the availability for purchase or
lease of any existing prison, jail, detention center, or other
comparable facility suitable for such use.
(h) STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section shall be
construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit
that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States
or its agencies or officers or any other person.
(i) INCARCERATION.—
(1) If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if appropriate,
a political subdivision of the State) exercising authority with

respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien
submits a written request to the Attorney General, the Attor-
ney General shall, as determined by the Attorney General—
(A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides
for compensation to the State or a political subdivision of
the State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incar-
ceration of the undocumented criminal alien; or
(B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the cus-
tody of the Federal Government and incarcerate the alien.
(2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the aver-
age cost of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State as
determined by the Attorney General.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘undocumented
criminal alien’’ means an alien who—
(A) has been convicted of a felony or two or more mis-
demeanors; and
(B)(i) entered the United States without inspection or at
any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney
General;
(ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation pro-
ceedings at the time he or she was taken into custody by
the State or a political subdivision of the State; or
(iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he
or she was taken into custody by the State or a political
subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the non-
immigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to
which it was changed under section 248, or to comply with
the conditions of any such status.
(4)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General
shall give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocu-
mented criminal aliens who have committed aggravated felo-
nies.
(B) The Attorney General shall ensure that undocumented
criminal aliens incarcerated in Federal facilities pursuant to
this subsection are held in facilities which provide a level of se-
curity appropriate to the crimes for which they were convicted.
(5) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this
subsection—
(A) $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;
(B) $850,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and
(C) $950,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008
through 2011.
(6) Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of
appropriations in paragraph (5) that are distributed to a State
or political subdivision of a State, including a municipality,
may be used only for correctional purposes.

The terrorist atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel on October
7th and the subsequent devastating war in the region have been
a colossal human catastrophe. We hope in the coming weeks that
a ceasefire can be negotiated so that we will see the return of all

the hostages to their families and an end to the gruesome violence
and suffering.
At markup, we agreed to advance this bill, which passed the
House with near-unanimous support last Congress. No one affili-
ated with Hamas, nor anyone involved in the horrific attacks of Oc-
tober 7th, should be admissible to the United States or eligible for
any immigration benefits, whatsoever. That is an obvious political
and moral statement.
This is, however, another missed opportunity for us to work
across the aisle in a bipartisan manner. As noted at our markup,
this is essentially a visa sanctions bill. For decades, we have relied
on pre-negotiated, bipartisan, and bicameral text for every visa
sanctions bill. H.R. 176 departs from this bipartisan practice by di-
rectly amending the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to im-
pose visa sanctions. To put into perspective just how unusual this
approach is, consider our response to the September 11th attacks.
In the aftermath of that national tragedy, we revised our immigra-
tion laws to overhaul significant parts of our immigration system,
and we created the Department of Homeland Security. Yet, even
then, we did not amend the INA to specifically reference the events
of September 11th, or to bar the individuals involved in the plan-
ning or commission of those attacks from entering or remaining in
the United States.
The reason for that is plain: the laws we have in place already
bar noncitizens who engage in terrorism or are involved with ter-
rorist organizations, from entering the United States. And for any
of those noncitizens who happen to be here, our laws allow us to
remove them and prevent them from obtaining any immigration
benefits. These laws were designed to apply broadly to any indi-
vidual or organization engaged in terrorism, without having to
specify them by reference to specific events and attacks.
Under sections 212(a)(3)(B) and 237(a)(4)(B) of the INA, any non-
citizen who has engaged in terrorist activity, provided material
support to terrorists, or is a member or representative of a terrorist
organization or a group that endorses or espouses terrorist activity,
is inadmissible to the United States and deportable. Hamas has
been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997. So, we al-
ready have the legal tools to keep any noncitizen involved with
Hamas, as well as any noncitizen who was involved in the horrific
attacks of October 7th out of this country or deport them if they
are already here.
The Committee’s standard visa sanctions language—which was
carefully crafted in collaboration with all four corners of the Judici-
ary Committees staff—would allow us to achieve the aims of this
legislation without departing from negotiated sanctions language
and amendingthe INA in an unprecedented and incongruous way.
Amending the INA to impose visa sanctions sets a dangerous
precedent where new statutory language becomes necessary every
time a new terrorist group emerges. This ad hoc pastiche approach
will lead to unintended consequences.
