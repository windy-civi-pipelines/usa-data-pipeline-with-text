117TH CONGRESS
Second Session— Legislative Action
On July 20, 2022, Representative Bobby Scott (D–VA) introduced
H.R. 8450, Healthy Meals, Healthy Kids Act, with Representative
Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) as an original cosponsor. The bill was
referred solely to the Committee on Education and Labor. On July
27, 2022, the Committee considered H.R. 8450 in legislative session
and reported it favorably, as amended, to the House of Representa-
tives by a recorded vote of 27–20. The Committee considered the
following amendments to H.R. 8450:

Section 4:
1. Representatives Lisa McClain (R–MI) and Russ Fulcher
(R–ID) offered—and withdrew—an amendment to ensure pota-
toes remain allowable as a vegetable under the programs.

Section 5:
2. Representative McClain offered an amendment to prohibit
all new changes from being enacted unless an independent
study is conducted to ensure the program won’t increase infla-
tion or the changes can be implemented once inflation drops to
2 percent. This amendment was defeated in a roll call vote of
19–27.

Section 6:
3. Representative Glenn Thompson (R–PA), along with Rep-
resentatives Elise Stefanik (R–NY), Fulcher, and Fred Keller

COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
For generations, milk has been recognized as one of the most nu-
tritious options to support a healthy, growing child. Students, par-
ents, school food service providers, and nutritionists all agree that
milk in school lunches is both wanted and needed. Until 2010,
milk, with its nine essential nutrients, was easily accessible in
school cafeterias and was readily available across all child nutrition
programs. Under the Obama administration, the first milk restric-
tions were levied on school meal programs, which the Biden admin-
istration subsequently perpetuated. In rejection of this bureaucratic
overreach, this bill restores nutritional choices that help our na-
tion’s students thrive and learn.
MILK FACED NEW REGULATIONS WITH THE HEALTHY,
HUNGER-FREE KIDS ACT OF 2010
Restrictions of milk choice began with the Obama-era Healthy,
Hunger-free Kids Act of 2010. While schools have been required to
serve meals consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) since the 1994
child nutrition reauthorization (P.L. 103–448), choice and flexibility
for school districts and their students were decimated when the
Obama administration decided to wage war against milk. The
Obama-era standards required one specific food item—milk, and
milk alone—to be consistent with the DGA, unfairly applying
standards regulating a meal to an individual food item. This re-
sulted in barring the inclusion of whole (3.25 percent) and reduced-
fat (2 percent) milk in school lunches. Consequently, beginning
with School Year (SY) 2012–2013, schools were compelled to serve
either fat-free and low-fat (1 percent) unflavored milk or fat-free
flavored milk.
Many schools experienced challenges implementing these
changes and reported issues with student acceptance of food. Be-
ginning in FY 2015, Congress, through the appropriations process,
enacted provisions that loosened these milk requirements. In De-
cember 2018, USDA published a final rule (effective starting in SY

2019–2020) permitting school food authorities to once again offer
flavored, low-fat (1 percent) milk as a part of school meals and re-
quiring unflavored milk to be offered alongside those offerings.
However, this effort to restore some flexibility was not enough to
satiate students and retain program participation. USDA’s own
data show a steady decline in students eating school meals since
the enactment of changes made in the 2010 reauthorization.1 This
has led to a pattern of underconsumption of dairy among school
students. According to the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Com-
mittee report, between 68 and 76.2 percent of school age males and
between 77.4 and 94.3 percent of school age females fail to meet
recommended levels of dairy consumption.
RECENT REGULATIONS ARE PERPETUATING THIS HEALTH CONCERN
Biden administration-era regulations only further discourage stu-
dents from consuming the recommended levels of milk and have in-
tensified the health concerns consequent on the decline of student
participation in school meal programs. By continuing to impose
strict top-down dietary regulations for school meals, these bureau-
crats further harm student health and do little to support the tire-
less efforts of food service workers. The April 2024, final rule under
the Biden administration USDA subjects flavored milk to a new
added sugars limit.2 Further, the rule’s continued exclusion of
whole milk from school meal programs is unsupported by current
research: new evidence-based nutrition recommendations released
in January 2025, and developed by experts from leading health or-
ganizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, follow
research that demonstrates full fat dairy is associated with a neu-
tral or lower risk of heart disease and obesity rather than being the
alarming cause of such health concerns.
Washington bureaucrats’ restrictive meddling in school nutrition
has resulted in distaste for school meals. Limited milk choices do
not satiate students, instead driving them away from the school
lunch program. At a press conference where then-USDA Secretary
Vilsack announced USDA meal regulation changes, one school dis-
trict food service coordinator said, ‘‘We fear that new regulations
will push the neediest students away from the programs.’’3
There is every reason to include all popular milk options, from
whole milk to reduced-fat milks, in school lunches, since we know
they have the same nutritional benefits. Therefore, H.R. 649 will
expand milk options for school lunches to include flavored and
unflavored whole and reduced-fat milks. While recent reauthoriza-
tions and USDA regulations have hampered school food authorities
with burdensome requirements and limited options, H.R. 649 al-
lows schools to make choices that are right for the children they
serve every day.
CONCLUSION
Politicization of education must stop. By continuing to wage war
on milk, Washington bureaucrats attempt to dictate yet another as-
pect of the school day through administrative regulations. In oppo-

sition to this overreach, the Committee is taking action to safe-
guard the rights of parents and students. H.R. 649 expands milk
access and variety in school lunches, giving parents and school food
service providers the simplicity and flexibility they need to feed
students a nutritious beverage. Instead of continuing to restrict
such a nutrient-dense food, the Committee supports making milk
fully available to students to support their health and education.
Much work is needed to improve child nutrition, and H.R. 649 puts
the nation’s students on a healthier path forward.

EXPLANATION OF AMENDMENTS
The amendments, including the amendment in the nature of a
substitute, are explained in the body of this report.
APPLICATION OF LAW TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

Section 17:
Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104–1 requires a description of
the application of this bill to the legislative branch. H.R. 649 takes
important steps to allow schools that participate in the school
lunch program under such Act to serve whole milk. H.R. 649 ap-
plies solely to the National School Lunch Program and therefore
does not apply to the Legislative Branch.
UNFUNDED MANDATE STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344 (as amended
by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee traditionally adopts as its own
the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 649 is to allow schools
that participate in the National School Lunch Program to serve
whole milk.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 649 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 649: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 649 would allow schools that participate in the National
School Lunch Program to serve whole, reduced-fat, or low-fat milk
that is flavored or unflavored to students. Under current law,
schools must offer milk that is fat-free or low-fat and may only
offer flavored milk if it is fat-free or low-fat. The bill would exclude
the saturated fat in milk from calculations of the amount of such
fat that is allowed under the program for an average meal.
The bill also would prohibit participating schools from pur-
chasing or offering milk produced by China state-owned enter-
prises.
CBO expects that enacting the bill would not affect reimburse-
ment rates or participation in the program, so there would be no
effect on the cost of benefits. CBO estimates that the administra-
tive costs to update the dietary regulations would be insignificant;
any spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Susan Beyer. The esti-
mate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 649. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 649, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025, removes
the requirement that milk served in the National School Lunch
Program (NSLP) be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (DGAs), a federally established, evidence-based, com-
prehensive set of recommendations on nutrition. In making nutri-
tion policy, it is important to maintain the unbiased process to en-
sure that children receive the most nutritious meals possible, free
from political interests and interference. H.R. 649 sets a precedent
of Congress legislating the foods and beverages served in schools,
even if such legislation would contradict evidence-based rec-
ommendations. Further, H.R. 649 runs contrary to the Committee’s
longstanding bipartisan practice of not considering standalone child
nutrition legislation outside of a full reauthorization that com-
prehensively invests in and improves federal child nutrition pro-
grams.
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE VITAL PROGRAMS
THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED
Federal child nutrition programs such as NSLP provide many
school-aged children with up to half of their daily calories.1 Collec-
tively, these programs ensure nutrition security for our nation’s in-
fants and children during a critical period of growth and develop-
ment and provide nutritious meals and snacks in a variety of set-
tings, such as schools, child care centers, and summer camps.
These programs are authorized in two federal statutes: the Richard
B. Russell National School Lunch Act2 and the Child Nutrition Act
of 1966.3 The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act was
first signed into law by President Truman in 1946 to bolster na-
tional security threatened by rampant malnutrition among military
recruits.4 School meals have been associated with increased focus
in the classroom, improved educational outcomes, and reduced food
insecurity5 and are especially impactful for children from low-in-
come and food insecure families.6 According to the most recent cen-

sus survey data, nearly 18 percent of households with children
under 18 years old struggled with food insecurity in 2023.7 This
data is troubling considering that Republicans are reportedly enter-
taining significant cuts to child nutrition programs through the
budget reconciliation process8—a measure that will be used to ex-
tend tax cuts to benefit corporations and the wealthy.9 For over 75
years, child nutrition programs have been instrumental in overall
health and school readiness, which is why it is imperative that
these programs be protected.10
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS SUPPORT
CHILDREN’S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research has shown that nutrition plays a key role in the health
and academic outcomes of children,11 making it vital that school
meals are as nutritious as possible. Strong nutrition standards for
foods and beverages provided through federal child nutrition pro-
grams are especially important for improving health equity. Black,
Hispanic, and American Indian and Alaska Native communities
are often disproportionally impacted by food insecurity and these
communities often face diet-related chronic diseases at a dispropor-
tionate rate.12 Additionally, participation rates in NSLP are higher
among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black students compared to non-
Hispanic white students and among students from lower income
households compared to those from higher income households.13
Strong nutrition standards also have a demonstrated positive
health impact on children: the previous update to the school meal
patterns, more than a decade ago, led to increased consumption of
fruits, vegetables, and whole grain-rich foods, and reduced con-
sumption of saturated fat and sodium.14

Milk Can Provide Important Nutrition for Children
Milk is an important source of protein and contains carbo-
hydrates and fats.15 Along with macronutrients important for chil-
dren’s growth and development, milk is also a source of calcium
and is fortified to provide vitamin D.16 The most recent DGAs, for
2020–2025, state that healthy dietary patterns include fat-free and
low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, and cheese for children two years and
older.17 The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s 2025 Sci-
entific Report’s findings supported maintaining the existing rec-
ommendations for fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk.18 Recognizing the
nutritional benefits that milk can provide, regulation requires that
unflavored milk be offered at each school meal service.19 While the
meal program actively promotes milk consumption, researchers
have found that national dairy fluid milk consumption declines
with age; this decline is part of a longer-term decline that has been
occurring since 1975, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) began tracking annual consumption of milk, cheese, and
other dairy products.20 Additionally, milk consumption can vary
across racial and ethnic groups as Boston Children’s Hospital found
that 80 percent of all African Americans and Native Americans and
over 90 percent of Asian Americans are unable to process lactose.21
CURRENT STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF
NUTRITION STANDARDS RELIES ON SCIENCE
Nutritional requirements are not outlined in statute, and current
law requires the USDA Secretary to provide ‘‘minimum nutritional
requirements’’ founded on ‘‘tested nutritional research.’’22 Current
law also requires school meals to be ‘‘consistent with the goals’’ of
the latest dietary guidelines.23 Every five years, the DGAs are
formed through an advisory committee of experts appointed to re-
view scientific evidence on nutrition and health and consider public
comments in the establishment of the DGAs.24 Since the 1980s, the
DGAs have provided nutritional and dietary information for the
Public Interest (Apr. 24, 2024), https://www.cspinet.org/cspi-news/school-meals-get-upgrade-
what-expect-going-forward.

ages 2 through 8 (based on caloric intake of 1,000–2,000 calories per day); and 3 cups or the
equivalent per day of dairy for children ages 9 through 18 (based on caloric intake of 1,400–
3,200 calories per day). Also, beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that con-
tribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the pri-
mary beverages consumed.

general public and for federal food, nutrition, and health programs
guided by the most current scientific and medical knowledge.25
USDA establishes detailed nutritional requirements for school meal
programs through regulations on a periodic basis consistent with
the most recent DGAs.26 Specific nutrition standards for foods and
beverages served in the NSLP are not written in statute to specifi-
cally allow for adaptations in line with the latest science and ex-
pert recommendations. The framework also ensures that standards
are developed apolitically and are largely independent of the legis-
lative branch.
Whole milk and reduced-fat (2%) milk (flavored or unflavored)
have not been permitted in school meals for over a decade. In 2012,
updated regulations requiring school food authorities (SFAs) to
offer unflavored low-fat (1%) and flavored fat-free milk were issued
under the Obama Administration pursuant to the bipartisan
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.27 Congressional and admin-
istrative actions resulted in low-fat (1%) flavored milk being avail-
able beginning in School Year (SY) 2017–2018.28
The Biden Administration worked to improve the health and nu-
trition of students by promulgating regulations to align school meal
standards with the goals of the latest DGAs. On April 25, 2024,
USDA published the Child Nutrition Programs: Meal Patterns Con-
sistent with the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans final
rule.29 Under the final rule, flavored non-fat and low-fat milk (1%)
are subject to new added sugar limits of no more than 10 grams
of added sugar per 8 fluid ounces for flavored milk served in ele-
mentary schools and no more than 15 grams of added sugar per 12
fluid ounces for flavored milk served in middle and high schools,
effective SY 2025–2026.30 Additionally, the final rule requires
schools to limit added sugars to less than 10 percent of total cal-
ories per week in the school breakfast and lunch programs starting
in SY 2027–2028.31 This guidance was based on research showing
added sugars can increase risk factors associated with cardio-

cal Year (FY) 2021 appropriations rider. Subsequently, a 2022 final transitional rule allowed
schools to offer low-fat flavored milk with further rulemaking expected for subsequent years. In
March 2024, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 included a provision requiring the up-

vascular disease.32 With milk being the leading source of added
sugars in school meal programs, this Biden-era guidance is a step
toward addressing the health concerns related to the consumption
of added sugars.33
H.R. 649 MOVES AWAY FROM UNBIASED,
SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS
H.R. 649 amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch
Act to allow for flavored and unflavored whole, reduced-fat (2%),
low-fat (1%), and fat-free fluid milk as well as lactose-free fluid
milk to be offered as part of a reimbursable meal in schools
through the NSLP. As described above, currently, schools partici-
pating in the NSLP are allowed to offer unflavored or flavored low-
fat milk (1%) and/or fat-free milk.
H.R. 649 makes milk available in schools regardless of fat or
added sugar content, eroding the Biden Administration’s final rule
updating nutrition standards to align with the most recent DGAs.
Further, the bill excludes milk fat from classification as saturated
fat for the purpose of measuring compliance with the allowable
school nutrition saturated fat standards. Current regulations limit
average saturated fat content of meals offered over a five-day
school week to less than 10 percent of total calories, and the satu-
rated fat of whole and 2% milk exceeds that limit.34 The bill also
makes a few smaller changes that are unobjectionable. H.R. 649 re-
quires a written statement from a licensed physician, parent, or
legal guardian identifying the student’s disability for fluid milk
substitution; the bill also prohibits schools participating in the
school lunch program from purchasing or offering milk produced by
China state-owned enterprises.35
The bill is opposed by over 30 organizations including the Na-
tional WIC Association, the American Public Health Association,
the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medi-
cine, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, and
the American Heart Association.36 These organizations make it
clear that ‘‘[s]ingling out milk—in this case, whole and reduced-fat

milk—to be exempt from the recommendations of the Dietary
Guidelines is a slippery slope for allowing special interests to carve
out exemptions in school meal program rules.’’37
H.R. 649 COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT CHILDREN’S HEALTH
H.R. 649 fails to acknowledge that milk is a top source of satu-
rated fat in American diets.38 The American Heart Association con-
sistently agrees that saturated fat raises ‘‘bad’’ cholesterol, a
known risk factor for heart disease.39 Additionally, according to the
National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, one in five
children and adolescents ages 6 to 19 have ‘‘at least one abnormal
cholesterol measure.’’40 The DGAs, along with the American Heart
Association41 and the American Academy of Pediatrics,42 rec-
ommend switching to low-fat (1%) and fat-free milk for children
two years old and older. Additionally, fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk
both provide slightly more nutrients than whole milk and reduced
fat milk (2%), but with lower fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and cal-
ories.43 The American Heart Association,44 the American College of
Cardiology,45 and the World Health Organization46 are all in
agreement that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats re-
duces the risk of heart disease in both children and adults.
The Committee is also very concerned by the hyper-politicization
of public health and the Trump Administration’s actions that have
taken aim at public health research and other science-based proc-
esses.47 Troublingly, Project 2025 calls for the Administration to
work with Congress to repeal or at the very minimum significantly

reform the DGAs,48 citing unsubstantiated claims regarding the
politicization of a process that has long been considered evidence-
based and apolitical. Committee Democrats will work tirelessly to
protect the DGA process and to ensure that science guides the na-
tion’s public health response.
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 649
Committee Democrats did not offer any amendments during the
markup of H.R. 649.
CONCLUSION
Nutrition standards for school meal programs are best left to evi-
dence-based recommendations from nutrition and public health ex-
perts. Instead of taking a comprehensive approach to improving
federal child nutrition programs, H.R. 649 dismisses the apolitical
and evidence-based nutrition science that we depend on to improve
the health of school-aged children across the country. Federal child
nutrition programs have provided children and families with vital
nutrition support for decades, and any proposed cuts to these pro-
grams or erosion of meal standards undermines the original intent
of federal statute. For the reasons stated above, a majority of Com-
mittee Democrats opposed H.R. 649 when the Committee on Edu-
cation and Workforce considered it on February 12, 2025. We urge
the House of Representatives to do the same.

COMMITTEE ACTION
117TH CONGRESS
Second Session— Legislative Action
On July 20, 2022, Representative Bobby Scott (D–VA) introduced
H.R. 8450, Healthy Meals, Healthy Kids Act, with Representative
Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) as an original cosponsor. The bill was
referred solely to the Committee on Education and Labor. On July
27, 2022, the Committee considered H.R. 8450 in legislative session
and reported it favorably, as amended, to the House of Representa-
tives by a recorded vote of 27–20. The Committee considered the
following amendments to H.R. 8450:
1. Representatives Lisa McClain (R–MI) and Russ Fulcher
(R–ID) offered—and withdrew—an amendment to ensure pota-
toes remain allowable as a vegetable under the programs.
2. Representative McClain offered an amendment to prohibit
all new changes from being enacted unless an independent
study is conducted to ensure the program won’t increase infla-
tion or the changes can be implemented once inflation drops to
2 percent. This amendment was defeated in a roll call vote of
19–27.
3. Representative Glenn Thompson (R–PA), along with Rep-
resentatives Elise Stefanik (R–NY), Fulcher, and Fred Keller
(R–PA), offered an amendment to address whole milk and choc-
olate milk in school meals and allow greater choice of milk in
the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program. This amend-
ment was defeated by a voice vote.
4. Representative Stefanik offered an amendment that would
address the infant formula contracting requirements in WIC by
requiring two manufacturers per state or state consortia. While
it received bipartisan support, the amendment failed by roll
call vote of 20–24.
5. Representatives Bob Good (R–VA) and Mary Miller (R–IL)
offered—and withdrew—an amendment to require nutrition
regulations promulgated under the bill to make grain-based
desserts eligible for reimbursement.
6. Representative Tim Walberg (R–MI) offered an amend-
ment to ensure food substitutions for religious needs are al-
lowed. This amendment was adopted.

7. Representatives Miller and Good offered an amendment to
eliminate the change the Democrats made to the definition of
woman and therefore to re-define pregnant woman,
breastfeeding woman, and postpartum woman as a woman.
This amendment was defeated on a party line vote of 20–25.
8. Representative Glenn Grothman (R–WI) and Diana
Harshbarger (R–TN) offered an amendment to prohibit en-
forcement of the May 5, 2022, memo on Title IX enforcement
as it relates to child nutrition programs. This amendment was
defeated by a roll call vote of 20–25.
9. Representative Harshbarger offered an amendment to re-
quire a feasibility study before issuing new regulations. This
study would determine the cost increase these potential stand-
ards would impose, the timeline for availability of food meeting
these standards, and the increase to plate waste these stand-
ards might cause. This amendment was also defeated on a
party line vote.

119TH CONGRESS
First Session—Hearing
On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and Work-
force held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’ The
purpose of the hearing was to examine the state of American edu-
cation, including K–12 education, postsecondary education, and
workforce development. During the hearing, Representative
Thompson referenced research that demonstrates that student
health contributes to academic success, and witness Mrs. Nicole
Neily testified that allowing schools the flexibility to provide stu-
dents with a whole milk option would be beneficial for student
health. Mrs. Neily agreed with Representative Thompson’s con-

1. Representative Thompson offered an Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute (ANS) that provided minor technical
changes to help ensure our children’s food service workers have
the flexibility they need in serving students milk at lunch
meals. The amendment was adopted by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
For generations, milk has been recognized as one of the most nu-
tritious options to support a healthy, growing child. Students, par-
ents, school food service providers, and nutritionists all agree that
milk in school lunches is both wanted and needed. Until 2010,
milk, with its nine essential nutrients, was easily accessible in
school cafeterias and was readily available across all child nutrition
programs. Under the Obama administration, the first milk restric-
tions were levied on school meal programs, which the Biden admin-
istration subsequently perpetuated. In rejection of this bureaucratic
overreach, this bill restores nutritional choices that help our na-
tion’s students thrive and learn.
MILK FACED NEW REGULATIONS WITH THE HEALTHY,
HUNGER-FREE KIDS ACT OF 2010
Restrictions of milk choice began with the Obama-era Healthy,
Hunger-free Kids Act of 2010. While schools have been required to
serve meals consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) since the 1994
child nutrition reauthorization (P.L. 103–448), choice and flexibility
for school districts and their students were decimated when the
Obama administration decided to wage war against milk. The
Obama-era standards required one specific food item—milk, and
milk alone—to be consistent with the DGA, unfairly applying
standards regulating a meal to an individual food item. This re-
sulted in barring the inclusion of whole (3.25 percent) and reduced-
fat (2 percent) milk in school lunches. Consequently, beginning
with School Year (SY) 2012–2013, schools were compelled to serve
either fat-free and low-fat (1 percent) unflavored milk or fat-free
flavored milk.
Many schools experienced challenges implementing these
changes and reported issues with student acceptance of food. Be-
ginning in FY 2015, Congress, through the appropriations process,
enacted provisions that loosened these milk requirements. In De-
cember 2018, USDA published a final rule (effective starting in SY

2019–2020) permitting school food authorities to once again offer
flavored, low-fat (1 percent) milk as a part of school meals and re-
quiring unflavored milk to be offered alongside those offerings.
However, this effort to restore some flexibility was not enough to
satiate students and retain program participation. USDA’s own
data show a steady decline in students eating school meals since
the enactment of changes made in the 2010 reauthorization.1 This
has led to a pattern of underconsumption of dairy among school
students. According to the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Com-
mittee report, between 68 and 76.2 percent of school age males and
between 77.4 and 94.3 percent of school age females fail to meet
recommended levels of dairy consumption.
RECENT REGULATIONS ARE PERPETUATING THIS HEALTH CONCERN
Biden administration-era regulations only further discourage stu-
dents from consuming the recommended levels of milk and have in-
tensified the health concerns consequent on the decline of student
participation in school meal programs. By continuing to impose
strict top-down dietary regulations for school meals, these bureau-
crats further harm student health and do little to support the tire-
less efforts of food service workers. The April 2024, final rule under
the Biden administration USDA subjects flavored milk to a new
added sugars limit.2 Further, the rule’s continued exclusion of
whole milk from school meal programs is unsupported by current
research: new evidence-based nutrition recommendations released
in January 2025, and developed by experts from leading health or-
ganizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, follow
research that demonstrates full fat dairy is associated with a neu-
tral or lower risk of heart disease and obesity rather than being the
alarming cause of such health concerns.
Washington bureaucrats’ restrictive meddling in school nutrition
has resulted in distaste for school meals. Limited milk choices do
not satiate students, instead driving them away from the school
lunch program. At a press conference where then-USDA Secretary
Vilsack announced USDA meal regulation changes, one school dis-
trict food service coordinator said, ‘‘We fear that new regulations
will push the neediest students away from the programs.’’3
There is every reason to include all popular milk options, from
whole milk to reduced-fat milks, in school lunches, since we know
they have the same nutritional benefits. Therefore, H.R. 649 will
expand milk options for school lunches to include flavored and
unflavored whole and reduced-fat milks. While recent reauthoriza-
tions and USDA regulations have hampered school food authorities
with burdensome requirements and limited options, H.R. 649 al-
lows schools to make choices that are right for the children they
serve every day.
CONCLUSION
Politicization of education must stop. By continuing to wage war
on milk, Washington bureaucrats attempt to dictate yet another as-
pect of the school day through administrative regulations. In oppo-

sition to this overreach, the Committee is taking action to safe-
guard the rights of parents and students. H.R. 649 expands milk
access and variety in school lunches, giving parents and school food
service providers the simplicity and flexibility they need to feed
students a nutritious beverage. Instead of continuing to restrict
such a nutrient-dense food, the Committee supports making milk
fully available to students to support their health and education.
Much work is needed to improve child nutrition, and H.R. 649 puts
the nation’s students on a healthier path forward.
H.R. 649 SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY
Section 1. Short title
• Names the bill as the ‘‘Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of
2025’’.
Section 2.
• Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to:
» Offer students a variety of fluid milk options without re-
striction by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
» Permit schools to serve students flavored and unflavored
whole, reduced-fat, low- fat, fat-free, and lactose-free fluid
milk.
» Exempt milk fat from being considered saturated fat for
purposes of compliance.
» Require schools to serve a substitute to fluid milk when
a student’s disability, as documented by a parent or legal
guardian, restricts his or her diet.
» Prohibit the purchasing or offering of milk produced by a
China state-owned enterprise.
» Prohibit the USDA secretary from rulemaking in opposi-
tion to the milk provisions described.
EXPLANATION OF AMENDMENTS
The amendments, including the amendment in the nature of a
substitute, are explained in the body of this report.
APPLICATION OF LAW TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104–1 requires a description of
the application of this bill to the legislative branch. H.R. 649 takes
important steps to allow schools that participate in the school
lunch program under such Act to serve whole milk. H.R. 649 ap-
plies solely to the National School Lunch Program and therefore
does not apply to the Legislative Branch.
UNFUNDED MANDATE STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344 (as amended
by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee traditionally adopts as its own
the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 649 is to allow schools
that participate in the National School Lunch Program to serve
whole milk.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 649 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 649: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 649 would allow schools that participate in the National
School Lunch Program to serve whole, reduced-fat, or low-fat milk
that is flavored or unflavored to students. Under current law,
schools must offer milk that is fat-free or low-fat and may only
offer flavored milk if it is fat-free or low-fat. The bill would exclude
the saturated fat in milk from calculations of the amount of such
fat that is allowed under the program for an average meal.
The bill also would prohibit participating schools from pur-
chasing or offering milk produced by China state-owned enter-
prises.
CBO expects that enacting the bill would not affect reimburse-
ment rates or participation in the program, so there would be no
effect on the cost of benefits. CBO estimates that the administra-
tive costs to update the dietary regulations would be insignificant;
any spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Susan Beyer. The esti-
mate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 649. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

(4) PROVISION OF INFORMATION.—
(A) GUIDANCE.—Prior to the beginning of the school year
beginning July 2004, the Secretary shall issue guidance to
States and school food authorities to increase the consump-
tion of foods and food ingredients that are recommended
for increased serving consumption in the most recent Die-
tary Guidelines for Americans published under section 301
of the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research
Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5341).
(B) RULES.—Not later than 2 years after the date of en-
actment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall promulgate
rules, based on the most recent Dietary Guidelines for

sumption in the place where meals are served during meal
service.
(b)(1)(A) Not later than June 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary
shall prescribe income guidelines for determining eligibility for free
and reduced price lunches during the 12-month period beginning
July 1 of such fiscal year and ending June 30 of the following fiscal
year. The income guidelines for determining eligibility for free
lunches shall be 130 percent of the applicable family size income
levels contained in the nonfarm income poverty guidelines pre-
scribed by the Office of Management and Budget, as adjusted an-
nually in accordance with subparagraph (B). The income guidelines
for determining eligibility for reduced price lunches for any school
year shall be 185 percent of the applicable family size income levels
contained in the nonfarm income poverty guidelines prescribed by
the Office of Management and Budget, as adjusted annually in ac-
cordance with subparagraph (B). The Office of Management and
Budget guidelines shall be revised at annual intervals, or at any
shorter interval deemed feasible and desirable.
(B) The revision required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph
shall be made by multiplying—
(i) the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Man-
agement and Budget); by
(ii) the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index dur-
ing the annual or other interval immediately preceding the
time at which the adjustment is made.
Revisions under this subparagraph shall be made not more than 30
days after the date on which the consumer price index data re-
quired to compute the adjustment becomes available.
(2)(A) Following the determination by the Secretary under para-
graph (1) of this subsection of the income eligibility guidelines for
each school year, each State educational agency shall announce the
income eligibility guidelines, by family size, to be used by schools
in the State in making determinations of eligibility for free and re-
duced price lunches. Local school authorities shall, each year, pub-
licly announce the income eligibility guidelines for free and reduced
price lunches on or before the opening of school.
(B) APPLICATIONS AND DESCRIPTIVE MATERIAL.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—Applications for free and reduced price
lunches, in such form as the Secretary may prescribe or
approve, and any descriptive material, shall be distributed
to the parents or guardians of children in attendance at
the school, and shall contain only the family size income
levels for reduced price meal eligibility with the expla-
nation that households with incomes less than or equal to
these values would be eligible for free or reduced price
lunches.
(ii) INCOME ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES.—Forms and de-
scriptive material distributed in accordance with clause (i)
may not contain the income eligibility guidelines for free
lunches.
(iii) CONTENTS OF DESCRIPTIVE MATERIAL.—

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 649, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025, removes
the requirement that milk served in the National School Lunch
Program (NSLP) be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (DGAs), a federally established, evidence-based, com-
prehensive set of recommendations on nutrition. In making nutri-
tion policy, it is important to maintain the unbiased process to en-
sure that children receive the most nutritious meals possible, free
from political interests and interference. H.R. 649 sets a precedent
of Congress legislating the foods and beverages served in schools,
even if such legislation would contradict evidence-based rec-
ommendations. Further, H.R. 649 runs contrary to the Committee’s
longstanding bipartisan practice of not considering standalone child
nutrition legislation outside of a full reauthorization that com-
prehensively invests in and improves federal child nutrition pro-
grams.
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE VITAL PROGRAMS
THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED
Federal child nutrition programs such as NSLP provide many
school-aged children with up to half of their daily calories.1 Collec-
tively, these programs ensure nutrition security for our nation’s in-
fants and children during a critical period of growth and develop-
ment and provide nutritious meals and snacks in a variety of set-
tings, such as schools, child care centers, and summer camps.
These programs are authorized in two federal statutes: the Richard
B. Russell National School Lunch Act2 and the Child Nutrition Act
of 1966.3 The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act was
first signed into law by President Truman in 1946 to bolster na-
tional security threatened by rampant malnutrition among military
recruits.4 School meals have been associated with increased focus
in the classroom, improved educational outcomes, and reduced food
insecurity5 and are especially impactful for children from low-in-
come and food insecure families.6 According to the most recent cen-

sus survey data, nearly 18 percent of households with children
under 18 years old struggled with food insecurity in 2023.7 This
data is troubling considering that Republicans are reportedly enter-
taining significant cuts to child nutrition programs through the
budget reconciliation process8—a measure that will be used to ex-
tend tax cuts to benefit corporations and the wealthy.9 For over 75
years, child nutrition programs have been instrumental in overall
health and school readiness, which is why it is imperative that
these programs be protected.10
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS SUPPORT
CHILDREN’S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research has shown that nutrition plays a key role in the health
and academic outcomes of children,11 making it vital that school
meals are as nutritious as possible. Strong nutrition standards for
foods and beverages provided through federal child nutrition pro-
grams are especially important for improving health equity. Black,
Hispanic, and American Indian and Alaska Native communities
are often disproportionally impacted by food insecurity and these
communities often face diet-related chronic diseases at a dispropor-
tionate rate.12 Additionally, participation rates in NSLP are higher
among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black students compared to non-
Hispanic white students and among students from lower income
households compared to those from higher income households.13
Strong nutrition standards also have a demonstrated positive
health impact on children: the previous update to the school meal
patterns, more than a decade ago, led to increased consumption of
fruits, vegetables, and whole grain-rich foods, and reduced con-
sumption of saturated fat and sodium.14

Milk Can Provide Important Nutrition for Children
Milk is an important source of protein and contains carbo-
hydrates and fats.15 Along with macronutrients important for chil-
dren’s growth and development, milk is also a source of calcium
and is fortified to provide vitamin D.16 The most recent DGAs, for
2020–2025, state that healthy dietary patterns include fat-free and
low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, and cheese for children two years and
older.17 The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s 2025 Sci-
entific Report’s findings supported maintaining the existing rec-
ommendations for fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk.18 Recognizing the
nutritional benefits that milk can provide, regulation requires that
unflavored milk be offered at each school meal service.19 While the
meal program actively promotes milk consumption, researchers
have found that national dairy fluid milk consumption declines
with age; this decline is part of a longer-term decline that has been
occurring since 1975, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) began tracking annual consumption of milk, cheese, and
other dairy products.20 Additionally, milk consumption can vary
across racial and ethnic groups as Boston Children’s Hospital found
that 80 percent of all African Americans and Native Americans and
over 90 percent of Asian Americans are unable to process lactose.21
CURRENT STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF
NUTRITION STANDARDS RELIES ON SCIENCE
Nutritional requirements are not outlined in statute, and current
law requires the USDA Secretary to provide ‘‘minimum nutritional
requirements’’ founded on ‘‘tested nutritional research.’’22 Current
law also requires school meals to be ‘‘consistent with the goals’’ of
the latest dietary guidelines.23 Every five years, the DGAs are
formed through an advisory committee of experts appointed to re-
view scientific evidence on nutrition and health and consider public
comments in the establishment of the DGAs.24 Since the 1980s, the
DGAs have provided nutritional and dietary information for the
Public Interest (Apr. 24, 2024), https://www.cspinet.org/cspi-news/school-meals-get-upgrade-

equivalent per day of dairy for children ages 9 through 18 (based on caloric intake of 1,400–

general public and for federal food, nutrition, and health programs
guided by the most current scientific and medical knowledge.25
USDA establishes detailed nutritional requirements for school meal
programs through regulations on a periodic basis consistent with
the most recent DGAs.26 Specific nutrition standards for foods and
beverages served in the NSLP are not written in statute to specifi-
cally allow for adaptations in line with the latest science and ex-
pert recommendations. The framework also ensures that standards
are developed apolitically and are largely independent of the legis-
lative branch.
Whole milk and reduced-fat (2%) milk (flavored or unflavored)
have not been permitted in school meals for over a decade. In 2012,
updated regulations requiring school food authorities (SFAs) to
offer unflavored low-fat (1%) and flavored fat-free milk were issued
under the Obama Administration pursuant to the bipartisan
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.27 Congressional and admin-
istrative actions resulted in low-fat (1%) flavored milk being avail-
able beginning in School Year (SY) 2017–2018.28
The Biden Administration worked to improve the health and nu-
trition of students by promulgating regulations to align school meal
standards with the goals of the latest DGAs. On April 25, 2024,
USDA published the Child Nutrition Programs: Meal Patterns Con-
sistent with the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans final
rule.29 Under the final rule, flavored non-fat and low-fat milk (1%)
are subject to new added sugar limits of no more than 10 grams
of added sugar per 8 fluid ounces for flavored milk served in ele-
mentary schools and no more than 15 grams of added sugar per 12
fluid ounces for flavored milk served in middle and high schools,
effective SY 2025–2026.30 Additionally, the final rule requires
schools to limit added sugars to less than 10 percent of total cal-
ories per week in the school breakfast and lunch programs starting
in SY 2027–2028.31 This guidance was based on research showing
added sugars can increase risk factors associated with cardio-

cal Year (FY) 2021 appropriations rider. Subsequently, a 2022 final transitional rule allowed
schools to offer low-fat flavored milk with further rulemaking expected for subsequent years. In
March 2024, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 included a provision requiring the up-

vascular disease.32 With milk being the leading source of added
sugars in school meal programs, this Biden-era guidance is a step
toward addressing the health concerns related to the consumption
of added sugars.33
H.R. 649 MOVES AWAY FROM UNBIASED,
SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS
H.R. 649 amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch
Act to allow for flavored and unflavored whole, reduced-fat (2%),
low-fat (1%), and fat-free fluid milk as well as lactose-free fluid
milk to be offered as part of a reimbursable meal in schools
through the NSLP. As described above, currently, schools partici-
pating in the NSLP are allowed to offer unflavored or flavored low-
fat milk (1%) and/or fat-free milk.
H.R. 649 makes milk available in schools regardless of fat or
added sugar content, eroding the Biden Administration’s final rule
updating nutrition standards to align with the most recent DGAs.
Further, the bill excludes milk fat from classification as saturated
fat for the purpose of measuring compliance with the allowable
school nutrition saturated fat standards. Current regulations limit
average saturated fat content of meals offered over a five-day
school week to less than 10 percent of total calories, and the satu-
rated fat of whole and 2% milk exceeds that limit.34 The bill also
makes a few smaller changes that are unobjectionable. H.R. 649 re-
quires a written statement from a licensed physician, parent, or
legal guardian identifying the student’s disability for fluid milk
substitution; the bill also prohibits schools participating in the
school lunch program from purchasing or offering milk produced by
China state-owned enterprises.35
The bill is opposed by over 30 organizations including the Na-
tional WIC Association, the American Public Health Association,
the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medi-
cine, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, and
the American Heart Association.36 These organizations make it

milk—to be exempt from the recommendations of the Dietary
Guidelines is a slippery slope for allowing special interests to carve
out exemptions in school meal program rules.’’37
H.R. 649 COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT CHILDREN’S HEALTH
H.R. 649 fails to acknowledge that milk is a top source of satu-
rated fat in American diets.38 The American Heart Association con-
sistently agrees that saturated fat raises ‘‘bad’’ cholesterol, a
known risk factor for heart disease.39 Additionally, according to the
National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, one in five
children and adolescents ages 6 to 19 have ‘‘at least one abnormal
cholesterol measure.’’40 The DGAs, along with the American Heart
Association41 and the American Academy of Pediatrics,42 rec-
ommend switching to low-fat (1%) and fat-free milk for children
two years old and older. Additionally, fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk
both provide slightly more nutrients than whole milk and reduced
fat milk (2%), but with lower fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and cal-
ories.43 The American Heart Association,44 the American College of
Cardiology,45 and the World Health Organization46 are all in
agreement that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats re-
duces the risk of heart disease in both children and adults.
The Committee is also very concerned by the hyper-politicization
of public health and the Trump Administration’s actions that have
taken aim at public health research and other science-based proc-
esses.47 Troublingly, Project 2025 calls for the Administration to
work with Congress to repeal or at the very minimum significantly

reform the DGAs,48 citing unsubstantiated claims regarding the
politicization of a process that has long been considered evidence-
based and apolitical. Committee Democrats will work tirelessly to
protect the DGA process and to ensure that science guides the na-

DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 649
Committee Democrats did not offer any amendments during the
markup of H.R. 649.
CONCLUSION
Nutrition standards for school meal programs are best left to evi-
dence-based recommendations from nutrition and public health ex-
perts. Instead of taking a comprehensive approach to improving
federal child nutrition programs, H.R. 649 dismisses the apolitical
and evidence-based nutrition science that we depend on to improve
the health of school-aged children across the country. Federal child
nutrition programs have provided children and families with vital
nutrition support for decades, and any proposed cuts to these pro-
grams or erosion of meal standards undermines the original intent
of federal statute. For the reasons stated above, a majority of Com-
mittee Democrats opposed H.R. 649 when the Committee on Edu-
cation and Workforce considered it on February 12, 2025. We urge
the House of Representatives to do the same.
