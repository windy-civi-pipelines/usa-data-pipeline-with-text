sumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a mandatory con-
sumer product safety standard with respect to retractable awnings.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Motorized awnings pose a known hazard to the public, with
about 270,000 units being subject to a recall by the manufacturer
facilitated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in
August of 2019.1 The hazard involved soft vinyl awning covers en-
closing a freestanding motorized retractable awning distributed be-
tween June 1999 and January 2019.2 This product had 14 reports
of incidents, including one report of a death and six injuries.3 The
death involved a 73-year-old man who died after falling from a lad-
der over an elevated porch when the motorized awning opened un-
expectedly and struck him while removing the tie-downs.4
There is currently no voluntary standard for motorized awnings,
and the recall only covered one manufacturer of the products. This
legislation would require the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Com-
mission to promulgate a rule and regulations for such home
awnings.
