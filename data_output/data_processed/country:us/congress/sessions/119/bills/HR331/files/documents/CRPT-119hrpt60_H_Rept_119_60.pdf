PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 331 is to amend the Aquifer Recharge Flexi-
bility Act to clarify a provision relating to conveyances for aquifer
recharge purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 331, as amended, would amend the Aquifer Recharge Flexi-
bility Act (P.L. 116–260) to allow holders of an existing right-of-
way (ROW) to utilize that grant for the purposes of aquifer re-
charge without further authorization from the Secretary of the In-
terior. The Aquifer Recharge Flexibility Act was enacted in 2020 to
facilitate aquifer recharge programs using existing federally owned
irrigation canals and ditches on lands owned by the U.S. Bureau
of Land Management.
H.R. 331, as amended, also clarifies that this use shall not be
considered an expansion or modification and ensures that the in-
tent of the current law can be fully implemented. The holder of the
right-of-way, easement, permit, or other authorization is required
to provide 30 days’ notice to the Bureau of Land Management iden-
tifying what entity is intending to transfer water for aquifer re-
charge, identifying the existing right-of-way, easement, permit, or
other authorization, providing details on the intended use and

scope for the purpose of aquifer recharge, and providing a copy of
the agreement between the entities.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 331 was introduced on January 13, 2025, by Rep. Russ
Fulcher (R–ID). The bill was referred to the Committee on Natural
Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee on
Water, Wildlife and Fisheries. On January 23, 2025, the Sub-
committee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held a hearing on the
bill. On February 12, 2025, the Committee on Natural Resources
met to consider the bill. The Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and
Fisheries was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 331 by
unanimous consent. Chairman Bruce Westerman (R–AR) offered an
amendment designated Westerman #1. The amendment was agreed
to by unanimous consent. The bill, as amended, was ordered favor-
ably reported to the House of Representatives by unanimous con-
sent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing by the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held on
January 23, 2025.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Conveyance for aquifer recharge purposes
Section 1, as amended, amends the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility
Act to allow for the holder of an existing water right, acting for
themselves or on behalf of another entity the ability to use the ex-
isting right-of-way, easement, permit, or other authorization for the
purpose of aquifer recharge without requiring additional authoriza-
tion from the Secretary of the Interior.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.
COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XIII AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
ACT
1. Cost of Legislation and the Congressional Budget Act. With re-
spect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) and (3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and sections 308(a) and
402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has
received the following estimate for the bill from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office:

H.R. 331 would amend the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility Act to
allow holders of existing rights-of-way, easements, permits, or
other authorizations granted by the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) to use existing rights-of-way for aquifer recharge on behalf
of third parties without further authorization. The bill would define
those third parties as a state, political subdivision, Indian tribe, or
other public entity. The bill also would clarify that using an exist-
ing right-of-way for aquifer recharge would not constitute an ex-
pansion or modification.
By removing the need for public entities to obtain new rights-of-
way in such cases, H.R. 331 could reduce offsetting receipts from
the fees charged to issue those permissions; such receipts are re-
corded as reductions in direct spending. Using information from
BLM, CBO expects that those reductions would result in an insig-
nificant increase in direct spending over the 2025–2035 period, be-
cause most public entities are exempt from paying such fees.
CBO expects that the cost of implementing the bill’s require-
ments would be less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Alaina Rhee. The esti-
mate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
2. General Performance Goals and Objectives. As required by
clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the general performance goal or objective
of this bill is to amend the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility Act to clar-
ify a provision relating to conveyances for aquifer recharge pur-
poses.
EARMARK STATEMENT
This bill does not contain any Congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined under clause 9(e),
