The bill does not apply to a telephone, laptop, tablet, or any device
that a consumer would reasonably expect to have a camera or
microphone or to any device that is specifically marketed as a cam-
era, telecommunications device, or microphone.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Consumers increasingly purchase internet-connected devices for
use in their homes. The number of so-called ‘‘smart homes,’’ where
internet-connected appliances, controls, and devices are used, is ex-
pected to reach 103 million by 2028.1 In one survey, consumers
who embraced smart home devices believed these technologies im-
proved their quality of life because of real-time notifications and
the ability to easily adjust home and appliance settings, among
other features.2
At the same time, consumers may not be aware that many inter-
net-connected devices contain cameras or microphones that record
them. One investigation found that a smart refrigerator used a
small camera to photograph its contents and gathered additional
information on its users.3 A robot vacuum was also found to have
also collected and shared compromising images of its owner.4 In ad-
dition to consumers being unaware of these features, internet-con-
nected devices may pose new data security risks to consumers be-
cause of the collection, processing, and storage of this information.
Given the proliferation of internet-connected devices in American
homes and the potential data security risks to consumers, con-
sumers should be informed when a smart device is capable of re-
cording or listening to them before purchasing the device. The Fed-
eral Trade Commission Act’s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts
or practices broadly applies to the marketing of smart devices by
manufacturers. Nonetheless, specific legislation is necessary to en-
sure manufacturers take these steps before additional consumer
harm occurs in the marketplace and to ensure that consumers can
make informed purchasing decisions.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides that the Act may be cited as the ‘‘Informing
Consumers about Smart Devices Act.’’
Section 2. Required disclosure of a camera or recording capability
in certain internet-connected devices
Section 2 requires manufacturers of covered devices to clearly
and conspicuously disclose prior to purchase whether a covered de-
vice contains a camera or microphone.
Section 3. Enforcement
Section 3 provides that a violation of the Act shall be treated as
a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive practice pre-
scribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, and authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to en-
force the Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with
the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as applicable under the
Federal Trade Commission Act.
This section also directs the FTC, within 180 days of the Act’s
enactment, to issue guidance to help manufacturers comply with
the Act’s requirements, including guidance about bestpractices for
making required disclosures as clear and conspicuous and age ap-
propriate as practicable, and best practices for using a pictorial vis-
ual representation of the information to be disclosed. Manufactur-
ers may petition the FTC for tailored guidance on how to meet the
disclosure requirements consistent with existing rules of practice or
any successor rules. The FTC’s guidance shall not confer rights on
any person or entity and shall not operate to bind the FTC or any
person to the approach recommended in the guidance. The FTC
shall not base an enforcement action or execute a consent order
based on practices that are alleged to be inconsistent with such
guidance unless the practices allegedly violate section 2 of the Act.
Section 4. Definition of covered device
Section 4 defines the term ‘‘covered device’’ to: (1) mean a con-
sumer product, as defined by section 3(a) of the Consumer Product
Safety Act that is capable of connecting to the internet, a compo-
nent of which is a camera or microphone; and (2) not include: (A)
a telephone (including a mobile phone), a laptop, tablet, or any de-
vice that a consumer would reasonably expect to have a micro-
phone or camera; (B) any device that is specifically marketed as a
camera, telecommunications device, or microphone; or (C) any de-
vice or apparatus described in sections 255, 716, and 718, and sub-

sections (aa) and (bb) of section 303 of the Communications Act of
1934, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.
Section 5. Effective date

manufactured after the date that is 180 days after the date the

duced into interstate commerce before that date.
