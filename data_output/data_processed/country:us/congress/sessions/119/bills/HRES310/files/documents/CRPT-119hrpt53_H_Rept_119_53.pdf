STATEMENT OF BUDGET AUTHORITY AND RELATED ITEMS
The resolution does not provide new budget authority, new
spending authority, new credit authority, or an increase or de-
crease in revenues or tax expenditures and a statement under
House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(2) and section 308(a)(1) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 is not required.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
In compliance with House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(3), the Com-
mittee states, with respect to H. Res. 310, that the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office did not submit a cost estimate and
comparison under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of
1974.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
On February 25, 2025, David Ambrose (‘‘Contestant’’) filed a No-
tice of Contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives pur-
suant to the Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA).1 Contestant
ran as a candidate in the August 20, 2024 primary election for the
office of Representative to the United States Congress representing
the At-Large Congressional District of the State of Alaska. The
principal candidates for the At-Large Congressional District were
incumbent Democrat Mary Peltola and Republican Nick Begich III
(‘‘Contestee’’),2 who ultimately prevailed in the November 5, 2024,
general election. On September 1, 2024, the State of Alaska cer-
tified the primary results as follows: Incumbent Peltola received
55,166 votes, Contestee Begich received 28,803 votes and Contest-
ant received 154 votes. Under state law, the top four finishing can-
didates in the primary election advance to the general election.
Contestant finished in ninth place and did not advance to the No-
vember 5, 2024, general election.
BASIS OF CONTEST
In his Notice of Contest, Contestant alleges that the official elec-
tion results for the At-Large Congressional District were tainted by
fraud and misconduct by several individuals, including Contestee.
Contestant further alleges had this fraud not occurred, Contestant
would have advanced from the August 20, 2024, primary election
to the November 5, 2024, general election and ultimately prevailed
to win the contest. Contestant is asking that the House order a re-
view to determine whether election law violations occurred and a
new election pursuant to the authority in Article I Sec. 5 of the
United States Constitution.
STANDING
To have standing under the FCEA, a contestant must have been
a candidate for election to the House of Representatives in the last
preceding election and claim a right to the Contestee’s seat.3 FCEA
12 U.S.C. §§381–96.
2Alaska holds nonpartisan primary contests. As a result, while Contestant’s contest pertains
to a primary election and Contestant did not ultimately advance to compete in the general elec-
tion, Contestant did compete against Republican candidate Nick Begich III in the primary, who
later advanced to the general election, prevailed in the general election contest, and is now the
incumbent in the seat that Contestant is challenging.

also states that the House of Representatives has jurisdiction over
official general and special elections, excluding a primary election,
or a caucus or convention of a political party. Since Contestant was
a candidate in the primary election for the At-Large Congressional
District of Alaska, and not a candidate in the general election, Con-
testant therefore lacks standing.
TIMING/NOTICE
The Notice of Contest was filed with the Clerk of the House of
Representatives on February 25, 2025, a date occurring after the
prescribed time period for filing set by the FCEA. However, the
timing of Contestant’s filing is not relevant to the determination of
this claim, because Contestant lacks standing.
ANALYSIS
Under FCEA, the House of Representatives has jurisdiction over
official general and special elections, but that does not include a
primary election, or a caucus or convention of a political party.4
Since Contestant was a candidate in the primary election for the
At-Large Congressional District of Alaska and not a candidate in
the general election, Contestant lacks standing. The Committee
finds that this claim must be dismissed due to lack of standing.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Committee therefore con-
cludes that this contest should be dismissed.
