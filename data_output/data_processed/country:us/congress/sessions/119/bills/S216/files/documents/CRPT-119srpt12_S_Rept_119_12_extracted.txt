SAVE OUR SEAS 2.0 AMENDMENTS ACT
APRIL8, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 216]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 216) to amend the Save Our Seas

Section 2:
2.0 Act to improve the administration of the Marine Debris Foun-
dation, to amend the Marine Debris Act to improve the administra-
tion of the Marine Debris Program of the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, and for other purposes, having consid-
ered the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and
recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 216, the Save our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act,
is to improve the administration of the Marine Debris Foundation
(Foundation) and the Marine Debris Program within the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Marine debris is persistent, solid trash in the ocean or the Great
Lakes.1 Small pieces of marine debris, like litter that originates on
land, can be flushed into the ocean via storm drains, rivers, and
streams, often due to heavy rainfall or high tide. More extreme
weather events, like hurricanes, tsunamis, or floods, might deposit

larger pieces of refuse into the ocean.2 Marine debris can also come
from fishing vessels (including lost fishing gear), cargo ships, or oil
and gas platforms, and abandoned vessels can become marine de-
bris. In addition to being an eyesore, marine debris can pose a haz-
ard to navigation if it becomes entangled in propulsion systems or
intakes; endanger human health, especially in the case of medical
waste; be ingested by, or entangle, marine animals; and in the case
of derelict fishing gear, can continue to net, hook, or trap animals—
sometimes called ‘‘ghost fishing.’’3
MARINE DEBRIS RESEARCH, PREVENTION, AND REDUCTION ACT
The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act
(MDRPRA)4 was enacted in December 2006. The MDRPRA estab-
lished a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program (Pro-
gram) within NOAA to reduce and prevent the occurrence and ad-
verse impacts of marine debris on the marine environment and
navigation safety. The MDRPRA directs the Administrator of
NOAA (Administrator), through the Program, to conduct the fol-
lowing activities: mapping, identification, impact assessment, re-
moval, and prevention of marine debris; reducing and preventing
loss of fishing gear; and outreach and education to the public and
stakeholders. The MDRPRA provides guidelines for the Adminis-
trator to enter into cooperative agreements and contracts and pro-
vide financial assistance through grants for projects that help as-
sess, reduce, and prevent marine debris and adverse impacts of de-
bris. The MDRPRA amended the Marine Plastic Pollution Research
and Control Act of 19875 to establish an Interagency Marine De-
bris Coordinating Committee (Interagency Committee) to coordi-
nate a comprehensive program of marine debris research and ac-
tivities among Federal agencies, in cooperation with nongovern-
mental organizations, industry, universities, States, Indian Tribes,
and other nations. The MDRPRA also directs the Commandant of
the U.S. Coast Guard, in consultation with the Interagency Com-
mittee, to increase compliance with the International Convention
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex V6
and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.7 Specific compliance
activities include improving waste management onboard vessels
and at ports, monitoring and enforcing compliance, coordinating
with industry to improve waste management, and improving inter-
national cooperation. The MDRPRA directs the Administrator, in
coordination with the Interagency Committee, to maintain a Fed-
eral information clearinghouse on marine debris. The MDRPRA au-
thorized appropriations from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 at $10
million for the Marine Debris Program and $2 million to the Coast
Guard Commandant to improve MARPOL implementation.8

NOAA MARINE DEBRIS PROGRAM
NOAA’s Marine Debris Program is part of the Office of Response
and Restoration within the National Ocean Service. The program
seeks to coordinate, strengthen, and increase the visibility of ma-
rine debris issues and efforts within NOAA, other agencies and
partners, and the public. The program is undertaking a national
and international effort focused on identifying, reducing, and pre-
venting debris in the marine environment. To achieve its goals, the
program works closely with various partners across the United
States. Projects supported by the Marine Debris Program have in-
cluded marine debris reduction initiatives at Texas A&M Univer-
sity and the University of Texas at Austin, aerial surveys of marine
debris in Alaska, removal of derelict fishing gear from Flower Gar-
den Banks National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of Texas, re-
moval of abandoned vessels and structures from Olympic Coast Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary in the State of Washington through part-
nership with the Makah and Quileute Tribes, research at the Uni-
versity of Delaware on factors that impact debris movement and
transport through the Delaware River and Bay and into coastal
waters, high seas marine debris monitoring, and online outreach
and education programs. The NOAA Program also sponsors the
International Coastal Cleanup, the largest marine debris and litter
cleanup event in the world.9
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 216 would do the following:
• Require the Marine Debris Foundation’s Governing Board of
Directors to appoint a chief executive officer (CEO).
• Allow the Marine Debris Foundation to receive additional

• Permit in-kind contributions from NOAA.
• Allow the Administrator to receive funds and use resources
from governmental and non-governmental entities and individ-
uals.

117TH CONGRESS
S. 4321, the Save Our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act, was introduced
on May 26, 2022, by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senators
Whitehouse and Menendez) and was referred to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Senator
Peters was later added as a cosponsor. On June 22, 2022, the Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session, and by voice vote, ordered
S. 4321 reported favorably with an amendment. On December 22,
2022, that bill passed the Senate with an amendment by unani-
mous consent.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 216 would authorize annual appropriations for the Marine De-
bris Program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration (NOAA) and would authorize a single-year appropriation
for the Marine Debris Foundation. The bill would allow the founda-
tion to match contributions from foreign governments and from
tribal and regional organizations. Both the program and the foun-
dation support efforts to remove plastics, discarded fishing gear,
and other harmful materials from the marine environment.
CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted in 2025 and that the
authorized amounts will be provided in each year. On that basis,
and using historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that imple-
menting the bill would cost $77 million over the 2025–2030 period.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budget
function 300 (natural resources and environment).
Marine Debris Program: S. 216 would reauthorize the appropria-
tion of $15 million annually from 2025 through 2029 for NOAA to
operate the Marine Debris Program. In 2024, NOAA allocated $36

million for the program. CBO estimates that implementing this
provision would cost $75 million over the 2025–2030 period.

Marine Debris Foundation: The bill would authorize the appro-
priation of $2 million in 2025 for the Marine Debris Foundation to
match external contributions. An appropriation of $10 million a
year was authorized for the foundation to match contributions from
private individuals or from state and local governments but that
authorization expired at the end of 2024; the Congress has not ap-
propriated any funds for the foundation to date. The bill would
allow the foundation to match contributions from foreign govern-
ments, tribal governments and organizations, and other regional
organizations. CBO estimates that implementing this provision
would cost $2 million over the 2025–2030 period.
The foundation is authorized to invest appropriated funds in
Treasury securities and to spend any credited interest without fur-
ther appropriation. The collection and spending of contributions as
well as the spending of credited interest are classified in the budget
as direct spending. CBO estimates that the net effect on direct
spending from the additional contributions to the foundation would
be insignificant over the 2025–2035 period because those collections
would be spent quickly. CBO also expects that the spending of any
interest credited to the foundation would be insignificant.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aurora Swanson. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 216 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING

Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions

Section 4:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 5:
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Save our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act’’.

Section 6:
Section 2. Modifications to the Marine Debris Program of the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
This section would expand the types of agreements the Marine
Debris Program can enter to include other agreements beyond con-
tracts, grant agreements, and cooperative agreements. It would
also allow NOAA to contribute on an in-kind basis rather than a
funding basis for the Federal Government’s share of the cost of a
project.

Section 7:
Section 3. Modifications to the Marine Debris Foundation
This section would make technical corrections to ensure the Ma-
rine Debris Foundation language in the original SOS 2.010 text is
internally consistent and that consultations about the Foundation
include all key government agencies. Additionally, it would des-
ignate the first officer of the Foundation as the chief executive offi-
cer, clarify the Board’s authority to appoint and remove the CEO
and define the CEO’s role in managing other officers or employees.
The section would also change the Foundation’s designation from
a nonprofit organization to a nonprofit corporation for consistency
throughout SOS 2.0. It would establish a 6-year term limit for ap-
pointed Board Directors, require Board member selection to have
the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, and clarify the Board’s
ability to appoint and remove the CEO. Furthermore, it would af-
firm the CEO’s authority to appoint, review, and remove other offi-
cers and employees. It would require the Foundation’s principal of-
fice to be in the National Capital Region or a coastal shoreline com-
munity. Additionally, the Foundation would be directed to develop
and implement best practices for outreach to Indian Tribes.
This section would authorize an appropriation of $2 million for
the Marine Debris Foundation for fiscal year 2025 and clarify that
the Foundation could match contributions from regional organiza-
tions, Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and foreign govern-
ments. It would also reauthorize $10 million for the Marine Debris
Program for each fiscal year from 2018 through 2029.

Section 4. Transfers
This section would reorganize subtitle C of title I of the Save Our
Seas 2.0 Act11 for better organization within section 119 of the
original Marine Debris Act.12

SEC. 111. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSES OF FOUNDATION.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established the Marine Debris
Foundation (in this title referred to as the ‘‘Foundation’’). The
Foundation is a charitable and nonprofit øorganization¿ corpora-
tion and is not an agency or establishment of the United States.
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of the Foundation are—
(1) to encourage, accept, and administer private gifts of prop-
erty for the benefit of, or in connection with, the activities and
services of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion under the Marine Debris Program established under sec-
tion 3 of the Marine Debris Act (33 U.S.C. 1952), and other rel-
evant programs and agencies;
(2) to undertake and conduct such other activities as will

SAVE OUR SEAS 2.0 AMENDMENTS ACT
APRIL8, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 216]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 216) to amend the Save Our Seas
2.0 Act to improve the administration of the Marine Debris Foun-
dation, to amend the Marine Debris Act to improve the administra-
tion of the Marine Debris Program of the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, and for other purposes, having consid-
ered the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and
recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 216, the Save our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act,
is to improve the administration of the Marine Debris Foundation
(Foundation) and the Marine Debris Program within the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Marine debris is persistent, solid trash in the ocean or the Great
Lakes.1 Small pieces of marine debris, like litter that originates on
land, can be flushed into the ocean via storm drains, rivers, and
streams, often due to heavy rainfall or high tide. More extreme
weather events, like hurricanes, tsunamis, or floods, might deposit

larger pieces of refuse into the ocean.2 Marine debris can also come
from fishing vessels (including lost fishing gear), cargo ships, or oil
and gas platforms, and abandoned vessels can become marine de-
bris. In addition to being an eyesore, marine debris can pose a haz-
ard to navigation if it becomes entangled in propulsion systems or
intakes; endanger human health, especially in the case of medical
waste; be ingested by, or entangle, marine animals; and in the case
of derelict fishing gear, can continue to net, hook, or trap animals—
sometimes called ‘‘ghost fishing.’’3
MARINE DEBRIS RESEARCH, PREVENTION, AND REDUCTION ACT
The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act
(MDRPRA)4 was enacted in December 2006. The MDRPRA estab-
lished a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program (Pro-
gram) within NOAA to reduce and prevent the occurrence and ad-
verse impacts of marine debris on the marine environment and
navigation safety. The MDRPRA directs the Administrator of
NOAA (Administrator), through the Program, to conduct the fol-
lowing activities: mapping, identification, impact assessment, re-
moval, and prevention of marine debris; reducing and preventing
loss of fishing gear; and outreach and education to the public and
stakeholders. The MDRPRA provides guidelines for the Adminis-
trator to enter into cooperative agreements and contracts and pro-
vide financial assistance through grants for projects that help as-
sess, reduce, and prevent marine debris and adverse impacts of de-
bris. The MDRPRA amended the Marine Plastic Pollution Research
and Control Act of 19875 to establish an Interagency Marine De-
bris Coordinating Committee (Interagency Committee) to coordi-
nate a comprehensive program of marine debris research and ac-
tivities among Federal agencies, in cooperation with nongovern-
mental organizations, industry, universities, States, Indian Tribes,
and other nations. The MDRPRA also directs the Commandant of
the U.S. Coast Guard, in consultation with the Interagency Com-
mittee, to increase compliance with the International Convention
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex V6
and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.7 Specific compliance
activities include improving waste management onboard vessels
and at ports, monitoring and enforcing compliance, coordinating
with industry to improve waste management, and improving inter-
national cooperation. The MDRPRA directs the Administrator, in
coordination with the Interagency Committee, to maintain a Fed-
eral information clearinghouse on marine debris. The MDRPRA au-
thorized appropriations from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 at $10
million for the Marine Debris Program and $2 million to the Coast
Guard Commandant to improve MARPOL implementation.8

NOAA MARINE DEBRIS PROGRAM
NOAA’s Marine Debris Program is part of the Office of Response
and Restoration within the National Ocean Service. The program
seeks to coordinate, strengthen, and increase the visibility of ma-
rine debris issues and efforts within NOAA, other agencies and
partners, and the public. The program is undertaking a national
and international effort focused on identifying, reducing, and pre-
venting debris in the marine environment. To achieve its goals, the
program works closely with various partners across the United
States. Projects supported by the Marine Debris Program have in-
cluded marine debris reduction initiatives at Texas A&M Univer-
sity and the University of Texas at Austin, aerial surveys of marine
debris in Alaska, removal of derelict fishing gear from Flower Gar-
den Banks National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of Texas, re-
moval of abandoned vessels and structures from Olympic Coast Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary in the State of Washington through part-
nership with the Makah and Quileute Tribes, research at the Uni-
versity of Delaware on factors that impact debris movement and
transport through the Delaware River and Bay and into coastal
waters, high seas marine debris monitoring, and online outreach
and education programs. The NOAA Program also sponsors the
International Coastal Cleanup, the largest marine debris and litter
cleanup event in the world.9
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 216 would do the following:
• Require the Marine Debris Foundation’s Governing Board of
Directors to appoint a chief executive officer (CEO).
• Allow the Marine Debris Foundation to receive additional

117TH CONGRESS
S. 4321, the Save Our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act, was introduced
on May 26, 2022, by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senators
Whitehouse and Menendez) and was referred to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Senator
Peters was later added as a cosponsor. On June 22, 2022, the Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session, and by voice vote, ordered
S. 4321 reported favorably with an amendment. On December 22,
2022, that bill passed the Senate with an amendment by unani-
mous consent.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 216 would authorize annual appropriations for the Marine De-
bris Program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration (NOAA) and would authorize a single-year appropriation
for the Marine Debris Foundation. The bill would allow the founda-
tion to match contributions from foreign governments and from
tribal and regional organizations. Both the program and the foun-
dation support efforts to remove plastics, discarded fishing gear,
and other harmful materials from the marine environment.
CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted in 2025 and that the
authorized amounts will be provided in each year. On that basis,
and using historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that imple-
menting the bill would cost $77 million over the 2025–2030 period.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budget
function 300 (natural resources and environment).
Marine Debris Program: S. 216 would reauthorize the appropria-
tion of $15 million annually from 2025 through 2029 for NOAA to
operate the Marine Debris Program. In 2024, NOAA allocated $36

million for the program. CBO estimates that implementing this
provision would cost $75 million over the 2025–2030 period.

Marine Debris Foundation: The bill would authorize the appro-
priation of $2 million in 2025 for the Marine Debris Foundation to
match external contributions. An appropriation of $10 million a
year was authorized for the foundation to match contributions from
private individuals or from state and local governments but that
authorization expired at the end of 2024; the Congress has not ap-
propriated any funds for the foundation to date. The bill would
allow the foundation to match contributions from foreign govern-
ments, tribal governments and organizations, and other regional
organizations. CBO estimates that implementing this provision
would cost $2 million over the 2025–2030 period.
The foundation is authorized to invest appropriated funds in
Treasury securities and to spend any credited interest without fur-
ther appropriation. The collection and spending of contributions as
well as the spending of credited interest are classified in the budget
as direct spending. CBO estimates that the net effect on direct
spending from the additional contributions to the foundation would
be insignificant over the 2025–2035 period because those collections
would be spent quickly. CBO also expects that the spending of any
interest credited to the foundation would be insignificant.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aurora Swanson. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 216 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING

Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions

contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Save our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act’’.
Section 2. Modifications to the Marine Debris Program of the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
This section would expand the types of agreements the Marine
Debris Program can enter to include other agreements beyond con-
tracts, grant agreements, and cooperative agreements. It would
also allow NOAA to contribute on an in-kind basis rather than a
funding basis for the Federal Government’s share of the cost of a
project.
Section 3. Modifications to the Marine Debris Foundation
This section would make technical corrections to ensure the Ma-
rine Debris Foundation language in the original SOS 2.010 text is
internally consistent and that consultations about the Foundation
include all key government agencies. Additionally, it would des-
ignate the first officer of the Foundation as the chief executive offi-
cer, clarify the Board’s authority to appoint and remove the CEO
and define the CEO’s role in managing other officers or employees.
The section would also change the Foundation’s designation from
a nonprofit organization to a nonprofit corporation for consistency
throughout SOS 2.0. It would establish a 6-year term limit for ap-
pointed Board Directors, require Board member selection to have
the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, and clarify the Board’s
ability to appoint and remove the CEO. Furthermore, it would af-
firm the CEO’s authority to appoint, review, and remove other offi-
cers and employees. It would require the Foundation’s principal of-
fice to be in the National Capital Region or a coastal shoreline com-
munity. Additionally, the Foundation would be directed to develop
and implement best practices for outreach to Indian Tribes.
This section would authorize an appropriation of $2 million for
the Marine Debris Foundation for fiscal year 2025 and clarify that
the Foundation could match contributions from regional organiza-
tions, Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and foreign govern-
ments. It would also reauthorize $10 million for the Marine Debris
Program for each fiscal year from 2018 through 2029.
Section 4. Transfers
This section would reorganize subtitle C of title I of the Save Our
Seas 2.0 Act11 for better organization within section 119 of the
original Marine Debris Act.12
Section 5. Definitions
This section would add definitions for the terms ‘‘circular econ-
omy’’, ‘‘coastal shoreline community’’, ‘‘EPA Administrator’’, ‘‘Indian
