I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 1491, the ‘‘Disaster Related Extension of Deadlines
Act,’’ as ordered reported by the Committee on Ways and Means
on February 26, 2025.
Under the provision, any period disregarded under section 7508A
with respect to the time prescribed for filing any return of tax is
treated as an extension of time for purposes of determining the lim-
itations on a refund or credit under section 6511(b)(2)(A).
In addition, under the provision, the last date prescribed for pay-
ment of any tax under section 6303 is clarified to take into account
any period disregarded under section 7508A.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Committee on Ways and Means has conducted oversight of
the IRS and the need for modernization. On February 11, 2025, the
Committee held a hearing titled ‘‘IRS Return on Investment and
the Need for Modernization,’’ to examine the lack of return on in-
vestment from funding provided by to the IRS by the Inflation Re-
duction Act and the need for information technology modernization
at the agency.1 During the Committee’s consideration of how to
modernize the administration of the tax laws, the Committee recog-
nized several issues faced by taxpayers who are recovering from
natural disasters, one being the strict time period that a taxpayer
must file a claim for a credit or a refund when they have been af-

fected by a natural disaster. Another is receiving a mailing notice
from the IRS 60 days after the filing deadline demanding a tax
payment, that does not account for the taxpayer’s extension grant-
ed under a federal natural disaster declaration.
Currently, taxpayers who file tax returns by the April 15 filing
deadline ordinarily have the opportunity to file a claim for a credit
or refund of any overpayments of tax until April 15 three years
later. However, if a filing deadline is postponed beyond the typical
April 15 deadline due to a natural disaster, the taxpayer’s allotted
time to file a claim for a credit or a refund does not change. This
leads to a decreased period of time in which a taxpayer must file
a claim for a credit or refund, during the time that the taxpayer
is recovering from a natural disaster.
The IRS is required to send a letter of notice and demand to the
taxpayer demanding payment within 60 days of assessment, but
not before the last date prescribed for the payment of tax.2 Under
current law, the IRS does not take into account a taxpayers exten-
sion related to natural disasters, often leading to the agency send-
ing notice and demand letters prematurely.
Taxpayers should not be burdened by inadvertent notice and de-
mand letters from the IRS that are sent erroneously without con-
sideration of the taxpayer’s extension granted due to a natural dis-
aster.
This bill brings parity to the tax filing extension that is granted
due to a federally designated natural disaster to the three-year
lookback period to file a claim for a credit or a refund and ensures
the IRS does not send notice and demand letters prematurely. Tax-
payers who are facing the difficulties of a natural disaster should
receive the same timeline to file a claim for a credit or a refund
and should not be burdened by erroneous notice and demand let-
ters.
The Committee on Ways and Means is committed to providing
fair treatment to taxpayers who face the challenges of recovering
from a natural disaster. This bill brings parity to the extension pro-
vided to taxpayers.

II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
A. POSTPONEMENT OF CERTAIN DEADLINES BY REASON OF DISAS-
TERS MADE APPLICABLE TO LIMITATION ON CREDIT OR REFUND
(SEC. 2 OF THE BILL AND NEW SEC. 7508A(f) AND SEC. 6303(b)
OF THE CODE)
PRESENT LAW
General time limits for filing tax returns and paying estimated tax
Individuals generally are required to file their Federal income
tax returns by April 15 of the year following the close of a taxable
year.4 Present law also provides that the Secretary may grant rea-
sonable extensions of time for filing such returns.5 Treasury regula-
tions provide upon application on the proper form, an automatic
six-month extension (until October 15 for calendar-year individ-
uals) for any individual timely filing that form and paying the
amount of tax estimated to be due.6
In general, individuals are required to make quarterly estimated
tax payments by April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15
of the following taxable year. Wage withholding is considered to be
a payment of estimated taxes.
Suspension of time periods
In general, the Secretary may specify a period of up to one year
that may be disregarded for performing various acts under the
Code, such as filing tax returns, paying taxes, or filing a claim for
credit or refund of tax, for any taxpayer determined by the Sec-
retary to be affected by a Federally declared disaster,7 a significant
fire,8 or a terroristic or military action9 with respect to any tax li-
ability of the taxpayer.10 In addition, the period specified by the
Secretary may be disregarded in determining the amount of any in-
terest, penalty, additional amount, or addition to tax, and the
amount of any credit or refund.
There are special rules provided for pension plans and other em-
ployee benefit plans. The Secretary may prescribe a period of up to
one year which may be disregarded in determining the date by
which any action by a pension or other employee benefit plan, or
by any sponsor, administrator, participant, beneficiary, or other
person with respect to such plan, affected by a Federally declared
disaster, a significant fire, or a terroristic or military action, would
be required or permitted to be completed. A plan is not treated as

operating in a manner inconsistent with its terms or in violation
of its terms merely due to disregarding any such periods.
The suspension of time may apply to a wide variety of acts, in-
cluding the (1) filing of any return of income, estate, gift, employ-
ment, or excise tax; (2) payment of any income, estate, gift, employ-
ment, or excise tax; (3) allowance of a credit or refund of any tax;
(4) assessment of any tax; (5) collection of the amount of any liabil-
ity in respect of any tax; (6) notice or demand for payment of any
tax or with respect to any liability of tax; and (7) any other act re-
quired or permitted under the internal revenue laws specified by
the Secretary of the Treasury.11 The types of acts for which time
may be suspended are identified in a related provision and incor-
porated by reference.12
For a tax-related deadline to be postponed under this authority,
the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) generally will publish, as soon
as practicable after the declaration of the disaster, significant fire,
or occurrence of a terroristic or military action, a revenue ruling,
revenue procedure, notice, announcement, news release, or other
guidance authorizing the postponement and describing the acts
postponed, the postponement period, and the location of the cov-
ered disaster area.13
Mandatory 60-day suspension
In the case of a Federally declared disaster, qualified taxpayers
have a mandatory 60-day period that is disregarded in determining
whether the acts listed above were performed in the time pre-
scribed; the amount of any interest, penalty, additional amount, or
addition to tax; and the amount of any credit or refund.14 The 60-
day period begins on the earliest incident date specified in the dec-
laration to which the relevant disaster area relates and ends on the
date which is the later of 60 days after the earliest incident date
so specified or the date such declaration was issued. In the case of
multiple declarations, a separate 60-day period shall be calculated
with respect to each declaration. The 60-day period is disregarded
in determining under the internal revenue laws, in respect of any
tax liability of a qualified taxpayer, whether any of the specified
acts to which the extension applies were performed within the time
prescribed (without regard to any extensions otherwise provided for
periods after the 60-day period). The mandatory 60-day period pro-
vided is in addition to, or concurrent with, any period of suspension
provided by the Secretary. In the case of multiple declarations, a
separate 60-day period shall be calculated with respect to each dec-
laration.
11Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7508A–1. The regulations note that the IRS may postpone deadlines
for performing certain acts with respect to taxes other than taxes not administered by the IRS
such as firearms tax (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section
4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E).
12Sec. 7508(a)(1)(A) through (K). Under Treasury regulations, additional acts were added to
this list with respect to affected pension plans and affected taxpayers with respect to such plans:
Making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within the meaning of section 4974(c))
under section 219(f)(3), 404(a)(6), 404(h)(1)(B), or 404(m)(2); making distributions under section
408(d)(4); recharacterizing contributions under section 408A(d)(6); or making a rollover under
section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3). Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7508A–1(c)(1)(iii). In addi-
tion, Revenue Procedure 2018–58, 2018–50 I.R.B. 990, supplements the list of postponed acts
in section 7508(a)(1) and Treasury Regulation section 301.7508A–1(c)(1) with an additional list
of time-sensitive acts.

Qualified taxpayers are (1) any individual whose principal resi-
dence is located in a disaster area, (2) any taxpayer if the tax-
payer’s principal place of business (other than the business of per-
forming services as an employee) is located in a disaster area, (3)
any individual who is a relief worker affiliated with a recognized
government or philanthropic organization and who is assisting in
a disaster area, (4) any taxpayer whose records necessary to meet
a deadline for the acts listed above are maintained in a disaster
area, (5) any individual visiting a disaster area who was killed or
injured as a result of the disaster, and (6) solely with respect to a
joint return, any spouse of an individual who is a qualified tax-
payer.
Statute of limitations on credit or refund
In general, a taxpayer is required to file a claim for credit or re-
fund of an overpayment of tax within three years from the time the
return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid,
whichever expires later.15 If the taxpayer did not file a return, the
taxpayer is required to file a claim for credit or refund within two
years from the time the tax was paid.16 No credit or refund is al-
lowed or made after the expiration of this period of limitation, un-
less the taxpayer files a claim for credit or refund within such pe-
riod.17
If a taxpayer files a claim for credit or refund during the three-
year limitation period, the amount of credit or refund is limited to
the portion of tax paid within the three years immediately before
filing the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing
the return.18 If the claim was not filed within the three-year pe-
riod, the amount of credit or refund is limited to the two years im-
mediately preceding the filing of the claim.19
Notice and demand for payment
Under present law, the IRS is required to mail to the taxpayer
a notice and demand for payment within 60 days of assessment,
but not before the last date prescribed for the payment of tax.20 An
assessment generally occurs after a taxpayer files a return showing
a tax liability owed, regardless of whether the amount is paid at
that time. As explained above, the date by which notice or demand
for tax is required to be mailed is among the events or actions spec-
ified as subject to postponement due to Federally declared disas-
ters, etc.21

IRS sent taxpayers who qualified for disaster relief but had not yet paid in full, a statutory no-
tice of underpayment despite being granted a postponement of time under section 7508A. To
clarify the confusion generated by these letters, the IRS sent a second letter advising taxpayers
in Federally declared disaster areas of the tax relief available to them, including the fact that
they had additional time for filing and payment. Inspector General for Tax Administration, De-

REASONS FOR CHANGE
The Committee believes that taxpayers eligible for relief by rea-
son of Federally declared disaster, significant fire, terroristic or
military action should not be treated differently than taxpayers eli-
gible for relief for other reasons. The disparity arises because while
claims for refunds are generally limited to amounts paid or deemed
paid within three years of filing the claim (including extensions),
disaster-related postponement relief is not considered an extension
for refund claim purposes. Therefore, amounts paid timely, such as
withholding and estimated taxes, may not be eligible for refund in
certain circumstances because they were deemed paid before the
end of the postponement period. Thus, the Committee believes that
Congress should modify the Code to ensure that disaster victims
who have overpaid their taxes will be able to claim a refund for
these overpayments, as long as their claim is filed within three
years of the date the return was filed.
In addition, the Committee believes that taxpayers affected by
disasters, etc. who are eligible for extension relief should not re-
ceive letters demanding payment from the IRS for tax liabilities
not yet due. Specifically, the Committee believes that the Code
should be modified such that affected taxpayers who choose to file
their return early without including payment will not receive notice
and demand letters before their tax liability is due.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
Under the provision, any period disregarded under section 7508A
with respect to the time prescribed for filing any return of tax is
treated as an extension of time for purposes of determining the lim-
itations on a refund or credit under section 6511(b)(2)(A).
In addition, under the provision, the last date prescribed for pay-
ment of any tax under section 6303 is clarified to take into account
any period disregarded under section 7508A.
EFFECTIVE DATES
The provision with respect to the treatment of the disregarded
period as an extension of time applies to claims filed after the date
of enactment.
The provision with respect to the determination of the last date
prescribed for payment applies to notices issued after the date of
enactment.

IV. BUDGET EFFECTS OF THE BILL
A. COMMITTEE ESTIMATE OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS
In compliance with clause 3(d) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the following statement is made con-
cerning the effects on the budget of the bill, H.R. 1491 as reported.
The estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
is included below.

year budget receipts for the period 2025 through 2034.
B. STATEMENT REGARDING NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX
EXPENDITURES BUDGET AUTHORITY
In compliance with clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee states that the bill in-
volves no new or increased budget authority.
C. COST ESTIMATE PREPARED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
OFFICE

H.R. 1491 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the
statute of limitations on filing for a tax credit or tax refund in the
case of declared disasters. The bill would treat any filing extension
granted in such cases as applicable to the allowable period for fil-
ing a return to receive a tax credit or tax refund. The bill would
also apply the extension to the date used to determine when the
Internal Revenue Service must mail a notice and demand for pay-
ment.
The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, stipulates
that revenue estimates provided by the staff of the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation (JCT) are the official estimates for all tax legis-
lation considered by the Congress. CBO therefore incorporates such
estimates into its cost estimates of the effects of legislation. The
revenue estimates for the bill were provided by JCT.1 JCT esti-
mates that the bill would reduce federal revenues by an insignifi-
cant amount over the 2025–2035 period.
CBO estimates that it would cost less than $500,000 over the
2025–2030 period to implement the bill. Any related spending
would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Jennifer Shand. The
estimate was reviewed by John McClelland, Director of Tax Anal-
ysis.

G. TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Reform and Re-
structuring Act of 1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the Inter-
nal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a
tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all
legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the
House Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of con-
ference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indi-
rectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has widespread ap-
plicability to individuals or small businesses.
The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has determined
that there are no provisions that are of widespread applicability to
individuals or small businesses.
