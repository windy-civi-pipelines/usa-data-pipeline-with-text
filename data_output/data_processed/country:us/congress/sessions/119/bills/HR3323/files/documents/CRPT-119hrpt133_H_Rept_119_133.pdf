PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3323, the Helping Startups Continue to Grow Act, was intro-
duced on May 13, 2025, by Representative Bryan Steil (WI–01).
H.R. 3323 provides an extension of certain exemptions and reduced
disclosure requirements for companies that were emerging growth
companies (EGCs) and continue to meet all other requirements for
EGCs except for the five-year restriction. This bill also increases
the maximum threshold amounts to qualify as an EGC to $3 billion
and removes the disqualification for ‘‘large accelerated filers.’’
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
By granting EGCs a temporary ‘‘on-ramp’’ status, Title I of the
JOBS Act encourages small companies to go public while ensuring
that they graduate to full regulatory compliance as they grow large
enough to sustain the compliance infrastructure typical of mature
companies.1 The JOBS Act’s IPO on-ramp succeeded by providing
accommodations that streamlined the IPO process and promoted ef-
ficiency without compromising investor protection. The IPO on-
ramp accommodations are limited, measured and based on analo-
gous pre-existing principles or practices in federal securities regula-
tion.
Congress should build off this success, by increasing the thresh-
old amounts to qualify as an EGC, extending the maximum
amount of time an issuer can remain an EGC, and removing the
disqualification for large accelerated filers. The proposed enhance-
ments to the IPO on-ramp represent a balanced approach to pro-

(2013) (codified as amended at 26 U.S.C. §41).

mote IPO activity without compromising investor protections, in-
cluding all of the disclosure and liability requirements that con-
tinue to remain in place for all companies.

atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a

The Committee has requested but not received from the Director

dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would amend the definition of an emerging growth com-
pany (EGC) to include all companies with a valuation of at least
$2 billion (up from $1 billion), and would also increase the period
under which a company can qualify as an EGC to 10 years (up
from 5 years).
As background, EGC status was created by the JOBS Act of 2012
as a way to provide a temporary on-ramp for private start-ups to
go public without immediately needing to meet the burden of the
reporting obligations of a full-fledged public company. A private
company can qualify for EGC status—and therefore, access to the
public equity markets—if it is below a certain age or valuation, and
also commits to providing reduced legal and financial disclosures
which amount to an abbreviated version of what a fully public
issuer must disclose. This bill would instead allow many more com-
panies that would otherwise graduate into full-blown public report-
ing company status—subject to important investor protections and
regulatory guardrails—to skirt these requirements for a much
longer period of time, to the detriment of investors and the market.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3323.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
