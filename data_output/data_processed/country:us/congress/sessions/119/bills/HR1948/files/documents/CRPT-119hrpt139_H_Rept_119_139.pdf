cept funds for activities relating to wastewater treatment and flood
control works, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC or
Commission) was established in 1889 and is an international body
composed of the United States Section and the Mexican Section.
The IBWC is responsible for applying the boundary and water trea-
ties between the United States and Mexico. As part of this respon-
sibility, the IBWC undertakes a variety of infrastructure projects
to implement existing treaties and international agreements, as
well as to resolve new or emerging boundary or water problems.
The United States Section of the IBWC currently operates and
maintains roughly 100 hydrologic gaging stations, 500 miles of lev-
ees, 20,000 acres of floodplains, four diversion dams, two inter-
national storage dams and associated hydroelectric power plants,
more than 500 hydraulic structures, two international wastewater
treatment plants, and half of all boundary monuments and mark-
ers on the land boundary and at ports of entry.1 Additionally, the
IBWC conducts and reviews environmental impact studies, water
quality monitoring, hydraulic studies, and develops design plans for
construction and renovation of water infrastructure projects.2
H.R. 1948 authorizes the IBWC to accept funds from other Fed-
eral agencies and non-Federal partners to study, design, construct,
operate, and maintain water resource infrastructure. This legisla-
tion builds on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Imple-
mentation Act (P.L. 116–113), which directed the United States En-
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with the IBWC to
address international transboundary water flows originating in
Mexico and appropriated $300 million to EPA for the purpose of
constructing and maintaining water infrastructure. This authority
was later amended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023
(P.L. 117–328) to authorize the transfer of this funding from EPA
to the IBWC to carry out this work.
H.R. 1948 also aligns the IBWC’s authorities with other Federal
agencies that are authorized to receive funding from non-Federal
entities. For example, the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps) is eligible to receive funding from non-Federal partners for
the study, design, construction, and operation and maintenance of
infrastructure projects.3
The Commissioner of the United States Section of the IBWC,
Maria-Elena Giner, testified before the Subcommittee on Water
and Environment of the Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure during the 118th Congress. Commissioner Giner stated
that the IBWC has a $473 million deferred maintenance backlog
and that the ability to accept additional funding would allow the

Commission to better manage its infrastructure assets, as well as
partner with other agencies on critical infrastructure projects.4
For example, United States Customs and Border Protection ac-
cesses the Commission’s levees and flood control structures regu-
larly for border security purposes.5 This legislation will help the
Commission address deferred maintenance and new water infra-
structure needs by collaborating with other Federal agencies and
non-Federal partners.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of rule XIII, clause 3(c)(6)(A) of the 119th Con-
gress no hearings were held to develop this legislation. However,
activity in the 118th Congress informed this legislation.
In the 118th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water Resources
and Environment of the Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure held a hearing entitled, ‘‘Review of Fiscal Year 2024
Budget Request: Agency Perspectives (Part II).’’ The hearing gave
Members the opportunity to review the Fiscal Year 2024 budget re-
quest, as well as the Administration’s program priorities within the
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee. The Subcommittee received testi-
mony from the Honorable Radhika Fox, Assistant Administrator,
Office of Water, EPA; Dr. Maria-Elena Giner, Commissioner,
IWBC, United States Section; Mr. Louis Aspey, Associate Chief,
Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture; Dr. Aaron Bernstein, Director, Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry; and Ms. Nicole R. LeBoeuf,
Assistant Administrator, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of

sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES

the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of

H.R. 1948 would authorize the U.S. International Boundary and
Water Commission to accept and spend contributions from federal
and certain nonfederal entities to carry out wastewater treatment,
water conservation, and flood control projects. The bill would re-
quire the commission to report annually on how any collections
were used.
Any contributions from nonfederal entities would be recorded in
the budget as offsetting receipts, that is, as reductions in direct
spending. CBO expects that the amount the commission would col-
lect each year from federal and nonfederal sources would vary de-
pending on the needs, priorities, and financial resources of the con-
tributing entities. Based on historical spending patterns of similar
activities, CBO estimates that any collections would be spent soon
after they are received. Thus, under the bill, the net effect on direct
spending would be negligible in each year and over the 2025–2035
period.
Based on the costs of similar requirements, CBO estimates that
the annual report would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–
2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the avail-
ability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Kelly Durand. The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

lating to wastewater treatment, water conservation projects, and
flood control works, and for other purposes.

DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1948 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, a pro-
gram that was included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED
TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of the rule XXI.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
An estimate of Federal mandates prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of the
Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congres-
sional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that H.R. 1948 does not preempt any state, local, or tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the definition of Section 5(b) of
the appendix to Title 5, United States Code, are created by this leg-
islation.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Public Law 104–1).
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations outlining the funds that have been accepted
under this authority and the activities carried out with such funds.

imbursement to a total of $5 million annually.
This section also restricts the Commission from accepting funds

of which is located in, a foreign country of concern or that has any
agreement with a foreign country of concern.
