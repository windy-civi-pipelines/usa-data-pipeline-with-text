119THCONGRESS REPORT
1st Session " HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ! 119–182
SINKHOLE MAPPING ACT OF 2025
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 900]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 900) to direct the Director of the United States Geological
Survey to establish a program to map zones that are at greater
risk of sinkhole formation, and for other purposes, having consid-
ered the same, reports favorably thereon with an amendment and
recommends that the bill as amended do pass.
The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:

Section 2:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sinkhole Mapping Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. SINKHOLE HAZARD IDENTIFICATION.
(a) INGENERAL.—Subject to the availability of appropriations made in advance for
such purpose, the Director of the United States Geological Survey shall establish a
program to—
(1) study the short-term and long-term mechanisms that cause sinkholes, in-
cluding extreme storm events, prolonged droughts causing shifts in water man-
agement practices, aquifer depletion, and other major changes in water use; and
(2) develop maps that depict zones that are at greater risk of sinkhole forma-
tion.
(b) USEOFCERTAINDATA.—In developing maps under subsection (a)(2), the Direc-
tor of the United States Geological Survey shall utilize 3D elevation data (as that
term is defined in section 2 of the National Landslide Preparedness Act (43 U.S.C.
3101)) collected pursuant to section 5 of that Act (43 U.S.C. 3104).
(c) REVIEWOFMAPS.—Once during each 5-year period, or more often as the Direc-
tor of the United States Geological Survey determines is necessary, the Director
shall assess the need to revise and update the maps developed under this section.
(d) WEBSITE.—The Director of the United States Geological Survey shall establish
and maintain a public website that displays the maps developed under this section
and other relevant information critical for use by community planners and emer-
gency managers.

PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 900 is to direct the Director of the United
States Geological Survey to establish a program to map zones that
are at greater risk of sinkhole formation, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 900 directs the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to
examine the short- and long-term causes of sinkholes and map
areas at greater risk of sinkhole formation. Sinkholes are a dan-
gerous natural hazard, created when a ground depression lacks ex-
ternal surface drainage and the rock below the subsurface is dis-
solved by groundwater.1 While rock in the subsurface gradually
dissolves creating an underground cavern, the surface can stay in-
tact for a time, until the underground cavern gets to be too large
and cannot support the surface leading to a collapse.2 Over the
past 15 years, damage from sinkholes cost an average of $300 mil-
lion annually in the United States.3
H.R. 900 directs USGS to establish a program to study the
causes of sinkholes, including storms and droughts. The develop-
ment of such program would be subject to the availability of appro-
priations. The bill also requires USGS to develop, and make pub-
licly available, maps of higher-risk areas and revise them as need-
ed every five years. These provisions could reduce the risk to the
public and help land-use planners make development decisions.
H.R. 900 has bipartisan cosponsors, including two Republicans:
Reps. Gus Bilirakis (R–FL) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R–PA). Previous
versions of this bill passed the Committee on Natural Resources by
unanimous consent in the 116th, 117th, and 118th Congresses.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 900 was introduced on January 31, 2025, by Representative
Darren Soto (D–FL). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources. On April 9, 2025, the Committee on Natural
Resources met to consider the bill. Representative Darren Soto (D–
FL) offered an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute des-
ignated Soto_012 ANS. The Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-
stitute was adopted by unanimous consent. The bill, as amended,
was then ordered favorably reported to the House of Representa-
tives by unanimous consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing in the 118th Congress by the Subcommittee on Energy and
Mineral Resources held on October 25, 2023.

Section 1. Short title

Section 5:
Section 1 designates the short title of this bill as the ‘‘Sinkhole
Mapping Act of 2025’’.

Section 6:
Section 2. Sinkhole hazard identification

Section 7:
Section 2 requires the Director of the USGS to establish a pro-
gram to study short- and long-term causes of sinkholes, such as
heavy rainfall and prolonged droughts. The USGS must also de-
velop maps that analyze zones that are at risk of sinkhole forma-
tion. When developing these maps, the USGS will use Light Detec-
tion and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired through the 3D Elevation
Program, and these maps must be updated at least every 5 years,
or more frequently if the Director determines it is necessary, and
must be made publicly available. No appropriations are authorized
for this program in this bill.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.
COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XIII AND
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT

Section 8:

of House rule XIII and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act
of 1974, the Committee has requested but not received from the Di-
rector of the Congressional Budget Office a budgetary analysis and
a cost estimate of this bill.

Section 9:
2. General Performance Goals and Objectives. As required by
clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the general performance goal or objective
of this bill is to direct the Director of the United States Geological
Survey to establish a program to map zones that are at greater
risk of sinkhole formation, and for other purposes.
EARMARK STATEMENT
This bill does not contain any Congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined under clause 9(e),
9(f), and 9(g) of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives.

Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chair of the Com-
mittee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional
Record upon its receipt by the Committee, if such estimate is not
publicly available on the Congressional Budget Office website.
