PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3352, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act
of 2025, was introduced on May 13, 2025, by Representative Mike
Lawler (NY–17). H.R. 3352 defines an angel investor for purposes
of the federal securities laws. The bill also clarifies the definition
of general solicitation contained in the Securities Act of 1933 to en-
sure that startups can discuss their products and business plans at
certain events, known as ‘‘demo days,’’ without such discussions
being considered an investment offering.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Depending on the regulatory pathway a company chooses to raise
capital, the company may be limited in how it can connect with po-
tential investors. For example, the most commonly used offering
exemption under the federal securities laws—Rule 506(b) of Regu-
lation D—prohibits the use of ‘‘general solicitation’’ to market secu-
rities. A solicitation that conditions the market for an offering of
securities is viewed as general solicitation. Examples of activities
that amount to a general solicitation include newspaper and maga-
zine advertisements, unrestricted public websites, and TV and
radio broadcasts.
In implementing the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS)
Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified
‘‘demo day’’ communications (i.e., communications made in connec-
tion with an event sponsored by a group or entity that invites
issuers to present their businesses to potential investors with the
aim of securing investment) as a general solicitation.1 However, the
SEC reversed course when it finalized Rule 148. Under the new
rule, an issuer will not be deemed to have engaged in general solic-
itation if the communications are made in connection with an event
sponsored by a college, university, or other institution of higher
education; a state or local government or instrumentality thereof;
a nonprofit organization; or an angel investor group, incubator, or
accelerator, provided certain conditions are satisfied. These condi-
tions include limitations on the sponsor’s activities, a requirement
that the advertising for the event not reference any specific offering
of securities by the issuer, and limits on the information conveyed
at the event regarding the offering of securities by or on behalf of
the issuer. H.R. 3352 codifies this SEC position to ensure issuers
may continue to conduct demo days without violating the securities
laws.

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 3352 as the ‘‘Helping Angels Lead Our
Startups Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘HALOS Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Clarification of general solicitation
This section defines an angel investor group as any group that
is composed of accredited investors interested in investing personal
capital in early-stage companies that hold regular meetings and
have defined processes and procedures for making investment deci-
sions and who are neither associated nor affiliated with brokers,
dealers, or investment advisors. This section also defines an issuer
as a business that is not in bankruptcy or receivership, is not an
investment company, and is not a blank check, blind pool, or shell
company.
In addition, this section directs the SEC to revise Regulation D
of its rules to require that in carrying out the prohibition against
general solicitation or general advertising that the prohibition shall
not apply to a presentation or other communications made by or on
behalf of an issuer which is made at an event sponsored by: (1) the
U.S. or any territory thereof, (2) a college, university, or other insti-
tution of higher education, (3) a nonprofit organization, (4) an angel
investor group, (5) an incubator or accelerator, (6) a venture forum,
venture capital association, or trade association, or (7) any other
group, person, or entity as the SEC may determine by rule.
This section also notes that the prohibition shall not apply where
any advertising for the event does not reference any specific offer-
ing by the issuer or where the sponsor of which does not make an
investment recommendation or provide investment advice, does not
engage in an active role in investment negotiation, does not charge
event attendees any fees other than reasonable administrative fees,
does not receive any compensation for making introductions be-
tween investors and issuers, does not receive any compensation
with respect to such event, and makes readily available to
attendees a disclosure not longer than one page describing the na-
ture of the event and the risks of investing in the issuers pre-
senting at the event.
Moreover, this section clarifies that the prohibition shall not
apply where no specific information regarding an offering of securi-
ties by the issuer is communicated or distributed by or on behalf
of the issuer, other than the issuer being in the process of offering
securities or planning to offer securities, the type and amount of

securities being offered, the amount of securities being offered that
have already been subscribed for, and the intended use of proceeds
of the offering.
This section also covers virtual events where online participation
is limited to individuals associated with the sponsor organization,
individuals that the sponsor reasonably believes are accredited in-
vestors, or individuals who have been invited to the event by the
sponsor based on industry experience.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 3352 does not repeal or amend any section of a statute.
Therefore, the Office of Legislative Counsel did not prepare the re-
port required under clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives.
