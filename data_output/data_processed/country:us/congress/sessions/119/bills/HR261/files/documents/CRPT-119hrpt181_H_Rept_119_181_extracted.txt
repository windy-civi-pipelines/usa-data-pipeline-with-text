SEC. 3. REMOVING RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES COVERED BY SANCTUARY SPECIAL USE
PERMITS.

Section 3:
Section 310(c) of National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1441(c)) is amend-
ed—
(1) in paragraph (1), by adding ‘‘and’’ at the end;
(2) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3); and
(3) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (2).
Amend the title so as to read:
A bill to amend the National Marine Sanctuaries Act to prohibit
the Secretary of Commerce from prohibiting, or requiring any per-
mit or other authorization for, the installation, continued presence,
operation, maintenance, repair, or recovery of undersea fiber optic
cables in a national marine sanctuary if such activities have been
authorized by a Federal or State agency.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 261, as ordered reported, is to amend the
National Marine Sanctuaries Act to prohibit the Secretary of Com-
merce from prohibiting, or requiring any permit or other authoriza-
tion for, the installation, continued presence, operation, mainte-
nance, repair, or recovery of undersea fiber optic cables in a na-
tional marine sanctuary if such activities have been authorized by
a Federal or State agency.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Undersea cables have been used for more than 170 years1 and
are largely responsible for the growth of international tele-
communications systems in recent decades. The current undersea
cable network connects every continent except Antarctica and ‘‘car-
ries about 95% of intercontinental global internet traffic, and 99%
of transoceanic digital communications . . . including trillions in
international financial transactions daily.’’2 The Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) grants cable landing licenses for 25
years. However, like many other types of projects, the process to
site, install, and approve these cables typically involves numerous
agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Under the National
Marine Sanctuary Act (NMSA), the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration has the authority to issue Special Use Per-
mits (SUPs) for certain categories of activities within a national
marine sanctuary, if it is determined that the activity is needed to
establish access to its resources or ‘‘promote public use and under-
standing of a sanctuary resource.’’ SUPs can often take years to ac-
quire and can come with additional burdens and costs. Addition-
ally, it has been noted that over the last 20 years, no new cables

have been constructed within national marine sanctuaries due to
regulatory burdens, including the SUP process.3
H.R. 261, as amended, addresses this issue by prohibiting the
Secretary of Commerce from requiring any additional permit or au-
thorization for an undersea cable in a sanctuary, including a SUP.
Additionally, the bill removes the five-year timeline for SUPs in
order to allow for broader activities within national marine sanc-
tuaries.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 261 was introduced on January 9, 2025, by Rep. Earl L.
‘‘Buddy’’ Carter (R–GA). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee
on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries. On January 23, 2025, the Sub-
committee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held a hearing on the
bill. On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural Resources met
to consider the bill. The Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fish-
eries was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 261 by
unanimous consent. Chairman Bruce Westerman (R–AR) offered an
Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute designated
Westerman_022 ANS. The Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-
stitute was agreed to by voice vote. Ranking Member Jared
Huffman (D–CA) offered an amendment to the Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute designated Huffman #1. The amendment
was not agreed to by a roll call vote of 18 yeas to 25 nays, as fol-

DISSENTING VIEWS
H.R. 261 would prohibit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) from requiring any authorization for the
installation, continued presence, operation, maintenance, repair, or
recovery of undersea fiber optic cables in a National Marine Sanc-
tuary (NMS) if those activities have been previously approved by
other Federal or State agencies. The bill would remove NOAA’s au-
thority under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) to con-
duct environmental review and charge fair market fees for major
infrastructure projects in federally protected marine areas.
The National Marine Sanctuary System is a network of 17 na-
tional marine sanctuaries and two marine monuments covering
over 629,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters.1
Congress established the system to safeguard America’s natural
and cultural marine resources while supporting their sustainable
use. Recreational users frequent sanctuaries for activities such as
boating, kayaking, wildlife viewing, and recreational fishing that’s
permitted within approximately 98% of the sanctuary system.2 The
sanctuary system generates $8 billion in annual revenue and plays
a critical role in preserving coastal ecosystems.3
Under section 310 of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act,
NOAA may issue special use permits (SUPs) for activities within
sanctuaries that are compatible with sanctuary purposes and do
not destroy sanctuary resources. One such activity is the installa-
tion of submarine fiber optic cables, which facilitates internet ac-
cess and telecommunications. NOAA conducts environmental re-
view, assesses applicants’ readiness, examines installation meth-
ods, and confirms no alternative location exists outside the sanc-
tuary. NOAA also considers environmental impacts and consults
with partner agencies and affected tribes. While ecosystems in
some sanctuaries can recover from cable installation within months
or years, cables can potentially cause long-term impacts that dis-
rupt essential sanctuary features such as benthic habitat, water
quality, and ocean noise levels.4
To obtain a permit for cable installation and maintenance, the
Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) conducts an envi-
ronmental review and consults with partner agencies. The permit
review includes an assessment of applicants’ professional and fi-
nancial readiness, examination of proposed installation methods,
and confirmation that there is no alternative location for the cable

except through the sanctuary. ONMS also considers how the
project might affect resources, impact site value and existing uses,
and potential risk mitigation strategies, weighing these factors
against the socioeconomic and security implications of the project.
The need for a thorough review was demonstrated when Meta at-
tempted to install an undersea cable off the coast of Tillamook
County, Oregon. A drill bit broke during installation, leaving 1,000
feet of steel pipe on the seafloor and a spill of 6,500 gallons of drill-
ing fluid. Meta paid less than $400,000 in damages and fees but
abandoned the equipment.5
This bill would also prevent NOAA from assessing fair market
rents and fees for the use of marine sanctuaries, as is the practice
under current law. Onshore agencies like the National Park Serv-
ice and Bureau of Land Management charge rent for telecommuni-
cations rights-of-way,6 but this bill would exempt companies from
paying fair compensation for the use of public resources. The bill
would also eliminate NOAA’s environmental review authority, re-
moving safeguards for our nation’s most precious natural, cultural,
and historical resources in sanctuaries.
Additionally, the bill would transfer federal authority over pro-
tected marine areas to state agencies and other federal agencies,
eliminating uniform environmental protections under the NMSA
and creating a patchwork of inconsistent standards. The bill fails
to specify which agencies could permit these activities and which
permits, leases, or licenses would apply. Because the list of applica-
ble permits and licenses is unknown, it is unclear whether NOAA
would have the authority to ensure sensitive ecological or cul-
turally significant areas are avoided or whether there are safe-
guards for Tribal consultation. This could violate Tribal sovereignty
and government-to-government communication requirements.7
Some sanctuaries are co-managed with coastal treaty Tribes who
would be excluded from management decisions affecting their trea-
ty rights.
The bill’s language would also strike key provisions from the
NMSA for all special use permits. These provisions require 5-year
renewals for special use permits and require NOAA to ensure that
activities carried out under a special use permit be conducted ‘‘in
a manner that does not destroy, cause the loss of, or injure sanc-
tuary resources.’’8
During committee markup, Democrats offered an amendment to
address the main concerns with the bill and preserve some basic
safeguards under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. This
amendment would have allowed NOAA to collect rents, consult, en-
sure avoidance of sensitive areas, and verify bonding or insurance
coverage. It would also have defined applicable state agencies and
required public notice for permits and licenses issued in lieu of spe-

tering existing requirements regarding interagency cooperation under section 304(d)
in any Federal agency action described in that section and involving the installation,

SEC. 3. REMOVING RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES COVERED BY SANCTUARY SPECIAL USE
PERMITS.
Section 310(c) of National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1441(c)) is amend-
ed—
(1) in paragraph (1), by adding ‘‘and’’ at the end;
(2) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3); and
(3) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (2).
Amend the title so as to read:
A bill to amend the National Marine Sanctuaries Act to prohibit
the Secretary of Commerce from prohibiting, or requiring any per-
mit or other authorization for, the installation, continued presence,
operation, maintenance, repair, or recovery of undersea fiber optic
cables in a national marine sanctuary if such activities have been
authorized by a Federal or State agency.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 261, as ordered reported, is to amend the
National Marine Sanctuaries Act to prohibit the Secretary of Com-
merce from prohibiting, or requiring any permit or other authoriza-
tion for, the installation, continued presence, operation, mainte-
nance, repair, or recovery of undersea fiber optic cables in a na-
tional marine sanctuary if such activities have been authorized by
a Federal or State agency.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Undersea cables have been used for more than 170 years1 and
are largely responsible for the growth of international tele-
communications systems in recent decades. The current undersea
cable network connects every continent except Antarctica and ‘‘car-
ries about 95% of intercontinental global internet traffic, and 99%
of transoceanic digital communications . . . including trillions in
international financial transactions daily.’’2 The Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) grants cable landing licenses for 25
years. However, like many other types of projects, the process to
site, install, and approve these cables typically involves numerous
agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Under the National
Marine Sanctuary Act (NMSA), the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration has the authority to issue Special Use Per-
mits (SUPs) for certain categories of activities within a national
marine sanctuary, if it is determined that the activity is needed to
establish access to its resources or ‘‘promote public use and under-
standing of a sanctuary resource.’’ SUPs can often take years to ac-
quire and can come with additional burdens and costs. Addition-
ally, it has been noted that over the last 20 years, no new cables

have been constructed within national marine sanctuaries due to
regulatory burdens, including the SUP process.3
H.R. 261, as amended, addresses this issue by prohibiting the
Secretary of Commerce from requiring any additional permit or au-
thorization for an undersea cable in a sanctuary, including a SUP.
Additionally, the bill removes the five-year timeline for SUPs in
order to allow for broader activities within national marine sanc-
tuaries.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 261 was introduced on January 9, 2025, by Rep. Earl L.
‘‘Buddy’’ Carter (R–GA). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee
on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries. On January 23, 2025, the Sub-
committee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held a hearing on the
bill. On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural Resources met
to consider the bill. The Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fish-
eries was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 261 by
unanimous consent. Chairman Bruce Westerman (R–AR) offered an
Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute designated
Westerman_022 ANS. The Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-
stitute was agreed to by voice vote. Ranking Member Jared
Huffman (D–CA) offered an amendment to the Amendment in the
Nature of a Substitute designated Huffman #1. The amendment

DISSENTING VIEWS
H.R. 261 would prohibit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) from requiring any authorization for the
installation, continued presence, operation, maintenance, repair, or
recovery of undersea fiber optic cables in a National Marine Sanc-
tuary (NMS) if those activities have been previously approved by
other Federal or State agencies. The bill would remove NOAA’s au-
thority under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) to con-
duct environmental review and charge fair market fees for major
infrastructure projects in federally protected marine areas.
The National Marine Sanctuary System is a network of 17 na-
tional marine sanctuaries and two marine monuments covering
over 629,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters.1
Congress established the system to safeguard America’s natural
and cultural marine resources while supporting their sustainable
use. Recreational users frequent sanctuaries for activities such as
boating, kayaking, wildlife viewing, and recreational fishing that’s
permitted within approximately 98% of the sanctuary system.2 The
sanctuary system generates $8 billion in annual revenue and plays
a critical role in preserving coastal ecosystems.3
Under section 310 of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act,
NOAA may issue special use permits (SUPs) for activities within
sanctuaries that are compatible with sanctuary purposes and do
not destroy sanctuary resources. One such activity is the installa-
tion of submarine fiber optic cables, which facilitates internet ac-
cess and telecommunications. NOAA conducts environmental re-
view, assesses applicants’ readiness, examines installation meth-
ods, and confirms no alternative location exists outside the sanc-
tuary. NOAA also considers environmental impacts and consults
with partner agencies and affected tribes. While ecosystems in
some sanctuaries can recover from cable installation within months
or years, cables can potentially cause long-term impacts that dis-
rupt essential sanctuary features such as benthic habitat, water
quality, and ocean noise levels.4
To obtain a permit for cable installation and maintenance, the
Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) conducts an envi-
ronmental review and consults with partner agencies. The permit
review includes an assessment of applicants’ professional and fi-
nancial readiness, examination of proposed installation methods,
and confirmation that there is no alternative location for the cable

except through the sanctuary. ONMS also considers how the
project might affect resources, impact site value and existing uses,
and potential risk mitigation strategies, weighing these factors
against the socioeconomic and security implications of the project.
The need for a thorough review was demonstrated when Meta at-
tempted to install an undersea cable off the coast of Tillamook
County, Oregon. A drill bit broke during installation, leaving 1,000
feet of steel pipe on the seafloor and a spill of 6,500 gallons of drill-
ing fluid. Meta paid less than $400,000 in damages and fees but
abandoned the equipment.5
This bill would also prevent NOAA from assessing fair market
rents and fees for the use of marine sanctuaries, as is the practice
under current law. Onshore agencies like the National Park Serv-
ice and Bureau of Land Management charge rent for telecommuni-
cations rights-of-way,6 but this bill would exempt companies from
paying fair compensation for the use of public resources. The bill
would also eliminate NOAA’s environmental review authority, re-
moving safeguards for our nation’s most precious natural, cultural,
and historical resources in sanctuaries.
Additionally, the bill would transfer federal authority over pro-
tected marine areas to state agencies and other federal agencies,
eliminating uniform environmental protections under the NMSA
and creating a patchwork of inconsistent standards. The bill fails
to specify which agencies could permit these activities and which
permits, leases, or licenses would apply. Because the list of applica-
ble permits and licenses is unknown, it is unclear whether NOAA
would have the authority to ensure sensitive ecological or cul-
turally significant areas are avoided or whether there are safe-
guards for Tribal consultation. This could violate Tribal sovereignty
and government-to-government communication requirements.7
Some sanctuaries are co-managed with coastal treaty Tribes who
would be excluded from management decisions affecting their trea-
ty rights.
The bill’s language would also strike key provisions from the
NMSA for all special use permits. These provisions require 5-year
renewals for special use permits and require NOAA to ensure that
activities carried out under a special use permit be conducted ‘‘in
a manner that does not destroy, cause the loss of, or injure sanc-
tuary resources.’’8
During committee markup, Democrats offered an amendment to
address the main concerns with the bill and preserve some basic
safeguards under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. This
amendment would have allowed NOAA to collect rents, consult, en-
sure avoidance of sensitive areas, and verify bonding or insurance
coverage. It would also have defined applicable state agencies and
required public notice for permits and licenses issued in lieu of spe-
