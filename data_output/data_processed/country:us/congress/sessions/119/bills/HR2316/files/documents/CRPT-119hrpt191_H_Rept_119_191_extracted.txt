119THCONGRESS REPORT
1st Session " HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ! 119–191
WETLANDS CONSERVATION AND ACCESS
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2025
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 2316]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 2316) to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restora-
tion Act to provide that interest on obligations held in the Federal
aid to wildlife restoration fund shall become available for appor-
tionment at the beginning of fiscal year 2033, having considered
the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and rec-
ommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 2316 is to amend the Pittman-Robertson
Wildlife Restoration Act to provide that interest on obligations held
in the Federal aid to wildlife restoration fund shall become avail-
able for apportionment at the beginning of fiscal year 2033.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman-Robert-
son), enacted in 1937, distributes federal aid to all 50 states and
5 U.S. territories to carry out wildlife restoration, conservation, and
hunter education and safety programs. Revenue for Pittman-Rob-
ertson is generated through an excise tax on all firearms, ammuni-
tion, and archery equipment.1 The Service administers Pittman-
Robertson and allocates funding through three programs: the Wild-
life Restoration Program, the Basic Hunter Education and Safety
Program, and the Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety Pro-

gram. The Wildlife Restoration Program aids in funding state fish
and wildlife programs and allocates funding for projects that re-
store, conserve, and enhance native habitats. Through this pro-
gram, states may use funding to purchase, restore, manage, and fa-
cilitate public access to wildlife areas.2 The formula used for appor-
tionment to each state is one-third based on the total land area of
the state and two-thirds based on the population of each state.3
H.R. 2316 extends the period in which the interest accrued on
unallocated Pittman-Robertson funds can be used to supplement
congressional appropriations to the North American Wetlands Con-
servation Act (NAWCA). This provision is set to expire on Sep-
tember 30, 2025.4 Without reauthorization of this provision, the in-
terest would be distributed to states and territories under the cur-
rent Pittman-Robertson apportionment formula. The Association of
Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which represents the states, is sup-
portive of H.R. 2316.5
NAWCA provides grants to projects that conserve wetland habi-
tats critical for migratory birds in the United States, Canada, and
Mexico. According to the Service, over its nearly 40-year history
NAWCA has benefitted nearly 34 million acres of wetland habitat
for migratory waterfowl through 3,300 individual projects.6 This
success is why Congress reauthorized NAWCA as a part of the
America’s Conservation Enhancement (ACE) Reauthorization Act
in December 2024.7
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 2316 was introduced on March 25, 2025, by Representative
Jeff Hurd (R–CO). The bill was referred to the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee on
Water, Wildlife and Fisheries. On April 8, 2025, the Subcommittee
on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held a hearing on the bill. On
June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural Resources met to con-
sider the bill. The Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries
was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2316 by unani-
mous consent. The bill was ordered favorably reported to the House
of Representatives by unanimous consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing by the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held on
April 8, 2025.
