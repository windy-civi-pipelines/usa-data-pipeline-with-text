PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1823, the ‘‘VA Budget Shortfall Accountability Act,’’ was in-
troduced by Rep. Jack Bergman of Michigan on March 4, 2025. The
bill, as amended, would require the Comptroller General to conduct
a review of the circumstances surrounding the expected shortfall
for Fiscal Year 2024 and require an annual review thereafter of the
funding situation at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Spe-
cifically, it would require the Comptroller General to perform an
audit of various accounting systems and procedures at VA that led
to inaccurate financial projections and false claims of a funding
shortfall in fiscal year (FY) 2024 and 2025. This bill, as amended,
would ensure that such budgeting mistakes do not happen again
and would prevent the overall mismanagement of billions of dollars
in taxpayer funds.

BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Budget Shortfall Accountability
Act.’’
Section 2: Funding Shortfalls in Certain Administrations of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs: Review; Reports
In July 2024, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) informed
Congress that the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) would
need almost $2.9 billion in emergency funding for the remainder of
FY 2024, citing an impending shortfall that may hinder the deliv-
ery of veterans’ benefits. VA also informed Congress that the Vet-
erans Health Administration (VHA) may need an additional $12
billion in funding in FY 2025 based on financial projections.
In August 2024, VA requested supplemental appropriations of
$12 billion to cover medical care for the rest of FY 2024 and all of
FY 2025 at VHA.
In September 2024, Congress approved the funding for VBA to
avert potential delays in payments to approximately 7 million vet-
erans and beneficiaries (P.L. 118–82). In that bill, Congress also re-
quired the VA Office of Inspector General to review the cir-
cumstances that led to projected funding shortfalls at VBA and
VHA.
In October 2024, VA officials acknowledged significant errors in
their budget projections. VA said that without the supplemental
funding Congress had already appropriated, VBA would have car-
ried over approximately $2.1 billion in the compensation and pen-
sion account and over $92 million in the readjustment benefits ac-
count, thus negating the need for the supplemental funding re-
quest. In November, VHA also revised its estimated shortfall from
$12 billion to $6.6 billion for only the remainder of FY 2025.
In mid-March 2025, Congress passed a continuing resolution to
fund VA’s remaining FY 2025 medical care using $6 billion from
the Toxic Exposure Fund.
VA attributed the initial miscalculations to unprecedented in-
creases in benefits claims and health care utilization. VA delivered
a record $187 billion in benefits (including $173 billion in com-
pensation and pension benefits) to 6.7 million veterans and bene-
ficiaries in 2024. VA also processed a record 2,517,519 disability
benefit claims, a 27% increase over the year prior. Further, VA pro-
vided a record 127.5 million health care appointments in fiscal
2024—a 6% rise from the previous year.
VA’s inaccurate requests for emergency funding caused panic
among veterans and their families, who were worried about delays
and cuts in VA services. The Committee was concerned that the
misleading information would undermine public faith in VA as an
institution and that these errors in accounting suggested a much
larger issue with VA management overall.
The Committee recognizes that veterans must be able to trust
VA to provide their promised benefits and healthcare. As such,
H.R. 1823, as amended, would require the Comptroller General to
perform an internal audit of VA’s accounting systems and proce-
dures, which resulted in VA’s incorrect 2024 budget projections.
The bill, as amended, would ensure that such a budgeting mistake

does not happen again and would prevent the mismanagement of
federal funds.
Through this and subsequent reviews by the Comptroller Gen-
eral, the Committee believes H.R. 1823, as amended, will hold the
VA responsible for its stewardship of taxpayer dollars and the care,
benefits, and services that are delivered to veterans and their bene-
ficiaries.

COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion to consider H.R. 1823, as amended. During consideration of
the bill, the following amendments were considered:
An amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1823 of-
fered by Representative Bergman was agreed to by voice vote.
The amendment in the nature of a substitute would direct the
Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a forensic
audit on an annual basis until calendar year 2031.
A substitute amendment to the amendment in the nature of
a substitute to H.R. 1823 offered by Representative Delia Ra-
mirez of Illinois would strike the entirety of the bill and
change its focus from oversight over the previous administra-
tion, to the production of a report concerning all communica-
tion within VA that discusses any policy, directive, or guidance
from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to the
Secretary relating to the management of VA employees. The
amendment failed by a recorded vote of 11 yeas, 13 nays.

atives and the U.S. Senate any evidence of wrongdoing in VA
budget mismanagement. The amendment failed by a recorded
vote of 11 yeas, 13 nays.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1823 offered by Ranking Member Takano would

and require a written notice to Congress 15 days prior to the
termination of an employee. The amendment failed by a re-
corded vote of 11 yeas, 13 nays.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 1823, as amended, are to ensure that VA submits
to Congress accurate information supporting the President’s Budg-
et and to help prevent funding shortfalls for VA.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 1823, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate on H.R. 1823,
as amended, prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST
ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1823,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant
to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
H.R. 1823 would require the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to report to the Congress on the causes of funding shortfalls
in appropriation accounts for health care, disability compensation,
and education benefits that the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) anticipated would occur in 2024 and 2025. The bill also would
require GAO to report annually, for five years, VA’s spending plans

for those accounts, deviations from those spending plans, and
transfers from those accounts.
Based on the costs of similar studies and reports, CBO estimates
that fulfilling the bill’s reporting requirements would cost less than
$500,000 over the 2025–2029 period; such spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Noah Callahan. The
estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Di-
rector of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Con-
trol Act (as amended by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandate
Reform Act, P.L. 104–4), is inapplicable to H.R. 1823, as amended.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees, within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act would be created by H.R. 1823, as
amended.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H.R. 1823, as amended, does not relate
to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public serv-
ices or accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of
the Congressional Accountability Act.
STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1823, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short title
This section would establish the short title as the ‘‘VA Budget
Shortfall Accountability Act.’’
Section 2: Funding shortfalls in certain administrations of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs: reviews; reports
Section 2(a) would require the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to review the circumstances and causes of the funding short-
fall in the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) for fiscal year
2024 and the expected funding shortfall in the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration (VHA) in fiscal year 2025. In the review, GAO would
examine VBA and VHA’s relevant accounts, compare monthly obli-
gations and expenditures against VA’s spending plan, identify sig-
nificant diversions from the spending plan and their causes, and

analyze the accuracy of projections or estimates relevant to such di-
versions. This review would also include remedial actions that the
VA Secretary may take to ensure that VA submits to Congress ac-
curate information supporting the President’s Budget and to pre-
vent future funding shortfalls for VA. GAO would submit the re-
view to the Secretary within 30 days of completion.
Section 2(b) would require GAO to submit annual reviews for the
next five calendar years. Each review would examine the most re-
cent fiscal year.
Section 2(c) would require VA to submit reviews to the Commit-
tees on Veterans’ Affairs and Appropriations in the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate. Each review would be due to Congress
within 30 days from when the Secretary receives the review from
GAO.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill, as amended, requires the U.S. Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) to conduct a review of the circumstances sur-
rounding the budget shortfalls at the Veterans Benefits Adminis-
tration (VBA) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in
fiscal year (FY) 2024 and FY 2025, respectively. The review must
include a comparison of monthly obligations in the relevant ac-
counts, the reasons for any significant diversions from the spending
plan, an analysis of the accuracy of any estimates, and rec-
ommendations on remedial actions the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs (VA) can take to improve projection accuracy and avoid future
shortfalls. GAO will submit the report to VA, who must report it
to the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs and Appropriations
Committees.
The A.N.S. to this bill requires GAO to do an initial review and
then complete subsequent reviews for five years following the date
of enactment, reviewing requests for subsequent fiscal years.
Committee Democrats are concerned that this bill is duplicative
of existing Office of Inspector General efforts. The Office of Inspec-
tor General (OIG) recently issued two reports, which were man-
dated by the Veterans Benefits Continuity and Accountability Sup-
plemental Appropriations Act 2024 (P.L. 118–82). Those reports
identified that VA’s existing accounting and budget technological
infrastructure is a primary cause of the shortcomings in VA’s moni-
toring of budget execution that led to the shortfall. This bill does
nothing to address that and other underlying causes, and instead
seems to be designed to reopen investigation of previous errors.
To Committee Democrats’ knowledge, the Majority did not con-
sult with GAO on this legislation and in fact did not seek technical
assistance from GAO to ensure the request complies with GAO’s
standard operating procedures and comment periods.
Additionally, GAO is already working on a report related to this
issue. GAO’s review, which it initiated under its Comptroller Gen-
eral authority (i.e. not based on a request or mandate from Con-
gress), has much of the same scope as this bill; although, it does
not address the VBA portions of the bill.
Committee Democrats are concerned that Rep. Bergman’s legisla-
tion duplicates work that VA oversight bodies, including OIG and
GAO, are already doing. It is especially concerning that it was in-
cluded in this markup in the context of the letter the Chairman re-
cently sent to the Department of Justice, urging the Attorney Gen-
eral to investigate three former Biden administration officials for
criminal wrongdoing in handling last year’s budget shortfall. This
bill should be viewed as political retaliation; it is not serious over-
sight.
Finally, Committee Democrats are disappointed that the Major-
ity did not accept any amendments offered by our members at

markup. Due to this bill’s focus on VA’s budget requests, Demo-
cratic amendments focused on ensuring that the ongoing workforce
changes, accountability at VA, and other efforts will in fact improve
VA’s budget and not impact veteran care. These amendments in-
cluded:
1. Substitute Amendment offered by Rep. Ramirez: Requires
VA to report to Congress within 30 days all documents related
to the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) involve-
ment at VA related to VA workforce actions (to include termi-
nations, reductions in force, and reorganization plans); VA con-
tract terminations or recompetes; and VA data systems which
DOGE has accessed.
2. Amendment offered by Rep. Takano: Requires the Attor-
ney General to submit to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs,
and the Committees on Appropriations, of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, any evidence of wrongdoing that is
in the possession of the Attorney General and collected in the
course of any ongoing or future investigation into alleged budg-
et mismanagement at VA. Given that the department and its
funding are under the oversight jurisdiction of these Commit-
tees, these bodies should have access to this information, and
yet the Majority declined to vote to make this a requirement.
This raises concerns that their ultimate goal with this legisla-
tion and in requesting ongoing investigation is not, in fact, le-
gitimate oversight efforts.
3. Amendment offered by Rep. Takano: Requires any savings
garnered from contract cancellations at VA, as ordered by
DOGE, to be reinvested into veteran care and employee serv-
ices. The Trump administration has claimed that the goal of
any potential savings is to reinvest them into veteran care, but
as DOGE is not a congressionally-established agency, it has no
obligation to follow through on these claims. Therefore, Com-
mittee Democrats are concerned that the Majority elected not
to support an amendment that would require VA to fulfill
these claims.
4. Amendment offered by Rep. Kennedy: Would add the text
of Rep. Kennedy’s legislation, H.R. 2722, which exempts VA
from hiring freezes, exempts veterans from RIFs, and rein-
states veterans who have been fired since Jan. 20. It also pro-
hibits removal of probationary employees at the department.
5. Amendment offered by Rep. Kennedy: Would exempt vet-
erans from planned or future reductions in force at the depart-
ment.
6. Amendment offered by Rep. Kennedy: Would exempt dis-
abled veterans from planned or future reductions in force at
the department. Committee Democrats feel that veterans who
have chosen to continue to serve their country through post-
service employment in the federal workforce at VA should not
be subject to any firings and should not bear the burden of any
attempts to ‘‘right size’’ the department’s workforce. Unfortu-
nately, the Majority does not appear to share that sentiment,
even for those veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice
and have permanent disabilities following their service.

7. Amendment offered by Rep. Budzinski: Would require VA
to brief Committees on Veterans’ Affairs, and the Committees
on Appropriations, of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives prior to its annual budget submission, and require that
all personnel involved in development of the budget submis-
sion, including employees of DOGE, participate in the briefing.
Committee Democrats believe GAO’s oversight resources could be
put to better use on more meaningful oversight of VA’s budget for-
mulation and execution—to include the role of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget in determining VA’s annual budget requests.
