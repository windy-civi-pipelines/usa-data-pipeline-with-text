Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 98]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 98) to require the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to establish a vetting process for prospective
applicants for high-cost universal service program funding, having
considered the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment
and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 98 is to direct the Federal Communications
Commission to initiate a rulemaking within 180 days establishing
a vetting process for applicants seeking funding, including through
a reverse competitive bidding mechanism, under the high-cost uni-
versal service program.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) high-cost pro-
gram provides funding via the Universal Service Fund (USF) to
carriers that provide service in rural areas. While the program
originally subsidized voice service, it has transitioned to providing
support for broadband expansion over the past decade.1 The high-

cost program is one of the Federal spending programs designed to
connect American homes and businesses to broadband.2
USF high-cost funds are awarded via model-based and legacy
rate-of-return direct subsidy mechanisms, including the Connect
American Cost Model, the Alternative Connect America Cost
Model, Enhanced-ACAM, and Connect America Fund Broadband
Loop Support.3 Additionally, reverse auctions award funds to car-
riers, wherein a bid represents how much funding a company
would require in exchange for servicing an area, with awards going
to the lowest bidders.
The FCC’s most recent high-cost reverse auction, the Rural Dig-
ital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), occurred in December 2020.
Through RDOF, 180 bidders won $9.23 billion to serve 5,220,833
locations in 49 States and one territory over 10 years.4 However,
a number of the winning bidders have had their awards revoked
by the FCC, defaulted on obligations, or surrendered locations back
to the FCC, and as a result, approximately 1.9 million of those lo-
cations will not ultimately be served by the RDOF program.5 For
example, in 2023, the FCC determined to deny the largest winning
bidder in the RDOF program, which had initially been awarded
$1.3 billion, concluding after further review that its application
‘‘was not reasonably capable of offering the required gigabit-speed,
low-latency service throughout the broad areas where it won auc-
tion support.’’6 In 2024, the FCC issued a second report and order
updating the 5G Fund established in 2020, through which the FCC
aims to make nearly $10 billion in USF support available to car-
riers deploying 5G networks in areas that today lack 5G coverage.7
Deploying network infrastructure in rural and other remote
areas can be difficult and expensive, even with Government sub-
sidies. This legislation, if enacted, would aim to ensure that appli-
cants for the USF high-cost program are able to build and operate
the networks and services that they are pledging to provide, while
simultaneously discouraging gamesmanship from nonserious bid-
ders.
To that end, this legislation would direct the FCC to initiate a
rulemaking requiring applicants to high-cost programs to provide
documentation demonstrating their technical, financial, and oper-
ational capability to deploy a network and deliver services in ac-
cordance with FCC requirements and as pledged by applicants. The
FCC would evaluate applicants’ proposals against reasonable and
well-established technical, financial, and operational standards, as

well as applicants’ history of complying with the FCC’s require-
ments and those of other Government broadband funding pro-
grams. The FCC would also establish penalties for applicants who
commit pre-authorization default—i.e., carriers that are unable to
build and operate the networks and services they pledge to provide.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 98, the Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2025, was intro-
duced on January 15, 2025, by Senator Capito (for herself and Sen-
ators Klobuchar and Curtis) and was referred to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On February
5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by
voice vote, ordered S. 98 reported favorably without amendment.
On March 11, 2025, Senator Peters was added as a cosponsor.
118TH CONGRESS
S. 275, the Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2024, was intro-
duced on February 7, 2023, by Senator Capito (for herself and Sen-
ator Klobuchar) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On July 31, 2024, the
Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, or-
dered S. 275 reported favorably with an amendment (in the nature
of a substitute). On September 25, 2024, S. 275 passed the Senate
by unanimous consent.
H.R. 7005, a House companion bill to S. 275, was introduced on
January 17, 2024, by Representative Curtis (for himself and Rep-
resentative Kuster) and was referred to the Committee on Energy
and Commerce of the House of Representatives.
117TH CONGRESS
S. 4126, the Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2022, was intro-
duced on May 3, 2022, by Senator Capito (for herself and Senator
Klobuchar) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

S. 98 would require the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to issue rules to amend the application review process for
the high cost universal service program, which seeks to expand
voice and broadband service in unserved or underserved areas.
Specifically, the bill would require the FCC to evaluate applicants
and funding recipients based on a set of criteria specified in the
bill. Recent awards for the high cost program have been made
through auctions run by the FCC. The bill would establish min-
imum civil monetary penalties for bidders who win an auction and
subsequently default on their service obligations prior to receiving
funding.
Because the FCC currently evaluates applicants for this pro-
gram, CBO expects that the rules issued under S. 98 would mostly
codify the commission’s current policies. On that basis, CBO esti-
mates that it would cost the FCC less than $500,000 to issue rules
amending the current review process. The FCC is authorized to col-
lect fees each year sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its
regulatory activities; thus, CBO estimates that the net cost for the
FCC to implement the bill would be negligible, assuming appro-
priation actions consistent with that authority.
Under current law, the FCC has broad authority to levy civil
monetary penalties, which are recorded in the budget as revenues.
Using that authority, the commission currently issues rules for
each auction that include penalties for winning bidders that default
on their service obligations prior to receiving funding. S. 98 would
set minimum penalties for defaulting entities at an amount higher
than the amounts the FCC has set for recent auctions.
Using information from the FCC about the size of penalties col-
lected for previous defaults and the uncertainty about the timing
of future auctions, CBO estimates that enacting S. 98 would in-
crease revenues by an insignificant amount over the 2025–2035 pe-
riod. In CBO’s estimation, any significant increases in penalty col-
lections under S. 98 would be unlikely to occur before 2036.
If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of
implementing provisions in the bill, S. 98 would increase the cost

of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay
those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate
would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold es-
tablished in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for pri-
vate-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for
inflation).
S. 98 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are David Hughes (for
federal costs), Nate Frentz (for revenues) and Rachel Austin (for
mandates). The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.

Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
NUMBER OF PERSONS COVERED
S. 98, as reported, would direct the FCC to establish a vetting
process for applicants seeking funding via the high-cost universal
service program. The vetting process would require applicants to
provide documentation demonstrating their technical, financial,
and operational capability to deploy a network and deliver services
in accordance with FCC requirements and as pledged by appli-
cants. While the legislation would affect the FCC, the vetting proc-
ess for applicants is limited to new covered funding awards. As
such, it would only affect additional persons if the FCC established
a new covered funding award.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
S. 98 is not expected to have an adverse impact on the Nation’s
economy. The legislation would help the FCC ensure that appli-
cants for high-cost funding are able to deliver on their commit-
ments.
PRIVACY
S. 98 would not impact the personal privacy of individuals.
PAPERWORK
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work burdens for private individuals or businesses resulting from
the passage of this legislation. First, the new vetting process would
only apply if the FCC established a new covered funding award.
Moreover, the FCC has historically held vetting processes for appli-
cants prior to issuing funding awards.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions

contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 3:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 4:
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the legislation may be cited as
the ‘‘Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2025’’.

Section 5:
Section 2. Vetting process for prospective high-cost Universal Service
Fund applicants
This section would amend section 254 of the Communications Act
of 1934,8 which establishes the FCC’s universal service program.

Section 6:
Section 254 would be amended by adding a subsection (m) requir-
ing the FCC to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish a vet-
ting process for applicants for high-cost program funding within
180 days of the law’s enactment. The resulting FCC rules would re-
quire applicants for new FCC funding awards to document their
technical, financial, and operational capabilities, as well as a rea-
sonable business plan, for deploying and operating the networks
they are pledging to stand up. The rules would also require the
FCC to evaluate an applicant’s proposal against well-established
FCC standards, as well as the applicant’s history of compliance
with FCC program requirements and those of other Government
broadband funding programs. Finally, the rules would have to set
the penalty for pre-authorization defaults to be at least $9,000 per
violation but no less than 30 percent of an applicant’s total support,
unless the FCC were to demonstrate the need for a lower penalty
in a particular instance.

Rules of the Senate, changes in existing law made by the bill, as

well as applicants’ history of complying with the FCC’s require-
ments and those of other Government broadband funding pro-
grams. The FCC would also establish penalties for applicants who
commit pre-authorization default—i.e., carriers that are unable to
build and operate the networks and services they pledge to provide.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 98, the Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2025, was intro-
duced on January 15, 2025, by Senator Capito (for herself and Sen-
ators Klobuchar and Curtis) and was referred to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On February
5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by
voice vote, ordered S. 98 reported favorably without amendment.
On March 11, 2025, Senator Peters was added as a cosponsor.

duced on May 3, 2022, by Senator Capito (for herself and Senator
Klobuchar) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

S. 98 would require the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to issue rules to amend the application review process for
the high cost universal service program, which seeks to expand
voice and broadband service in unserved or underserved areas.
Specifically, the bill would require the FCC to evaluate applicants
and funding recipients based on a set of criteria specified in the
bill. Recent awards for the high cost program have been made
through auctions run by the FCC. The bill would establish min-
imum civil monetary penalties for bidders who win an auction and
subsequently default on their service obligations prior to receiving
funding.
Because the FCC currently evaluates applicants for this pro-
gram, CBO expects that the rules issued under S. 98 would mostly
codify the commission’s current policies. On that basis, CBO esti-
mates that it would cost the FCC less than $500,000 to issue rules
amending the current review process. The FCC is authorized to col-
lect fees each year sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its
regulatory activities; thus, CBO estimates that the net cost for the
FCC to implement the bill would be negligible, assuming appro-
priation actions consistent with that authority.
Under current law, the FCC has broad authority to levy civil
monetary penalties, which are recorded in the budget as revenues.
Using that authority, the commission currently issues rules for
each auction that include penalties for winning bidders that default
on their service obligations prior to receiving funding. S. 98 would
set minimum penalties for defaulting entities at an amount higher
than the amounts the FCC has set for recent auctions.
Using information from the FCC about the size of penalties col-
lected for previous defaults and the uncertainty about the timing
of future auctions, CBO estimates that enacting S. 98 would in-
crease revenues by an insignificant amount over the 2025–2035 pe-
riod. In CBO’s estimation, any significant increases in penalty col-
lections under S. 98 would be unlikely to occur before 2036.
If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of
implementing provisions in the bill, S. 98 would increase the cost

of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay
those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate
would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold es-
tablished in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for pri-
vate-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for
inflation).
S. 98 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are David Hughes (for
federal costs), Nate Frentz (for revenues) and Rachel Austin (for
mandates). The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
NUMBER OF PERSONS COVERED
S. 98, as reported, would direct the FCC to establish a vetting
process for applicants seeking funding via the high-cost universal
service program. The vetting process would require applicants to
provide documentation demonstrating their technical, financial,
and operational capability to deploy a network and deliver services
in accordance with FCC requirements and as pledged by appli-
cants. While the legislation would affect the FCC, the vetting proc-
ess for applicants is limited to new covered funding awards. As
such, it would only affect additional persons if the FCC established
a new covered funding award.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
S. 98 is not expected to have an adverse impact on the Nation’s
economy. The legislation would help the FCC ensure that appli-
cants for high-cost funding are able to deliver on their commit-
ments.
PRIVACY
S. 98 would not impact the personal privacy of individuals.
PAPERWORK
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work burdens for private individuals or businesses resulting from
the passage of this legislation. First, the new vetting process would
only apply if the FCC established a new covered funding award.
Moreover, the FCC has historically held vetting processes for appli-
cants prior to issuing funding awards.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions

contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the legislation may be cited as
the ‘‘Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Vetting process for prospective high-cost Universal Service
Fund applicants
This section would amend section 254 of the Communications Act
of 1934,8 which establishes the FCC’s universal service program.
Section 254 would be amended by adding a subsection (m) requir-
ing the FCC to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish a vet-
ting process for applicants for high-cost program funding within
180 days of the law’s enactment. The resulting FCC rules would re-
quire applicants for new FCC funding awards to document their
technical, financial, and operational capabilities, as well as a rea-
sonable business plan, for deploying and operating the networks
they are pledging to stand up. The rules would also require the
FCC to evaluate an applicant’s proposal against well-established
FCC standards, as well as the applicant’s history of compliance
with FCC program requirements and those of other Government
broadband funding programs. Finally, the rules would have to set
the penalty for pre-authorization defaults to be at least $9,000 per
violation but no less than 30 percent of an applicant’s total support,
unless the FCC were to demonstrate the need for a lower penalty
in a particular instance.
