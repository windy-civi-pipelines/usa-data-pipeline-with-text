PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H. Res. 114 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to trans-
mit to the House of Representatives certain documents relating to
Department of Homeland Security policies and activities related to
domestic preparedness and collective response to terrorism and the
Department’s cybersecurity activities.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Clause 7 of House rule XIII provides that, if properly drafted, a
resolution of inquiry is provided special parliamentary status al-
lowing the Committee to which the measure was referred to be dis-
charged if the Committee has not reported the measure back to the
House within 14 legislative days after its introduction. The Com-
mittee notes that the consideration of this resolution of inquiry is
to have the Committee comply with rule XIII; it does not affect the
Committee’s obligation or commitment to investigate and require
documentation from the Administration on issues within the Com-
mittee’s jurisdictional authorities. The Committee will investigate
any credible allegation of misconduct in the Executive Branch to
the extent that such allegations fall within the Committee’s juris-
diction.
HEARINGS
No hearings were held to inform H. Res. 114 during the 119th
Congress.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee ad-
vises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee,
based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X, are in-
corporated in the descriptive portions of this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE, NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY,
ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII and section 308(a) of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974, and clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII and section 402
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, are inapplicable because
H. Res. 114 does not provide any new budget authority, spending
authority, or increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures.
The Committee expects that implementing H. Res. 114 would not
produce any budgetary effects.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
An estimate of Federal mandates prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Committee finds
that no Federal mandates are included in the resolution.
DUPLICATIVE FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII, the Committee finds that H.
Res. 114 does not contain any provision that establishes or reau-
thorizes a program known to be duplicative of another Federal pro-
gram.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the objective of H. Res.
114 is to obtain documents and information from the Department
of Homeland Security.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED
TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with rule XXI, this bill, as reported, contains no
congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff bene-
fits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of rule XXI.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H. Res. 114 does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodation within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

MINORITY VIEWS
H. Res. 114 directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
to provide the Committee on Homeland Security any information
in its possession related to the security implications of halting dis-
bursement of DHS grant funds. In January, the President barred
departments and agencies from awarding congressionally author-
ized and funded Federal grants, creating chaos throughout the Fed-
eral Government and among grantees. As directed by Congress,
DHS administers a range of grants—including for disaster re-
sponse, terrorism prevention, and first responders—primarily to
State and local governments. Given the important role DHS grants
play in the security and resilience of communities across the coun-
try, it is critical that the Committee understand whether and what
analysis DHS performed regarding how freezing grant funds would
affect national preparedness, disaster response, and first respond-
ers prior to implementing the President’s grant freeze.
One of the most chaotic days of the second Trump presidency
was January 27, when the White House issued a careless and slop-
py memo telling Federal agencies to stop providing Federal grant
funding to State and local governments across the country. The
memo was so bad that courts had to intervene to prevent it from
taking effect, and after publicly defending it, the White House re-
scinded the memo.1
Even with court intervention and the White House attempting to
rescind the memo, there are still reports that Federal grants are
being withheld from our communities.
H. Res. 114 demands transparency on the impact of blocking crit-
ical DHS grants, which directly threatens national security by cut-
ting vital funding for first responders, disaster recovery, and com-
munity safety programs—creating chaos and undermining our pre-
paredness. For example, DHS’s Transit Security Grant Program is
the primary means through which the Federal Government pro-
vides security support to mass transit, passenger rail, ferries, and
bus systems. Trump’s attempted grants freeze—combined with his
tearing down of key transportation advisory committees and firing
of TSA and FAA employees—puts our transportation systems at
greater risk, even as we experience a shocking increase in trans-
portation accidents.
This Committee needs to know who from DHS thought it was a
good idea to jeopardize this funding and their rationale and re-
search, if any, on the implications of doing so. Because right now,
none of that has been shared with the Committee or the public.
Donald Trump’s decision to block congressionally authorized Fed-
eral grants has halted crucial funding for programs like the Urban

Area Security Initiative, the State Homeland Security Program, the
Nonprofit Security Grant Program, the State and Local Cybersecu-
rity Grant Program—each vital for emergency response, terrorism
prevention, and law enforcement support. Chaotic disruptions of
grant funds leave the boots on the ground in a lurch, undermine
the goals of the grant programs, and attack national security.
Republicans who doubt the impact of the grant funding freeze
memo would do well to reach out to their State and local govern-
ments and first responders and ask them about the impact of Don-
ald Trump’s threat to take away DHS funding.
The grant funding freeze means that State and local govern-
ments and first responders may not get reimbursed for the millions
they have already spent to protect and support our communities—
dollars promised to them by the Federal Government. At a min-
imum, the payments will be delayed—and communities cannot af-
ford to go months or years without being paid back due to a dis-
organized and shoddy memo from Donald Trump—nor should they
have to.
The DHS grants that are under threat by the Trump administra-
tion are ones that this Committee has supported in a bipartisan
fashion for years. Every Member of Congress should be alarmed
that—with a push of a button, without even a conversation or let-
ter to Congress—the Trump administration is undermining support
for first responders back home.
Democrats on this Committee are committed to safeguarding na-
tional security, but regrettably, by adversely reporting H. Res. 114,
Committee Republicans have stopped our efforts to conduct effec-
tive oversight of the Trump administration’s chaotic disruptions of
grant funds.
