PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 4275, as amended, is to authorize and
amend authorities, programs, and statutes administered by the
Coast Guard and to establish a Secretary of the Coast Guard, and
for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 4275, as amended, is to authorize funding
for the United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service) in fis-
cal years (FY) 2025 through FY 2029 to support Coast Guard oper-
ations, major acquisitions and capital investment efforts and to es-
tablish a Secretary of the Coast Guard. The bill authorizes a
growth of active-duty personnel for the Coast Guard to 50,000 for
each of fiscal years 2025 and 2026, 55,000 for fiscal year 2027 and
60,000 for each of fiscal years 2028 and 2029 following a dem-
onstration of a sufficient Administration budget request to support
that end strength level. The bill establishes a Service Secretary for
the Coast Guard and makes reforms to Coast Guard authorities
and laws governing maritime commerce and navigation. It im-
proves vessel safety, clarifies authorities for emerging technologies,
and improves regulatory processes. It also includes provisions to
strengthen protections for members of the Coast Guard from sexual
assault and sexual harassment and increases transparency within
the Service.
Coast Guard
The Coast Guard was established on January 28, 1915, through
the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service (established in
1790) and the Lifesaving Service (established in 1848).1 The Coast
Guard later assumed the duties of three other agencies: the Light-
house Service (established in 1789), the Steamboat Inspection Serv-
ice (established in 1838), and the Bureau of Navigation (established
in 1884).2
Under Section 102 of title 14, United States Code, the Coast
Guard has primary responsibility to enforce or assist in the en-
forcement of all applicable Federal laws on, under, and over the
high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States; to ensure the safety of life and property at sea; to carry out
domestic and international icebreaking activities; and, as one of the
six armed forces of the United States, to maintain defense readi-
ness and operate as a specialized service in the Navy upon the dec-
laration of war or when the President directs.3 The Coast Guard
is composed of approximately 41,000 active-duty military members,
7,000 reservists, and 8,700 civilian employees.4
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, the Coast Guard interdicted 3,687 out
of the 14,211 known maritime illegal immigrants (25.8 percent).
The Coast Guard was responsible for 72 percent of maritime inter-
dictions completed by United States Government agencies in FY
2024. During the same fiscal year, the Coast Guard removed

106,290.1 kilograms of cocaine and 41,799.1 pounds of marijuana
worth an estimated $3.24 billion.5
H.R. 4275, as amended, authorizes the Coast Guard for the next
five years at fiscally responsible levels to continue carrying out
these critical missions, with support to revitalize afloat and air as-
sets, improve the Coast Guard’s crumbling shoreside infrastructure
and facilities, and revitalize antiquated IT systems.
Investments in the Coast Guard
The Coast Guard has endured chronic undercapitalization for
decades—jeopardizing the ability for the Service to carry out its
missions. As a consequence, many Coast Guard assets were, and
still are, operated well beyond their planned service life because
funds to carry out the recapitalization were not forthcoming. While
significant progress has been made in recapitalizing some assets,
heavy icebreakers, medium endurance cutters and rotary wing air-
craft are aging out before they can be replaced. The advanced age
and lack of maintenance on these legacy assets limits the amount
of time they are available to carry out Coast Guard mission and
increases maintenance costs.
To address these capability gaps, Congress approved Pub. L.
119–21, which provides $24.59 billion in investments for the Serv-
ice’s surface, air and shoreside assets.6 H.R. 4275, as amended,
builds on these investments by authorizing substantial growth over
the next five years in the Coast Guard’s Procurement, Construc-
tion, and Investment Account to finish the modernization of the ro-
tary wing fleet, complete the Waterway Commerce Cutter program,
build a Great Lakes icebreaker, slow the growth in the backlog of
shoreside projects, continue the growth of unmanned systems to
provide better maritime domain awareness, and build other future
Coast Guard capabilities. At the same time, H.R. 4275, as amend-
ed, authorizes substantial growth in the Coast Guard’s Operations
and Support Account, bringing the Service’s total annual authoriza-
tion to more than $20 billion by 2028.
While the Committee supports funding growth based on dem-
onstrated need, the Committee has significant concerns about the
Coast Guard’s ability to effectively carry out its major acquisition
programs. The Committee notes that nearly all of the Coast Guard
surface acquisition programs have suffered from cost overruns and
delays, and in some cases, the Service will be receiving fewer hulls
than the number for which they signed contracts. The Committee
is pleased with recent progress on the Polar Security Cutter Pro-
gram but has substantial concerns with the progress of the first
phase of the Offshore Patrol Cutter Program. The Committee con-
tinues to strongly support the domestic maritime industrial base—
both in terms of the economic benefits it brings to our country and
the national security readiness that it provides in times of war or
national emergency. Accordingly, H.R. 4275, as amended, strength-
ens the requirements of section 1151 of title 14, U.S.C., by man-
dating additional notification requirements should the President
determine a national security exemption from the prohibition on
foreign construction of Coast Guard cutters is necessary.

The Committee also recognizes the need for the Coast Guard to
update its aging fleet of air assets. While the Committee continues
to have concerns with the suitability of the MH–60 airframe for
certain Coast Guard missions, the Committee appreciates the need
to phase out MH–65 dolphin helicopters which are no longer being
produced and will suffer from a rapidly increasing scarcity of parts.
To support the Committee’s understanding of Coast Guard aircraft
needs, H.R. 4275, as amended, requires a detailed analysis of Coast
Guard rotary wing requirements. The Committee will continue to
closely monitor the transition as it moves forward.
Given the Coast Guard’s acquisition challenges, and dem-
onstrated need for significant oversight, H.R. 4275, as amended,
prohibits the Coast Guard from spending the funding appropriated
by Pub. L. 119–21 until certain statutorily required reports on how
those funds will be expended are delivered to Congress and man-
dates regular reporting on the disbursement and use of those
funds. Similarly, the measure restricts funding for fixed wing and
rotary wing assets until the Service provides a report detailing the
sufficiency of the Coast Guards aviation assets to meet mission de-
mands, which was due to the Committee 18 months ago.7 Impor-
tantly, H.R. 4275, as amended, also updates Coast Guard acquisi-
tion processes to provide the best value for the taxpayer and per-
mits the Service to use vessel construction managers to support
major acquisition programs. This includes the ability for the service
to choose the best contractor for the job, not simply the cheapest,
which has historically led to poor performance by the contractor
and increased costs to remedy the project delays and cost overruns.
As part of the push to grow the service by over 15,000 personnel,
the Committee recognizes the need to fund and improve other as-
pects of the service that would provide critical support services
such as medical care, medical facilities, childcare resources, and
housing. H.R. 4275, as amended, requires the Coast Guard to pro-
vide a report to Congress on how it intends to support the service’s
growth if the budget submission does not reflect a commensurate
increase in its Operations and Support funding account. The Com-
mittee views this requirement as a critical oversight tool in order
to prevent furthering the backlog of funding for personnel and in-
frastructure.
With the increase in funding across the board, the Committee
also recognizes the need for investments in the workforce. The
Coast Guard is understaffed in both medical care providers and
specialists and childcare providers. An investment in the hiring
and career retention of these individuals is critical for providing
the necessary levels of care for servicemembers, especially in light
of the anticipated growth of the force.
Secretary of the Coast Guard
The Coast Guard is the only armed service without a Service
Secretary. The Committee is concerned that the Service’s lack of
representation within the Department, the Administration and
among the other service Secretaries has harmed its ability to effec-
tively advocate for its needs. As a result, the Service has suffered
from decades of underinvestment, which had led to a decline in

mission performance. Accordingly, H.R. 4275, as amended, estab-
lishes an Office of the Secretary of the Coast Guard, similar to po-
sitions held in other armed services.
Report on Craft Preventative Maintenance and Monitoring
The Committee recognizes the importance of sustaining the
United States Coast Guard’s small boat and cutter fleets and safe-
guarding the health of their crews, who operate in some of the
most challenging maritime environments in the world. The Com-
mittee is aware of proven, commercially available technologies ca-
pable of securely collecting and capturing vessel and operator data
in offline, austere conditions. These technologies have dem-
onstrated value in enhancing safety, extending operational life, and
improving mission readiness by identifying maintenance and
health issues before they become critical.
Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Coast Guard to
evaluate opportunities to integrate preventative maintenance capa-
bilities and monitoring systems across its surface fleet, particularly
for high-use, high-tempo platforms such as fast response cutters
and deployable boats. The Committee believes these technologies
offer a cost-effective means of improving material readiness, reduc-
ing risk to personnel, and extending the service life of critical as-
sets.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Coast Guard to submit a
briefing to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
not later than December 1, 2025, on its efforts to explore such tech-
nologies, any barriers to their adoption, and resource requirements
necessary to pilot or field these systems at scale.
Maritime Transportation
The maritime transportation system (MTS) is a key contributor
to commerce and is essential to the economic health and prosperity
of the United States. The past few years have demonstrated the
fragility of not only the United States supply chain, but the supply
chain worldwide. Recently, the maritime supply chain has faced ad-
ditional threats from violent Houthi attacks targeting numerous ci-
vilian and military vessels. This has caused several of the largest
shipping companies to halt or limit transits through the Red Sea
and Suez Canal, which traditionally facilitated the flow of 20 per-
cent of container shipping.8 Modernizing the operations of the MTS
is more important than ever in the wake of a myriad of threats to
the supply chain. The Committee is committed to supporting the
MTS and growing our shipbuilding industry.
H.R. 4275, as amended, contains provisions to boost the pool of
qualified United States mariners by reducing bureaucratic delays
and barriers to Americans seeking a seagoing career. It seeks to
make permanent reductions to the lengths of certain periods of
service initiated in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2024.9 Additionally, the legislation amends the require-
ments for certain merchant mariner credentials to consider ad-
vances in technology and training, aligns Coast Guard require-

ments with international requirements, and reinforces the existing
statutory authority for American Samoans to be eligible for mer-
chant mariner credentials. H.R. 4275, as amended, also seeks to
promote vessel safety by studying additional requirements to as-
sure the safety of amphibious passenger vessels and allowing risk-
based examinations for certain tank vessels.
Implementation of Accountability and Transparency Review Rec-
ommendations
H.R. 4275, as amended, strengthens protections for members of
the Coast Guard from sexual assault and harassment and in-
creases transparency within the Service. Operation Fouled Anchor
was a Coast Guard investigation initiated in 2014 that revealed in-
cidents of rape, assault, and other misconduct at the Coast Guard
Academy (Academy) occurring from 1990 until 2006.10 The report
uncovered a repeated pattern of mishandling cases and not holding
perpetrators accountable—in part driven by efforts to protect the
reputation of the Academy.11 Furthermore, the Committee’s inves-
tigation revealed broken processes that failed to properly track de-
cision making with regards to prosecutorial decisions. Despite the
Committee’s demonstrated interest in curbing sexual assault and
sexual harassment, the Coast Guard chose to withhold the report
from Congress. Even worse, the decision to bury the report resulted
in a failure to implement the recommendations from Operation
Fouled Anchor. After the report became public, the Service under-
took an Accountability and Transparency Review (ATR), which in-
cluded recommendations to prevent and better respond to future
sexual assault and sexual harassment incidents.12 On November
27, 2023, the Coast Guard released the ATR, along with the Com-
mandant’s Directed Actions, which seek to mitigate instances of
harassment, assault, and other mistreatment.13
H.R. 4275, as amended, provides additional authorities to the
Coast Guard to protect its service members, aligns Coast Guard
practices with the practices of other military services, and man-
dates additional transparency and accountability as the actions are
implemented.
Other Matters
H.R. 4275, as amended, seeks to improve personnel conditions to
promote retention and attract the best qualified applicants. Among
other things, it updates provides direct hire authority for civilian
faculty at the Coast Guard Academy and authorizes maternity uni-
form allowances for officers.
As autonomous systems become more common in the maritime
domain, H.R. 4275 seeks to advance the Coast Guard’s capabilities
with regards to the use of such technologies. The legislation estab-
lishes a National Autonomous Maritime Systems Advisory Com-
mittee within the Coast Guard, comprised of various stakeholders

and experts that will be positioned to advise the Coast Guard on
matters relating to the regulations and use of autonomous systems
within the territorial waters of the United States. The measure
also directs GAO and National Academies Studies on the Coast
Guard’s use of autonomous technologies and establishes pilot pro-
grams for the use of autonomous systems within the Service.
H.R. 4275 also seeks to clarify authorities and improve moni-
toring of safety at sea. It clearly provides authority to establish
safety zones for special activities in the exclusive economic zone, in-
corporates recommendations from the National Transportation and
Safety Board in the wake of the 2021 pipeline oil spill in San Pedro
Bay, and improves vessel traffic service monitoring. It also clarifies
authorities to remove abandoned and derelict vessels at sea.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee’s over-
sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to the filing of the report and is included in the re-
port. Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4275, as amended, from the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office:
Legislation Considered Under Suspension of the Rules
The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives announces
bills that will be considered under suspension of the rules in that
chamber. Under suspension, floor debate is limited, all floor
amendments are prohibited, points of order against the bill are
waived, and final passage requires a two-thirds majority vote.
At the request of the Majority Leader and the House Committee
on the Budget, CBO estimates the effects of those bills on direct
spending and revenues. CBO has limited time to review the legisla-
tion before consideration. Although it is possible in most cases to
determine whether the legislation would affect direct spending or
revenues, time may be insufficient to estimate the magnitude of
those effects. If CBO has prepared estimates for similar or identical
legislation, a more detailed assessment of budgetary effects, includ-
ing effects on spending subject to appropriation, may be included.

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this legislation is to authorize the Coast Guard in
support of its missions.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
4275, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the
Federal government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED
TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of the rule XXI.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(Public Law 104–4).
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that H.R. 4275 does not preempt any state, local, or tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
Section 5(b) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act requires the
report of any Committee establishing, or authorizing the establish-
ment of any advisory committee, to include a statement as to
whether the functions of the proposed advisory committee are being
or could be performed by one or more agencies or by an advisory
committee already in existence, or by enlarging the mandate of an
existing advisory committee. The Committee finds that issues re-
lated to use and regulations of autonomous maritime systems poses
sufficiently new and distinct questions for the Coast Guard that
the creation of the National Advisory Committee on Autonomous
Maritime Systems is merited instead of the expansion of the man-
date of any existing advisory committee.

assess a class II civil penalty under this paragraph, or (ii)

Administrator or Secretary under this paragraph shall affect
any person’s obligation to comply with any section of this Act.
(G) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—Any person against whom a civil pen-
alty is assessed under this paragraph or who commented on
the proposed assessment of such penalty in accordance with
subparagraph (C) may obtain review of such assessment—
(i) in the case of assessment of a class I civil penalty, in
the United States District Court for the District of Colum-

neously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to
the Administrator or Secretary, as the case may be, and
the Attorney General. The Administrator or Secretary
shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the
record on which the order was issued. Such court shall not
set aside or remand such order unless there is not sub-
stantial evidence in the record, taken as a whole, to sup-
port the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator’s
or Secretary’s assessment of the penalty constitutes an
abuse of discretion and shall not impose additional civil
penalties for the same violation unless the Administrator’s
or Secretary’s assessment of the penalty constitutes an
abuse of discretion.
(H) COLLECTION.—If any person fails to pay an assessment
of a civil penalty—

ministrator or Secretary, as the case may be, the Adminis-
trator or Secretary shall request the Attorney General to
bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to re-
cover the amount assessed (plus interest at currently pre-
vailing rates from the date of the final order or the date
of the final judgment, as the case may be). In such an ac-
tion, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such
penalty shall not be subject to review. Any person who
fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment
of a civil penalty as described in the first sentence of this
subparagraph shall be required to pay, in addition to such
amount and interest, attorneys fees and costs for collection
proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each
quarter during which such failure to pay persists. Such

ginning of such quarter.

shall be deemed a cost incurred under subsection (c) of this section
for the removal of such substance by the United States Govern-
ment.

such act or omission was or was not negligent, or any combination
of the foregoing clauses, such owner or operator of any vessel from
which oil or a hazardous substance is discharged in violation of
subsection (b)(3) of this section shall, notwithstanding any other
provision of law, be liable to the United States Government for the
actual costs incurred under subsection (c) for the removal of such
oil or substance by the United States Government in an amount
not to exceed, in the case of an inland oil barge $125 per gross ton
of such barge, or $125,000, whichever is greater, and in the case
of any other vessel, $150 per gross ton of such vessel (or, for a ves-
sel carrying oil or hazardous substances as cargo, $250,000), which-
ever is greater, except that where the United States can show that
such discharge was the result of willful negligence or willful mis-
conduct within the privity and knowledge of the owner, such owner
or operator shall be liable to the United States Government for the
full amount of such costs. Such costs shall constitute a maritime
lien on such vessel which may be recovered in an action in rem in
the district court of the United States for any district within which
any vessel may be found. The United States may also bring an ac-
tion against the owner or operator of such vessel in any court of
competent jurisdiction to recover such costs.
(2) Except where an owner or operator of an onshore facility can
prove that a discharge was caused solely by (A) an act of God, (B)
an act of war, (C) negligence on the part of the United States Gov-
ernment, or (D) an act or omission of a third party without regard
to whether any such act or omission was or was not negligent, or
any combination of the foregoing clauses, such owner or operator
of any such facility from which oil or a hazardous substance is dis-
charged in violation of subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be lia-
ble to the United States Government for the actual costs incurred
under subsection (c) for the removal of such oil or substance by the
United States Government in an amount not to exceed $50,000,000,
except that where the United States can show that such discharge
was the result of willful negligence or willful misconduct within the
privity and knowledge of the owner, such owner or operator shall
be liable to the United States Government for the full amount of
such costs. The United States may bring an action against the
owner or operator of such facility in any court of competent juris-
diction to recover such costs. The Administrator is authorized, by
regulation, after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and
the Small Business Administration, to establish reasonable and eq-
uitable classifications, of those onshore facilities having a total
fixed storage capacity of 1,000 barrels or less which he determines
because of size, type, and location do not present a substantial risk
of the discharge of oil or hazardous substance in violation of sub-
section (b)(3) of this section, and apply with respect to such classi-
fications differing limits of liability which may be less than the
amount contained in this paragraph.
(3) Except where an owner or operator of an offshore facility can
prove that a discharge was caused solely by (A) an act of God, (B)
an act of war, (C) negligence on the part of the United States Gov-

charged in violation of subsection (b)(3) of this section shall, not-
withstanding any other provision of law, be liable to the United
States Government for the actual costs incurred under subsection
(c) for the removal of such oil or substance by the United States
Government in an amount not to exceed $50,000,000, except that
where the United States can show that such discharge was the re-
sult of willful negligence or willful misconduct within the privity
and knowledge of the owner, such owner or operator shall be liable
to the United States Government for the full amount of such costs.
The United States may bring an action against the owner or oper-
ator of such a facility in any court of competent jurisdiction to re-
cover such costs.
(4) The costs of removal of oil or a hazardous substance for which
the owner or operator of a vessel or onshore or offshore facility is
liable under subsection (f) of this section shall include any costs or
expenses incurred by the Federal Government or any State govern-
ment in the restoration or replacement of natural resources dam-
aged or destroyed as a result of a discharge of oil or a hazardous
substance in violation of subsection (b) of this section.
(5) The President, or the authorized representative of any State,
shall act on behalf of the public as trustee of the natural resources
to recover for the costs of replacing or restoring such resources.
Sums recovered shall be used to restore, rehabilitate, or acquire the
equivalent of such natural resources by the appropriate agencies of
the Federal Government, or the State government.
(g) Where the owner or operator of a vessel (other than an inland
oil barge) carrying oil or hazardous substances as cargo or an on-
shore or offshore facility which handles or stores oil or hazardous
substances in bulk, from which oil or a hazardous substance is dis-
charged in violation of subsection (b) of this section, alleges that
such discharge was caused solely by an act or omission of a third
party, such owner or operator shall pay to the United States Gov-
ernment the actual costs incurred under subsection (c) for removal
of such oil or substance and shall be entitled by subrogation to all
rights of the United States Government to recover such costs from
such third party under this subsection. In any case where an owner
or operator of a vessel, of an onshore facility, or of an offshore facil-
ity, from which oil or a hazardous substance is discharged in viola-
tion of subsection (b)(3) of this section, proves that such discharge
of oil or hazardous substance was caused solely by an act or omis-
sion of a third party, or was caused solely by such an act or omis-
sion in combination with an act of God, an act of war, or negligence
on the part of the United States Government, such third party
shall, not withstanding any other provision of law, be liable to the
United States Government for the actual costs incurred under sub-
section (c) for removal of such oil or substance by the United States
Government, except where such third party can prove that such
discharge was caused solely by (A) an act of God, (B) an act of war,
(C) negligence on the part of the United States Government, or (D)
an act or omission of another party without regard to whether such
act or omission was or was not negligent, or any combination of the
foregoing clauses. If such third party was the owner or operator of
a vessel which caused the discharge of oil or a hazardous substance
in violation of subsection (b)(3) of this section, the liability of such
third party under this subsection shall not exceed, in the case of

an inland oil barge $125 per gross ton of such barge, $125,000,
whichever is greater, and in the case of any other vessel, $150 per
gross ton of such vessel (or, for a vessel carrying oil or hazardous
substances as cargo, $250,000), whichever is greater. In any other
case the liability of such third party shall not exceed the limitation
which would have been applicable to the owner or operator of the
vessel or the onshore or offshore facility from which the discharge
actually occurred if such owner or operator were liable. If the
United States can show that the discharge of oil or a hazardous
substance in violation of subsection (b)(3) of this section was the re-
sult of willful negligence or willful misconduct within the privity
and knowledge of such third party, such third party shall be liable
to the United States Government for the full amount of such re-
moval costs. The United States may bring an action against the
third party in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover such
removal costs.
(h) The liabilities established by this section shall in no way af-
fect any rights which (1) the owner or operator of a vessel or of an
onshore facility or an offshore facility may have against any third
party whose acts may in any way have caused or contributed to
such discharge, or (2) The15 United States Government may have
against any third party whose actions may in any way have caused
or contributed to the discharge of oil or hazardous substance.
(i) In any case where an owner or operator of a vessel or an on-
shore facility or an offshore facility from which oil or a hazardous
substance is discharged in violation of subsection (b)(3) of this sec-
tion acts to remove such oil or substance in accordance with regula-
tions promulgated pursuant to this section, such owner or operator
shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs incurred in such
removal upon establishing, in a suit which may be brought against
the United States Government in the United States Claims Court,
that such discharge was caused solely by (A) an act of God, (B) an
act of war, (C) negligence on the part of the United States Govern-
ment, or (D) an act or omission of a third party without regard to
whether such act or omission was or was not negligent, or of any
combination of the foregoing clauses.
(j) NATIONAL RESPONSE SYSTEM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Consistent with the National Contingency
Plan required by subsection (c)(2) of this section, as soon as
practicable after the effective date of this section, and from
time to time thereafter, the President shall issue regulations
consistent with maritime safety and with marine and naviga-
tion laws (A) establishing methods and procedures for removal
of discharged oil and hazardous substances, (B) establishing
criteria for the development and implementation of local and
regional oil and hazardous substance removal contingency

ward of the seaward boundary of a State.
(C) GREATER AMOUNT.—If the President determines that
an amount of financial responsibility for a responsible
party greater than the amount required by subparagraph
(B) is justified based on the relative operational, environ-
mental, human health, and other risks posed by the quan-
tity or quality of oil that is explored for, drilled for, pro-
duced, or transported by the responsible party, the evi-
dence of financial responsibility required shall be for an
amount determined by the President not exceeding
$150,000,000.

sponsible party would be entitled to limit liability under that
section. If the Secretary exercises the authority under section
1004(d)(2) to lower the limit of liability for deepwater ports,
