PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 2225, the Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act, was
introduced on March 18, 2025, by Representative Brad Sherman
(CA–32). H.R. 2225 allows a registered investment company to ex-
clude from the calculation of ‘‘acquired fund fees and expenses
(AFFE)’’ those incurred indirectly from investment in a business
development company (BDC).
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Since their creation, BDCs have stepped up to provide capital for
smaller businesses. Yet, an SEC rule drafted in 2006 has prevented
BDCs from securing additional capital to invest in American busi-
nesses.1 The SEC rule requires funds that invest in BDCs to dis-
close management fees and other expenses of a BDC as well as
AFFE. This requirement led to a miscalculation because BDCs
typically have higher operating expenses than passive investment
funds because they devote substantial resources to sourcing, evalu-
ating, and managing investments in American small businesses.
However, these expenses are already reflected in a BDC’s manage-
ment fees, expenses, and market price. When the SEC required
funds investing in BDCs to disclose BDC expenses again, it re-
sulted in double counting, overstating the BDC’s expenses and giv-
ing investors a misleading view of the actual costs they bear. This
miscalculation led funds to stop investing in BDCs thereby reduc-
ing the capital available for BDCs to invest in small businesses.
17 C.F.R. §270.

H.R. 2225 would allow funds to omit a BDC’s AFFE while still
continuing to disclose the BDCs management fees and other ex-
penses. By correcting this unintended consequence while maintain-
ing existing disclosures, investors will have an accurate picture of
a BDC’s expenses and allow BDCs to compete for capital to then
invest in small businesses.
