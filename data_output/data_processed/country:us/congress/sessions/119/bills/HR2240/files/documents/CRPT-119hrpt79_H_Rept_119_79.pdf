SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and
Wellness Through Data Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) There has been a rise in anti-police rhetoric and a corresponding rise in
violence against law enforcement officers.
(2) In 2022, a total of 60 police officers were feloniously killed in the line of
duty.
(3) Nearly 30 percent of police officer killings in 2022 were caused by
unprovoked attacks or ambushes on officers.
(4) Law enforcement officers bravely put themselves at risk for the better-
ment of society.
(5) A data collection that represents the full circumstances surrounding vio-
lent attacks and ambush attacks on law enforcement officers is vital for the pro-
vision of needed Federal resources to Federal, State, and local law enforcement
officers.
(6) Police suffer assaults and other offenses that do not rise to the level of
Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted or National Incident-Based Re-
porting System reporting due to the frequency of such incidents, lower risk to
officers, and minimal administrative resources to report such frequent events.
(7) The mental health of law enforcement officers has suffered due to over-
work, recruitment issues, and the general stress of their work.
(8) The people of the United States will always remember the victims of these
hateful attacks against law enforcement officers and stand in solidarity with in-
dividuals affected by these senseless tragedies and incidents of hate that have
affected law enforcement communities and their families.
(9) The United States must demonstrate to its brave law enforcement officers
that they are important, valued, and respected.
(10) Congress has made a commitment to helping communities protect the
lives of their police officers, as evidenced by the Bulletproof Vest Partnership
Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–155; 130 Stat.
389) and other laws.
(11) Subsection (c) of the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988 (34
U.S.C. 41303(c)) requires the Attorney General to ‘‘acquire, collect, classify, and
preserve national data on Federal criminal offenses as part of the Uniform
Crime Reports’’ and requires all Federal departments and agencies that inves-
tigate criminal activity to ‘‘report details about crime within their respective ju-
risdiction to the Attorney General in a uniform matter and on a form prescribed
by the Attorney General’’.

Purpose and Summary
H.R. 2240, the Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and
Wellness Through Data Act, introduced by Rep. Tim Moore (R–
NC), would fill gaps in the reporting of attacks targeting law en-
forcement officers. The bill requires the Attorney General to de-
velop a series of reports related to violent attacks on law enforce-
ment officers, the efficacy of current data collection related to vio-
lent attacks on law enforcement officers, and the efficacy of pro-
grams intended to provide protective equipment and wellness re-
sources to law enforcement officers.
Background and Need for the Legislation
Democrat-run Cities Defunded Their Police
Due to the radical left’s ‘‘defund the police’’ movement, Democrat-
run cities across the United States reduced funding for police de-
partments, which left their cities without an adequate law enforce-
ment presence to address a surge in violent crime.1 In 2020, Los
Angeles reduced its police department’s budget by $150 million.2 At
the same time, New York City also made cuts amounting to $1 bil-
lion from the New York Police Department (NYPD).3 Chicago’s
then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot approved a decrease of approximately
$80 million for the Chicago Police Department (CPD) budget for
2021.4 In 2021, Washington, D.C. slashed the Metropolitan Police
Department (MPD) budget by roughly $15 million.5 The subse-
quent years unsurprisingly saw a significant uptick in violent

crime in these cities, which can be attributed to these decisions to
defund law enforcement.6
According to the Major City Chiefs Association (MCCA), violent
crime increased in 2021 compared to 2020.7 After the FBI updated
its data in 2022, there were 80,029 more violent crimes recorded
in 2022 than in 2021.8 Out of the 70 cities included in MCCA’s
data, 69 cities saw increases in at least one category of violent
crimes in 2022, which include homicide, rape, robbery, and aggra-
vated assault.9 After homicide rates reached a peak in 2021, it re-
mained 24 percent higher in 30 cities in the first half of 2023 than
it was before the COVID–19 pandemic.10 Likewise, when com-
paring aggravated assault cases from 2019 to those in 2023, the
number is nearly 10 percent higher, with over 23,000 more assaults
recorded within the same period.11
Although crime rates are generally lower in 2024 when compared
to pre-pandemic levels, some violent crimes have actually increased
when compared to 2019.12 For example, aggravated assaults have
increased four percent, assaults with firearms have increased by
five percent, and carjackings have increased by 25 percent.13
After this spike in crime, some Democrats refused to acknowl-
edge their own policy failures and instead blamed firearms, eco-
nomic downturns, and perceived deficiencies in federal law enforce-
ment support.14 For example, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot
reached out to then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, advocating
for an increase in Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explo-
sives (ATF) agents in Chicago to address illegal firearms, remark-
ing, ‘‘we cannot continue to endure the level of violence that we are
now experiencing.’’15
However, other Democrats realized the effects of their cata-
strophic defunding decisions and reversed course. For example,
then-San Francisco Mayor London Breed initially diverted $120
million from the police budget towards social initiatives, only to re-
calibrate her approach in light of rising crime and commit to
strengthen the police force and counter the criminal elements in
the city.16 Within three years, almost all large Democrat-led cities
reversed course on their decision to defund law enforcement and
augmented their police department budgets, with many Democrats
abandoning the ‘‘defund the police’’ narrative altogether.17 In 2023

after Washington D.C. experienced its deadliest year in more than
20 years,18 Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed legislation to soften the
anti-police reforms.19 The legislation also sought to target orga-
nized retail crime as well as the issue of open-air drug markets in
the District.20 Bowser admitted the original police reform legisla-
tion did not ‘‘match the daily practice of safe and effective polic-
ing.’’21
Rogue Prosecutors Refusing to Enforce the Law
Another significant reason for the increase in crime over the past
several years is the prevalence of far-left rogue prosecutors who
prioritize social justice initiatives over public safety. Dozens of
these rogue prosecutors owe their election victories, in large part,
to far-left political action committees.22 These rogue prosecutors
made social justice initiatives more important than public safety.
Their goal is to fundamentally change the criminal justice system
by replacing both Republican and Democrat law-and-order prosecu-
tors with pro-criminal, anti-victim extremists who ignore the law,
abuse their offices, and allow crime to rise in their jurisdictions.23
These prosecutors generally fail to charge criminals, or permit
criminals to be charged on low-level crimes, allowing them to re-
turn to communities to reoffend.
Police Recruitment Crisis
Police departments across the country are experiencing signifi-
cant recruitment challenges, as officers have been leaving the force
in droves. As of January 2025, the Los Angeles Police Department
(LAPD) is projected to mark the lowest staffing levels in 30 years.
LAPD leaders expect to lose more than 150 officers, leaving a force
of about 8,620 by June 30, 2026.24 In 2023, the San Francisco Po-
lice Department had over 600 fewer officers compared to 2020, a
decrease of approximately thirty percent of the department.25 In
2023, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in Washington,
D.C. had the lowest number of officers it has had in the past fifty
years.26 In January 2025, the DC Police Union chair said that the
MPD is operating at dangerously low staffing levels.27 As of Sep-
tember 2024, Chicago had 1,662 fewer officers than it did in 2018,
a decline of nearly 13 percent.28
In an effort to hire more law enforcement officers, police depart-
ments have ‘‘expanded the geographic area from which they draw
recruits, offered hiring bonuses and multiyear contracts, beefed up

recruiting efforts, decreased onboarding obstacles and adjusted ad-
mission requirements.’’29 For example, the MPD is offering a
$25,000 hiring bonus for new MPD recruits.30 On March 2, 2024,
the City of Dunwoody, Georgia, announced it is increasing its hir-
ing bonuses for new recruits to $15,000.31 Alameda County, Cali-
fornia, just outside San Francisco, is offering a $75,000 recruitment
bonus that will be paid out installments over several years.32 The
City of Fremont, California, introduced a $100,000 signing bonus
for up to 10 lateral police officer hires. This initiative significantly
expands upon the city’s previous $20,000 signing bonus for lateral
officers.33
Escalating Attacks on Law Enforcement Officers
The effects of far-left efforts to defund the police, elect rogue
prosecutors, and enact radical criminal justice policies can all be
seen through the continuous attacks on police officers. In 2022, 328
officers were shot in the line of duty,34 there were 88 ambush-style
attacks against police officers, and 31 of those officers lost their
lives.35 When those statistics were released, Patrick Yoes, national
president of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), described 2022
‘‘one of the most dangerous years for law enforcement in recent his-
tory due to the increase of violence directed towards law enforce-
ment officers . . . .’’36 In 2023, 378 officers were shot in the line
of duty, with 115 ambush-style attacks,37 and 20 officers lost their
lives because of these attacks.38 FOP President Yoes reported:
Last year, over 330 police officers were shot in the line
of duty. With the COVID–19 pandemic behind us and after
so many Americans have seen the tragic consequences of
the defund the police movement, it was our hope that
these numbers would be a high-water mark. We were
wrong. Instead, 378 officers were shot in the line of duty
in 2023, the highest number the FOP has ever recorded.39
In 2024, the number of officers killed in the line of duty again
increased from the previous year. According to National Law En-
forcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), 147 law enforce-
ment officers died in the line of duty in 2024 compared to 118 offi-
cers who died in the line of duty in 2023, representing a 25% in-

Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through
Data Act
Currently, basic information on law enforcement attacks is col-
lected by the FBI’s Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted
(LEOKA) program.42 While the program collects information such
as the circumstance of the assault and the weapon used,43 it does
not contain information or recommendations to help prevent fur-
ther attacks on law enforcement officers. The Improving Law En-
forcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Act would
help to prevent attacks by increasing the categories of information
that can be voluntarily reported, including the intention and co-
ordination of criminals. It would also direct the Justice Department
to examine adding additional categories to the Uniform Crime Re-
porting System such as aggressive actions, conduct, or other trau-
ma-inducing incidents against law enforcement officers. The bill
will also provide further transparency on the mental health im-
pacts of attacks on law enforcement officers and examine the avail-
ability and extent of mental health resources for police officers.
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 2240: ‘‘The Right to Self
Defense’’ a hearing held on March 4, 2025, before Subcommittee on
Crime and Federal Government Surveillance of the Committee on
the Judiciary. The Subcommittee heard testimony from the fol-
lowing witnesses:
• Doug Ritter, Founder and Chair of Knife Rights, Inc. and
Knife Rights Foundation;
• Diana Muller, Founder of Women for Gun Rights;
• Dave McDermott, Founding Partner of McDermott Law
Group and USCCA Network Attorney; and
• Gregory Jackson, Jr., Former Deputy Director, White
House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
The hearing examined the individual’s right to self-defense, pro-
tected by the Second Amendment, and examined the efficacy of gun
control policies and the related effect on public safety. The sub-
committee received testimony from Ms. Muller, a retired law en-
forcement officer, about the stressful situations law enforcement of-
ficers encounter that have a negative effect on their mental health.

H.R. 2240 would require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to re-
port to the Congress about violent attacks on law enforcement offi-
cers, including the responses of federal, state, and local govern-
ments to such attacks and how to improve the reporting of those
attacks. The bill also would require DOJ to report to the Congress
on how traumatic incidents affect the mental health and wellness
of officers.
Based on the costs of similar reports, CBO estimates that imple-
menting H.R. 2240 would cost $3 million over the 2025–2030 pe-
riod. Any related spending would be subject to the availability of
appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Jeremy Crimm. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
Committee Estimate of Budgetary Effects
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee adopts
as its own the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974.
Duplication of Federal Programs
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of House rule XIII, no provision of H.R.
2240 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another federal program.
Performance Goals and Objectives
The Committee states that pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of House
rule XIII, H.R. 2240 would fill gaps in the reporting of attacks tar-
geting law enforcement officers by requiring reporting of violent at-
tacks on law enforcement officers, the efficacy of current data col-
lection, and the efficacy of programs intended to provide protective
equipment and wellness resources.
Advisory on Earmarks
In accordance with clause 9 of House rule XXI, H.R. 2240 does
not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits as defined in clauses 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of
House Rule XXI.
Federal Mandates Statement
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
Advisory Committee Statement
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
