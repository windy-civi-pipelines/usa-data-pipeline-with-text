Section 3:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon
Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. INADMISSIBILITY AND DEPORTABILITY RELATED TO DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED
OR IMPAIRED.
(a) INADMISSIBILITY.—Section 212(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(J) DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED OR IMPAIRED.—Any alien who has been
convicted of, who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts
which constitute the essential elements of an offense for driving while in-
toxicated or impaired, as those terms are defined under the law of the juris-
diction where the conviction, offense, or acts constituting the essential ele-
ments of the offense occurred (including an offense for driving while under
the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs), without regard to whether
the conviction or offense is classified as a misdemeanor or felony under Fed-
eral, State, tribal, or local law, is inadmissible.’’.
(b) DEPORTABILITY.—Section 237(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(G) DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED OR IMPAIRED.—Any alien who has been
convicted of an offense for driving while intoxicated or impaired, as those
terms are defined under the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction oc-
curred (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or
impaired by alcohol or drugs), without regard to whether the conviction is
classified as a misdemeanor or felony under Federal, State, tribal, or local
law, is deportable.’’.
Purpose and Summary
H.R. 875, the Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon
Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025, intro-
duced by Rep. Barry Moore (R–AL), would create a new ground of
inadmissibility for aliens convicted of, or admitting to, driving
under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It also codifies a new
ground of removability for aliens with driving under the influence
(DUI) convictions.
Background and Need for the Legislation
One person dies in a drunk driving crash every 45 minutes,1
with 13,384 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in 2021 and 13,524
in 2022.2 In 2021, drunk driving crashes led to 388,136 injuries.3
Because there is neither a ground of inadmissibility nor a ground
of removability related to DUI, criminal aliens can escape account-
ability for their reckless actions, free to re-offend and endanger
communities. H.R. 875 is named in honor of Jeremy and Angel
Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, three victims of drunk driv-
ing by illegal aliens.

Jeremy and Angel Seay
On June 13, 2009, Jeremy and Angel Seay of Enterprise, Ala-
bama, were killed when Freddie DeLeon Perez, an illegal alien,
crashed into their motorcycle.4 Witnesses ‘‘contend[ed] [Perez] had
been drinking that night’’ before he drove his truck into the newly-
weds.5 Perez ‘‘pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular homicide
and one count of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries’’ and
was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment.6
Sergeant Brandon Mendoza
In May 2014, ‘‘a man that drove 35 miles along multiple Phoenix
freeways in the wrong direction’’ crashed into Mesa, Arizona, police
officer Brandon Mendoza, killing both Sergeant Mendoza and the
driver, Raul Silva-Corona.7 A 13-year veteran of the Mesa Police
Department, Sergeant Mendoza was on his way home after com-
pleting his shift when Silva-Corona crashed into his vehicle.8 Silva-
Corona’s blood-alcohol level was nearly ‘‘three times the legal
limit.’’9 Despite being convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary
after a 1994 arrest in Colorado, Corona-Silva ‘‘had lived in the
United States illegally for more than 20 years.’’10
The dangers of drunk driving
Despite drunk driving being illegal in every state and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, individuals who drive drunk continue to kill or
injure hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. Alcohol-im-
paired fatalities increased by 14 percent from 2020 to 2021, with
a total of 13,617 deaths.11 The number of alcohol-impaired fatali-
ties remained steady in 2022, with 13,524 deaths.12 Drunk drivers
are involved in 31 percent of all crash deaths in the country, with
an average of 10,850 people killed every year in DUI-related crash-
es from 2012 through 2021.13 Criminal and illegal aliens are re-
sponsible for some of these preventable crashes and deaths.
In October 2022, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) announced it had arrested ‘‘175 illegal immigrants who had

multiple DUI convictions.’’14 In FY 2018, ICE arrested aliens
whose criminal histories included 80,730 DUI-related charges and
convictions.15 In FY 2019, ICE nearly matched that number, ar-
resting aliens who accounted for 74,523 DUI charges and convic-
tions.16 Because of Democrats’ lax immigration enforcement, in FY
2022, that number plummeted to 26,238, meaning that more illegal
aliens with DUI-related charges and convictions are free to re-
offend in American communities.17 In FY 2023, the number of DUI-
related ICE arrests continued to be lower than during the first
Trump Administration, with ICE arresting aliens whose criminal
histories accounted for only 43,044 DUI-related charges and convic-
tions—barely half the FY 2018 number and more than 30,000
fewer than in FY 2019.18
The effects of illegal alien drunk driving are felt across the coun-
try—not just the southwest border. In January 2025, an illegal
alien from Mexico was arrested in Florida for his third DUI after
he hit and killed a kindergartener.19 In Texas in December 2024,
an illegal alien killed 7-year-old Ivory Smith after he drove drunk
and crashed into a car driven by Ivory’s mother.20 Just months ear-
lier, ICE had lifted a detainer it previously lodged against the ille-
gal alien after he was ‘‘arrested for assaulting a family member in
June’’ 2024.21 In a suspected drunk driving crash in Georgia, an il-
legal alien ‘‘ran through a red light, going 100 mph, and T-boned
another car, killing the driver’’ in December 2024.22 And in St.
Louis, Missouri, an illegal alien lost control of his vehicle, which
then struck a St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department officer as
the officer ‘‘respond[ed] to a vehicular accident on Interstate 70 at
the time.’’23 Authorities charged the illegal alien with DWI.24 In a
similar incident in 2016, an illegal alien drunk driver ‘‘ran into the
back of [a sheriff’s deputy’s] vehicle,’’ pushing it into another vehi-
cle and killing Master Deputy Brandon Collins.25

In addition, in September 2023, an illegal alien ‘‘slammed into
a[] [New York City Police Department] squad car and three other
vehicles’’ and then ‘‘bit off a piece of a police sergeant’s finger while
in a holding cell.’’26 Police eventually charged the man with driving
while intoxicated and ‘‘driving while apparently impaired.’’27 In
Missouri in November 2023, an illegal alien from Honduras was
sentenced to 10 years in prison ‘‘for driving drunk at 100 mph’’ and
killing another driver.28 In Montana, an illegal alien was arrested
for driving the wrong way on an interstate,29 apparently the second
such drunk driving incident by an illegal alien on the same inter-
state within two weeks.30 In Colorado in December 2023, an illegal
alien from El Salvador31 allegedly drove drunk and killed a 46-
year-old woman and her 16-year-old son when he drove his truck
up to 100 mph and ran into the victims’ vehicle, causing it to crash
into a tree.32 Despite having five previous DUI-related convictions,
‘‘[a] Boulder County judge sentenced [the illegal alien] to probation,
community service[,] and work release’’ on December 8, 2023, in re-
lation to two of those convictions, just four days before the crash
that killed the mother and son.33
Democrat excuses for illegal aliens with DUI convictions
Despite these statistics and examples, Democrats have
downplayed drunk driving by illegal aliens. For instance, at a Judi-
ciary Committee markup in September 2021, Democrats voted
down a series of Republican amendments that would have made
certain aliens ineligible for lawful permanent residence if they had
one, two, or even 10 or more DUI convictions.34 In that markup,
then-Chairman Jerry Nadler excused criminal aliens’ drunk driving
convictions, stating, ‘‘[W]hether someone has 2, or 6, or 10, or 20

convictions of DUI 30 years ago, someone can change.’’35 He added,
‘‘You may have any number of convictions for DUI because you are
a drunk, because you are an alcoholic, but you also may cease to
be an alcoholic.’’36 In January 2020, then-presidential candidate
Joe Biden asserted that ICE should not arrest aliens with drunk
driving convictions because, ‘‘[y]ou only arrest for the purpose of
dealing with a felony that’s committed, and I don’t count drunk
driving as a felony.’’37 In fact, candidate Biden called for ICE offi-
cers to be fired if they arrested aliens without felony convictions,
which could include those with DUIs.38 On February 1, 2024, 150
Democrats voted against the Protect Our Communities from DUIs
Act during consideration on the House floor.39
Current immigration law treatment of DUI convictions
Although illegal aliens are routinely arrested for, charged with,
and convicted of DUI and DUI-related crimes, U.S. immigration
law does not state explicitly that driving while intoxicated or im-
paired is a ground of inadmissibility or removability.40 Instead,
aliens charged with or convicted of such crimes may rarely be
found inadmissible or removable due to having been convicted of a
crime that constitutes either an aggravated felony or a crime in-
volving moral turpitude (CIMT).41 Determining whether an offense
is an aggravated felony or a CIMT, however, often involves com-
plicated legal analysis that can produce absurd results. In one in-
stance, for example, a federal judge observed that the process,
known as the categorical approach, presented ‘‘a single legal ques-
tion about a single conviction,’’ yet the analysis ‘‘spawned, over
eleven years and counting: four decisions by the [Board of Immigra-
tion Appeals], four decisions by three different immigration judges,
approximately six rounds of briefing, and a split opinion by [a fed-
eral] court.’’42 In addition, the Board of Immigration Appeals has
held that a ‘‘simple DUI offense’’ is not a crime involving moral tur-
pitude.43 Even worse, some far-left prosecutors—or even activist
judges—may ensure that illegal aliens are never convicted of DUI-
related crimes in the first place, which makes it even more impor-
tant that aliens can be held responsible for their criminal actions

if they admit to, but are not convicted of, driving under the influ-
ence.
American communities should not have to wait until an illegal
alien kills or seriously injures someone in a drunk driving accident
before that alien can be removed from the United States. In fact,
according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, ‘‘most [drunk driving]
offenders drive drunk at least 80 times before they are arrested.’’44
Additionally, a 2014 article detailed how ‘‘[m]ore than one-third of
individuals who are convicted of driving under the influence [] are
repeat offenders.’’45 By specifically enumerating driving while in-
toxicated or impaired by alcohol or drugs as both a ground of inad-
missibility and a ground of removability, the Jeremy and Angel
Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities
from DUIs Act of 2025 ensures that aliens who endanger commu-
nities can be removed from the United States. In doing so, this bill
gives authorities another tool to protect America from dangerous
criminal aliens and prevents families from suffering unimaginable
losses from DUI-related crashes.
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 875: ‘‘Restoring Immi-
gration Enforcement in America,’’ a hearing held on January 22,
2025, before the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security,
and Enforcement of the Committee on the Judiciary. The Sub-
committee heard testimony from the following witnesses:

(b) NOTICES OF DENIALS.—
(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if an alien’s application
for a visa, for admission to the United States, or for adjust-
ment of status is denied by an immigration or consular officer
because the officer determines the alien to be inadmissible
under subsection (a), the officer shall provide the alien with a
timely written notice that—
(A) states the determination, and
(B) lists the specific provision or provisions of law under
which the alien is excludable or ineligible for entry or ad-
justment of status.

eral’s discretion, may waive the application of subsection (a) (other
than paragraph (3)(E)) in the case of a nonimmigrant described in

Section 16:
section 101(a)(15)(S), if the Attorney General considers it to be in
the national interest to do so. Nothing in this section shall be re-
garded as prohibiting the Immigration and Naturalization Service
from instituting removal proceedings against an alien admitted as
a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(S) for conduct committed
after the alien’s admission into the United States, or for conduct
or a condition that was not disclosed to the Attorney General prior
to the alien’s admission as a nonimmigrant under section

(other than paragraphs (3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and
clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), may,
after approval by the Attorney General of a recommendation by the
Secretary of State or by the consular officer that the alien be ad-
mitted temporarily despite his inadmissibility, be granted such a
visa and may be admitted into the United States temporarily as a
nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney General, or (ii) who
is inadmissible under subsection (a) (other than paragraphs
(3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and clauses (i) and (ii) of
paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), but who is in possession of
appropriate documents or is granted a waiver thereof and is seek-
ing admission, may be admitted into the United States temporarily
as a nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney General. The
Attorney General shall prescribe conditions, including exaction of
such bonds as may be necessary, to control and regulate the admis-
sion and return of inadmissible aliens applying for temporary ad-

(B)(i) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Attorney
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary
of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
State and the Attorney General, may determine in such Secretary’s
sole unreviewable discretion that subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not
apply with respect to an alien within the scope of that subsection
or that subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) shall not apply to a group within
the scope of that subsection, except that no such waiver may be ex-
tended to an alien who is within the scope of subsection
(a)(3)(B)(i)(II), no such waiver may be extended to an alien who is
a member or representative of, has voluntarily and knowingly en-
gaged in or endorsed or espoused or persuaded others to endorse
or espouse or support terrorist activity on behalf of, or has volun-
tarily and knowingly received military-type training from a ter-
rorist organization that is described in subclause (I) or (II) of sub-

Section 17:
section (a)(3)(B)(vi), and no such waiver may be extended to a
group that has engaged terrorist activity against the United States
or another democratic country or that has purposefully engaged in
a pattern or practice of terrorist activity that is directed at civil-
ians. Such a determination shall neither prejudice the ability of the
United States Government to commence criminal or civil pro-
ceedings involving a beneficiary of such a determination or any
other person, nor create any substantive or procedural right or ben-
efit for a beneficiary of such a determination or any other person.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatu-
tory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus
provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall
have jurisdiction to review such a determination or revocation ex-
cept in a proceeding for review of a final order of removal pursuant
to section 1252 of this title, and review shall be limited to the ex-
tent provided in section 1252(a)(2)(D). The Secretary of State may
not exercise the discretion provided in this clause with respect to
an alien at any time during which the alien is the subject of pend-
ing removal proceedings under section 1229a of this title.
(ii) Not later than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, the
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
each provide to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of
Representatives and of the Senate, the Committee on International
Relations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity of the House of Representatives a report on the aliens to
whom such Secretary has applied clause (i). Within one week of ap-
plying clause (i) to a group, the Secretary of State or the Secretary
of Homeland Security shall provide a report to such Committees.
(4) Either or both of the requirements of paragraph (7)(B)(i) of
subsection (a) may be waived by the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of State acting jointly (A) on the basis of unforeseen emer-
gency in individual cases, or (B) on the basis of reciprocity with re-
spect to nationals of foreign contiguous territory or of adjacent is-
lands and residents thereof having a common nationality with such
nationals, or (C) in the case of aliens proceeding in immediate and
continuous transit through the United States under contracts au-
thorized in section 238(c).

vided in subparagraph (B) or in section 214(f), in his discretion pa-

may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian
reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admis-
sion to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not
be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes
of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland
Security, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be
returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter
his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that
of any other applicant for admission to the United States.
(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security may not parole into the
United States an alien who is a refugee unless the Secretary of
Homeland Security determines that compelling reasons in the pub-
lic interest with respect to that particular alien require that the
alien be paroled into the United States rather than be admitted as
a refugee under section 207.
(C) The attorney general of a State, or other authorized State of-
ficer, alleging a violation of the limitation under subparagraph (A)
that parole solely be granted on a case-by-case basis and solely for
urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, that
harms such State or its residents shall have standing to bring an
action against the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of
such State or the residents of such State in an appropriate district
court of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.
The court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition
of a civil action filed under this subparagraph to the greatest ex-
tent practicable. For purposes of this subparagraph, a State or its
residents shall be considered to have been harmed if the State or
its residents experience harm, including financial harm in excess of
$100.
(7) The provisions of subsection (a) (other than paragraph (7))
shall be applicable to any alien who shall leave Guam, the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the
Virgin Islands of the United States, and who seeks to enter the
continental United States or any other place under the jurisdiction
of the United States. Any alien described in this paragraph, who
is denied admission to the United States, shall be immediately re-
moved in the manner provided by section 241(c) of this Act.
(8) Upon a basis of reciprocity accredited officials of foreign gov-
ernments, their immediate families, attendants, servants, and per-
sonal employees may be admitted in immediate and continuous
transit through the United States without regard to the provisions
of this section except paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (7)(B) of
subsection (a) of this section.
(11) The Attorney General may, in his discretion for humani-
tarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in
the public interest, waive application of clause (i) of subsection
(a)(6)(E) in the case of any alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not
under an order of removal, and who is otherwise admissible to the
United States as a returning resident under section 211(b) and in
the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment of status as
an immediate relative or immigrant under section 203(a) (other
than paragraph (4) thereof), if the alien has encouraged, induced,
assisted, abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of

such action was the alien’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and
no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.
(12) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
General for humanitarian purposes or to assure family unity, waive
application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(F)—
(A) in the case of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and
not under an order of deportation or removal and who is other-
wise admissible to the United States as a returning resident
under section 211(b), and
(B) in the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment
of status under section 201(b)(2)(A) or under section 203(a),
if no previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien
under section 274C and the offense was committed solely to assist,
aid, or support the alien’s spouse or child (and not another indi-
vidual). No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the
Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver under this paragraph.
(13)(A) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine
whether a ground for inadmissibility exists with respect to a non-
immigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(T), except that the
ground for inadmissibility described in subsection (a)(4) shall not
apply with respect to such a nonimmigrant.
(B) In addition to any other waiver that may be available under
this section, in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(T), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, in the Attorney General’s discretion, may waive the applica-
tion of—
(i) subsection (a)(1); and
(ii) any other provision of subsection (a) (excluding para-
graphs (3), (4), (10)(C), and (10(E)) if the activities rendering
the alien inadmissible under the provision were caused by, or
were incident to, the victimization described in section
101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I).
(14) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine wheth-
er a ground of inadmissibility exists with respect to a non-
immigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(U). The Secretary of
Homeland Security, in the Attorney General’s discretion, may
waive the application of subsection (a) (other than paragraph
(3)(E)) in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(U), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the public or national interest to do so.
(e) No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J) or acquiring
such status after admission (i) whose participation in the program
for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or
in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of
the United States or by the government of the country of his na-
tionality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or
acquisition of status under section 101(a)(15)(J) was a national or
resident of a country which the Director of the United States Infor-
mation Agency pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, had des-
ignated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the
field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was en-
gaged, or (iii) who came to the United States or acquired such sta-
tus in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall

Section 18:
section 101(a)(15)(L) until it is established that such person has re-
sided and been physically present in the country of his nationality
or his last residence for an aggregate of a least two years following
departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favor-
able recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an
interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an
alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the request of a State
Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Commis-
sioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined
that departure from the United States would impose exceptional
hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse or child
is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully resident alien), or
that the alien cannot return to the country of his nationality or last
residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of
race, religion, or political opinion, the Attorney General may waive
the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the
case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by
the Attorney General to be in the public interest except that in the
case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public Health,
or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an inter-
ested United States Government agency on behalf of an alien de-
scribed in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the require-
ments of section 214(l): And provided further, That, except in the
case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may,
upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such
two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the
foreign country of the alien’s nationality or last residence has fur-
nished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection
to such waiver in the case of such alien.
(f) Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or
of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental
to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and
for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of
all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants,
or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to
be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a com-
mercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attor-
ney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection
of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the
United States (including the training of personnel in such detec-
tion), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all
aliens transported to the United States by such airline.
(g) The Attorney General may waive the application of—
(1) subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) in the case of any alien who—
(A) is the spouse or the unmarried son or daughter, or
the minor unmarried lawfully adopted child, of a United
States citizen, or of an alien lawfully admitted for perma-
nent residence, or of an alien who has been issued an im-

or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or

physician (as those terms are defined by section 34.2 of
title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations) certifies, ac-
cording to such regulations as the Secretary of Health and
Human Services may prescribe, that such vaccination
would not be medically appropriate, or
(C) under such circumstances as the Attorney General
provides by regulation, with respect to whom the require-
ment of such a vaccination would be contrary to the alien’s
religious beliefs or moral convictions; or
(3) subsection (a)(1)(A)(iii) in the case of any alien, in accord-
ance with such terms, conditions, and controls, if any, includ-
ing the giving of bond, as the Attorney General, in the discre-

retary of Health and Human Services, may by regulation pre-

cation of subparagraphs (A)(i)(I), (B), (D), and (E) of subsection

relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less
of marijuana if—

satisfaction of the Attorney General that—
(i) the alien is inadmissible only under subparagraph
(D)(i) or (D)(ii) of such subsection or the activities for
which the alien is inadmissible occurred more than 15
years before the date of the alien’s application for a visa,
admission, or adjustment of status,
(ii) the admission to the United States of such alien
would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or se-
curity of the United States, and
(iii) the alien has been rehabilitated; or
(B) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, parent,
son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established
to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien’s de-
nial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the
United States citizen or lawfully resident spouse, parent, son,
or daughter of such alien; or
(C) the alien is a VAWA self-petitioner; and
(2) the Attorney General, in his discretion, and pursuant to
such terms, conditions and procedures as he may by regula-
tions prescribe, has consented to the alien’s applying or re-
applying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or ad-
justment of status.

No waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of
an alien who has been convicted of (or who has admitted commit-
ting acts that constitute) murder or criminal acts involving torture,
or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act in-
volving torture. No waiver shall be granted under this subsection
in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the
United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
dence if either since the date of such admission the alien has been
convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully re-
sided continuously in the United States for a period of not less
than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of pro-
ceedings to remove the alien from the United States. No court shall
have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to
grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.
(i)(1) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
General, waive the application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(C)
in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, son, or daughter
of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for per-
manent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the Attor-
ney General that the refusal of admission to the United States of
such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the cit-
izen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such an alien or, in
the case of a VAWA self-petitioner, the alien demonstrates extreme
hardship to the alien or the alien’s United States citizen, lawful
permanent resident, or qualified alien parent or child.
(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision or action
of the Attorney General regarding a waiver under paragraph (1).
(j)(1) The additional requirements referred to in section
101(a)(15)(J) for an alien who is coming to the United States under
a program under which he will receive graduate medical education
or training are as follows:
(A) A school of medicine or of one of the other health profes-
sions, which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the
purpose by the Secretary of Education, has agreed in writing
to provide the graduate medical education or training under
the program for which the alien is coming to the United States
or to assume responsibility for arranging for the provision
thereof by an appropriate public or nonprofit private institu-
tion or agency, except that, in the case of such an agreement
by a school of medicine, any one or more of its affiliated hos-
pitals which are to participate in the provision of the graduate
medical education or training must join in the agreement.
(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has
been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of
medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for
the purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of
whether such school of medicine is in the United States); or
(ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Med-
ical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as
determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services),
(II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be
able to adapt to the educational and cultural environment in
which he will be receiving his education or training, and (IV)

iners examination if the alien was fully and permanently li-
censed to practice medicine in a State on January 9, 1978, and
was practicing medicine in a State on that date.
(C) The alien has made a commitment to return to the coun-
try of his nationality or last residence upon completion of the
education or training for which he is coming to the United
States, and the government of the country of his nationality or
last residence has provided a written assurance, satisfactory to
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that there is a
need in that country for persons with the skills the alien will
acquire in such education or training.
(D) The duration of the alien’s participation in the program
of graduate medical education or training for which the alien
is coming to the United States is limited to the time typically
required to complete such program, as determined by the Di-
rector of the United States Information Agency at the time of
the alien’s admission into the United States, based on criteria
which are established in coordination with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services and which take into consideration
the published requirements of the medical specialty board
which administers such education or training program; except
that—
(i) such duration is further limited to seven years unless
the alien has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Direc-
tor that the country to which the alien will return at the
end of such specialty education or training has an excep-
tional need for an individual trained in such specialty, and
(ii) the alien may, once and not later than two years
after the date the alien is admitted to the United States
as an exchange visitor or acquires exchange visitor status,
change the alien’s designated program of graduate medical
education or training if the Director approves the change
and if a commitment and written assurance with respect
to the alien’s new program have been provided in accord-
ance with subparagraph (C).
(E) The alien furnishes the Attorney General each year with
an affidavit (in such form as the Attorney General shall pre-
scribe) that attests that the alien (i) is in good standing in the
program of graduate medical education or training in which
the alien is participating, and (ii) will return to the country of
his nationality or last residence upon completion of the edu-
cation or training for which he came to the United States.
(2) An alien who is a graduate of a medical school and who is
coming to the United States to perform services as a member of the
medical profession may not be admitted as a nonimmigrant under

Section 19:
section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) unless—
(A) the alien is coming pursuant to an invitation from a pub-
lic or nonprofit private educational or research institution or
agency in the United States to teach or conduct research, or
both, at or for such institution or agency, or
(B)(i) the alien has passed the Federation licensing examina-
tion (administered by the Federation of State Medical Boards

mined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
(ii)(I) has competency in oral and written English or (II) is
a graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a
body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of
Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in
the United States).
(3) The Director of the United States Information Agency annu-
ally shall transmit to the Congress a report on aliens who have
submitted affidavits described in paragraph (1)(E), and shall in-
clude in such report the name and address of each such alien, the
medical education or training program in which such alien is par-
ticipating, and the status of such alien in that program.
(k) Any alien, inadmissible from the United States under para-
graph (5)(A) or (7)(A)(i) of subsection (a), who is in possession of an
immigrant visa may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in the
discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General is satis-
fied that inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have
been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the im-
migrant before the time of departure of the vessel or aircraft from
the last port outside the United States and outside foreign contig-
uous territory or, in the case of an immigrant coming from foreign
contiguous territory, before the time of the immigrant’s application
for admission.
(l) GUAM AND NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS VISA WAIVER PRO-
GRAM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The requirement of subsection (a)(7)(B)(i)
may be waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the
case of an alien applying for admission as a nonimmigrant vis-
itor for business or pleasure and solely for entry into and stay
in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands for a period not to exceed 45 days, if the Secretary of
Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior, the Secretary of State, the Governor of Guam and
the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, determines that—
(A) an adequate arrival and departure control system
has been developed in Guam and the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; and
(B) such a waiver does not represent a threat to the wel-
fare, safety, or security of the United States or its terri-
tories and commonwealths.
(2) ALIEN WAIVER OF RIGHTS.—An alien may not be provided
a waiver under this subsection unless the alien has waived any
right—
(A) to review or appeal under this Act an immigration
officer’s determination as to the admissibility of the alien
at the port of entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; or
(B) to contest, other than on the basis of an application
for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of this
Act or under the Convention Against Torture, or an appli-
cation for asylum if permitted under section 208, any ac-
tion for removal of the alien.

(3) REGULATIONS.—All necessary regulations to implement
this subsection shall be promulgated by the Secretary of Home-
land Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior
and the Secretary of State, on or before the 180th day after the
date of enactment of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act
of 2008. The promulgation of such regulations shall be consid-
ered a foreign affairs function for purposes of section 553(a) of
title 5, United States Code. At a minimum, such regulations
should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
(A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may obtain
the waiver also provided by this subsection, except that
such regulations shall provide for a listing of any country
from which the Commonwealth has received a significant
economic benefit from the number of visitors for pleasure
within the one-year period preceding the date of enactment
of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, unless
the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such
country’s inclusion on such list would represent a threat to
the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its
territories; and
(B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or
all of those countries who may present an increased risk
of overstays or other potential problems, if different from
such requirements otherwise provided by law for non-
immigrant visitors.
(4) FACTORS.—In determining whether to grant or continue
providing the waiver under this subsection to nationals of any
country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State,
shall consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant, in-
cluding electronic travel authorizations, procedures for report-
ing lost and stolen passports, repatriation of aliens, rates of re-
fusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems,
and information exchange.
(5) SUSPENSION.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to Guam and
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under
this subsection. If the Secretary determines that such admis-
sions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors from
a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unlawfully obtaining
entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking with-
holding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country
pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of Guam
or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or of
the United States (including the interest in the enforcement of
the immigration laws of the United States), the Secretary shall
suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this
subsection. The Secretary of Homeland Security may in the
Secretary’s discretion suspend the Guam and Northern Mar-
iana Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-
by-country basis, for other good cause.
(6) ADDITION OF COUNTRIES.—The Governor of Guam and the
Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec-

retary of Homeland Security to add a particular country to the
list of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity may grant such request after consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may pro-
mulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of that coun-
try and any special requirements the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the Secretary’s sole discretion, may impose prior to
allowing nationals of that country to obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection.
(m)(1) The qualifications referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
with respect to an alien who is coming to the United States to per-

professional nursing in the country where the alien obtained
nursing education or has received nursing education in the
United States;

such temporary or interim licensing requirements which au-
thorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of in-
tended employment to engage in the practice of professional
nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to
the United States and is authorized under such laws to be em-
ployed by the facility.
(2)(A) The attestation referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
with respect to a facility for which an alien will perform services,
is an attestation as to the following:
(i) The facility meets all the requirements of paragraph (6).
(ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the
wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly
employed.
(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage
rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.
(iv) The facility has taken and is taking timely and signifi-
cant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered
nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are
authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as
quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on
nonimmigrant registered nurses.
(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a reg-
istered nurse employed by the facility within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing
of any visa petition, and the employment of such an alien is
not intended or designed to influence an election for a bar-
gaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.
(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered
nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), notice of the filing has
been provided by the facility to the bargaining representative

such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been
provided to the registered nurses employed at the facility
through posting in conspicuous locations.
(vii) The facility will not, at any time, employ a number of
aliens issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) that exceeds 33 percent of the
total number of registered nurses employed by the facility.
(viii) The facility will not, with respect to any alien issued a
visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c)—
(I) authorize the alien to perform nursing services at any
worksite other than a worksite controlled by the facility; or
(II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from
one worksite to another.
Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility
to have taken significant steps described in such clause before
the date of the enactment of the Nursing Relief for Disadvan-
taged Areas Act of 1999. A copy of the attestation shall be pro-
vided, within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered nurses
employed at the facility on the date of filing.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the following
shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit
and retain registered nurses:
(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the
facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
program for registered nurses elsewhere.
(ii) Providing career development programs and other meth-
ods of facilitating health care workers to become registered
nurses.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than
currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in
the geographic area.
(iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary
advancement by registered nurses.
The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered
to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken
to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv). Nothing in this sub-
paragraph shall require a facility to take more than one step if the
facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reason-
able.
(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subpara-
graph (A)—

(II) the end of the period of admission under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the last alien with respect to whose
admission it was applied (in accordance with clause (ii));
and
(ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year period
beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor
if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to
comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph
with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.

(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a
list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for non-
immigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) and, for each such fa-
cility, a copy of the facility’s attestation under subparagraph (A)
(and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by
the facility.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including
reasonable time limits, for the receipt, investigation, and disposi-
tion of complaints respecting a facility’s failure to meet conditions
attested to or a facility’s misrepresentation of a material fact in an
attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or or-
ganization (including bargaining representatives, associations
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties
as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary
shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reason-
able cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested
to. Subject to the time limits established under this clause, this
subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation is
expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in
clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the
Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the in-
terested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint
within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has
failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepre-
sentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall no-
tify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, im-
pose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary
penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per viola-
tion, with the total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation) as
the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with
respect to a facility during a period of at least one year for nurses
to be employed by the facility.
(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv), if
the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under
subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at
the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to
provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be re-
quired to comply with such condition.
(F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing an
attestation under subparagraph (A) a filing fee, in an amount pre-
scribed by the Secretary based on the costs of carrying out the Sec-
retary’s duties under this subsection, but not exceeding $250.
(ii) Fees collected under this subparagraph shall be deposited in
a fund established for this purpose in the Treasury of the United
States.
(iii) The collected fees in the fund shall be available to the Sec-
retary of Labor, to the extent and in such amounts as may be pro-

(i), in addition to any other funds that are available to the Sec-
retary to cover such costs.
(3) The period of admission of an alien under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) shall be 3 years.
(4) The total number of nonimmigrant visas issued pursuant to
petitions granted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) in each fiscal
year shall not exceed 500. The number of such visas issued for em-
ployment in each State in each fiscal year shall not exceed the fol-
lowing:
(A) For States with populations of less than 9,000,000, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 25 visas.
(B) For States with populations of 9,000,000 or more, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 50 visas.
(C) If the total number of visas available under this para-
graph for a fiscal year quarter exceeds the number of qualified
nonimmigrants who may be issued such visas during those
quarters, the visas made available under this paragraph shall
be issued without regard to the numerical limitation under
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph during the last fiscal
year quarter.
(5) A facility that has filed a petition under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) to employ a nonimmigrant to perform nursing
services for the facility—
(A) shall provide the nonimmigrant a wage rate and working
conditions commensurate with those of nurses similarly em-
ployed by the facility;
(B) shall require the nonimmigrant to work hours commen-
surate with those of nurses similarly employed by the facility;
and
(C) shall not interfere with the right of the nonimmigrant to
join or organize a union.
(6) For purposes of this subsection and section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
the term ‘‘facility’’ means a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in

Section 20:
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
1395ww(d)(1)(B))) that meets the following requirements:
(A) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a
health professional shortage area (as defined in section 332 of
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).
(B) Based on its settled cost report filed under title XVIII of
the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period beginning
during fiscal year 1994—
(i) the hospital has not less than 190 licensed acute care
beds;
(ii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were entitled to benefits under part A of such title is not
less than 35 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period; and
(iii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan ap-
proved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, is not
less than 28 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period.

(7) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(v), the term ‘‘lay off’’,
with respect to a worker—
(A) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(B) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit an employee’s
or an employer’s rights under a collective bargaining agree-
ment or other employment contract.
(n)(1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as an H–1B
nonimmigrant in an occupational classification unless the employer
has filed with the Secretary of Labor an application stating the fol-
lowing:
(A) The employer—
(i) is offering and will offer during the period of author-
ized employment to aliens admitted or provided status as
an H–1B nonimmigrant wages that are at least—
(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all
other individuals with similar experience and quali-
fications for the specific employment in question, or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the application, and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-
immigrant that will not adversely affect the working condi-
tions of workers similarly employed.
(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute in the occupational classification at the place of em-
ployment.
(C) The employer, at the time of filing the application—

provided notice of filing in the occupational classification
through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
locations at the place of employment or electronic notifica-
tion to employees in the occupational classification for
which H–1B nonimmigrants are sought.
(D) The application shall contain a specification of the num-
ber of workers sought, the occupational classification in which
the workers will be employed, and wage rate and conditions
under which they will be employed.

the employer did not displace and will not displace a United
States worker (as defined in paragraph (4)) employed by the

ing 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition sup-
ported by the application.
(ii) An application described in this clause is an application
filed on or after the date final regulations are first promul-
gated to carry out this subparagraph, and before by an H–1B-
dependent employer (as defined in paragraph (3)) or by an em-
ployer that has been found, on or after the date of the enact-
ment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Im-
provement Act of 1998, under paragraph (2)(C) or (5) to have
committed a willful failure or misrepresentation during the 5-
year period preceding the filing of the application. An applica-
tion is not described in this clause if the only H–1B non-
immigrants sought in the application are exempt H–1B non-
immigrants.
(F) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
(E)(ii), the employer will not place the nonimmigrant with an-
other employer (regardless of whether or not such other em-
ployer is an H–1B-dependent employer) where—
(i) the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part
at one or more worksites owned, operated, or controlled by
such other employer; and
(ii) there are indicia of an employment relationship be-
tween the nonimmigrant and such other employer;
unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to
whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of the
placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer, the
other employer has displaced or intends to displace a United
States worker employed by the other employer.
(G)(i) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
(E)(ii), subject to clause (ii), the employer, prior to filing the ap-
plication—
(I) has taken good faith steps to recruit, in the United
States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards
and offering compensation that is at least as great as that
required to be offered to H–1B nonimmigrants under sub-
paragraph (A), United States workers for the job for which
the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
(II) has offered the job to any United States worker who
applies and is equally or better qualified for the job for
which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are
sought.
(ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to
an application filed with respect to the employment of an H–
1B nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or
(C) of section 203(b)(1).
The employer shall make available for public examination, within
one working day after the date on which an application under this
paragraph is filed, at the employer’s principal place of business or
worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying
documents as are necessary). The Secretary shall compile, on a cur-
rent basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of
the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include

tion is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall pro-
vide the certification described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) within
7 days of the date of the filing of the application. The application
form shall include a clear statement explaining the liability under
subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer de-
scribed in such subparagraph displaces a United States worker as
described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G) shall
be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate selec-
tion criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the
type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a
discriminatory manner.
(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall establish
a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of com-
plaints respecting a petitioner’s failure to meet a condition specified
in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner’s
misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Com-
plaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (in-
cluding bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing
shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or mis-
representation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respec-
tively. The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this
paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure
or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding
described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that
such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for no-
tice of such determination to the interested parties and an oppor-
tunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section
556 of title 5, United States Code, within 60 days after the date
of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary
shall make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60
days after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the
hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E),
or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
(1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material fact
in an application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be employed by the
employer.

(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a willful
misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a violation
of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or a
willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in the
course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced
a United States worker employed by the employer within the pe-
riod beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date
of filing of any visa petition supported by the application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-
strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,
includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise
a process under which an H–1B nonimmigrant who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an H–1B non-
immigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the em-
ployer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the em-
ployer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment
is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
State law.

(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an alien who is the
subject of a petition filed under section 214(c)(1), for which a fee
is imposed under section 214(c)(9), to reimburse, or otherwise com-
pensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is
a violation of this clause for such an employer otherwise to accept
such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.
(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause,
the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for
each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the
return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this
clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring pay-
ment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection
and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
employee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the em-
ployer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as
lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant’s lack of a permit or li-
cense, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accord-
ance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and
who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time em-
ployee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the employer
with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has en-
tered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status
under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such
a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such petition
consistent with the rate of pay identified on such petition.
(III) In the case of an H–1B nonimmigrant who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
application under this subsection, and a petition under section
214(c)(1), with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of sub-
clauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days
after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United
States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the non-
immigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer (in the case
of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date
of the approval of the petition).
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an
H–1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-re-
lated factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant
for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant un-
able to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to an
H–1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to H–1B nonimmigrants and
United States workers in the same occupational classification an
annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—

(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to
fail to offer to an H–1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant’s
period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for bene-
fits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life, dis-
ability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in
retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and noncash com-
pensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on perform-
ance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria,
as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level speci-
fied under the application and required under paragraph (1), the
Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of such
amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the re-
quirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under sub-
paragraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) If an H–1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H–1B
nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph
(1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United
States worker employed by such other employer during the period
described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered
for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer,
to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under
paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a
sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i), (C)(ii),
or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing em-
ployer—
(i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the
time of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other em-
ployer; or
(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph
based upon a previous placement of an H–1B nonimmigrant
with the same other employer.
(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an em-
ployer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, begin-
ning on the date (on or after the date of the enactment of the
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of
1998) on which the employer is found by the Secretary to have
committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or
has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful
failure to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have
made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application.
The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of
whether or not the employer is an H–1B-dependent employer. The
authority of the Secretary under this subparagraph shall not be

construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of sub-
paragraph (A).
(G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of any
employer that employs nonimmigrants described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) if the Secretary of Labor has reasonable cause to
believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection.
In the case of an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of
Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case of the absence of dis-
ability of the Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that rea-
sonable cause exists and shall approve commencement of the inves-
tigation. The investigation may be initiated for reasons other than
completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in com-
plying with this subsection.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible information
from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer’s
practices or employment conditions, or an employer’s compliance
with the employer’s labor condition application under paragraph
(1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, and
such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the em-
ployer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of para-
graph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged
in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has
committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that af-
fects multiple employees, the Secretary of Labor may conduct an
investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of
Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer,
and the source’s identity shall not be subject to disclosure under

Section 21:
section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any
person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information de-
scribed in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the
basis for the commencement of an investigation described in such
clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed
and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on be-
half of the person. The person may not be an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the re-
quirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the
Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the per-
son).
(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of
Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies
the requirements of such clause and that—
(I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor; or
(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the
course of lawfully conducting another Department of Labor in-
vestigation under this Act of any other Act.
(v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information sub-
mitted by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary of
Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) shall not be considered a re-
ceipt of information for purposes of clause (ii).
(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing described
in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be conducted with
respect to information about a failure to meet a condition described

in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the informa-
tion not later than 12 months after the date of the alleged failure.
(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer
with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an inves-
tigation described in clauses (i) or (ii), prior to the commencement
of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an
investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and
shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond to
the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Sec-
retary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the
Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere with
an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the em-
ployer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall be no
judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor under
this clause.
(viii) An investigation under clauses (i) or (ii) may be conducted
for a period of up to 60 days. If the Secretary of Labor determines
after such an investigation that a reasonable basis exists to make
a finding that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet
a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or
(1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet
such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to meet
such a condition that affects multiple employees, the Secretary of
Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the inter-
ested parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with

Section 22:
section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 120 days after the
date of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Sec-
retary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the matter by not
later than 120 days after the date of the hearing.
(H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or enti-
ty is considered to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to
meet such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to com-
ply with the requirements.
(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if—
(I) the Department of Labor (or another enforcement agency)
has explained to the person or entity the basis for the failure;
(II) the person or entity has been provided a period of not
less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the ex-
planation) within which to correct the failure; and
(III) the person or entity has not corrected the failure volun-
tarily within such period.
(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation,
is found to have violated the prevailing wage requirements set
forth in paragraph (1)(A), shall not be assessed fines or other
penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish
that the manner in which the prevailing wage was calculated
was consistent with recognized industry standards and prac-
tices.
(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity
that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
willful violations of this subsection.
(I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.

nonimmigrant who—
(I) receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar
compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000;

equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employ-
ment; and
(ii) the term nonexempt H–1B nonimmigrant means an H–

(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
(i) in computing the number of full-time equivalent employ-
ees and the number of H–1B nonimmigrants, exempt H–1B
nonimmigrants shall not be taken into account during the
longer of—
(I) the 6-month period beginning on the date of the en-
actment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce
Improvement Act of 1998; or
(II) the period beginning on the date of the enactment of
the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improve-
ment Act of 1998 and ending on the date final regulations

(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the H–1B nonimmigrant is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more
H–1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is consid-
ered to ‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the em-
ployer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the
equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or non-
immigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to
be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves es-
sentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States
worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experi-

other job.
(C) The term ‘‘H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an alien admit-
ted or provided status as a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).
(D)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract (other than a temporary employment contract en-
tered into in order to evade a condition described in sub-
paragraph (E) or (F) of paragraph (1)); but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
(or, in the case of a placement of a worker with another
employer under paragraph (1)(F), with either employer de-
scribed in such paragraph) at equivalent or higher com-
pensation and benefits than the position from which the
employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the
employee accepts the offer.

ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(E) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee

erwise authorized, by this Act or by the Attorney General,
to be employed.
(5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A)
through (E) of paragraph (2) in the case of a violation described in
subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect the
authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect to
any other violation.
(B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the re-
ceipt, initial review, and disposition in accordance with this para-
graph of complaints respecting an employer’s failure to meet the
condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner’s misrepresenta-
tion of material facts with respect to such condition. Complaints
may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has submitted a
re´sume´ or otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for the job
that is the subject of the condition. No proceeding shall be con-
ducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a fail-
ure or misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines
that the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the
date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
(C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been filed
in accordance with subparagraph (B) and there is reasonable cause
to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described in
such complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate

roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure
and rules of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such
arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney Gen-
eral shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a
failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B) oc-
curred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or misrepresentation
was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding to that effect. The
arbitrator may not find such a failure or misrepresentation (or that
such a failure or misrepresentation was willful) unless the com-
plainant demonstrates such a failure or misrepresentation (or its
willful character) by clear and convincing evidence. The arbitrator
shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion to the
parties to the arbitration and the Attorney General. Such findings
shall be final and conclusive, and, except as provided in this sub-
paragraph, no official or court of the United States shall have
power or jurisdiction to review any such findings.
(ii) The Attorney General may review and reverse or modify the
findings of an arbitrator only on the same bases as an award of an
arbitrator may be vacated or modified under section 10 or 11 of
title 9, United States Code.
(iii) With respect to the findings of an arbitrator, a court may re-
view only the actions of the Attorney General under clause (ii) and
may set aside such actions only on the grounds described in sub-
paragraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 706(a)(2) of title 5, United
States Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such judi-
cial review may only be brought in an appropriate United States
court of appeals.
(E) If the Attorney General receives a finding of an arbitrator
under this paragraph that an employer has failed to meet the con-
dition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or has misrepresented a material
fact with respect to such condition, unless the Attorney General re-
verses or modifies the finding under subparagraph (D)(ii)—
(i) the Attorney General may impose administrative rem-
edies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
exceed $1,000 per violation or $5,000 per violation in the case
of a willful failure or misrepresentation) as the Attorney Gen-
eral determines to be appropriate; and
(ii) the Attorney General is authorized to not approve peti-
tions filed, with respect to that employer and for aliens to be
employed by the employer, under section 204 or 214(c)—
(I) during a period of not more than 1 year; or
(II) in the case of a willful failure or willful misrepresen-
tation, during a period of not more than 2 years.
(F) The Attorney General shall not delegate, to any other em-
ployee or official of the Department of Justice, any function of the
Attorney General under this paragraph, until 60 days after the At-
torney General has submitted a plan for such delegation to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.

under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality
Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986 at any date, who—
(A) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse
of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent
resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986;
(B) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, re-
sided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a
lawful permanent resident; and
(C) applied for benefits under section 301(a) of the Immi-
gration Act of 1990.
(p)(1) In computing the prevailing wage level for an occupational
classification in an area of employment for purposes of subsections
(a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) in the case of an em-
ployee of—
(A) an institution of higher education (as defined in section
101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or a related or af-
filiated nonprofit entity; or
(B) a nonprofit research organization or a Governmental re-
search organization,
the prevailing wage level shall only take into account employees at
such institutions and organizations in the area of employment.
(2) With respect to a professional athlete (as defined in sub-

Section 23:
section (a)(5)(A)(iii)(II)) when the job opportunity is covered by pro-
fessional sports league rules or regulations, the wage set forth in
those rules or regulations shall be considered as not adversely af-
fecting the wages of United States workers similarly employed and

(4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to em-
ployers, a governmental survey to determine the prevailing wage,
such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commensurate
with experience, education, and the level of supervision. Where an
existing government survey has only 2 levels, 2 intermediate levels
may be created by dividing by 3, the difference between the 2 levels
offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the first level and
subtracting that quotient from the second level.
(q) Any alien admitted under section 101(a)(15)(B) may accept an
honorarium payment and associated incidental expenses for a
usual academic activity or activities (lasting not longer than 9 days
at any single institution), as defined by the Attorney General in
consultation with the Secretary of Education, if such payment is of-
fered by an institution or organization described in subsection
(p)(1) and is made for services conducted for the benefit of that in-
stitution or entity and if the alien has not accepted such payment
or expenses from more than 5 institutions or organizations in the
previous 6-month period.

justment of status, the Attorney General) a certified statement
from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (or

the certification of nurses under subsection (a)(5)(C) by the Attor-
ney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and

language proficiency of those who complete such pro-
grams in that country, justify the country’s designa-
tion; or
(ii) designated on the basis of such an assessment by
unanimous agreement of such commission and any
equivalent credentialing organizations which have
been approved under subsection (a)(5)(C) for the cer-
tification of nurses under this subsection; and
(C)(i) which was in operation on or before the date of the

permanent resident by reason of subsection (a)(4), the consular offi-
cer or the Attorney General shall not consider any benefits the
alien may have received that were authorized under section 501 of
the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) within 7 days of the date of the filing of the attes-
tation.

gaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be con-
ducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresenta-
tion unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after
the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively. The Sec-
retary of Labor shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph
if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure or mis-
representation has occurred.
(B) Under the process described in subparagraph (A), the Sec-

mination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing
on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, United
States Code, within 60 days after the date of the determination. If
such a hearing is requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a
finding concerning the matter by not later than 60 days after the
date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints respecting the
same applicant, the Secretary of Labor may consolidate the hear-
ings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), a
substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(C) or (1)(D),
or a misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$1,000 per violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-
tions filed with respect to that employer under section 204,
214(c), 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 1 year for aliens to
be employed by the employer.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1),
a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, or a
violation of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$5,000 per violation as the Secretary of Labor determines to be

curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-

(iii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)
or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, in
the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer dis-
placed a United States worker employed by the employer within
the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the
date of filing of any visa petition or application supported by the
attestation—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$35,000 per violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-
tions filed with respect to that employer under section 204,
214(c), 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 3 years for aliens
to be employed by the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an attestation under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-
strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,
includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity shall devise a process under which a nonimmigrant under sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an attestation under this subsection to require a nonimmigrant
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) to pay
a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date
agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of
Labor shall determine whether a required payment is a penalty
(and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.
(II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this
clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil monetary penalty
of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order
requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in
violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located,
requiring payment of any such amount to the general fund of the
Treasury.

(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or

Section 26:
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a full-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status due to a decision by the
employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the non-
immigrant’s lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the non-
immigrant full-time wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for
all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or

Section 27:
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a part-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status under circumstances
described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a nonimmigrant for
such hours as are designated on the attestation consistent with the
rate of pay identified on the attestation.
(III) In the case of a nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
attestation under this subsection with respect to the non-
immigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to
the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant
first is admitted into the United States, or 60 days after the date
the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer in the
case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the
date of the approval of the attestation filed with the Secretary of
Labor.
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) for nonproductive time due to non-work-related
factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an
absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to
work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to nonimmigrants under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and United States
workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in
disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to

Section 28:
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii), during the nonimmigrant’s period of au-
thorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including
the opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other
insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and
savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such
as stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the
same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the em-
ployer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage
level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph (1),
the Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for pay-
ment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply
with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty
under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject
an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years,
beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the Sec-
retary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a condi-
tion of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful misrepresentation
of material fact in an attestation. The authority of the Secretary of
Labor under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be subject
to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).
(F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more
nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) by an employer, the employer is considered to
‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the employer
lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent
of the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or
are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially
equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the
same responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with
substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is
located in the same area of employment as the other job.
(C)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer

at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an em-
ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(D) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee
who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 207 of
this title, is granted asylum under section 208, or is an im-
migrant otherwise authorized, by this Act or by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, to be employed.
(t)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted
under section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I), or acquiring such status after ad-
mission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant status, an im-
migrant visa, or permanent residence under this Act until it is es-
tablished that such person has resided and been physically present
in the person’s country of nationality or last residence for an aggre-
gate of at least 2 years following departure from the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the require-
ment of such 2-year foreign residence abroad if the Secretary deter-
mines that—
(A) departure from the United States would impose excep-
tional hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse
or child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence); or
(B) the admission of the alien is in the public interest or the
national interest of the United States.

Dissenting Views
Instead of confronting the danger of drunk driving with serious
public policy changes, H.R. 875 simply weaponizes the problem to
attack and scapegoat immigrants. It is not a serious attempt to re-
duce drunk driving, a problem on our roads that is overwhelmingly
about citizen drivers. Nor does this bill do anything to repair our
broken immigration system or secure the border.
Instead of advancing a bill that could reduce the huge number
of drunk driving fatalities on our roads, we have a bill that would
make immigrants, including permanent green card holders, deport-
able from the country for a single misdemeanor driving under the
influence (DUI) offense even when no one is hurt. This would nei-
ther reduce drunk driving nor illegal immigration. It’s weak sym-
bolic politics.
Moreover, under our immigration laws, serious DUIs already
render people inadmissible and deportable. Under the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA), a noncitizen who is convicted of, or who
admits to committing, a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude, or a
‘‘CIMT,’’ is generally inadmissible. Likewise, a noncitizen who is
convicted of a CIMT, where a sentence of one year or longer may
be imposed, is deportable. Serious DUI offenses are CIMTs under
current law.
For example, the following DUI offenses are all considered
CIMTs: a DUI where the maximum possible penalty is a year or
more and where there is serious bodily harm; hit and runs; an ag-
gravated DUI; and a DUI involving driving with knowledge of an
invalid, suspended, or revoked license.
But this bill goes far beyond current law and seeks to expand the
ability to remove green card holders for a single infraction, even
where no one is hurt and no property is damaged. Today, there are
nearly 13 million green card holders in the United States, with 9
million of them eligible to become citizens.
I. BACKGROUND ON INADMISSIBILITY AND DEPORTABILITY

Section 32:
Section 212 of the INA provides the reasons a non-citizen may
be determined to be inadmissible, and Section 237 contains the
INA’s deportability provisions.1 Both sections contain similar, but
not entirely identical grounds, ranging from criminal convictions
and security/terrorism grounds to foreign policy and public charge-
related grounds. Section 212 applies to individuals who are apply-
ing for status in the United States, whereas Section 237 generally
applies to individuals who have been lawfully admitted into the
United States and are lawfully present in the United States.

Section 33:
Section 212(a)(2) and Section 237(a)(2) of the INA contain the
criminal-related inadmissibility and deportability grounds.2

Section 34:
Section 237(a)(2)(A) renders deportable any noncitizen who ‘‘is
convicted of some crime involving moral turpitude committed with-
in five years . . . after the date of admission.’’3 Further, the con-
viction must be one ‘‘for which a sentence of one year or longer may
be imposed.’’4 This means that the actual sentence imposed need
not be one year of imprisonment, but rather that if one is convicted
of the offense, one could be sentenced to at least one year in prison.

Section 35:
Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i) is broader—it states that any noncitizen
‘‘convicted of, or who admits to committing acts which constitute
essential elements . . . a crime involving moral turpitude (other
than a purely political offense) or an attempt or conspiracy to com-
mit such a crime . . . is inadmissable.’’5
DUIs where the maximum possible penalty is a year or more and
where there is serious bodily harm, hit and runs, aggravated DUI,
driving with knowledge of an invalid, suspended, or revoked license
are all already CIMTs and therefore makes an individual both in-
admissible and deportable.6
II. DUI OFFENSES
However, this bill is a significant overreach. DUI offenses vary
all over the country. Some jurisdictions do not even require the in-
dividual to be physically driving the vehicle for a DUI offense to
be committed. For example, in Arizona, the DUI statute allows peo-
ple to be charged with a DUI if they are intoxicated and have
‘‘physical control’’ of their vehicle.7 The Ninth Circuit, in reviewing
an appeal of a removal case for a noncitizen charged under Arizo-
na’s DUI statute, found that the ‘‘physical control’’ language meant
that under this statute, ‘‘One may be convicted under it for sitting
in one’s own car in one’s own driveway with the key in the ignition
and a bottle of beer in one’s hand.’’8
While the noncitizen in this case had been ordered deported on
the basis that his conviction under this statute constituted a CIMT,
the Ninth Circuit overturned that ruling because the activities cov-
ered by the statute could not reasonably be seen as crimes involv-
ing moral turpitude.9 As the court put it, ‘‘Drunken driving is des-
picable. Having physical control of a car while drinking is not.’’10
Likewise, the Code of Virginia §18.2–266 makes it ‘‘unlawful for
any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle . . .’’ with a blood
alcohol concentration of 0.08 grams or more.11 The Virginia Su-
preme Court has interpreted this definition to mean that an intoxi-
cated person seated, asleep behind the steering wheel of a car in
their own driveway with a key inserted into the ignition switch is
in physical control and can be convicted under the statute.12

These are just two examples of overbroad DUI statutes. These
cases only made it to court because prosecutors chose to bring
these charges, so it would be implausible to argue that prosecutors
would not waste their states’ time by bringing de minimus DUI
cases. Under these statutes, individuals are charged with DUIs for
merely sleeping in their car. These people have potentially made
the conscious choice to not drive impaired, yet they end up being
punished. Under current law, such individuals would not ulti-
mately be subject to removal based on these convictions. But if this
bill were to become law, a conviction like the ones discussed above
would cause even a longstanding permanent resident to get de-
ported.
III. CONSEQUENCES FOR LEGAL IMMIGRANTS
Making new crimes into deportable offenses does not affect un-
documented immigrants. The new deportability offense in this bill
would only affect legal immigrants, such as students, those with
work visas, and lawful permanent residents. Because this new
ground encompasses such a wide array of offenses, it opens long-
term legal immigrants up to deportation even if they never posed
any sort of threat to public safety.
To rectify this, at markup, Rep. Jayapal offered an amendment
to allow an adjudicator to consider a variety of mitigating factors,
such as the severity of the offense, if anyone was hurt, or how long
the individual has lived in the country before rendering a lawful
immigrant deportable. While some Republicans indicated interest
in providing leniency for lawful immigrants, this amendment was
ultimately defeated on a party line vote.
The Majority did not provide substantive arguments against this
amendment beyond arguing that there are studies showing that a
person’s first DUI arrest is not their first DUI. The waiver author-
ity proposed by Rep. Jayapal would not prevent someone from get-
ting deported due to a DUI, it would simply allow an adjudicator
discretion to examine the underlying conduct.
* * *
H.R. 875 is an overreaching and unnecessarily broad piece of leg-
islation that would lead to absurd consequences and deportation for
people who pose no threat to our country, while doing nothing to
deter people from driving under the influence that our laws do not
already do. Instead of confronting the danger of drunk driving with
serious public policy changes, it simply weaponizes the problem to
attack and scapegoat legal immigrants. It is not a serious attempt
to reduce drunk driving, a problem on our roads that is overwhelm-
ingly about citizen drivers. Nor does this bill do anything to repair
our broken immigration system or secure the border.

The amendment is as follows:
Strike all that follows after the enacting clause and insert the
following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon
Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. INADMISSIBILITY AND DEPORTABILITY RELATED TO DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED
OR IMPAIRED.
(a) INADMISSIBILITY.—Section 212(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(J) DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED OR IMPAIRED.—Any alien who has been
convicted of, who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts
which constitute the essential elements of an offense for driving while in-
toxicated or impaired, as those terms are defined under the law of the juris-
diction where the conviction, offense, or acts constituting the essential ele-
ments of the offense occurred (including an offense for driving while under
the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs), without regard to whether
the conviction or offense is classified as a misdemeanor or felony under Fed-
eral, State, tribal, or local law, is inadmissible.’’.
(b) DEPORTABILITY.—Section 237(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(G) DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED OR IMPAIRED.—Any alien who has been
convicted of an offense for driving while intoxicated or impaired, as those
terms are defined under the law of the jurisdiction where the conviction oc-
curred (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or
impaired by alcohol or drugs), without regard to whether the conviction is
classified as a misdemeanor or felony under Federal, State, tribal, or local
law, is deportable.’’.
Purpose and Summary
H.R. 875, the Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon
Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025, intro-
duced by Rep. Barry Moore (R–AL), would create a new ground of
inadmissibility for aliens convicted of, or admitting to, driving
under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It also codifies a new
ground of removability for aliens with driving under the influence
(DUI) convictions.
Background and Need for the Legislation
One person dies in a drunk driving crash every 45 minutes,1
with 13,384 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in 2021 and 13,524
in 2022.2 In 2021, drunk driving crashes led to 388,136 injuries.3
Because there is neither a ground of inadmissibility nor a ground
of removability related to DUI, criminal aliens can escape account-
ability for their reckless actions, free to re-offend and endanger
communities. H.R. 875 is named in honor of Jeremy and Angel
Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, three victims of drunk driv-
ing by illegal aliens.

Jeremy and Angel Seay
On June 13, 2009, Jeremy and Angel Seay of Enterprise, Ala-
bama, were killed when Freddie DeLeon Perez, an illegal alien,
crashed into their motorcycle.4 Witnesses ‘‘contend[ed] [Perez] had
been drinking that night’’ before he drove his truck into the newly-
weds.5 Perez ‘‘pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular homicide
and one count of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries’’ and
was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment.6
Sergeant Brandon Mendoza
In May 2014, ‘‘a man that drove 35 miles along multiple Phoenix
freeways in the wrong direction’’ crashed into Mesa, Arizona, police
officer Brandon Mendoza, killing both Sergeant Mendoza and the
driver, Raul Silva-Corona.7 A 13-year veteran of the Mesa Police
Department, Sergeant Mendoza was on his way home after com-
pleting his shift when Silva-Corona crashed into his vehicle.8 Silva-
Corona’s blood-alcohol level was nearly ‘‘three times the legal
limit.’’9 Despite being convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary
after a 1994 arrest in Colorado, Corona-Silva ‘‘had lived in the
United States illegally for more than 20 years.’’10
The dangers of drunk driving
Despite drunk driving being illegal in every state and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, individuals who drive drunk continue to kill or
injure hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. Alcohol-im-
paired fatalities increased by 14 percent from 2020 to 2021, with
a total of 13,617 deaths.11 The number of alcohol-impaired fatali-
ties remained steady in 2022, with 13,524 deaths.12 Drunk drivers
are involved in 31 percent of all crash deaths in the country, with
an average of 10,850 people killed every year in DUI-related crash-
es from 2012 through 2021.13 Criminal and illegal aliens are re-
sponsible for some of these preventable crashes and deaths.
In October 2022, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) announced it had arrested ‘‘175 illegal immigrants who had

multiple DUI convictions.’’14 In FY 2018, ICE arrested aliens
whose criminal histories included 80,730 DUI-related charges and
convictions.15 In FY 2019, ICE nearly matched that number, ar-
resting aliens who accounted for 74,523 DUI charges and convic-
tions.16 Because of Democrats’ lax immigration enforcement, in FY
2022, that number plummeted to 26,238, meaning that more illegal
aliens with DUI-related charges and convictions are free to re-
offend in American communities.17 In FY 2023, the number of DUI-
related ICE arrests continued to be lower than during the first
Trump Administration, with ICE arresting aliens whose criminal
histories accounted for only 43,044 DUI-related charges and convic-
tions—barely half the FY 2018 number and more than 30,000
fewer than in FY 2019.18
The effects of illegal alien drunk driving are felt across the coun-
try—not just the southwest border. In January 2025, an illegal
alien from Mexico was arrested in Florida for his third DUI after
he hit and killed a kindergartener.19 In Texas in December 2024,
an illegal alien killed 7-year-old Ivory Smith after he drove drunk
and crashed into a car driven by Ivory’s mother.20 Just months ear-
lier, ICE had lifted a detainer it previously lodged against the ille-
gal alien after he was ‘‘arrested for assaulting a family member in
June’’ 2024.21 In a suspected drunk driving crash in Georgia, an il-
legal alien ‘‘ran through a red light, going 100 mph, and T-boned
another car, killing the driver’’ in December 2024.22 And in St.
Louis, Missouri, an illegal alien lost control of his vehicle, which
then struck a St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department officer as
the officer ‘‘respond[ed] to a vehicular accident on Interstate 70 at
the time.’’23 Authorities charged the illegal alien with DWI.24 In a
similar incident in 2016, an illegal alien drunk driver ‘‘ran into the
back of [a sheriff’s deputy’s] vehicle,’’ pushing it into another vehi-
cle and killing Master Deputy Brandon Collins.25

In addition, in September 2023, an illegal alien ‘‘slammed into
a[] [New York City Police Department] squad car and three other
vehicles’’ and then ‘‘bit off a piece of a police sergeant’s finger while
in a holding cell.’’26 Police eventually charged the man with driving
while intoxicated and ‘‘driving while apparently impaired.’’27 In
Missouri in November 2023, an illegal alien from Honduras was
sentenced to 10 years in prison ‘‘for driving drunk at 100 mph’’ and
killing another driver.28 In Montana, an illegal alien was arrested
for driving the wrong way on an interstate,29 apparently the second
such drunk driving incident by an illegal alien on the same inter-
state within two weeks.30 In Colorado in December 2023, an illegal
alien from El Salvador31 allegedly drove drunk and killed a 46-
year-old woman and her 16-year-old son when he drove his truck
up to 100 mph and ran into the victims’ vehicle, causing it to crash
into a tree.32 Despite having five previous DUI-related convictions,
‘‘[a] Boulder County judge sentenced [the illegal alien] to probation,
community service[,] and work release’’ on December 8, 2023, in re-
lation to two of those convictions, just four days before the crash
that killed the mother and son.33
Democrat excuses for illegal aliens with DUI convictions
Despite these statistics and examples, Democrats have
downplayed drunk driving by illegal aliens. For instance, at a Judi-
ciary Committee markup in September 2021, Democrats voted
down a series of Republican amendments that would have made
certain aliens ineligible for lawful permanent residence if they had
one, two, or even 10 or more DUI convictions.34 In that markup,
then-Chairman Jerry Nadler excused criminal aliens’ drunk driving
convictions, stating, ‘‘[W]hether someone has 2, or 6, or 10, or 20

convictions of DUI 30 years ago, someone can change.’’35 He added,
‘‘You may have any number of convictions for DUI because you are
a drunk, because you are an alcoholic, but you also may cease to
be an alcoholic.’’36 In January 2020, then-presidential candidate
Joe Biden asserted that ICE should not arrest aliens with drunk
driving convictions because, ‘‘[y]ou only arrest for the purpose of
dealing with a felony that’s committed, and I don’t count drunk
driving as a felony.’’37 In fact, candidate Biden called for ICE offi-
cers to be fired if they arrested aliens without felony convictions,
which could include those with DUIs.38 On February 1, 2024, 150
Democrats voted against the Protect Our Communities from DUIs
Act during consideration on the House floor.39
Current immigration law treatment of DUI convictions
Although illegal aliens are routinely arrested for, charged with,
and convicted of DUI and DUI-related crimes, U.S. immigration
law does not state explicitly that driving while intoxicated or im-
paired is a ground of inadmissibility or removability.40 Instead,
aliens charged with or convicted of such crimes may rarely be
found inadmissible or removable due to having been convicted of a
crime that constitutes either an aggravated felony or a crime in-
volving moral turpitude (CIMT).41 Determining whether an offense
is an aggravated felony or a CIMT, however, often involves com-
plicated legal analysis that can produce absurd results. In one in-
stance, for example, a federal judge observed that the process,
known as the categorical approach, presented ‘‘a single legal ques-
tion about a single conviction,’’ yet the analysis ‘‘spawned, over
eleven years and counting: four decisions by the [Board of Immigra-
tion Appeals], four decisions by three different immigration judges,
approximately six rounds of briefing, and a split opinion by [a fed-
eral] court.’’42 In addition, the Board of Immigration Appeals has
held that a ‘‘simple DUI offense’’ is not a crime involving moral tur-
pitude.43 Even worse, some far-left prosecutors—or even activist
judges—may ensure that illegal aliens are never convicted of DUI-
related crimes in the first place, which makes it even more impor-
tant that aliens can be held responsible for their criminal actions

if they admit to, but are not convicted of, driving under the influ-
ence.
American communities should not have to wait until an illegal
alien kills or seriously injures someone in a drunk driving accident
before that alien can be removed from the United States. In fact,
according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, ‘‘most [drunk driving]
offenders drive drunk at least 80 times before they are arrested.’’44
Additionally, a 2014 article detailed how ‘‘[m]ore than one-third of
individuals who are convicted of driving under the influence [] are
repeat offenders.’’45 By specifically enumerating driving while in-
toxicated or impaired by alcohol or drugs as both a ground of inad-
missibility and a ground of removability, the Jeremy and Angel
Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities
from DUIs Act of 2025 ensures that aliens who endanger commu-
nities can be removed from the United States. In doing so, this bill
gives authorities another tool to protect America from dangerous
criminal aliens and prevents families from suffering unimaginable
losses from DUI-related crashes.
Hearings
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6)(A) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearings were used to develop H.R. 875: ‘‘Restoring Immi-

(b) NOTICES OF DENIALS.—
(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if an alien’s application
for a visa, for admission to the United States, or for adjust-
ment of status is denied by an immigration or consular officer
because the officer determines the alien to be inadmissible
under subsection (a), the officer shall provide the alien with a
timely written notice that—
(A) states the determination, and
(B) lists the specific provision or provisions of law under
which the alien is excludable or ineligible for entry or ad-
justment of status.

under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (a).
(d)(1) The Attorney General shall determine whether a ground
for inadmissible exists with respect to a nonimmigrant described in

eral’s discretion, may waive the application of subsection (a) (other
than paragraph (3)(E)) in the case of a nonimmigrant described in
section 101(a)(15)(S), if the Attorney General considers it to be in
the national interest to do so. Nothing in this section shall be re-
garded as prohibiting the Immigration and Naturalization Service
from instituting removal proceedings against an alien admitted as
a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(S) for conduct committed
after the alien’s admission into the United States, or for conduct
or a condition that was not disclosed to the Attorney General prior
to the alien’s admission as a nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(S).
(3)(A) Except as provided in this subsection, an alien (i) who is

(other than paragraphs (3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and
clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), may,
after approval by the Attorney General of a recommendation by the
Secretary of State or by the consular officer that the alien be ad-
mitted temporarily despite his inadmissibility, be granted such a
visa and may be admitted into the United States temporarily as a
nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney General, or (ii) who
is inadmissible under subsection (a) (other than paragraphs
(3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), and clauses (i) and (ii) of
paragraph (3)(E) of such subsection), but who is in possession of
appropriate documents or is granted a waiver thereof and is seek-
ing admission, may be admitted into the United States temporarily
as a nonimmigrant in the discretion of the Attorney General. The
Attorney General shall prescribe conditions, including exaction of
such bonds as may be necessary, to control and regulate the admis-
sion and return of inadmissible aliens applying for temporary ad-

(B)(i) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Attorney
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary
of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
State and the Attorney General, may determine in such Secretary’s
sole unreviewable discretion that subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not
apply with respect to an alien within the scope of that subsection
or that subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) shall not apply to a group within
the scope of that subsection, except that no such waiver may be ex-
tended to an alien who is within the scope of subsection
(a)(3)(B)(i)(II), no such waiver may be extended to an alien who is
a member or representative of, has voluntarily and knowingly en-
gaged in or endorsed or espoused or persuaded others to endorse
or espouse or support terrorist activity on behalf of, or has volun-
tarily and knowingly received military-type training from a ter-
rorist organization that is described in subclause (I) or (II) of sub-
section (a)(3)(B)(vi), and no such waiver may be extended to a
group that has engaged terrorist activity against the United States
or another democratic country or that has purposefully engaged in
a pattern or practice of terrorist activity that is directed at civil-
ians. Such a determination shall neither prejudice the ability of the
United States Government to commence criminal or civil pro-
ceedings involving a beneficiary of such a determination or any
other person, nor create any substantive or procedural right or ben-
efit for a beneficiary of such a determination or any other person.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatu-
tory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus
provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall
have jurisdiction to review such a determination or revocation ex-
cept in a proceeding for review of a final order of removal pursuant
to section 1252 of this title, and review shall be limited to the ex-
tent provided in section 1252(a)(2)(D). The Secretary of State may
not exercise the discretion provided in this clause with respect to
an alien at any time during which the alien is the subject of pend-
ing removal proceedings under section 1229a of this title.
(ii) Not later than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, the
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
each provide to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of
Representatives and of the Senate, the Committee on International
Relations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity of the House of Representatives a report on the aliens to
whom such Secretary has applied clause (i). Within one week of ap-
plying clause (i) to a group, the Secretary of State or the Secretary
of Homeland Security shall provide a report to such Committees.
(4) Either or both of the requirements of paragraph (7)(B)(i) of
subsection (a) may be waived by the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of State acting jointly (A) on the basis of unforeseen emer-
gency in individual cases, or (B) on the basis of reciprocity with re-
spect to nationals of foreign contiguous territory or of adjacent is-
lands and residents thereof having a common nationality with such
nationals, or (C) in the case of aliens proceeding in immediate and
continuous transit through the United States under contracts au-
thorized in section 238(c).

vided in subparagraph (B) or in section 214(f), in his discretion pa-

role into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he
may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian
reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admis-
sion to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not
be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes
of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland
Security, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be
returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter
his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that
of any other applicant for admission to the United States.
(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security may not parole into the
United States an alien who is a refugee unless the Secretary of
Homeland Security determines that compelling reasons in the pub-
lic interest with respect to that particular alien require that the
alien be paroled into the United States rather than be admitted as
a refugee under section 207.
(C) The attorney general of a State, or other authorized State of-
ficer, alleging a violation of the limitation under subparagraph (A)
that parole solely be granted on a case-by-case basis and solely for
urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, that
harms such State or its residents shall have standing to bring an
action against the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of
such State or the residents of such State in an appropriate district
court of the United States to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.
The court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition
of a civil action filed under this subparagraph to the greatest ex-
tent practicable. For purposes of this subparagraph, a State or its
residents shall be considered to have been harmed if the State or
its residents experience harm, including financial harm in excess of
$100.
(7) The provisions of subsection (a) (other than paragraph (7))
shall be applicable to any alien who shall leave Guam, the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the
Virgin Islands of the United States, and who seeks to enter the
continental United States or any other place under the jurisdiction
of the United States. Any alien described in this paragraph, who
is denied admission to the United States, shall be immediately re-
moved in the manner provided by section 241(c) of this Act.
(8) Upon a basis of reciprocity accredited officials of foreign gov-
ernments, their immediate families, attendants, servants, and per-
sonal employees may be admitted in immediate and continuous
transit through the United States without regard to the provisions
of this section except paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (7)(B) of
subsection (a) of this section.
(11) The Attorney General may, in his discretion for humani-
tarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in
the public interest, waive application of clause (i) of subsection
(a)(6)(E) in the case of any alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not
under an order of removal, and who is otherwise admissible to the
United States as a returning resident under section 211(b) and in
the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment of status as
an immediate relative or immigrant under section 203(a) (other
than paragraph (4) thereof), if the alien has encouraged, induced,
assisted, abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of

such action was the alien’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and
no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.
(12) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
General for humanitarian purposes or to assure family unity, waive
application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(F)—
(A) in the case of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and
not under an order of deportation or removal and who is other-
wise admissible to the United States as a returning resident
under section 211(b), and
(B) in the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment
of status under section 201(b)(2)(A) or under section 203(a),
if no previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien
under section 274C and the offense was committed solely to assist,
aid, or support the alien’s spouse or child (and not another indi-
vidual). No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the
Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver under this paragraph.
(13)(A) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine
whether a ground for inadmissibility exists with respect to a non-
immigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(T), except that the
ground for inadmissibility described in subsection (a)(4) shall not
apply with respect to such a nonimmigrant.
(B) In addition to any other waiver that may be available under
this section, in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(T), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the national interest to do so, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, in the Attorney General’s discretion, may waive the applica-
tion of—
(i) subsection (a)(1); and
(ii) any other provision of subsection (a) (excluding para-
graphs (3), (4), (10)(C), and (10(E)) if the activities rendering
the alien inadmissible under the provision were caused by, or
were incident to, the victimization described in section
101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I).
(14) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine wheth-
er a ground of inadmissibility exists with respect to a non-
immigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(U). The Secretary of
Homeland Security, in the Attorney General’s discretion, may
waive the application of subsection (a) (other than paragraph
(3)(E)) in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(U), if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to
be in the public or national interest to do so.
(e) No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J) or acquiring
such status after admission (i) whose participation in the program
for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or
in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of
the United States or by the government of the country of his na-
tionality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or
acquisition of status under section 101(a)(15)(J) was a national or
resident of a country which the Director of the United States Infor-
mation Agency pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, had des-
ignated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the
field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was en-
gaged, or (iii) who came to the United States or acquired such sta-
tus in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall

dence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or
section 101(a)(15)(L) until it is established that such person has re-
sided and been physically present in the country of his nationality
or his last residence for an aggregate of a least two years following
departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favor-
able recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an
interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an
alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the request of a State
Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Commis-
sioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined
that departure from the United States would impose exceptional
hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse or child
is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully resident alien), or
that the alien cannot return to the country of his nationality or last
residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of
race, religion, or political opinion, the Attorney General may waive
the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the
case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by
the Attorney General to be in the public interest except that in the
case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public Health,
or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an inter-
ested United States Government agency on behalf of an alien de-
scribed in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the require-
ments of section 214(l): And provided further, That, except in the
case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may,
upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such
two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the
foreign country of the alien’s nationality or last residence has fur-
nished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection
to such waiver in the case of such alien.
(f) Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or
of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental
to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and
for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of
all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants,
or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to
be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a com-
mercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attor-
ney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection
of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the
United States (including the training of personnel in such detec-
tion), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all
aliens transported to the United States by such airline.
(g) The Attorney General may waive the application of—
(1) subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) in the case of any alien who—
(A) is the spouse or the unmarried son or daughter, or
the minor unmarried lawfully adopted child, of a United
States citizen, or of an alien lawfully admitted for perma-
nent residence, or of an alien who has been issued an im-

or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or
an alien who has been issued an immigrant visa; or

physician (as those terms are defined by section 34.2 of
title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations) certifies, ac-
cording to such regulations as the Secretary of Health and
Human Services may prescribe, that such vaccination
would not be medically appropriate, or
(C) under such circumstances as the Attorney General
provides by regulation, with respect to whom the require-
ment of such a vaccination would be contrary to the alien’s
religious beliefs or moral convictions; or

ance with such terms, conditions, and controls, if any, includ-

retary of Health and Human Services, may by regulation pre-

cation of subparagraphs (A)(i)(I), (B), (D), and (E) of subsection

relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less
of marijuana if—

satisfaction of the Attorney General that—
(i) the alien is inadmissible only under subparagraph
(D)(i) or (D)(ii) of such subsection or the activities for
which the alien is inadmissible occurred more than 15
years before the date of the alien’s application for a visa,
admission, or adjustment of status,
(ii) the admission to the United States of such alien
would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or se-
curity of the United States, and
(iii) the alien has been rehabilitated; or
(B) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, parent,
son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established
to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien’s de-
nial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the
United States citizen or lawfully resident spouse, parent, son,
or daughter of such alien; or
(C) the alien is a VAWA self-petitioner; and
(2) the Attorney General, in his discretion, and pursuant to
such terms, conditions and procedures as he may by regula-
tions prescribe, has consented to the alien’s applying or re-
applying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or ad-
justment of status.

No waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of
an alien who has been convicted of (or who has admitted commit-
ting acts that constitute) murder or criminal acts involving torture,
or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act in-
volving torture. No waiver shall be granted under this subsection
in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the
United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
dence if either since the date of such admission the alien has been
convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully re-
sided continuously in the United States for a period of not less
than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of pro-
ceedings to remove the alien from the United States. No court shall
have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to
grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.
(i)(1) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney
General, waive the application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(C)
in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, son, or daughter
of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for per-
manent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the Attor-
ney General that the refusal of admission to the United States of
such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the cit-
izen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such an alien or, in
the case of a VAWA self-petitioner, the alien demonstrates extreme
hardship to the alien or the alien’s United States citizen, lawful
permanent resident, or qualified alien parent or child.
(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision or action
of the Attorney General regarding a waiver under paragraph (1).
(j)(1) The additional requirements referred to in section
101(a)(15)(J) for an alien who is coming to the United States under
a program under which he will receive graduate medical education
or training are as follows:
(A) A school of medicine or of one of the other health profes-
sions, which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the
purpose by the Secretary of Education, has agreed in writing
to provide the graduate medical education or training under
the program for which the alien is coming to the United States
or to assume responsibility for arranging for the provision
thereof by an appropriate public or nonprofit private institu-
tion or agency, except that, in the case of such an agreement
by a school of medicine, any one or more of its affiliated hos-
pitals which are to participate in the provision of the graduate
medical education or training must join in the agreement.
(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has
been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of
medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for
the purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of
whether such school of medicine is in the United States); or
(ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Med-
ical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as
determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services),
(II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be
able to adapt to the educational and cultural environment in
which he will be receiving his education or training, and (IV)

iners examination if the alien was fully and permanently li-
censed to practice medicine in a State on January 9, 1978, and
was practicing medicine in a State on that date.
(C) The alien has made a commitment to return to the coun-
try of his nationality or last residence upon completion of the
education or training for which he is coming to the United
States, and the government of the country of his nationality or
last residence has provided a written assurance, satisfactory to
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that there is a
need in that country for persons with the skills the alien will
acquire in such education or training.
(D) The duration of the alien’s participation in the program
of graduate medical education or training for which the alien
is coming to the United States is limited to the time typically
required to complete such program, as determined by the Di-
rector of the United States Information Agency at the time of
the alien’s admission into the United States, based on criteria
which are established in coordination with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services and which take into consideration
the published requirements of the medical specialty board
which administers such education or training program; except
that—
(i) such duration is further limited to seven years unless
the alien has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Direc-
tor that the country to which the alien will return at the
end of such specialty education or training has an excep-
tional need for an individual trained in such specialty, and
(ii) the alien may, once and not later than two years
after the date the alien is admitted to the United States
as an exchange visitor or acquires exchange visitor status,
change the alien’s designated program of graduate medical
education or training if the Director approves the change
and if a commitment and written assurance with respect
to the alien’s new program have been provided in accord-
ance with subparagraph (C).
(E) The alien furnishes the Attorney General each year with
an affidavit (in such form as the Attorney General shall pre-
scribe) that attests that the alien (i) is in good standing in the
program of graduate medical education or training in which
the alien is participating, and (ii) will return to the country of
his nationality or last residence upon completion of the edu-
cation or training for which he came to the United States.
(2) An alien who is a graduate of a medical school and who is
coming to the United States to perform services as a member of the
medical profession may not be admitted as a nonimmigrant under
section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) unless—
(A) the alien is coming pursuant to an invitation from a pub-
lic or nonprofit private educational or research institution or
agency in the United States to teach or conduct research, or
both, at or for such institution or agency, or
(B)(i) the alien has passed the Federation licensing examina-
tion (administered by the Federation of State Medical Boards

mined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
(ii)(I) has competency in oral and written English or (II) is
a graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a
body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of
Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in
the United States).
(3) The Director of the United States Information Agency annu-
ally shall transmit to the Congress a report on aliens who have
submitted affidavits described in paragraph (1)(E), and shall in-
clude in such report the name and address of each such alien, the
medical education or training program in which such alien is par-
ticipating, and the status of such alien in that program.
(k) Any alien, inadmissible from the United States under para-
graph (5)(A) or (7)(A)(i) of subsection (a), who is in possession of an
immigrant visa may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in the
discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General is satis-
fied that inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have
been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the im-
migrant before the time of departure of the vessel or aircraft from
the last port outside the United States and outside foreign contig-
uous territory or, in the case of an immigrant coming from foreign
contiguous territory, before the time of the immigrant’s application
for admission.
(l) GUAM AND NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS VISA WAIVER PRO-
GRAM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The requirement of subsection (a)(7)(B)(i)
may be waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the
case of an alien applying for admission as a nonimmigrant vis-
itor for business or pleasure and solely for entry into and stay
in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands for a period not to exceed 45 days, if the Secretary of
Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior, the Secretary of State, the Governor of Guam and
the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, determines that—
(A) an adequate arrival and departure control system
has been developed in Guam and the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; and
(B) such a waiver does not represent a threat to the wel-
fare, safety, or security of the United States or its terri-
tories and commonwealths.
(2) ALIEN WAIVER OF RIGHTS.—An alien may not be provided
a waiver under this subsection unless the alien has waived any
right—
(A) to review or appeal under this Act an immigration
officer’s determination as to the admissibility of the alien
at the port of entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands; or
(B) to contest, other than on the basis of an application
for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of this
Act or under the Convention Against Torture, or an appli-
cation for asylum if permitted under section 208, any ac-
tion for removal of the alien.

(3) REGULATIONS.—All necessary regulations to implement
this subsection shall be promulgated by the Secretary of Home-
land Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior
and the Secretary of State, on or before the 180th day after the
date of enactment of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act
of 2008. The promulgation of such regulations shall be consid-
ered a foreign affairs function for purposes of section 553(a) of
title 5, United States Code. At a minimum, such regulations
should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
(A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may obtain
the waiver also provided by this subsection, except that
such regulations shall provide for a listing of any country
from which the Commonwealth has received a significant
economic benefit from the number of visitors for pleasure
within the one-year period preceding the date of enactment
of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, unless
the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such
country’s inclusion on such list would represent a threat to
the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its
territories; and
(B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or
all of those countries who may present an increased risk
of overstays or other potential problems, if different from
such requirements otherwise provided by law for non-
immigrant visitors.
(4) FACTORS.—In determining whether to grant or continue
providing the waiver under this subsection to nationals of any
country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State,
shall consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant, in-
cluding electronic travel authorizations, procedures for report-
ing lost and stolen passports, repatriation of aliens, rates of re-
fusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems,
and information exchange.
(5) SUSPENSION.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to Guam and
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under
this subsection. If the Secretary determines that such admis-
sions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors from
a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unlawfully obtaining
entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking with-
holding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country
pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of Guam
or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or of
the United States (including the interest in the enforcement of
the immigration laws of the United States), the Secretary shall
suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this
subsection. The Secretary of Homeland Security may in the
Secretary’s discretion suspend the Guam and Northern Mar-
iana Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-
by-country basis, for other good cause.
(6) ADDITION OF COUNTRIES.—The Governor of Guam and the
Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Sec-

retary of Homeland Security to add a particular country to the
list of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity may grant such request after consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may pro-
mulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of that coun-
try and any special requirements the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the Secretary’s sole discretion, may impose prior to
allowing nationals of that country to obtain the waiver pro-
vided by this subsection.
(m)(1) The qualifications referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
with respect to an alien who is coming to the United States to per-

professional nursing in the country where the alien obtained
nursing education or has received nursing education in the
United States;

such temporary or interim licensing requirements which au-
thorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of in-
tended employment to engage in the practice of professional
nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to
the United States and is authorized under such laws to be em-
ployed by the facility.
(2)(A) The attestation referred to in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
with respect to a facility for which an alien will perform services,
is an attestation as to the following:
(i) The facility meets all the requirements of paragraph (6).
(ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the
wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly
employed.
(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage
rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.
(iv) The facility has taken and is taking timely and signifi-
cant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered
nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are
authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as
quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on
nonimmigrant registered nurses.
(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute, the facility did not lay off and will not lay off a reg-
istered nurse employed by the facility within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing
of any visa petition, and the employment of such an alien is
not intended or designed to influence an election for a bar-
gaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.
(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered
nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), notice of the filing has
been provided by the facility to the bargaining representative

such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been
provided to the registered nurses employed at the facility
through posting in conspicuous locations.
(vii) The facility will not, at any time, employ a number of
aliens issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) that exceeds 33 percent of the
total number of registered nurses employed by the facility.
(viii) The facility will not, with respect to any alien issued a
visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c)—
(I) authorize the alien to perform nursing services at any
worksite other than a worksite controlled by the facility; or
(II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from
one worksite to another.
Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility
to have taken significant steps described in such clause before
the date of the enactment of the Nursing Relief for Disadvan-
taged Areas Act of 1999. A copy of the attestation shall be pro-
vided, within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered nurses
employed at the facility on the date of filing.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the following
shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit
and retain registered nurses:
(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the
facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
program for registered nurses elsewhere.
(ii) Providing career development programs and other meth-
ods of facilitating health care workers to become registered
nurses.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than
currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in
the geographic area.
(iv) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary
advancement by registered nurses.
The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered
to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken
to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv). Nothing in this sub-
paragraph shall require a facility to take more than one step if the
facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reason-
able.
(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subpara-
graph (A)—

(II) the end of the period of admission under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the last alien with respect to whose
admission it was applied (in accordance with clause (ii));
and
(ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year period
beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor
if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to
comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph
with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.

(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available
for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a
list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for non-
immigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) and, for each such fa-
cility, a copy of the facility’s attestation under subparagraph (A)
(and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by
the facility.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including
reasonable time limits, for the receipt, investigation, and disposi-
tion of complaints respecting a facility’s failure to meet conditions
attested to or a facility’s misrepresentation of a material fact in an
attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or or-
ganization (including bargaining representatives, associations
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties
as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary
shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reason-
able cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested
to. Subject to the time limits established under this clause, this
subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation is
expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in
clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the
Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the in-
terested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint
within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has
failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepre-
sentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall no-
tify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, im-
pose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary
penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per viola-
tion, with the total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation) as
the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with
respect to a facility during a period of at least one year for nurses
to be employed by the facility.
(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv), if
the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under
subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at
the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to
provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be re-
quired to comply with such condition.
(F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing an
attestation under subparagraph (A) a filing fee, in an amount pre-
scribed by the Secretary based on the costs of carrying out the Sec-
retary’s duties under this subsection, but not exceeding $250.
(ii) Fees collected under this subparagraph shall be deposited in
a fund established for this purpose in the Treasury of the United
States.
(iii) The collected fees in the fund shall be available to the Sec-
retary of Labor, to the extent and in such amounts as may be pro-

(i), in addition to any other funds that are available to the Sec-
retary to cover such costs.
(3) The period of admission of an alien under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) shall be 3 years.
(4) The total number of nonimmigrant visas issued pursuant to
petitions granted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) in each fiscal
year shall not exceed 500. The number of such visas issued for em-
ployment in each State in each fiscal year shall not exceed the fol-
lowing:
(A) For States with populations of less than 9,000,000, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 25 visas.
(B) For States with populations of 9,000,000 or more, based
upon the 1990 decennial census of population, 50 visas.
(C) If the total number of visas available under this para-
graph for a fiscal year quarter exceeds the number of qualified
nonimmigrants who may be issued such visas during those
quarters, the visas made available under this paragraph shall
be issued without regard to the numerical limitation under
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph during the last fiscal
year quarter.
(5) A facility that has filed a petition under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) to employ a nonimmigrant to perform nursing
services for the facility—
(A) shall provide the nonimmigrant a wage rate and working
conditions commensurate with those of nurses similarly em-
ployed by the facility;
(B) shall require the nonimmigrant to work hours commen-
surate with those of nurses similarly employed by the facility;
and
(C) shall not interfere with the right of the nonimmigrant to
join or organize a union.
(6) For purposes of this subsection and section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c),
the term ‘‘facility’’ means a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
1395ww(d)(1)(B))) that meets the following requirements:
(A) As of March 31, 1997, the hospital was located in a
health professional shortage area (as defined in section 332 of
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).
(B) Based on its settled cost report filed under title XVIII of
the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period beginning
during fiscal year 1994—
(i) the hospital has not less than 190 licensed acute care
beds;
(ii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were entitled to benefits under part A of such title is not
less than 35 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period; and
(iii) the number of the hospital’s inpatient days for such
period which were made up of patients who (for such days)
were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan ap-
proved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, is not
less than 28 percent of the total number of such hospital’s
acute care inpatient days for such period.

(7) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(v), the term ‘‘lay off’’,
with respect to a worker—
(A) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(B) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit an employee’s
or an employer’s rights under a collective bargaining agree-
ment or other employment contract.
(n)(1) No alien may be admitted or provided status as an H–1B
nonimmigrant in an occupational classification unless the employer
has filed with the Secretary of Labor an application stating the fol-
lowing:
(A) The employer—
(i) is offering and will offer during the period of author-
ized employment to aliens admitted or provided status as
an H–1B nonimmigrant wages that are at least—
(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all
other individuals with similar experience and quali-
fications for the specific employment in question, or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the application, and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-
immigrant that will not adversely affect the working condi-
tions of workers similarly employed.
(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor
dispute in the occupational classification at the place of em-
ployment.
(C) The employer, at the time of filing the application—

provided notice of filing in the occupational classification
through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous
locations at the place of employment or electronic notifica-
tion to employees in the occupational classification for
which H–1B nonimmigrants are sought.
(D) The application shall contain a specification of the num-
ber of workers sought, the occupational classification in which
the workers will be employed, and wage rate and conditions
under which they will be employed.

the employer did not displace and will not displace a United
States worker (as defined in paragraph (4)) employed by the

ing 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition sup-
ported by the application.
(ii) An application described in this clause is an application
filed on or after the date final regulations are first promul-
gated to carry out this subparagraph, and before by an H–1B-
dependent employer (as defined in paragraph (3)) or by an em-
ployer that has been found, on or after the date of the enact-
ment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Im-
provement Act of 1998, under paragraph (2)(C) or (5) to have
committed a willful failure or misrepresentation during the 5-
year period preceding the filing of the application. An applica-
tion is not described in this clause if the only H–1B non-
immigrants sought in the application are exempt H–1B non-
immigrants.
(F) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
(E)(ii), the employer will not place the nonimmigrant with an-
other employer (regardless of whether or not such other em-
ployer is an H–1B-dependent employer) where—
(i) the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part
at one or more worksites owned, operated, or controlled by
such other employer; and
(ii) there are indicia of an employment relationship be-
tween the nonimmigrant and such other employer;
unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to
whether, and has no knowledge that, within the period begin-
ning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of the
placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer, the
other employer has displaced or intends to displace a United
States worker employed by the other employer.
(G)(i) In the case of an application described in subparagraph
(E)(ii), subject to clause (ii), the employer, prior to filing the ap-
plication—
(I) has taken good faith steps to recruit, in the United
States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards
and offering compensation that is at least as great as that
required to be offered to H–1B nonimmigrants under sub-
paragraph (A), United States workers for the job for which
the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
(II) has offered the job to any United States worker who
applies and is equally or better qualified for the job for
which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are
sought.
(ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to
an application filed with respect to the employment of an H–
1B nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or
(C) of section 203(b)(1).
The employer shall make available for public examination, within
one working day after the date on which an application under this
paragraph is filed, at the employer’s principal place of business or
worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying
documents as are necessary). The Secretary shall compile, on a cur-
rent basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of
the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include

able for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of
Labor shall review such an application only for completeness and
obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the applica-
tion is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall pro-
vide the certification described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) within
7 days of the date of the filing of the application. The application
form shall include a clear statement explaining the liability under
subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer de-
scribed in such subparagraph displaces a United States worker as
described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G) shall
be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate selec-
tion criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the
type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a
discriminatory manner.
(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall establish
a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of com-
plaints respecting a petitioner’s failure to meet a condition specified
in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner’s
misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Com-
plaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (in-
cluding bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing
shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or mis-
representation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respec-
tively. The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this
paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure
or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30
days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination
as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding
described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that
such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for no-
tice of such determination to the interested parties and an oppor-
tunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section
556 of title 5, United States Code, within 60 days after the date
of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary
shall make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60
days after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the
hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E),
or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
(1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material fact
in an application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be employed by the
employer.

(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a willful
misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a violation
of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or a
willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in the
course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced
a United States worker employed by the employer within the pe-
riod beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date
of filing of any visa petition supported by the application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such
finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative
remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not
to exceed $35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed
with respect to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) dur-
ing a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-
strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,
includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise
a process under which an H–1B nonimmigrant who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an H–1B non-
immigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the em-
ployer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the em-
ployer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment
is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
State law.

(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an application under this subsection to require an alien who is the
subject of a petition filed under section 214(c)(1), for which a fee
is imposed under section 214(c)(9), to reimburse, or otherwise com-
pensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is
a violation of this clause for such an employer otherwise to accept
such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.
(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause,
the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for
each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the
return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this
clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring pay-
ment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection
and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
employee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the em-
ployer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant
has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as
lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant’s lack of a permit or li-
cense, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accord-
ance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and
who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time em-
ployee on the petition filed under section 214(c)(1) by the employer
with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has en-
tered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status
under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such
a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such petition
consistent with the rate of pay identified on such petition.
(III) In the case of an H–1B nonimmigrant who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
application under this subsection, and a petition under section
214(c)(1), with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of sub-
clauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days
after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United
States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the non-
immigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer (in the case
of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date
of the approval of the petition).
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an
H–1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-re-
lated factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant
for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant un-
able to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to an
H–1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to H–1B nonimmigrants and
United States workers in the same occupational classification an
annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—

(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to
fail to offer to an H–1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant’s
period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for bene-
fits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life, dis-
ability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in
retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and noncash com-
pensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on perform-
ance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria,
as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hear-
ing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level speci-
fied under the application and required under paragraph (1), the
Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of such
amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the re-
quirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under sub-
paragraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) If an H–1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H–1B
nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph
(1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United
States worker employed by such other employer during the period
described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered
for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer,
to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under
paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a
sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i), (C)(ii),
or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing em-
ployer—
(i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the
time of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other em-
ployer; or
(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph
based upon a previous placement of an H–1B nonimmigrant
with the same other employer.
(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an em-
ployer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, begin-
ning on the date (on or after the date of the enactment of the
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of
1998) on which the employer is found by the Secretary to have
committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or
has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful
failure to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have
made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application.
The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of
whether or not the employer is an H–1B-dependent employer. The
authority of the Secretary under this subparagraph shall not be

construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of sub-
paragraph (A).
(G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of any
employer that employs nonimmigrants described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) if the Secretary of Labor has reasonable cause to
believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection.
In the case of an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of
Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case of the absence of dis-
ability of the Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that rea-
sonable cause exists and shall approve commencement of the inves-
tigation. The investigation may be initiated for reasons other than
completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in com-
plying with this subsection.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible information
from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer’s
practices or employment conditions, or an employer’s compliance
with the employer’s labor condition application under paragraph
(1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, and
such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the em-
ployer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of para-
graph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged
in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has
committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that af-
fects multiple employees, the Secretary of Labor may conduct an
investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of
Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer,
and the source’s identity shall not be subject to disclosure under
section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any
person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information de-
scribed in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the
basis for the commencement of an investigation described in such
clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed
and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on be-
half of the person. The person may not be an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the re-
quirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the
Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the per-
son).
(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of
Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies
the requirements of such clause and that—
(I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee
of the Department of Labor; or
(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the
course of lawfully conducting another Department of Labor in-
vestigation under this Act of any other Act.
(v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information sub-
mitted by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary of
Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) shall not be considered a re-
ceipt of information for purposes of clause (ii).
(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing described
in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be conducted with
respect to information about a failure to meet a condition described

in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the informa-
tion not later than 12 months after the date of the alleged failure.
(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer
with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an inves-
tigation described in clauses (i) or (ii), prior to the commencement
of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an
investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and
shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond to
the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Sec-
retary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the
Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere with
an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the em-
ployer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall be no
judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor under
this clause.
(viii) An investigation under clauses (i) or (ii) may be conducted
for a period of up to 60 days. If the Secretary of Labor determines
after such an investigation that a reasonable basis exists to make
a finding that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet
a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or
(1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet
such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to meet
such a condition that affects multiple employees, the Secretary of
Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the inter-
ested parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with
section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 120 days after the
date of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Sec-
retary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the matter by not
later than 120 days after the date of the hearing.
(H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or enti-
ty is considered to have complied with the requirements of this
subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to
meet such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to com-
ply with the requirements.
(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if—
(I) the Department of Labor (or another enforcement agency)
has explained to the person or entity the basis for the failure;
(II) the person or entity has been provided a period of not
less than 10 business days (beginning after the date of the ex-
planation) within which to correct the failure; and
(III) the person or entity has not corrected the failure volun-
tarily within such period.
(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation,
is found to have violated the prevailing wage requirements set
forth in paragraph (1)(A), shall not be assessed fines or other
penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish
that the manner in which the prevailing wage was calculated
was consistent with recognized industry standards and prac-
tices.
(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity
that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice of
willful violations of this subsection.
(I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.

nonimmigrant who—
(I) receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar
compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000;

(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
(i) in computing the number of full-time equivalent employ-
ees and the number of H–1B nonimmigrants, exempt H–1B
nonimmigrants shall not be taken into account during the
longer of—
(I) the 6-month period beginning on the date of the en-
actment of the American Competitiveness and Workforce
Improvement Act of 1998; or
(II) the period beginning on the date of the enactment of
the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improve-
ment Act of 1998 and ending on the date final regulations
are issued to carry out this paragraph; and
(ii) any group treated as a single employer under subsection

(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the H–1B nonimmigrant is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more
H–1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is consid-
ered to ‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the em-
ployer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the
equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or non-
immigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to
be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves es-
sentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States
worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experi-

other job.
(C) The term ‘‘H–1B nonimmigrant’’ means an alien admit-
ted or provided status as a nonimmigrant described in section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).
(D)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract (other than a temporary employment contract en-
tered into in order to evade a condition described in sub-
paragraph (E) or (F) of paragraph (1)); but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer
(or, in the case of a placement of a worker with another
employer under paragraph (1)(F), with either employer de-
scribed in such paragraph) at equivalent or higher com-
pensation and benefits than the position from which the
employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the
employee accepts the offer.

ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(E) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee

erwise authorized, by this Act or by the Attorney General,
to be employed.
(5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A)
through (E) of paragraph (2) in the case of a violation described in
subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect the
authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect to
any other violation.
(B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the re-
ceipt, initial review, and disposition in accordance with this para-
graph of complaints respecting an employer’s failure to meet the
condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner’s misrepresenta-
tion of material facts with respect to such condition. Complaints
may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has submitted a
re´sume´ or otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for the job
that is the subject of the condition. No proceeding shall be con-
ducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a fail-
ure or misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines
that the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the
date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
(C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been filed
in accordance with subparagraph (B) and there is reasonable cause
to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described in
such complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate

roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure
and rules of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such
arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney Gen-
eral shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a
failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B) oc-
curred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or misrepresentation
was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding to that effect. The
arbitrator may not find such a failure or misrepresentation (or that
such a failure or misrepresentation was willful) unless the com-
plainant demonstrates such a failure or misrepresentation (or its
willful character) by clear and convincing evidence. The arbitrator
shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion to the
parties to the arbitration and the Attorney General. Such findings
shall be final and conclusive, and, except as provided in this sub-
paragraph, no official or court of the United States shall have
power or jurisdiction to review any such findings.
(ii) The Attorney General may review and reverse or modify the
findings of an arbitrator only on the same bases as an award of an
arbitrator may be vacated or modified under section 10 or 11 of
title 9, United States Code.
(iii) With respect to the findings of an arbitrator, a court may re-
view only the actions of the Attorney General under clause (ii) and
may set aside such actions only on the grounds described in sub-
paragraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 706(a)(2) of title 5, United
States Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such judi-
cial review may only be brought in an appropriate United States
court of appeals.
(E) If the Attorney General receives a finding of an arbitrator
under this paragraph that an employer has failed to meet the con-
dition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or has misrepresented a material
fact with respect to such condition, unless the Attorney General re-
verses or modifies the finding under subparagraph (D)(ii)—
(i) the Attorney General may impose administrative rem-
edies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
exceed $1,000 per violation or $5,000 per violation in the case
of a willful failure or misrepresentation) as the Attorney Gen-
eral determines to be appropriate; and
(ii) the Attorney General is authorized to not approve peti-
tions filed, with respect to that employer and for aliens to be
employed by the employer, under section 204 or 214(c)—
(I) during a period of not more than 1 year; or
(II) in the case of a willful failure or willful misrepresen-
tation, during a period of not more than 2 years.
(F) The Attorney General shall not delegate, to any other em-
ployee or official of the Department of Justice, any function of the
Attorney General under this paragraph, until 60 days after the At-
torney General has submitted a plan for such delegation to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate.

(A) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse
of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent
resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986;
(B) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, re-
sided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a
lawful permanent resident; and
(C) applied for benefits under section 301(a) of the Immi-
gration Act of 1990.
(p)(1) In computing the prevailing wage level for an occupational
classification in an area of employment for purposes of subsections
(a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) in the case of an em-
ployee of—
(A) an institution of higher education (as defined in section
101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or a related or af-
filiated nonprofit entity; or
(B) a nonprofit research organization or a Governmental re-
search organization,
the prevailing wage level shall only take into account employees at
such institutions and organizations in the area of employment.
(2) With respect to a professional athlete (as defined in sub-
section (a)(5)(A)(iii)(II)) when the job opportunity is covered by pro-
fessional sports league rules or regulations, the wage set forth in
those rules or regulations shall be considered as not adversely af-
fecting the wages of United States workers similarly employed and
be considered the prevailing wage.
(3) The prevailing wage required to be paid pursuant to sub-
sections (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) shall be 100 per-
cent of the wage determined pursuant to those sections.
(4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to em-
ployers, a governmental survey to determine the prevailing wage,
such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commensurate
with experience, education, and the level of supervision. Where an
existing government survey has only 2 levels, 2 intermediate levels
may be created by dividing by 3, the difference between the 2 levels
offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the first level and
subtracting that quotient from the second level.
(q) Any alien admitted under section 101(a)(15)(B) may accept an
honorarium payment and associated incidental expenses for a
usual academic activity or activities (lasting not longer than 9 days
at any single institution), as defined by the Attorney General in
consultation with the Secretary of Education, if such payment is of-
fered by an institution or organization described in subsection
(p)(1) and is made for services conducted for the benefit of that in-
stitution or entity and if the alien has not accepted such payment
or expenses from more than 5 institutions or organizations in the
previous 6-month period.

enter the United States for the purpose of performing labor as a
nurse who presents to the consular officer (or in the case of an ad-
justment of status, the Attorney General) a certified statement
from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (or
an equivalent independent credentialing organization approved for
the certification of nurses under subsection (a)(5)(C) by the Attor-
ney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and

thentic and unencumbered;
(2) the alien has passed the National Council Licensure Ex-
amination (NCLEX);
(3) the alien is a graduate of a nursing program—

days after the date of the enactment of the Nursing
Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999, based on
such commission’s assessment that the quality of
nursing education in that country, and the English
language proficiency of those who complete such pro-
grams in that country, justify the country’s designa-
tion; or
(ii) designated on the basis of such an assessment by
unanimous agreement of such commission and any
equivalent credentialing organizations which have
been approved under subsection (a)(5)(C) for the cer-
tification of nurses under this subsection; and
(C)(i) which was in operation on or before the date of the
enactment of the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas
Act of 1999; or
(ii) has been approved by unanimous agreement of such
commission and any equivalent credentialing organizations
which have been approved under subsection (a)(5)(C) for

(s) In determining whether an alien described in subsection
(a)(4)(C)(i) is inadmissible under subsection (a)(4) or ineligible to
receive an immigrant visa or otherwise to adjust to the status of
permanent resident by reason of subsection (a)(4), the consular offi-
cer or the Attorney General shall not consider any benefits the
alien may have received that were authorized under section 501 of
the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1641(c)).

other individuals with similar experience and quali-
fications for the specific employment in question; or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational
classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information avail-
able as of the time of filing the attestation; and
(ii) will provide working conditions for such a non-

tions of workers similarly employed.
(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor

companying documents as are necessary).
(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile, on a current basis,

101(a)(15)(E)(iii) within 7 days of the date of the filing of the attes-
tation.
(3)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the re-

gaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be con-
ducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresenta-
tion unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after
the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively. The Sec-
retary of Labor shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph
if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure or mis-
representation has occurred.
(B) Under the process described in subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary of Labor shall provide, within 30 days after the date a com-

exists, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such deter-
mination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing
on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, United
States Code, within 60 days after the date of the determination. If
such a hearing is requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a
finding concerning the matter by not later than 60 days after the
date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints respecting the
same applicant, the Secretary of Labor may consolidate the hear-
ings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(B), a
substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(C) or (1)(D),
or a misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$1,000 per violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-
tions filed with respect to that employer under section 204,
214(c), 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 1 year for aliens to
be employed by the employer.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1),
a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, or a
violation of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$5,000 per violation as the Secretary of Labor determines to be

curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-

(iii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)
or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, in
the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer dis-
placed a United States worker employed by the employer within
the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the
date of filing of any visa petition or application supported by the
attestation—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security of such finding and
may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$35,000 per violation) as the Secretary of Labor determines to
be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, as appropriate, shall not approve petitions or applica-
tions filed with respect to that employer under section 204,
214(c), 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) during a period of at least 3 years for aliens
to be employed by the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an attestation under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, re-
strain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discrimi-
nate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause,
includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) be-
cause the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or
to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evi-
dences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation per-
taining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or
seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding con-
cerning the employer’s compliance with the requirements of this
subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity shall devise a process under which a nonimmigrant under sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) who files a com-
plaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible
to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek
other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not
to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such non-
immigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed
an attestation under this subsection to require a nonimmigrant
under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) to pay
a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date
agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of
Labor shall determine whether a required payment is a penalty
(and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.
(II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this
clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil monetary penalty
of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order
requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in
violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located,
requiring payment of any such amount to the general fund of the
Treasury.

(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a full-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status due to a decision by the
employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the non-
immigrant’s lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the non-
immigrant full-time wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for
all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an
employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and
who places a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) designated as a part-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment
with the employer, in nonproductive status under circumstances
described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a nonimmigrant for
such hours as are designated on the attestation consistent with the
rate of pay identified on the attestation.
(III) In the case of a nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) who has not yet en-
tered into employment with an employer who has had approved an
attestation under this subsection with respect to the non-
immigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to
the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant
first is admitted into the United States, or 60 days after the date
the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer in the
case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the
date of the approval of the attestation filed with the Secretary of
Labor.
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) for nonproductive time due to non-work-related
factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an
absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to
work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer
that is a school or other educational institution from applying to a
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) an established salary practice of the employer,
under which the employer pays to nonimmigrants under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and United States
workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in
disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual sal-
ary payments prior to the commencement of the employment;
and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the non-
immigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to vio-
late any condition of the nonimmigrant’s authorization under
this Act to remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause
(viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for
an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to

section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii), during the nonimmigrant’s period of au-
thorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including
the opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other
insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and
savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such
as stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the
same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the em-
ployer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage
level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph (1),
the Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for pay-
ment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply
with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty
under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject
an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years,
beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the Sec-
retary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a condi-
tion of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful misrepresentation
of material fact in an attestation. The authority of the Secretary of
Labor under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be subject
to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).
(F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding
or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this
Act (such as the authorities under section 274B), or any other Act.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘area of employment’’ means the area within
normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location
where the work of the nonimmigrant under section
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) is or will be per-
formed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan
Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be
within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more
nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) or section
101(a)(15)(E)(iii) by an employer, the employer is considered to
‘‘displace’’ a United States worker from a job if the employer
lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent
of the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or
are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially
equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the
same responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with
substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is
located in the same area of employment as the other job.
(C)(i) The term ‘‘lays off’’, with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker’s loss of employment,
other than through a discharge for inadequate perform-
ance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary depar-
ture, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or
contract; but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker
is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a
similar employment opportunity with the same employer

at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than
the position from which the employee was discharged, re-
gardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an em-
ployee’s rights under a collective bargaining agreement or
other employment contract.
(D) The term ‘‘United States worker’’ means an employee
who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 207 of
this title, is granted asylum under section 208, or is an im-
migrant otherwise authorized, by this Act or by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, to be employed.
(t)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted
under section 101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I), or acquiring such status after ad-
mission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant status, an im-
migrant visa, or permanent residence under this Act until it is es-
tablished that such person has resided and been physically present
in the person’s country of nationality or last residence for an aggre-
gate of at least 2 years following departure from the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the require-
ment of such 2-year foreign residence abroad if the Secretary deter-
mines that—
(A) departure from the United States would impose excep-
tional hardship upon the alien’s spouse or child (if such spouse
or child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence); or
(B) the admission of the alien is in the public interest or the
national interest of the United States.

Dissenting Views
Instead of confronting the danger of drunk driving with serious
public policy changes, H.R. 875 simply weaponizes the problem to
attack and scapegoat immigrants. It is not a serious attempt to re-
duce drunk driving, a problem on our roads that is overwhelmingly
about citizen drivers. Nor does this bill do anything to repair our
broken immigration system or secure the border.
Instead of advancing a bill that could reduce the huge number
of drunk driving fatalities on our roads, we have a bill that would
make immigrants, including permanent green card holders, deport-
able from the country for a single misdemeanor driving under the
influence (DUI) offense even when no one is hurt. This would nei-
ther reduce drunk driving nor illegal immigration. It’s weak sym-
bolic politics.
Moreover, under our immigration laws, serious DUIs already
render people inadmissible and deportable. Under the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA), a noncitizen who is convicted of, or who
admits to committing, a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude, or a
‘‘CIMT,’’ is generally inadmissible. Likewise, a noncitizen who is
convicted of a CIMT, where a sentence of one year or longer may
be imposed, is deportable. Serious DUI offenses are CIMTs under
current law.
For example, the following DUI offenses are all considered
CIMTs: a DUI where the maximum possible penalty is a year or
more and where there is serious bodily harm; hit and runs; an ag-
gravated DUI; and a DUI involving driving with knowledge of an
invalid, suspended, or revoked license.
But this bill goes far beyond current law and seeks to expand the
ability to remove green card holders for a single infraction, even
where no one is hurt and no property is damaged. Today, there are
nearly 13 million green card holders in the United States, with 9
million of them eligible to become citizens.
I. BACKGROUND ON INADMISSIBILITY AND DEPORTABILITY
Section 212 of the INA provides the reasons a non-citizen may
be determined to be inadmissible, and Section 237 contains the
INA’s deportability provisions.1 Both sections contain similar, but
not entirely identical grounds, ranging from criminal convictions
and security/terrorism grounds to foreign policy and public charge-
related grounds. Section 212 applies to individuals who are apply-
ing for status in the United States, whereas Section 237 generally
applies to individuals who have been lawfully admitted into the
United States and are lawfully present in the United States.

Section 212(a)(2) and Section 237(a)(2) of the INA contain the
criminal-related inadmissibility and deportability grounds.2
Section 237(a)(2)(A) renders deportable any noncitizen who ‘‘is
convicted of some crime involving moral turpitude committed with-
in five years . . . after the date of admission.’’3 Further, the con-
viction must be one ‘‘for which a sentence of one year or longer may
be imposed.’’4 This means that the actual sentence imposed need
not be one year of imprisonment, but rather that if one is convicted
of the offense, one could be sentenced to at least one year in prison.
Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i) is broader—it states that any noncitizen
‘‘convicted of, or who admits to committing acts which constitute
essential elements . . . a crime involving moral turpitude (other
than a purely political offense) or an attempt or conspiracy to com-
mit such a crime . . . is inadmissable.’’5
DUIs where the maximum possible penalty is a year or more and
where there is serious bodily harm, hit and runs, aggravated DUI,
driving with knowledge of an invalid, suspended, or revoked license
are all already CIMTs and therefore makes an individual both in-
admissible and deportable.6
II. DUI OFFENSES
However, this bill is a significant overreach. DUI offenses vary
all over the country. Some jurisdictions do not even require the in-
dividual to be physically driving the vehicle for a DUI offense to
be committed. For example, in Arizona, the DUI statute allows peo-
ple to be charged with a DUI if they are intoxicated and have
‘‘physical control’’ of their vehicle.7 The Ninth Circuit, in reviewing
an appeal of a removal case for a noncitizen charged under Arizo-
na’s DUI statute, found that the ‘‘physical control’’ language meant
that under this statute, ‘‘One may be convicted under it for sitting
in one’s own car in one’s own driveway with the key in the ignition
and a bottle of beer in one’s hand.’’8
While the noncitizen in this case had been ordered deported on
the basis that his conviction under this statute constituted a CIMT,
the Ninth Circuit overturned that ruling because the activities cov-
ered by the statute could not reasonably be seen as crimes involv-
ing moral turpitude.9 As the court put it, ‘‘Drunken driving is des-
picable. Having physical control of a car while drinking is not.’’10
Likewise, the Code of Virginia §18.2–266 makes it ‘‘unlawful for
any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle . . .’’ with a blood
alcohol concentration of 0.08 grams or more.11 The Virginia Su-
preme Court has interpreted this definition to mean that an intoxi-
cated person seated, asleep behind the steering wheel of a car in
their own driveway with a key inserted into the ignition switch is
in physical control and can be convicted under the statute.12

These are just two examples of overbroad DUI statutes. These
cases only made it to court because prosecutors chose to bring
these charges, so it would be implausible to argue that prosecutors
would not waste their states’ time by bringing de minimus DUI
cases. Under these statutes, individuals are charged with DUIs for
merely sleeping in their car. These people have potentially made
the conscious choice to not drive impaired, yet they end up being
punished. Under current law, such individuals would not ulti-
mately be subject to removal based on these convictions. But if this
bill were to become law, a conviction like the ones discussed above
would cause even a longstanding permanent resident to get de-
ported.
III. CONSEQUENCES FOR LEGAL IMMIGRANTS
Making new crimes into deportable offenses does not affect un-
documented immigrants. The new deportability offense in this bill
would only affect legal immigrants, such as students, those with
work visas, and lawful permanent residents. Because this new
ground encompasses such a wide array of offenses, it opens long-
term legal immigrants up to deportation even if they never posed
any sort of threat to public safety.
To rectify this, at markup, Rep. Jayapal offered an amendment
to allow an adjudicator to consider a variety of mitigating factors,
such as the severity of the offense, if anyone was hurt, or how long
the individual has lived in the country before rendering a lawful
immigrant deportable. While some Republicans indicated interest
in providing leniency for lawful immigrants, this amendment was
ultimately defeated on a party line vote.
The Majority did not provide substantive arguments against this
amendment beyond arguing that there are studies showing that a
person’s first DUI arrest is not their first DUI. The waiver author-
ity proposed by Rep. Jayapal would not prevent someone from get-
ting deported due to a DUI, it would simply allow an adjudicator
discretion to examine the underlying conduct.
* * *
H.R. 875 is an overreaching and unnecessarily broad piece of leg-
islation that would lead to absurd consequences and deportation for
people who pose no threat to our country, while doing nothing to
deter people from driving under the influence that our laws do not
already do. Instead of confronting the danger of drunk driving with
serious public policy changes, it simply weaponizes the problem to
attack and scapegoat legal immigrants. It is not a serious attempt
to reduce drunk driving, a problem on our roads that is overwhelm-
ingly about citizen drivers. Nor does this bill do anything to repair
our broken immigration system or secure the border.
