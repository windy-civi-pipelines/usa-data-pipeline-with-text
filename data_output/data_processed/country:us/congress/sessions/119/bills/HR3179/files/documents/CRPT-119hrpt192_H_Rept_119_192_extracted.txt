119THCONGRESS REPORT
1st Session " HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ! 119–192
THE STATE OF TEXAS AS THE ‘‘JOCELYN NUNGARAY NATIONAL WILD-
LIFE REFUGE’’
JULY10, 2025.—Referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 3179]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 3179) to rename the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge
located in the State of Texas as the ‘‘Jocelyn Nungaray National
Wildlife Refuge’’, having considered the same, reports favorably
thereon without amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 3179 is to rename the Anahuac National
Wildlife Refuge located in the State of Texas as the ‘‘Jocelyn
Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge’’.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Jocelyn Nungaray was a 12-year-old girl from Houston, Texas,
whose life was tragically cut short on June 16, 2024, when she was
raped and murdered by two Venezuelan nationals who entered the
U.S. illegally and are allegedly members of the notorious Tren de
Aragua gang.1 Jocelyn’s death quickly garnered national attention
and renewed calls for more stringent immigration policies.2
To permanently commemorate Ms. Nungaray, who was known
for her special affinity for animals, President Trump signed Execu-
tive Order (E.O.) 14229 on March 4, 2025. This order directed the
Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to change the name of the
Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge to the ‘‘Jocelyn Nungaray Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge.’’3

Alexis Nungaray, Jocelyn’s mother, was a special guest of the
President during his March 4, 2025, address to Congress. During
his speech, the President said:
One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved ani-
mals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay from
where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent na-
tional wildlife refuge. A pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanc-
tuary for all of God’s creatures on the edge of the Gulf of Amer-
ica.4
On March 7, 2025, Secretary Doug Burgum signed a Secretary’s
Order to implement President Trump’s E.O.5 H.R. 3179, introduced
by Representative Brian Babin on May 5, 2025, would codify the
E.O. to ensure that this renaming cannot be overturned by a future
administration without Congressional action.
Established in 1963 along the Texas coast of the Gulf of America,
the refuge protects coastal marsh and prairie, providing habitat for
migratory and resident waterfowl, shorebirds, and waterbirds.6 In
addition to serving as a sanctuary, it offers the public numerous
opportunities for fishing, waterfowl hunting, and wildlife viewing,
hosting more than 800,000 visitors a year.7
The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.8
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 3179 was introduced on May 5, 2025, by Representative
Brian Babin (R–TX). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee
on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries. On May 20, 2025, the Sub-
committee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held a hearing on the
bill. On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural Resources met
to consider the bill. The Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fish-
eries was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3179 by
unanimous consent. The bill was ordered favorably reported to the
House of Representatives by unanimous consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing by the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held on
May 20, 2025.
