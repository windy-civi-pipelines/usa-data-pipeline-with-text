sports attractions. The bill requires the NTTO to promote domestic
and international travel and tourism to U.S. music festivals, con-
cert venues, and other music-related attractions and locations. The
bill also expands NTTO’s current mandate to facilitate sports and
recreation events and activities to include the promotion of inter-
national travel and tourism to such activities in the United States.
NTTO must report its activities and findings to Congress within
one year after the bill’s enactment and, thereafter, every two years.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Music and sporting events are defining elements of American
identity, culture, and economy. The U.S. is home to a rich musical
history with genres such as blues, country, jazz, hip-hop, and rock.
H.R. 617, the American Music Tourism Act, builds on this legacy
by directing the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) to pro-
mote domestic and international travel and tourism to U.S. venues
aiming to expand music’s already significant role in the economy.
Music tourism contributes billions to local and national econo-
mies. In Nashville, Tennessee—nicknamed ‘‘Music City’’—the
music industry contributes more than $15.6 billion annually to the
Nashville area economy and supports more than 80,757 jobs in the
region.1 Large music events such as the Bonnaroo Music and Arts
Festival brought an estimated $339.8 million in economic activity
to the region and generated over $5 million in local tax revenue.2
On the national level, the music industry contributes $212 billion
to the U.S. GDP and supports more than 2.5 million jobs.3 Glob-
ally, music tourism is expected to reach $13.8 billion by 2032.4
The COVID–19 pandemic dealt significant blows to the music
and live entertainment industries. Thousands of concerts and fes-
tivals were canceled or postponed resulting in losses of over $30
billion globally, with the U.S. bearing a substantial portion of that
impact.5 Live music venues, especially independent and small com-
munity spaces, faced closures, and tourism in music-centric cities
plummeted.
H.R. 617 addresses the long-term impacts of the pandemic by re-
quiring the NTTO to develop and implement a strategy for pro-
moting U.S. music attractions, while also reporting to Congress on
its efforts. The bill creates a framework for maximizing the visi-
bility and economic value of American music tourism on the global
stage.
