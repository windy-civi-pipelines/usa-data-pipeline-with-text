(1) Pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act (‘‘BSA’’), the Secretary of the Treasury,
acting through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (‘‘FinCEN’’), collects
millions of reports annually on the economic activity of ordinary Americans.
(2) Since 2001, FinCEN has applied the BSA to collect over 322,000,000 Cur-
rency Transaction Reports and more than 36,000,000 Suspicious Activity Re-
ports, as well as nearly 5,000,000 Form 8300 Reports. In addition, FinCEN ex-
pects to amass beneficial ownership information (‘‘BOI’’) from 32,000,000 compa-
nies in its initial year of collection, plus 5,000,000 additional companies impli-
cated each year thereafter.
(3) The mass of reporting collected by FinCEN suggests that, while certain
BSA reports might prove useful to combat illicit finance, the bulk of BSA-re-
lated data may possess little to no nexus to legitimate law enforcement or intel-
ligence purposes, even as it encompasses highly sensitive details on the every-
day lives of Americans.
(4) By law, the Secretary of the Treasury must ensure the security and con-
fidentiality of BSA data. In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking from December
2022, FinCEN acknowledged that ‘‘BOI is highly sensitive information. FinCEN
therefore views it as critical to mitigate the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
BOI as much as possible.’’.
SEC. 3. REPORTS TO CONGRESS; REVIEW OF PROTOCOLS FOR AGENCY ACCESS TO REPORTS.
(a) INGENERAL.—Chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, is amended—
(1) in subchapter II, by inserting after section 5326 the following:

ports
‘‘(a) REPORTS TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 180 days following the date of the
enactment of this section, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury
shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representa-
tives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a

during the reporting period; and
‘‘(C) any denials of requests for, or revocations of, access by a national

National Intelligence and the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury shall
annually review and, as appropriate, revise any written protocols or guidance de-
scribed under subsection (a) for the purposes of—
‘‘(1) better tailoring the collection, retention, and dissemination of information
filed under this subchapter to authorized national security, law enforcement, or
intelligence objectives;
‘‘(2) enforcing prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure of such informa-
tion; and
‘‘(3) protecting fully the legal rights of all United States persons, including
freedoms, civil liberties, and privacy rights guaranteed by Federal law.

(2) in the table of contents for such chapter, by inserting after the item relat-
ing to section 5326 the following:
‘‘5327. Reports to Congress; Review of protocols for agency access to reports.’’.
(b) SUNSET.—On the date that is the end of the 7-year period beginning on the

(2) the table of contents for chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, is

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 26, 2025, by Representative Warren Da-
vidson, H.R. 1602, the Financial Privacy Act of 2025, requires the
Department of the Treasury to annually report to Congress details
of reports made to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN). FinCEN collects reports on suspicious financial trans-
actions and the beneficial ownership of companies in order to de-
tect financial crimes, including money laundering. Under the bill,
FinCEN must report on the number and types of reports and
whether they are retained by FinCEN, any guidance regarding out-
side agency access to these reports, agency requests for these re-
ports, and any denials of access. Treasury must annually review ac-
cess guidance and revise as appropriate to protect the legal rights
of U.S. persons, among other objectives.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Under legal provisions collectively referred to as the Bank Se-
crecy Act (BSA), FinCEN requires financial institutions and other
businesses to submit reports that may assist the Treasury Depart-
ment’s anti-money laundering/combatting the financing of ter-
rorism (AML/CFT) efforts. These reports include suspicious activity
reports (SARs) and currency transaction reports (CTRs). BSA re-
quirements also include beneficial reporting data as mandated by
the Corporate Transparency Act.
Since 2001, FinCEN has collected more than 350 million SARs
and CTRs. Each day, FinCEN receives approximately 55,000 BSA
records. It expects to receive beneficial ownership information from
32 million companies in its initial year of implementation in addi-
tion to the current BSA records. The Financial Privacy Act will pro-
vide important insights into the scope of FinCEN’s data collection
and allow for stronger congressional oversight.
On August 31, 2023, Treasury’s Office of Inspector General (IG)
issued an audit of FinCEN’s ‘‘suppression’’ process. This process is
supposed to restrict access to inaccurate, duplicative, or sensitive
data. According to the IG, ‘‘FinCEN did not: (1) timely process and
adequately document the disposition of suppression requests, to in-
clude notifying requesters in writing; and (2) ensure that bulk data
recipients removed suppressed records from their respective data-
bases.’’1 The Financial Privacy Act will enhance Congress’s over-
sight of protocols governing FinCEN’s data protocols.

On April 27, 2023, the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit

(TFI).’’ The witnesses were: the Honorable Brian E. Nelson, Under
Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, and Mr. Himamauli Das, Acting Director for
the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. A draft version of H.R.
5485 was considered in the hearing.
On September 20, 2023, the Committee on Financial Services
met in open session and ordered H.R. 5485 to be reported favorably
to the House of Representatives by a recorded vote of 47 yeas and
0 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–100). Before
the question to report was called, the Committee adopted an
amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Hill by a
voice vote. H. Rept. 118–317 was filed on December 13, 2023.
119TH CONGRESS
On February 26, 2025, Representative Warren Davidson (R–OH)

ly to the Committee on Financial Services.
RELATED HEARINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following hearing was used to develop H.R.
1602:
The Full Committee held a hearing on February 25, 2025, titled
‘‘Examining Policies to Counter China.’’ A draft version of H.R.
1602 was considered in this hearing. The following witnesses ap-
peared: Mr. John Miller, Senior Vice President of Policy, Trust,
Data, and Technology, and General Counsel of the Information
Technology Industry Council; Mr. Nicholas McMurray, Managing
Director of International and Nuclear Policy at ClearPath; Mr.
John Cassara, a retired United States Treasury Department Spe-
cial Agent; Mr. Martin Muhleisen, a Nonresident Senior Fellow at
the GAO Economic Center at the Atlantic Council; and Dr. Rush
Doshi, the C.V. Starr Senior Fellow for Asian Studies, Director of
the China Strategy Initiative at the Council on Foreign Relations,
and an Assistant Professor at Georgetown University. Among the
discussion regarding Bank Secrecy Act provisions, Cassara high-

ments and to fund technology investments to make more efficient
use of Suspicious Activity Reports.

FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Financial Privacy Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Findings
The Congress finds:
(1) The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) col-
lects millions of reports annually on the economic activity of ordi-
nary Americans through the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
(2) Since 2001, FinCEN has collected over 322,000,000 Currency
Transaction Reports, and 5,000,000 Form 8300 Reports. In addi-
tion, FinCEN expects to collect beneficial ownership information
(BOI) from 32,000,000 companies in its initial year of collection,
and an additional 5,000,000 per year thereafter.
(3) The bulk of data collected by FinCEN possesses little or no
nexus to legitimate law enforcement or intelligence purposes yet
encompasses highly sensitive details of citizens.
(4) The Secretary of the Treasury must ensure the security and
confidentiality of data collected. FinCEN has acknowledged that
BOI is highly sensitive information.
Section 3. Reports to Congress; Review of protocols for agency access
to reports
Section 3 requires an annual report to Congress on data collected
and retained by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Bank Se-
crecy Act. In addition, it requires the Secretary to report on proto-
cols governing the retention and dissemination of this data, as well
as notify Congress of any updates to the protocols. It requires an
annual review of the protocols by the Secretary, including for the
purpose of safeguarding civil liberties and privacy rights.
