PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 3937 is to provide for the conveyance of cer-
tain Federal land in Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, and for
other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Nearly half of the landmass of Forest County in northern Wis-
consin, or roughly 350,000 acres, is federally owned as part of the
Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.1 Like many counties and
states with significant federal footprints, Forest County has limited
opportunities for economic development of local communities and
businesses. Located in the Town of Wabeno, a historic logging com-

munity with a population of just over 1,100 people in Forest Coun-
ty, Tony’s Wabeno Redi-Mix, LLC, is one such business currently
struggling to expand due to the lack of available nearby private
lands. For more than 22 years, this small business has supplied
concrete to local contractors and homeowners in the roughly 50-
mile service area around Wabeno, Wisconsin.2 Tony’s Wabeno Redi-
Mix, LLC, employs 17 people and has provided concrete for several
community projects, including fire and rescue buildings, town shops
and offices, barns for local farmers, as well as the material for
home construction and renovations.3
At its current pace, this business will run out of the aggregate
materials necessary to continue its operations in the next two to
three years.4 Aggregates are the raw materials, such as stone, sand
and gravel, that are used to create building materials, including ce-
ment and asphalt. To address this supply challenge, the company
tried to work with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) for seven years
on a land conveyance of a 14-acre parcel located in the
Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. This parcel is directly adja-
cent to the company’s current location and has adequate sand and
gravel resources needed to keep the business’s operations running
for years to come.5 To expedite this land conveyance process after
years of continuous USFS delays, Representative Tom Tiffany (R–
WI) introduced H.R. 3937, the ‘‘Wabeno Economic Development
Act,’’ to require USFS to convey this land to Tony’s Wabeno Redi-
Mix, LLC, for fair market value. This conveyance would provide
much-needed economic growth to the local community and is sup-
ported by the Wabeno Chamber of Commerce, the Forest County
Economic Development Partnership, and the Town of Wabeno.6
H.R. 3937 also includes a provision that recognizes the national
importance of encouraging more domestic sand, stone, and gravel
mining nationwide. A healthy supply of aggregates is critically im-
portant for infrastructure and economic development. It takes an
average of 38,000 tons of aggregates to construct just one lane mile
of interstate.7 Roughly 400 tons of aggregate are needed for the
construction of an average home, while a school or hospital typi-
cally requires around 15,000 tons.8 In addition to serving as reli-
able building materials, aggregates are an important ingredient for
many other materials, such as glass, plastic, silica for computer
parts, and even calcium carbonate for antacids.9 The average
American relies on over 10,000 pounds of stone and over 7,000
pounds of sand and gravel per year.10 Currently, projects of all va-
rieties that rely on federal aggregates take four to ten years to

complete the federal permitting process.11 Aggregate producers
have consistently encouraged steps to ‘‘fix a broken permitting re-
form process that currently makes the task of sourcing aggregates
severely difficult.’’12 H.R. 3937 would help address this problem by
requiring the Department of the Interior (DOI) to conduct a com-
prehensive review of the permitting process for stone, sand, and
gravel on federal lands. As part of this review, DOI would be re-
quired to report on current delays and inefficiencies in the permit-
ting process and the economic effects of those delays to the sand,
stone, and gravel industry.
