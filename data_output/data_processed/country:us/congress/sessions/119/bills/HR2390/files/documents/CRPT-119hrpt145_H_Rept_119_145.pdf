PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 2390 is to amend title 46, United States
Code, to clarify that port infrastructure development program
funds may be used to replace Chinese port crane hardware or soft-
ware, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The United States is a maritime nation, with 95 percent of all
cargo entering through the Marine Transportation System (MTS).1
Cargo activity at United States ports accounts for 26 percent of the
United States’ gross domestic product (GDP), generating nearly
$5.4 trillion in total economic activity, and supporting 31 million
direct and indirect jobs.2 To ensure the uninterrupted operation of
the MTS, the Coast Guard is responsible for the safe operation of
United States ports and waterways.3 The United States Maritime
Administration (MARAD) is responsible for the administration of
the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP), a discre-
tionary grant program that provides awards on a competitive basis
to projects at coastal seaports, inland river ports, and Great Lakes
ports to improve the safety, efficiency, or reliability of the move-
ment of goods into, out of, around, or within a port.4 Acting as the
sole discretionary grant program dedicated to port infrastructure
improvements, PIDP has grown exponentially over the last several
years with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117–
58) providing advanced appropriations of $450 million per year
through fiscal year (FY) 2026, which is in addition to annual appro-
priations the program receives.5 Since its initial round of funding
in FY 2019, PIDP has distributed over $9 billion in grant awards.6
Up to 80 percent of the ship-to-shore cranes that United States
ports rely on to move cargo from ships are manufactured in China,
presenting serious vulnerabilities to the MTS.7 H.R. 2390, as
amended, clarifies that PIDP funds can be used to remove
vulnerabilities from Chinese made port equipment, strengthening
operational security at United States ports.

mestic ports, infrastructure safety and security issues, and current
funding and investment needs. The subcommittee received testi-
mony from Mr. Paul Anderson, President and Chief Executive Offi-
cer, Port Tampa Bay, Mr. Joe Rella, President, St. Johns Ship

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND CONSIDERATION
H.R. 2390, the ‘‘Maritime Supply Chain Act’’, was introduced in
the United States House of Representatives on March 26, 2025, by
Rep. David Rouzer and referred to the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure. Within the Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure, H.R. 2390 was referred to the Subcommittee on
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. The Subcommittee on
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation was discharged from
further consideration of H.R. 2390 on April 2, 2025.
The Committee considered H.R. 2390 on April 2, 2025, and or-
dered the measure to be reported to the House with a favorable
recommendation, without amendment, by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires each committee report to include the total number of
votes cast for and against on each record vote on a motion to report
and on any amendment offered to the measure or matter, and the
names of those members voting for and against.
No recorded votes were requested for H.R. 2390.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee’s over-
sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to the filing of the report and is included in the re-
port. Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2390 from the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office:

H.R. 2390 would clarify that projects to upgrade or replace
cranes that were installed or maintained by the Chinese govern-
ment at U.S. ports are eligible for grants under the Maritime Ad-
ministration’s Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP).
Those projects are typically eligible for PIDP grants under current
law. Accordingly, CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2390 would
not affect the federal budget.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aaron Krupkin. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this legislation is to increase the safety and cyber
security of domestic ports by making funds available to eliminate
Chinese software and hardware form port cranes.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
2390 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, a pro-
gram that was included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS,
AND LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of the rule XXI.

FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
An estimate of Federal mandates prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of the
Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congres-
sional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that H.R. 2390 does not preempt any state, local, or tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the definition of Section 5(b) of
Public Law 92–463 (5 U.S.C. 1004(b)), United States Code, are cre-
ated by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Public Law 104–1).
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
