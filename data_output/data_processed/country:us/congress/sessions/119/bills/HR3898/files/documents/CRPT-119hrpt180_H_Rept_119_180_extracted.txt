Pennsylvania, the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State
of West Virginia. As such, the Federal Government should take a collaborative and
cooperative approach to the parties with regard to their compliance with the Chesa-
peake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load outlined in such agreement.
PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 3898, as amended, is to amend the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act to make targeted with respect to
waters of the United States, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary law governing water
quality of the Nation’s surface waters.1 Congress enacted the 1972
amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which is
commonly referred to as the CWA, with the objective to ‘‘restore
and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the
Nation’s waters.’’2
The CWA consists of two major parts: (1) the authorization of fi-
nancial assistance for construction of municipal wastewater treat-
ment plants, and (2) the regulatory requirements that apply to
those who discharge into navigable waters, including for industrial
and municipal actors.3 Planning, financial, and technical assistance
for various regions and issues are also addressed.4 Title III of the
CWA establishes the authority for the technological and water
quality-based effluent limitation guidelines that must be abided by
point source dischargers.5 Whereas Title III of the CWA largely fo-
cuses on the creation of water quality guidelines and limitations,
Title IV primarily deals with application of the regulatory program,

informed by the guidelines created pursuant to Title III, through
which dischargers must receive permits or certifications.6
In order to achieve its objectives, the CWA is predicated on the
principle that discharges into waters of the United States are only
lawful if authorized by a permit.7 Therefore, the application of var-
ious CWA components require a regulatory program. While certain
regulatory programs under the law may only be carried out by the
Federal Government, through either the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps), certain responsibilities can be assumed by states approved
by the EPA.8
Broadly, H.R. 3898, as amended, strives to once again find bal-
ance within the regulatory and permitting process originally envi-
sioned by the CWA by providing a comprehensive package of com-
monsense reforms to support energy producers, the agriculture sec-
tor, builders, and utilities. The bill includes necessary reforms to
promote regulatory efficiency, increase transparency, avoid frivo-
lous litigation, and protect and promote clean water, all while bal-
ancing states’ rights.
Prior to enactment of the CWA, water quality was seen as an
issue primarily concerning states and localities, except where inter-
state waters were concerned.9 As such, the CWA continued this rec-
ognition that states and localities play an essential role in main-
taining the quality of their own waters, rather than only the Fed-
eral Government.10 At the Federal level, EPA is the primary agen-
cy tasked with carrying out the CWA, while the Corps is also
tasked with certain responsibilities. Additionally, the various per-
mitting and environmental protection statutes in the CWA were
meant to be shared between the Federal Government and state and
local governments.11 The CWA is a law predicated on the principle
of cooperative Federalism, with the Federal Government and states
each playing a role in protecting water quality.
In keeping with the Federal-state goals of the CWA, Section 401
requires an applicant for a Federal license or permit that may re-
sult in a discharge into navigable waters to obtain a water quality
certification from the state or Tribe (or EPA, in the case of tribal
lands where a tribe has not been granted treatment as a state) in
which a discharge is to take place.12 The purpose of the water qual-
ity certification issued by the state or Tribe is to certify that any
discharges from a Federally permitted activity will comply with
certain water quality requirements of the CWA, including effluent
limitations and performance standards, water quality standards,
and toxic pretreatment standards.13
Examples of Federally licensed or permitted projects commonly
requiring water quality certification include those requiring dis-

charge permits under sections 402 and 404 of the CWA, or sections
9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, licenses from the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), bridge permits from the
Coast Guard, shoreline permits from the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity, and more.14 These statutes cover a wide variety of projects, in-
cluding hydropower projects, wastewater treatment plants, pipeline
projects, infrastructure development, mining projects, water re-
source development projects, and residential or commercial devel-
opment.15
Current implementation practices of section 401, however, have
been shaped by decades-worth of litigation and unclear guidance.
Until 2020, implementation regulations for section 401 published in
1971 were in effect.16 These regulations implemented the certifi-
cation provisions of section 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act of 1948, but EPA did not update the regulations to re-
flect the changes in the statutory text for nearly fifty years.17 Dur-
ing this time, many processes evolved in practice that were not re-
flected in the statute. H.R. 3898, as amended, codifies certain prac-
tices and clarifies others, to balance the role of state and Federal
Government, and provide certainty and predictability to permittees
and licensees that depend on a clear and useable 401 process.
In particular, some stakeholders have raised concerns that states
have misused the section 401 process, specifically weaponizing sec-
tion 401 to prevent important energy projects from obtaining cer-
tification and halting their progress in construction.18 For example,
some states have cited non-water quality related reasons in the 401
process to delay projects, expanded the scope of review beyond the
direct effects of a discharge, and circumvented the timelines set out
in statute.
In 2017, the Washington Department of Ecology denied water
quality certification with prejudice for a proposed energy export
terminal project, meaning that the applicants could not reapply in
the future. In doing so, the Department cited nine adverse impacts
for denial—air quality, vehicle transportation, noise and vibration,
social and community resources, rail transportation, rail safety,
vessel transportation, cultural resources, and tribal resources—
none of which affected water quality.19
In 2020, the New York Department of Environmental Protection
denied water quality certification to a proposed natural gas pipe-
line expansion project into Raritan Bay, despite FERC in 2019 de-
termining that with project proponent’s ‘‘plan of impact avoidance,
minimization and mitigation measures . . . all project effects
would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.’’20

The State of Oregon delayed a proposed LNG export terminal by
requesting more information from project proponents before even-
tually denying certification.21 By citing the need for additional in-
formation, the state was able to argue that the one-year ‘‘shot
clock’’ for review of a request for certification should start over once
a request is resubmitted.22
In California, some hydropower relicensing projects have been
delayed for decades due to the State’s various attempts to cir-
cumvent the one-year timeline for review. For example, at a Water
Resources and Environment Subcommittee hearing in February
2025, the Committee received testimony for the record from the
Modesto Irrigation District and Turlock Irrigation District that ex-
plained the State ‘‘has abused and expanded this opportunity,
using it not as the opportunity to ensure that any federally author-
ized discharge complies with applicable water quality, but rather
as an opportunity to seize control and oversight of the [Don Pedro
irrigation] Project as a whole to achieve policy goals that are often
only tangentially related to water quality and which have nothing
to do with the licensed activity itself.’’23

Section 18:
Section five of H.R. 3898, as amended, aims to mitigate the prob-
lems of permitting uncertainty and weaponization of Section 401
under the CWA. This section promotes the development of the Na-
tion’s energy infrastructure and myriad other projects by clarifying
the scope of review to include only water quality reasons from the
discharge at issue, defines what is required to be included in a re-
quest for certification, codifies what actions states may take after
receipt of a request for certification, and clarifies the entity in
charge of enforcing conditions added in through the 401 process.
Another key aspect of the CWA’s framework of cooperative Fed-
eralism is the ability for States to carry out the permitting pro-
grams set up by sections 402 and 404 of the CWA. While 47 states
have assumed the ability to carry out the National Pollution Dis-
charge Elimination System (NPDES) programs under section 402,
only two states (Michigan and New Jersey) have been delegated
authority to administer their own 404 dredge and fill programs.24
Florida had begun administering its own 404 permitting program
after the program was approved in December 2020; currently, how-
ever, the program has been divested of its authority due to a Fed-
eral judicial order.25 Other states have acknowledged interest in
implementing their own 404 program, but concerns about taking on
the costs of running such a program are often a barrier.26

Section 19:
Sections 14 and 16 of H.R. 3898, as amended, are focused on pro-
viding clarity to the process of state assumption of dredge and fill
permitting under section 404 of the CWA. Section 16 requires EPA
to complete a review of the applicable regulations to state assump-
tion of the section 404 program and implement revisions necessary
to encourage state assumption. Section 14 establishes a deadline
relating to EPA’s review of a state’s application to assume section
404 permitting. Section 20 of H.R. 3898, as amended, encourages
states with delegated permitting authorities under the CWA to uti-
lize the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council to im-
prove coordination across relevant Federal and state agencies. In
general, H.R. 3898, as amended, furthers the goals of cooperative
Federalism that the CWA is based upon by encouraging states to
take the lead in administering CWA permits.
Furthermore, CWA section 303(c) directs states to adopt water
quality standards (WQS) for navigable waters. The EPA is charged
with approving the state-developed standards. WQS serve as the
basis for several CWA programs, including the development of total
maximum daily loads (TMDLs), certifications of Federal licenses
and permits under section 401, NPDES permits under section 402,
and dredge and fill permits under section 404.
Currently, CWA section 402(q) requires municipalities with com-
bined sewer overflows to develop long-term control plans (LTCPs)
to minimize or eliminate discharges. It also instructs states to re-
view and, as appropriate, modify existing WQS while municipali-
ties are developing and implementing LTCPs to support compliance
with the CWA. Those reviews, however, have largely not happened,
and despite municipalities investing millions of dollars in upgrad-
ing their facilities, many are no closer to being deemed in compli-
ance with the CWA.27 Many stakeholders have also raised concerns
about states developing WQS that are not attainable based on
available technology.28 For example, the State of Washington has
set WQS that are so low many industries are concerned they will
not be able to comply with the CWA.29
While the CWA protects ‘‘navigable waters,’’ which are broadly
defined in the CWA as the ‘‘waters of the United States, including
the territorial seas,’’30 the CWA does not further define the term
‘‘waters of the United States’’ (WOTUS). Ultimately, the CWA
grants authority to the EPA and the Corps to implement the CWA,
and EPA and the Corps have promulgated several sets of rules de-
fining WOTUS as it governs the scope of CWA authority. There has
been a substantial amount of regulation and litigation in the Fed-
eral Courts on the scope of CWA jurisdiction over the years, includ-
ing multiple United States Supreme Court cases. In May 2023, the
Supreme Court concluded in Sackett v. EPA (Sackett) that the
CWA’s jurisdiction encompasses waters that are ‘‘relatively perma-
nent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water ‘forming geo-
graphical features’ that are described in ordinary parlance as

‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.’’’31 The Supreme Court also
held that jurisdictional wetlands ‘‘must be indistinguishably part of
a body of water that itself constitutes ‘waters’’ under the CWA.’’32
The recent Sackett decision provided additional direction on the
WOTUS definition, and therefore, the jurisdiction of the CWA.
However, the conforming rule issued by the EPA and the Corps
during the Biden Administration did not include or clarify certain
phrases and terms applied in Sackett. The Biden Administration
developed additional guidance to implement the ‘‘continuous sur-
face connection’’ test outlined by Sackett, while simultaneously
working through individual requests for CWA jurisdictional deter-
minations in light of the Sackett decision. However, many stake-
holders in the regulated community have raised concerns about the
slow pace at which the Biden Administration directed EPA and the
Corps to implement Sackett, as well as the lack of clear direction
the Biden Administration provided to the regulated public, even
through its supplemental guidance.
Although the Trump Administration is initiating a process to re-
vise the Biden rule and published updated implementation guid-
ance,33 the regulatory ambiguities following the Sackett decision
caused confusion in applying the rule, especially for Corps districts
who are tasked with issuing jurisdictional determinations (JDs),
which are generally required as part of the CWA section 404 per-
mit process.34 For example, the Army Corps of Engineers has re-
cently reported there are currently 3,588 pending JDs.35 This back-
log is delaying permits from moving forward that are critical to
building new roads, homes, and other important infrastructure
projects across the country. Because of this, section 17 of H.R.
3898, as amended, requires the Army Corps of Engineers to allo-
cate all necessary resources and staff to address the backlog of JDs.
Despite the continuously changing definition of a WOTUS, there
have been certain exclusions to the definition that have endured
both Democrat and Republican administrations for waste treat-
ment systems,36 ephemeral features,37 prior converted cropland,38
and groundwater.39 Section 18 of H.R. 3898, as amended, codifies
those exclusions into law, providing certainty and durability for the

36The waste treatment system exclusion, which includes features like treatment ponds and
lagoons that are intended to improve water quality, was first codified ion in 1979. This exclusion
was maintained by subsequent administrations, including the Biden Administration.
37Ephemeral features, which flow only in direct response to precipitation, have been consist-
ently excluded from the WOTUS definition. The Reagan and Bush Administrations generally
treated these features as non-jurisdictional, but the Obama Administration included some
ephemeral streams as jurisdictional, which was a flashpoint for litigation. The Trump Adminis-
tration explicitly excluded ephemeral features in their 2020 regulations, which was ultimately
maintained by the Biden Administration because of the Supreme Court ruling in Sackett.
38Prior Converted Cropland, which are wetlands that were converted to agricultural lands
and cultivated with a commodity crop prior to December 23, 1985, have been continuously ex-
cluded from the WOTUS definition since 1993.
39There has been increased interest from environmental organizations in making ground-
water jurisdictional under the CWA. However, the CWA is only authorized to regulate surface
waters.

regulated community who have utilized those exemptions for dec-
ades.

Section 21:
Section 402 of the CWA authorizes the National Pollutant Dis-
charge Elimination System (NPDES) program to regulate dis-
charges of pollutants from point sources into navigable waters.40
Point sources are defined as ‘‘any discernible, confined and discrete
conveyance, such as a pipe, ditch, channel, conduit, discrete fissure,
or container,’’41 and also include ‘‘vessels or other floating craft’’
from which pollutants may be discharged.42 Certain agriculture,
silviculture, and stormwater runoff are exempted from requiring a
NPDES permit.43 Sections 9 and 10 of H.R. 3898, as amended, fur-
ther clarifies these exemptions for agriculture runoff and aerial
fire-retardant, respectively, which have experienced legal uncer-
tainty over the last decade.
The CWA explicitly excludes ‘‘agricultural stormwater dis-
charges’’ and ‘‘return flows from irrigated agriculture’’ from the def-
inition of a point source, which means these discharges are not re-
quired to be regulated under the NPDES program.44 Despite this
clear exemption, in 2011, the EPA ordered a poultry farmer, Lois
Alt, in West Virginia to obtain a NPDES permit for stormwater
runoff from her farmyard, which is the area directly outside of the
poultry production house.45 The EPA claimed that chicken feath-
ers, manure, dander, and other debris that had been pushed out of
the poultry house through the ventilation system, and landed in
areas outside the poultry production houses, qualify as a discharge.
Ms. Alt challenged this order, and the United States Court for the
Northern District of West Virginia ruled against EPA in 2013, re-
jecting its argument that the CWA regulates ordinary stormwater
runoff from non-production areas at livestock or poultry farms.46
The EPA initially appealed the case, but it voluntarily withdrew
the appeal a few months later. In a public statement, the EPA stat-
ed that it ‘‘remains committed to working with the agricultural
community to ensure compliance with this legal requirement and
to pursue enforcement when necessary,’’47 indicating its intent to
circumvent the agricultural stormwater exemption in the CWA.

Section 22:
Section 9 of H.R. 3898, as amended, clarifies the scope of the agri-
culture stormwater exemption under the NPDES program to pre-
vent future EPA’s from unlawfully requiring agricultural oper-
ations from requiring a NPDES permit for stormwater discharges.
Conversely, the EPA has historically not required a permit for
aerial fire-retardant discharges under the NPDES program. How-
ever, in October 2022, the Forest Service Employees for Environ-
mental Ethics (FSEEE) brough suit against the United States For-
est Service (USFS) for discharging aerially deployed fire retardant
into navigable waters without a NPDES permit, in violation of the

CWA.48 The United States District Court for the District of Mon-
tana subsequently granted, in part, FSEEE’s motion for summary
judgement on the basis that USFS had violated the CWA for the
discharge of aerial fire retardant without a NPDES permit and re-
quired the EPA to work with USFS to develop a permit.49 Section
10 of H.R. 3898, as amended, clarifies that aerially discharged fire-
retardant does not require a NPDES permit.
Similarly, for more than three decades following the enactment
of the CWA, EPA did not consider registered pesticides used in
compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA) as pollutants that required additional permits through
the NPDES program, formalized in a 2006 Rule promulgated by
EPA.50 However, in 2009, the United States Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals held in National Cotton Council, et al, v. EPA, that the
final rule was not a reasonable interpretation of the CWA and va-
cated the rule.51 The court held that NPDES permits are required
for the application of biological pesticides or the application of
chemical pesticides that leave a residue in water when such appli-
cations are made to, or conveyed into, a WOTUS.52
Concerns were raised at the time of the National Cotton Council
case that requiring additional regulation of pesticides under the
CWA would create a duplicative permitting process without pro-
viding any additional health benefits. For example, then-Secretary
of Agriculture Tom Vilsack wrote to then-EPA Administrator Lisa
Jackson, stating, ‘‘subjecting FIFRA-compliant pesticides to the ad-
ditional regulatory regime of the CWA is duplicative and will not
help protect the environment.’’53 Section 11 of H.R. 3898, as
amended, restores EPA’s longstanding interpretation that FIFRA-
compliant pesticides do not require a duplicative permitting process
through the NPDES program.
Since all point source dischargers are subject to the NPDES pro-
gram, a total of more than 65,000 industrial and municipal conven-
tional dischargers are required to obtain permits pursuant to sec-
tion 402.54 In addition, NPDES permits are required for
stormwater discharges from industrial and municipal sources, in-
cluding over 150,000 individual sources.55 NPDES permits require
the point source to attain technology-based effluent limits, while
specifying the numerical effluent limitations that sources must
meet in order to guarantee water quality where possible, and a
deadline for compliance.56 Point sources may, in some instances,

apply for a NPDES general permit as opposed to a NPDES indi-
vidual permit. An individual NPDES permit is written for site-spe-
cific discharges that are unique to a specific location or discharge.57
Currently, general and individual NPDES permits are issued for
up to five years and must be renewed thereafter if discharges con-
tinue.58 However, if the permittee provides a complete application,
but is not reissued a permit prior the date of expiration, the permit
may be ‘‘administratively continued.’’59 Permit applications are
considered backlogged for new applications if they are not issued
or denied within 365 days of receipt, and for extensions if they are
administratively continued for 180 days or more.60 H.R. 3898, as
amended, seeks to provide more certainty for all NPDES permit
holders. Section 7 authorizes NPDES permits to be issued for up
to ten years, and Section 7 requires EPA to provide two-year notice
to general permit holders if that permit will not be renewed and
allows the permit to continue past its expiration date if two-year
notice is not provided to the permit holder.
Under section 304(a) of the CWA, the EPA is required to develop,
publish, and, from time to time, revise criteria for water quality.
These criteria serve as recommendations to states for defining am-
bient surface water conditions of a water body to protect against
adverse effects to aquatic life and human health.61 These criteria
are often adopted by states and help inform the development of
water quality-based effluent limits included in NPDES permits.62
Currently, the EPA voluntarily accepts comments on proposed cri-
teria under 304(a) and subjects them to review from its own
Science Advisory Board. In a hearing before the Subcommittee on
May 16, 2023, a witness representing the National Association of
Clean Water Agencies, Mickey Conway, Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) of Metro Water Recovery in Denver, CO, testified, ‘‘[a]s utili-
ties face complex and costly infrastructure challenges over the next
fifty years, it is critical that the limits imposed in NPDES permits
be based on the best available science and a complete record, not
political whim or expedience.’’63 Section 3 of H.R. 3898, as amend-
ed, increases the transparency of the process of creating limits for
NPDES permits by requiring that water quality criteria are devel-
oped through an official rulemaking, which allows outside com-
ments made by stakeholders, experts, and others, to be considered.
It also ensures that the rulemaking is subject to limited judicial re-
view.
The CWA provides for two types of general limits on pollution
discharges—a technology-based limit (TBEL) and a more-stringent
water quality-based limit (WQBEL) when technology-based limits
alone, are insufficient to address local water quality concerns. Per-
mit writers must consider the potential impact of every proposed

surface water discharge on the quality of the receiving water. If
TBELs are not sufficient to meet the water quality standards in
the receiving water, the CWA (section 303(b)(1)(B)) and NPDES
regulations (40 C.F.R. 122.44(d)) require that the permit writer de-
velop more stringent, water quality-based effluent limits
(WQBELs).64
TBELs for industrial dischargers reflect effluent limitation guide-
lines (ELGs). ELGs are technology-based, wastewater discharge
standards that are developed by the EPA on an industry-by-indus-
try basis. ELGs are intended to represent the greatest pollutant re-
ductions that are economically achievable for an industry and are
based on available technologies.65 Since 1972, EPA has promul-
gated ELGs for 59 industrial categories, including the steam elec-
tric power industry—which covers power plants that use nuclear or
fossil fuels to generate steam used to produce electricity.66 Some
have raised concerns that the technologies used to develop the ELG
for steam electric power under the Biden Administration was based
on data from foreign countries, including China.67 Section 4 of H.R.
3898, as amended, requires ELGs to be based on technology that
is commercially available in the United States that has also been
demonstrated at an applicable scale.

Section 23:
Section 402(k) of the CWA provides a ‘‘permit shield’’ for permit
holders.68 Under this provision, if a permittee is in compliance with
its NPDES permit terms, they are shielded from enforcement ac-
tion from agencies and third parties. The United States Supreme
Court has held that this permit shield serves to ‘‘insulate permit
holders from changes in various regulations during the period of a
permit and to relieve permit holders of having to litigate the ques-
tion of whether their permits are sufficiently strict. In short, sec-
tion 402(k) serves the purpose of giving permits finality.’’69
Some permit holders contend that permit writers are inappropri-
ately incorporating generic requirements within NPDES permits as
enforceable effluent limitations, which have attracted legal chal-
lenges. For example, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
(SFPUC) sued the EPA for requiring their NPDES permit to in-
clude broad language outside of clear effluent limitations man-
dating their discharges to not ‘‘cause or contribute to the violation
of water quality standards.’’70
In March 2025, the Supreme Court held in City and County of
San Francisco v. Environmental Protection Agency that the CWA
allows EPA to issue permits that limit a permitholder’s discharges
and that these ‘‘end-result’’ requirements, routinely imposed in
NPDES permits through generic language, were inconsistent with
the CW.71 Specifically, the court stated: ‘‘[W]e hold that

Section 24:
§1311(b)(1)(C) does not authorize the EPA to include ‘‘end-result’’
provisions in NPDES permits. Determining what steps a permittee
must take to ensure that water quality standards are met is the
EPA’s responsibility, and Congress has given it the tools needed to
make that determination. If the EPA does what the CWA demands,
water quality will not suffer.’’72

Section 25:
Section 8 of H.R. 3898, as amended, would reaffirm the Supreme
Court’s ruling in San Francisco v. EPA and clarify the scope of the
permit shield as outlined by a 1994 EPA policy guidance docu-
ment.73 The 1994 guidance specified that permittees are shielded
from liability under lawful NPDES permits for (1) pollutants spe-
cifically limited in a permit; (2) pollutants specifically identified as
present in a permit; or (3) pollutants not specifically identified as
present, but which are constituents of operations or processes that
are specifically identified in a permit.74 It also requires permit
writers to include specific information on the pollutant limitation,
therefore reducing ambiguity and the use of generic language in
NPDES permits.
A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is often referred to as a
‘‘pollution diet’’ and is defined as the ‘‘calculation of the maximum
amount of a pollutant allowed to enter a waterbody so that the
waterbody will meet and continue to meet water quality standards
for that particular pollutant’’.75 In waters where industrial and mu-
nicipal sources have achieved TBELs, but WQS have not been met,
dischargers may be required to meet additional pollution control re-
quirements through a TMDL, which can impact both point source
and non-point source dischargers.76 The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is
the largest, most comprehensive TMDL developed by EPA. It en-
compasses 64,000 square miles across six states and the District of
Columbia.77
EPA established the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010 pursuant to
consent decrees resolving litigation over impairment of waters in
Virginia and the District of Columbia, following years of voluntary
and cooperative measures taken amongst states within the Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed.78 The TMDL set two broad goals: an interim
goal of having 60 percent of pollution control measures needed to
attain water quality standards in place by 2017 and a final goal of
having 100 percent of the measures in place by 2025.79 Litigation
has taken place over the last fifteen years against the EPA for the
implementation of the TMDL, as well as against certain Bay
states—Pennsylvania in particular—due to concerns surrounding
implementation. Section 21 of H.R. 3898, as amended, expresses
that it’s the sense of Congress that the EPA should take a collabo-
rative and cooperative approach in working with the states and the

District of Columbia to achieve compliance with the Chesapeake
Bay TMDL.

Section 26:
Section 404 of the CWA authorizes a separate type of permit re-
quired to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters.
Activities covered under the section 404 program include those as-
sociated with pipeline projects; water resources projects such as
levees and dams; mining projects such as those for critical min-
erals; infrastructure development such as highways and airports;
and other development.80 Some activities are exempt from section
404 permitting requirements, such as certain farming and forestry
activities.81
Pursuant to section 404, the Corps issues two types of permits:
general and individual. The CWA authorizes the issuance of gen-
eral permits for discharges that are ‘‘similar in nature, will cause
only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed sepa-
rately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the
environment’’82 and are issued on a Nationwide, regional, or state
basis for particular categories of activities.83 Nationwide Permits
(NWPs) and Regional General Permits are issued by the Corps on
a National basis and are designed to ‘‘enhance regulatory efficiency
and provide clarity for the regulated public without decreasing en-
vironmental protections.’’84 The most recent reissuance of NWPs
went into effect in February 2022, covering 59 distinct activity cat-
egories, including mooring buoys, residential developments, utility
lines, road crossings, and mining activities.85 On June 18, 2025,
the Corps released a proposed rule titled ‘‘Proposal to Reissue and
Modify Nationwide Permits’’.86 Similar to other permits, NWPs are
often subject to litigation.87 Section 13 of H.R. 3898, as amended,
would, in effect, codify the current process followed by the Corps
in relation to its NWP program. The section also establishes min-
imum acreage requirements for all NWPs.

Section 27:
Section 404 also authorizes the EPA to restrict, prohibit, deny,
or withdraw the specification by the Corps of a site for the dis-
charge of dredged or fill material, if the agency determines that the
discharge will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal
water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or rec-
reational areas.88 Section 404(c) is commonly referred to as the
EPA’s ‘‘veto authority.’’ Since the CWA’s enactment, the EPA has
issued fourteen section 404(c) determinations, most recently for the
Pebble Deposit Area in Alaska.89 Concerns have been raised about
the EPA’s use of the 404(c) authority to retroactively issue a veto

after a project has received a permit or preemptively veto a project
before an application for a 404 permit is filed.
For example, in 2007, the Corps issued a permit for Spruce No.
1 Mine located in Logan Co., West Virginia. After a change in Ad-
ministration and legal action delaying the beginning of construc-
tion, the EPA vetoed the permit retroactively in 2011.90 In January
2023, the EPA preemptively vetoed a Section 404 permit for mine
development at the Pebble Deposit Area in Bristol Bay, Alaska.
This determination was made without an active section 404 permit
and based on Pebble Limited Partnership’s mine plan from 2020.91

Section 28:
Section 12 of H.R. 3898, as amended, would only permit the EPA
to issue a veto when there is an active application for a Section 404
permit, providing more certainty to permit seekers and holders, as
well as permitted projects. This legislation would not have any ret-
roactive impact on projects that have already underwent a veto
process.
In addition to the EPA’s veto authority, the Administrative Pro-
cedure Act provides a six-year statute of limitations for challenges
to section 404 permits, which provides third parties an opportunity
to legally challenge the issuance of a permit.92 This six-year win-
dow for legal action has caused project delays, added costs, and cre-
ated uncertainty for permit seekers, as well as for the Federal Gov-
ernment. Mr. Noah Hanners, on behalf of the National Association
of Manufacturers, at a Water Resources and Environment Sub-
committee Hearing in February 2025 stated:
‘‘Limiting the timeline for judicial review and supporting the
permit shield will cut down on unnecessary litigation that
delays projects and adds costs. Reasonable restrictions to the
EPA’s authority under Section 404(c) of the CWA to prohibit
areas as disposal sites—limiting retroactive vetoes of permits—
will likewise increase confidence in the permitting process.’’93

Section 29:
Section 15 of H.R. 3898, as amended, would apply a 60-day stat-
ute of limitations to Section 404 individual permits and general
permit verifications, in addition to EPA’s approval of a state’s as-
sumption of the 404 permit program. If a court does identify com-
pliance issues with the underlying statute, the court would be re-
quired to remand the permit back to the agency with specific
timelines to take court-ordered action, generally within 180 days.

Section 30:
Section 19 of H.R. 3898, as amended, aims to better balance the
scales of regulation and financial resources for agricultural pro-
ducers under the CWA. Section 311(j)(1)(C) of the CWA directs the
Federal Government to establish procedures, methods, and equip-
ment requirements to prevent the discharge of oil and hazardous
substances, which EPA has done through various rules.94 Section

(WRRDA) set parameters for which farms require no certification,
self-certification, or certification from a professional engineer under
the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Rule,
based on storage size of individual tanks, aggregate storage
amounts, and history of discharges.95 Section 19 raises the thresh-
old for which farms require certification under which category, al-
lowing more farmers to take responsibility, rather than forcing
them to hire the services of certified professional engineers.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee’s over-
sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of
1974, the Committee has requested but has not received a cost esti-
mate for this bill from the Director of Congressional Budget Office.
The Committee has also requested but not received from the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office a statement as to whether
this bill contains any new budget authority, spending authority,
credit authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax ex-
penditures. The Chairman of the Committee shall cause such esti-
mate and statement to be printed in the Congressional Record
upon its receipt by the Committee.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, a cost estimate provided
by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was not made available to the
Committee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of
the Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Con-
gressional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this legislation is to provide regulatory and judicial
certainty for regulated entities and communities, increase trans-
parency, and promote water quality, and for other purposes.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
3898, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the
Federal government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS,
AND LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS

of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional

earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of the rule XXI.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
An estimate of Federal mandates prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of the
Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congres-
sional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION

Section 50:
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that H.R. 3898, as amended, does not preempt any state, local, or
tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the definition of Section 5(b) of
the appendix to Title 5, United States Code, are created by this leg-
islation.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Public Law 104–1).

Section 51:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 52:

Section 2. Water quality standards attainability
This section requires water quality standards, developed under
Clean Water Act (CWA) section 303(c), to consider municipal com-
bined sewer storm and sanitary sewer long-term control plans, as
well as the ability of a permit holder to maintain compliance with
the standards through commercially available technologies.

Section 54:
Section 3. Water quality criteria development and transparency
This section establishes a more transparent procedure for the de-
velopment of water quality criteria by the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permits, which provides additional opportunities
for public participation and limited judicial review.

TITLE III—STANDARDS AND ENFORCEMENT
* * * * * * *
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
SEC. 303. (a)(1) In order to carry out the purpose of this Act, any
water quality standard applicable to interstate waters which was
adopted by any State and submitted to, and approved by, or is
awaiting approval by, the Administrator pursuant to this Act as in
effect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, shall remain in
effect unless the Administrator determined that such standard is
not consistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in ef-
fect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. If the Adminis-
trator makes such a determination he shall, within three months
after the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, notify the State and specify the changes
needed to meet such requirements. If such changes are not adopted
by the State within ninety days after the date of such notification,
the Administrator shall promulgate such changes in accordance
with subsection (b) of this section.
(2) Any State which, before the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, has adopted,
pursuant to its own law, water quality standards applicable to
intrastate waters shall submit such standards to the Administrator
within thirty days after the date of enactment of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Each such standard
shall remain in effect, in the same manner and to the same extent
as any other water quality standard established under this Act un-
less the Administrator determines that such standard is incon-
sistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in effect im-
mediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pol-
lution Control Act Amendments of 1972. If the Administrator
makes such a determination he shall not later than the one hun-
dred and twentieth day after the date of submission of such stand-
ards, notify the State and specify the changes needed to meet such
requirements. If such changes are not adopted by the State within
ninety days after such notification, the Administrator shall promul-
gate such changes in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.
(3)(A) Any State which prior to the date of enactment of the Fed-
eral Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 has not
adopted pursuant to its own laws water quality standards applica-
ble to intrastate waters shall, not later than one hundred and
eighty days after the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act Amendments of 1972, adopt and submit such
standards to the Administrator.
(B) If the Administrator determines that any such standards are
consistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in effect
immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, he shall approve such
standards.

(C) If the Administrator determines that any such standards are
not consistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in ef-
fect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, he shall, not
later than the ninetieth day after the date of submission of such
standards, notify the State and specify the changes to meet such
requirements. If such changes are not adopted by the State within
ninety days after the date of notification, the Administrator shall
promulgate such standards pursuant to subsection (b) of this sec-
tion.
(b)(1) The Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish pro-
posed regulations setting forth water quality standards for a State
in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Act as in ef-
fect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, if—
(A) the State fails to submit water quality standards within
the times prescribed in subsection (a) of this section,
(B) a water quality standard submitted by such State under
subsection (a) of this section is determined by the Adminis-
trator not to be consistent with the applicable requirements of
subsection (a) of this section.
(2) The Administrator shall promulgate any water quality stand-
ard published in a proposed regulation not later than one hundred
and ninety days after the date he publishes any such proposed
standard, unless prior to such promulgation, such State has adopt-
ed a water quality standard which the Administrator determines to
be in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.
(c)(1) øThe Governor of a State¿ (A) The Governor of a State or
the State water pollution control agency of such State shall from
time to time (but at least once each three year period beginning
with the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972) hold public hearings for the purpose of
reviewing applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate,
modifying and adopting standards. øResults of such review shall be
made available to the Administrator.¿
(B) Reviews under this paragraph shall include review, for pur-
poses of ensuring that combined sewer overflow controls are cost ef-
fective, of any water quality standard applicable to a body of water
into which, pursuant to a permit, order, or decree issued pursuant
to this Act, a municipal combined storm and sanitary sewer dis-
charges.
(C) Results of each review under this paragraph shall be made
available to the Administrator.
(2)(A) Whenever the State revises or adopts a new standard, such
revised or new standard shall be submitted to the Administrator.
Such revised or new water quality standard shall consist of the
designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the water
quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses. Such stand-
ards shall be such as to protect the public health or welfare, en-
hance the quality of water and serve the purposes of this Act. Such
standards shall be established taking into consideration (I) their
use and value for public water supplies, propagation of fish and
wildlife, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial, and
other purposesø, and also taking into consideration¿; (ii) their use
and value for navigation; and (iii) the cost and commercial avail-

ability in the United States of treatment technologies (including
whether the technologies have been demonstrated at an applicable
scale) that may be required to be applied to point sources in order
to result in compliance with such standards.
(B) Whenever a State reviews water quality standards pursuant
to paragraph (1) of this subsection, or revises or adopts new stand-
ards pursuant to this paragraph, such State shall adopt criteria for
all toxic pollutants listed pursuant to section 307(a)(1) of this Act
for which criteria have been published under section 304(a), the
discharge or presence of which in the affected waters could reason-
ably be expected to interfere with those designated uses adopted by
the State, as necessary to support such designated uses. Such cri-
teria shall be specific numerical criteria for such toxic pollutants.
Where such numerical criteria are not available, whenever a State
reviews water quality standards pursuant to paragraph (1), or re-
vises or adopts new standards pursuant to this paragraph, such
State shall adopt criteria based on biological monitoring or assess-
ment methods consistent with information published pursuant to

Section 73:
section 304(a)(8). Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit
or delay the use of effluent limitations or other permit conditions
based on or involving biological monitoring or assessment methods
or previously adopted numerical criteria.
(3) If the Administrator, within sixty days after the date of sub-
mission of the revised or new standard, determines that such
standard meets the requirements of this Act, such standard shall
thereafter be the water quality standard for the applicable waters
of that State. If the Administrator determines that any such re-
vised or new standard is not consistent with the applicable require-
ments of this Act, he shall not later than the ninetieth day after
the date of submission of such standard notify the State and speci-
fy the changes to meet such requirements. If such changes are not
adopted by the State within ninety days after the date of notifica-
tion, the Administrator shall promulgate such standard pursuant
to paragraph (4) of this subsection.
(4) The Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish pro-
posed regulations setting forth a revised or new water quality
standard for the navigable waters involved—
(A) if a revised or new water quality standard submitted by
such State under paragraph (3) of this subsection for such
waters is determined by the Administrator not to be consistent
with the applicable requirements of this Act, or
(B) in any case where the Administrator determines that a
revised or new standard is necessary to meet the requirements
of this Act.
The Administrator shall promulgate any revised or new standard
under this paragraph not later than ninety days after he publishes
such proposed standards, unless prior to such promulgation, such
State has adopted a revised or new water quality standard which
the Administrator determines to be in accordance with this Act.
(d)(1)(A) Each State shall identify those waters within its bound-
aries for which the effluent limitations required by section
301(b)(1)(A) and section 301(b)(1)(B) are not stringent enough to
implement any water quality standard applicable to such waters.
The State shall establish a priority ranking for such waters, taking

into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made
of such waters.
(B) Each State shall identify those waters or parts thereof within
its boundaries for which controls on thermal discharges under sec-
tion 301 are not stringent enough to assure protection and propa-
gation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and
wildlife.
(C) Each State shall establish for the waters identified in para-
graph (1)(A) of this subsection, and in accordance with the priority
ranking, the total maximum daily load, for those pollutants which
the Administrator identifies under section 304(a)(2) as suitable for
such calculation. Such load shall be established at a level necessary
to implement the applicable water quality standards with seasonal
variations and a margin of safety which takes into account any
lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between effluent lim-
itations and water quality.
(D) Each State shall estimate for the waters identified in para-
graph (1)(B) of this subsection the total maximum daily thermal
load required to assure protection and propagation of a balanced,
indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife. Such estimates
shall take into account the normal water temperatures, flow rates,
seasonal variations, existing sources of heat input, and the dissipa-
tive capacity of the identified waters or parts thereof. Such esti-
mates shall include a calculation of the maximum heat input that
can be made into each such part and shall include a margin of safe-
ty which takes into account any lack of knowledge concerning the
development of thermal water quality criteria for such protection
and propagation in the identified waters or parts thereof.
(2) Each State shall submit to the Administrator from time to
time, with the first such submission not later than one hundred
and eighty days after the date of publication of the first identifica-
tion of pollutants under section 304(a)(2)(D), for his approval the
waters identified and the loads established under paragraphs
(1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), and (1)(D) of this subsection. The Adminis-
trator shall either approve or disapprove such identification and
load not later than thirty days after the date of submission. If the
Administrator approves such identification and load, such State
shall incorporate them into its current plan under subsection (e) of
this section. If the Administrator disapproves such identification
and load, he shall not later than thirty days after the date of such
disapproval identify such waters in such State and establish such
loads for such waters as he determines necessary to implement the
water quality standards applicable to such waters and upon such
identification and establishment the State shall incorporate them
into its current plan under subsection (e) of this section.
(3) For the specific purpose of developing information, each State
shall identify all waters within its boundaries which it has not
identified under paragraph (1)(A) and (1)(B) of this subsection and
estimate for such waters the total maximum daily load with sea-
sonal variations and margins of safety, for those pollutants which
the Administrator identifies under section 304(a)(2) as suitable for
such calculation and for thermal discharges, at a level that would
assure protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous popu-
lation of fish, shellfish and wildlife.

(4) LIMITATIONS ON REVISION OF CERTAIN EFFLUENT LIMITA-
TIONS.—
(A) STANDARD NOT ATTAINED.—For waters identified
under paragraph (1)(A) where the applicable water quality
standard has not yet been attained, any effluent limitation
based on a total maximum daily load or other waste load
allocation established under this section may be revised
only if (i) the cumulative effect of all such revised effluent
limitations based on such total maximum daily load or
waste load allocation will assure the attainment of such
water quality standard, or (ii) the designated use which is
not being attained is removed in accordance with regula-
tions established under this section.
(B) STANDARD ATTAINED.—For waters identified under
paragraph (1)(A) where the quality of such waters equals
or exceeds levels necessary to protect the designated use
for such waters or otherwise required by applicable water
quality standards, any effluent limitation based on a total
maximum daily load or other waste load allocation estab-
lished under this section, or any water quality standard
established under this section, or any other permitting
standard may be revised only if such revision is subject to
and consistent with the antidegradation policy established
under this section.
(e)(1) Each State shall have a continuing planning process ap-
proved under paragraph (2) of this subsection which is consistent
with this Act.
(2) Each State shall submit not later than 120 days after the
date of the enactment of the Water Pollution Control Amendments
of 1972 to the Administrator for his approval a proposed continuing
planning process which is consistent with this Act. Not later than
thirty days after the date of submission of such a process the Ad-
ministrator shall either approve or disapprove such process. The
Administrator shall from time to time review each State’s approved
planning process for the purpose of insuring that such planning
process is at all times consistent with this Act. The Administrator
shall not approve any State permit program under title IV of this
Act for any State which does not have an approved continuing
planning process under this section.
(3) The Administrator shall approve any continuing planning
process submitted to him under this section which will result in
plans for all navigable waters within such State, which include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(A) effluent limitations and schedules of compliance at least
as stringent as those required by section 301(b)(1), section
301(b)(2), section 306, and section 307, and at least as strin-
gent as any requirements contained in any applicable water
quality standard in effect under authority of this section;
(B) the incorporation of all elements of any applicable
areawide waste management plans under section 208, and ap-
plicable basin plans under section 209 of this Act;

purpose of protecting human health in coastal recreation
waters.
(B) REVIEWS.—Not later than the date that is 5 years
after the date of publication of water quality criteria under
this paragraph, and at least once every 5 years thereafter,
the Administrator shall review and, as necessary, revise
the water quality criteria.
(10) CONSIDERATION OF TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES.—In de-
veloping or revising water quality criteria under this subsection,
the Administrator shall take into consideration the cost and
commercial availability in the United States of treatment tech-
nologies (including whether the technologies have been dem-
onstrated at an applicable scale) that may be required to be ap-
plied to point sources in order to result in compliance with
water quality standards adopted or promulgated under section

Section 79:
303.

or revised water quality criteria under paragraph (1) or (9) by
rule.
(b) For the purpose of adopting or revising effluent limitations
under this Act the Administrator shall, after consultation with ap-
propriate Federal and State agencies and other interested persons,
publish within one year of enactment of this title, regulations, pro-
viding guidelines for effluent limitations, and, at least annually
thereafter, revise, if appropriate, such regulations. Such regula-
tions shall—
(1)(A) identify, in terms of amounts of constituents and
chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of the best practicable control technology currently avail-
able for classes and categories of point sources (other than pub-
licly owned treatment works); and
(B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining
the control measures and practices to be applicable to point
sources (other than publicly owned treatment works) within
such categories or classes. Factors relating to the assessment
of best practical control technology currently available to com-
ply with subsection (b)(1) of section 301 of this Act shall in-
clude consideration of the total cost of application of technology
in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved
from such application, and shall also take into account the age
of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the
engineering aspects of the application of various types of con-
trol techniques, process changes, non-water quality environ-
mental impact (including energy requirements), the commercial
availability in the United States of the technology (including
whether the technology has been demonstrated at an applicable
scale), and such other factors as the Administrator deems ap-
propriate;
(2)(A) identify, in terms of amounts of constituents and
chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of the best control measures and practices achievable in-
cluding treatment techniques, process and procedure innova-
tions, operating methods, and other alternatives for classes
and categories of point sources (other than publicly owned
treatment works); and
(B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining
the best measures and practices available to comply with sub-

Section 80:
section (b)(2) of section 301 of this Act to be applicable to any
point source (other than publicly owned treatment works) with-
in such categories or classes. Factors relating to the assess-
ment of best available technology shall take into account the
age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed,
the engineering aspects of the application of various types of
control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such
effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (in-
cluding energy requirements), the commercial availability in
the United States of the technology (including whether the tech-
nology has been demonstrated at an applicable scale), and such
other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate;

(3) identify control measures and practices available to elimi-
nate the discharge of pollutants from categories and classes of
point sources, taking into account the cost of achieving such
elimination of the discharge of pollutants; and
(4)(A) identify, in terms of amounts of constituents and
chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of the best conventional pollutant control technology (in-
cluding measures and practices) for classes and categories of
point sources (other than publicly owned treatment works);
and
(B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining
the best conventional pollutant control technology measures
and practices to comply with section 301(b)(2)(E) of this Act to
be applicable to any point source (other than publicly owned
treatment works) within such categories or classes. Factors re-
lating to the assessment of best conventional pollutant control
technology (including measures and practices) shall include
consideration of the reasonableness of the relationship between
the costs of attaining a reduction in effluents and the effluent
reduction benefits derived, and the comparison of the cost and
level of reduction of such pollutants from the discharge from
publicly owned treatment works to the cost and level of reduc-
tion of such pollutants from a class or category of industrial
sources, and shall take into account the age of equipment and
facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering as-
pects of the application of various types of control techniques,
process changes, non-water quality environmental impact (in-
cluding energy requirements), the commercial availability in
the United States of the technology (including whether the tech-
nology has been demonstrated at an applicable scale), and such
other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.
(c) The Administrator, after consultation, with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, shall issue to
the States and appropriate water pollution control agencies within
270 days after enactment of this title (and from time to time there-
after) information on the processes, procedures, or operating meth-
ods which result in the elimination or reduction of the discharge
of pollutants to implement standards of performance under section
306 of this Act. Such information shall include technical and other
data, including costs, as are available on alternative methods of
elimination or reduction of the discharge of pollutants. Such infor-
mation, and revisions thereof, shall be published in the Federal
Register and otherwise shall be made available to the public.
(d)(1) The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate
Federal and State agencies and other interested persons, shall pub-
lish within sixty days after enactment of this title (and from time
to time thereafter) information, in terms of amounts of constituents
and chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
on the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of secondary treatment.
(2) The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, shall publish
within nine months after the date of enactment of this title (and
from time to time thereafter) information on alternative waste

eral and State agencies and other interested persons, shall promul-
gate within one hundred and eighty days after the date of enact-
ment of this subsection guidelines for identifying and evaluating in-
novative and alternative wastewater treatment processes and tech-
niques referred to in section 201(g)(5) of this Act.
(4) For the purposes of this subsection, such biological treatment
facilities as oxidation ponds, lagoons, and ditches and trickling fil-
ters shall be deemed the equivalent of secondary treatment. The
Administrator shall provide guidance under paragraph (1) of this
subsection on design criteria for such facilities, taking into account
pollutant removal efficiencies and, consistent with the objective of
the Act, assuring that water quality will not be adversely affected
by deeming such facilities as the equivalent of secondary treat-
ment.
(e) The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, may publish
regulations, supplemental to any effluent limitations specified
under subsections (b) and (c) of this section for a class or category
of point sources, for any specific pollutant which the Administrator
is charged with a duty to regulate as a toxic or hazardous pollutant
under section 307(a)(1) or 311 of this Act, to control plant site run-
off, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, and drainage from
raw material storage which the Administrator determines are asso-
ciated with or ancillary to the industrial manufacturing or treat-
ment process within such class or category of point sources and
may contribute significant amounts of such pollutants, to navigable
waters. Any applicable controls established under this subsection
shall be included as a requirement for the purposes of section 301,
302, 306, 307, or 403, as the case may be, in any permit issued to
a point source pursuant to section 402 of this Act.
(f) The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, shall issue to
appropriate Federal agencies, the States, water pollution control
agencies, and agencies designated under section 208 of this Act,
within one year after the effective date of this subsection (and from
time to time thereafter) information including (1) guidelines for
identifying and evaluating the nature and extent of nonpoint
sources of pollutants, and (2) processes, procedures, and methods to
control pollution resulting from—
(A) agricultural and silvicultural activities, including runoff
from fields and crop and forest lands;
(B) mining activities, including runoff and siltation from
new, currently operating, and abandoned surface and under-
ground mines;
(C) all construction activity, including runoff from the facili-
ties resulting from such construction;

Federal Register and otherwise made available to the public.
(g)(1) For the purpose of assisting States in carrying out pro-
grams under section 402 of this Act, the Administrator shall pub-
lish, within one hundred and twenty days after the date of enact-
ment of this title, and review at least annually thereafter and, if
appropriate, revise guidelines for pretreatment of pollutants which
he determines are not susceptible to treatment by publicly owned
treatment works. Guidelines under this subsection shall be estab-
lished to control and prevent the discharge into the navigable
waters, the contiguous zone, or the ocean (either directly or
through publicly owned treatment works) of any pollutant which
interferes with, passes through, or otherwise is incompatible with
such works.
(2) When publishing guidelines under this subsection, the Ad-
ministrator shall designate the category or categories of treatment
works to which the guidelines shall apply.
(h) The Administrator shall, within one hundred and eighty days
from the date of enactment of this title, promulgate guidelines es-
tablishing test procedures for the analysis of pollutants that shall
include the factors which must be provided in any certification pur-
suant to section 401 of this Act or permit application pursuant to

Section 81:
section 402 of this Act.
(i) The Administrator shall (1) within sixty days after the enact-
ment of this title promulgate guidelines for the purpose of estab-
lishing uniform application forms and other minimum require-
ments for the acquisition of information from owners and operators
of point-sources of discharge subject to any State program under

Section 82:
section 402 of this Act, and (2) within sixty days from the date of
enactment of this title promulgate guidelines establishing the min-
imum procedural and other elements of any State program under

Section 83:
section 402 of this Act which shall include:
(A) monitoring requirements;
(B) reporting requirements (including procedures to make in-
formation available to the public);
(C) enforcement provisions; and
(D) funding, personnel qualifications, and manpower require-
ments (including a requirement that no board or body which
approves permit applications or portions thereof shall include,
as a member, any person who receives, or has during the pre-
vious two years received, a significant portion of his income di-
rectly or indirectly from permit holders or applicants for a per-
mit).
(j) LAKE RESTORATION GUIDANCE MANUAL.—The Administrator
shall, within 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Water
Quality Act of 1987 and biennially thereafter, publish and dissemi-
nate a lake restoration guidance manual describing methods, proce-

discharge originates or will originate, or, if appropriate, from the
interstate water pollution control agency having jurisdiction over
the navigable waters at the point where the discharge originates or
will originate, that any such discharge will comply with the appli-
cable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of this Act.
In the case of any such øactivity¿ discharge for which there is not
an applicable effluent limitation or other limitation under sections
301(b) and 302, and there is not an applicable standard under sec-
tions 306 and 307, the State shall so certify, except that any such
certification shall not be deemed to satisfy section 511(c) of this
Act. Such State or interstate agency shall establish procedures for
public notice in the case of all øapplications¿ requests for certifi-
cation by it and, to the extent it deems appropriate, procedures for
public hearings in connection with specific øapplications¿ requests.
In any case where a State or interstate agency has no authority to
give such a certification, such certification shall be from the Ad-
ministrator. Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of
the PERMIT Act, each State and interstate agency that has author-
ity to give such a certification, and the Administrator, shall publish
requirements for certification to demonstrate to such State, such
interstate agency, or the Administrator, as the case may be, compli-
ance with the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306,
and 307. A decision to grant or deny a request for certification shall
be based only on compliance with the applicable provisions of sec-
tions 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307, and the grounds for the decision
shall be set forth in writing and provided to the applicant. Not later
than 90 days after receipt of a request for certification, the State,
interstate agency, or Administrator, as the case may be, shall iden-
tify in writing all specific additional materials or information nec-
essary for the request for certification to be complete, as described
in subsection (g). The State, interstate agency, or the Administrator,
as the case may be, may grant a request for certification with or
without conditions, deny a request for certification, or waive the re-
quirement for certification under this subsection with respect to
such Federal application. If the State, interstate agency, or Admin-
istrator, as the case may be, fails or refuses to øact on a request
for certification, within a reasonable period of time (which shall not
exceed one year) after receipt of such request, the certification re-
quirements of this subsection¿ grant the request for certification
with or without conditions, deny the request for certification, or
waive the requirement for certification under this subsection with
respect to such Federal application, within a reasonable period of
time to be determined by the licensing or permitting agency (which
shall not exceed one year) after receipt of such request, the require-
ment for certification under this subsection shall be waived with re-
spect to such Federal application. No license or permit shall be
granted until the certification required by this section has been ob-
tained or has been øwaived as provided in the preceding sentence¿
waived under this paragraph. No license or permit shall be granted
if certification has been denied by the State, interstate agency, or
the Administrator, as the case may be.

Whenever such a discharge may affect, as determined by the Ad-
ministrator, the quality of the waters of any other State, the Ad-
ministrator within thirty days of the date of ønotice of application
for such Federal license or permit¿ receipt of a notice under the pre-
ceding sentence shall so notify such other State, the licensing or
permitting agency, and the applicant. If the Administrator deter-
mines under the preceding sentence that such a discharge will not
affect the waters of any other State, no such notification is required.
If, within sixty days after receipt of such notification, such other
State determines that such discharge will affect the quality of its
waters so as to violate øany water quality requirement in such
State¿ any water quality standard in effect for the State under sec-
tion 303, and within such sixty-day period notifies the Adminis-
trator and the licensing or permitting agency in writing of its objec-
tion to the issuance of such license or permit and requests a public
hearing on such objection, the licensing or permitting agency shall
hold such a hearing at a time that is agreed to by such State and
the applicant. The Administrator shall at such hearing submit his
evaluation and recommendations with respect to any such objection
to the licensing or permitting agency. Such agency, based upon the
recommendations of such State, the Administrator, and upon any
additional evidence, if any, presented to the agency at the hearing,
shall condition such license or permit in such manner as may be
necessary to øinsure compliance with applicable water quality re-
quirements.¿ ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of

Section 88:
sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307. If the imposition of conditions
cannot øinsure¿ ensure such compliance such agency shall not
issue such license or permit.
(3) The certification obtained pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
subsection with respect to the construction of any facility shall ful-
fill the requirements of this subsection with respect to certification
in connection with any other Federal license or permit required for
the operation of such facility unless, after notice to the certifying
State, agency, or Administrator, as the case may be, which shall be
given by the Federal agency to whom application is made for such
operating license or permit, the State, or if appropriate, the inter-
state agency or the Administrator, notifies such agency within sixty
days after receipt of such notice that there is no longer reasonable
assurance that øthere will be compliance¿ any such discharge will
comply with the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303,
306, and 307 of this Act because of changes since the construction
license or permit certification was issued in (A) the construction or
operation of the facility, (B) the characteristics of the waters into
which such discharge is made, (C) the water quality criteria appli-
cable to such waters or (D) applicable effluent limitations or other
requirements. This paragraph shall be inapplicable in any case
where the applicant for such operating license or permit has failed
to provide the certifying State, or, if appropriate, the interstate
agency or the Administrator, with notice of any proposed changes
in the construction or operation of the facility with respect to which
a construction license or permit has been granted, which changes
may result in violation of øsection¿ any applicable provision of sec-
tion 301, 302, 303, 306, or 307 of this Act.

mitted facility or activity which may directly result in any dis-
charge into the navigable waters and with respect to which a cer-
tification has been obtained pursuant to paragraph (1) of this sub-

Section 89:
section, which facility or activity is not subject to a Federal oper-
ating license or permit, the licensee or permittee shall provide an
opportunity for such certifying State, or, if appropriate, the inter-
state agency or the Administrator to review the manner in which
the facility or activity shall be operated or conducted for the pur-
poses of assuring that øapplicable effluent limitations or other limi-
tations or other applicable water quality requirements will not be
violated¿ no applicable provision of section 301, 302, 303, 306, or
307 will be violated. Upon notification by the certifying State, or
if appropriate, the interstate agency or the Administrator that the
operation of any such federally licensed or permitted facility or ac-
tivity øwill violate applicable effluent limitations or other limita-
tions or other water quality requirements¿ will directly result in a
discharge that violates an applicable provision of section 301, 302,
303, 306, or 307, such Federal agency may, after public hearing,
suspend such license or permit. If such license or permit is sus-
pended, it shall remain suspended until notification is received
from the certifying State, agency, or Administrator, as the case
may be, that there is reasonable assurance that øsuch facility or
activity will not violate the applicable provisions¿ operation of such
facility or activity will not directly result in a discharge that vio-
lates any applicable provision of section 301, 302, 303, 306, or 307
of this Act.
(5) Any Federal license or permit with respect to which a certifi-
cation has been obtained under paragraph (1) of this subsection
may be suspended or revoked by the Federal agency issuing such
license or permit upon the entering of a judgment under this Act
that such facility or activity has been operated in violation of øthe
applicable provisions¿ any applicable provision of section 301, 302,
303, 306, or 307 of this Act.
(6) Except with respect to a permit issued under section 402 of
this Act, in any case where actual construction of a facility has
been lawfully commenced prior to April 3, 1970, no certification
shall be required under this subsection for a license or permit
issued after April 3, 1970, to operate such facility, except that any

tion of pollutants, notwithstanding section 301(a), upon condition
that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable requirements
under sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, and 403 of this Act, or (B)
prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions relating to all
such requirements, such conditions as the Administrator deter-
mines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.
(2) The Administrator shall prescribe conditions for such permits
to assure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this
subsection, including conditions on data and information collection,
reporting, and such other requirements as he deems appropriate.
(3) The permit program of the Administrator under paragraph (1)
of this subsection, and permits issued thereunder, shall be subject
to the same terms, conditions, and requirements as apply to a
State permit program and permits issued thereunder under sub-

Section 91:
section (b) of this section.
(4) All permits for discharges into the navigable waters issued
pursuant to section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, shall be deemed
to be permits issued under this title, and permits issued under this
title shall be deemed to be permits issued under section 13 of the
Act of March 3, 1899, and shall continue in force and effect for
their term unless revoked, modified, or suspended in accordance
with the provisions of this Act.
(5) No permit for a discharge into the navigable waters shall be
issued under section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, after the date
of enactment of this title. Each application for a permit under sec-
tion 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, pending on the date of enact-
ment of this Act shall be deemed to be an application for a permit
under this section. The Administrator shall authorize a State,
which he determines has the capability of administering a permit
program which will carry out the objective of this Act, to issue per-
mits for discharges into the navigable waters within the jurisdic-
tion of such State. The Administrator may exercise the authority
granted him by the preceding sentence only during the period
which begins on the date of enactment of this Act and ends either
on the ninetieth day after the date of the first promulgation of

approval by the Administrator of a permit program for such State
under subsection (b) of this section, whichever date first occurs,
and no such authorization to a State shall extend beyond the last
day of such period. Each such permit shall be subject to such condi-
tions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Act. No such permit shall issue if the Admin-
istrator objects to such issuance.
(6) GENERAL PERMITS.—
(A) PERMITS AUTHORIZED.—The Administrator may issue
general permits under this section on a State, regional, or
nationwide basis, or for a delineated area, for discharges
associated with any category of activities, which discharges
are of similar types and from similar sources.

a general permit issued under this section will expire and
the Administrator decides not to issue a new general permit
for discharges similar to those covered by the expiring gen-
eral permit, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal
Register a notice of such decision at least two years prior
to the expiration of the general permit.
(C) APPLICATION OF PERMIT TERMS OF AN EXPIRED PER-
MIT.—

this section expires and the Administrator has not pub-
lished a notice in accordance with subparagraph (B),
the Administrator shall, until the date described in
clause (ii)—
(I) continue to apply the terms, conditions, and
requirements of the expired general permit to any
discharge that was covered by the expired general
permit; and
(II) apply such terms, conditions, and require-
ments to any discharge that would have been cov-
ered by the expired general permit (in accordance
with any relevant requirements for such coverage)
if the discharge had occurred before such expira-
tion.
(ii) DATE DESCRIBED.—The date described in this
clause is the earlier of—
(I) the date on which the Administrator issues a

general permit for discharges similar to those cov-
ered by the expired general permit.
(b) At any time after the promulgation of the guidelines required
by subsection (i)(2) of section 304 of this Act, the Governor of each
State desiring to administer its own permit program for discharges
into navigable waters within its jurisdiction may submit to the Ad-
ministrator a full and complete description of the program it pro-
poses to establish and administer under State law or under an
interstate compact. In addition, such State shall submit a state-

ment from the attorney general (or the attorney for those State
water pollution control agencies which have independent legal
counsel), or from the chief legal officer in the case of an interstate
agency, that the laws of such State, or the interstate compact, as
the case may be, provide adequate authority to carry out the de-
scribed program. The Administrator shall approve each such sub-
mitted program unless he determines that adequate authority does
not exist:
(1) To issue permits which—
(A) apply, and insure compliance with, any applicable re-
quirements of sections 301, 302, 306, 307, and 403;

which may be affected, receive notice of each application for a per-
mit and to provide an opportunity for public hearing before a ruling
on each such application;
(4) To insure that the Administrator receives notice of each appli-
cation (including a copy thereof) for a permit;
(5) To insure that any State (other than the permitting State),
whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may sub-
mit written recommendations to the permitting State (and the Ad-
ministrator) with respect to any permit application and, if any part
of such written recommendations are not accepted by the permit-
ting State, that the permitting State will notify such affected State
(and the Administrator) in writing of its failure to so accept such
recommendations together with its reasons for so doing;
(6) To insure that no permit will be issued if, in the judgment
of the Secretary of the Army acting through the Chief of Engineers,
after consultation with the Secretary of the department in which
the Coast Guard is operating, anchorage and navigation of any of
the navigable waters would be substantially impaired thereby;
(7) To abate violations of the permit or the permit program, in-
cluding civil and criminal penalties and other ways and means of
enforcement;
(8) To insure that any permit for a discharge from a publicly
owned treatment works includes conditions to require the identi-
fication in terms of character and volume of pollutants of any sig-
nificant source introducing pollutants subject to pretreatment
standards under section 307(b) of this Act into such works and a
program to assure compliance with such pretreatment standards by
each such source, in addition to adequate notice to the permitting

any source which would be a new source as defined in section 306
if such source were discharging pollutants, (B) new introductions of
pollutants into such works from a source which would be subject
to section 301 if it were discharging such pollutants, or (C) a sub-
stantial change in volume or character of pollutants being intro-
duced into such works by a source introducing pollutants into such
works at the time of issuance of the permit. Such notice shall in-
clude information on the quality and quantity of effluent to be in-
troduced into such treatment works and any anticipated impact of
such change in the quantity or quality of effluent to be discharged
from such publicly owned treatment works; and
(9) To insure that any industrial user of any publicly owned
treatment works will comply with sections 204(b), 307, and 308.
(c)(1) Not later than ninety days after the date on which a State
has submitted a program (or revision thereof) pursuant to sub-

Section 92:
section (b) of this section, the Administrator shall suspend the
issuance of permits under subsection (a) of this section as to those
discharges subject to such program unless he determines that the
State permit program does not meet the requirements of subsection
(b) of this section or does not conform to the guidelines issued
under section 304(i)(2) of this Act. If the Administrator so deter-
mines, he shall notify the State of any revisions or modifications
necessary to conform to such requirements or guidelines.
(2) Any State permit program under this section shall at all
times be in accordance with this section and guidelines promul-
gated pursuant to section 304(i)(2) of this Act.

Section 93:
section in accordance with requirements of this section, he shall so
notify the State and, if appropriate corrective action is not taken

WITHDRAWALS.—A State may return to the Administrator ad-
ministration, and the Administrator may withdraw under
paragraph (3) of this subsection approval, of—

ministered by the State department or agency at the time
is returned or withdrawn; and
(B) a State partial permit program approved under sub-

Section 95:
section (n)(4) only if an entire phased component of the
permit program being administered by the State at the
time is returned or withdrawn.
(d)(1) Each State shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of
each permit application received by such State and provide notice
to the Administrator of every action related to the consideration of

permit under this paragraph such written objection shall contain a
statement of the reasons for such objection and the effluent limita-
tions and conditions which such permit would include if it were
issued by the Administrator.

graph, the Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this sub-

Section 97:
section, objects to the issuance of a permit, on request of the State,
a public hearing shall be held by the Administrator on such objec-
tion. If the State does not resubmit such permit revised to meet
such objection within 30 days after completion of the hearing, or,
if no hearing is requested within 90 days after the date of such ob-
jection, the Administrator may issue the permit pursuant to sub-

Section 98:
section (a) of this section for such source in accordance with the
guidelines and requirements of this Act.
(e) In accordance with guidelines promulgated pursuant to sub-

Section 99:
section (i)(2) of section 304 of this Act, the Administrator is author-
ized to waive the requirements of subsection (d) of this section at
the time he approves a program pursuant to subsection (b) of this

Section 100:
section for any category (including any class, type, or size within
such category) of point sources within the State submitting such
program.
(f) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing
categories of point sources which he determines shall not be subject
to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section in any State
with a program approved pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

carriage, storage, and stowage of pollutants.
(h) In the event any condition of a permit for discharges from a
treatment works (as defined in section 212 of this Act) which is
publicly owned is violated, a State with a program approved under
subsection (b) of this section or the Administrator, where no State
program is approved or where the Administrator determines pursu-
ant to section 309(a) of this Act that a State with an approved pro-
gram has not commenced appropriate enforcement action with re-
spect to such permit, may proceed in a court of competent jurisdic-
tion to restrict or prohibit the introduction of any pollutant into
such treatment works by a source not utilizing such treatment
works prior to the finding that such condition was violated.
(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the author-
ity of the Administrator to take action pursuant to section 309 of
this Act.

health. Until December 31, 1974, in any case where a permit
for discharge has been applied for pursuant to this section, but
final administrative disposition of such application has not
been made, such discharge shall not be a violation of (1) sec-
tion 301, 306, or 402 of this Act, or (2) section 13 of the Act

furnish information reasonably required or requested in order
to process the application. For the 180-day period beginning on
the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, in the case of any point source dis-
charging any pollutant or combination of pollutants imme-
diately prior to such date of enactment which source is not
subject to section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, the discharge

source applies for a permit for discharge pursuant to this sec-
tion within such 180-day period.
(2) SCOPE.—For purposes of paragraph (1), compliance with
the conditions of a permit issued under this section shall be
considered compliance with respect to a discharge of—

included in the permit that is—
(i) specifically identified as controlled or monitored
through indicator parameters in the permit, the fact
sheet for the permit, or the administrative record relat-
ing to the permit;
(ii) specifically identified during the permit applica-
tion process as present in discharges to which the per-
mit will apply; or
(iii) whether or not specifically identified in the per-
mit or during the permit application process—

the point source to which the permit applies, which
waste streams or processes are specifically identi-
fied during the permit application process; or
(II) otherwise within the scope of any operations
of the point source to which the permit applies,
which scope of operations is specifically identified
during the permit application process.

from conveyances or systems of conveyances (including but not
limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) used for col-
lecting and conveying precipitation runoff and which are not
contaminated by contact with, or do not come into contact with,
any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished
product, byproduct, or waste products located on the site of
such operations.
(3) SILVICULTURAL ACTIVITIES.—
(A) NPDES PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR SILVICULTURAL

duct of the following silviculture activities conducted
in accordance with standard industry practice: nursery
operations, site preparation, reforestation and subse-
quent cultural treatment, thinning, prescribed burn-
ing, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, sur-
face drainage, or road construction and
maintenanceø.¿; or
(ii) a discharge resulting from the aerial application
of a product used for fire control and suppression pur-
poses that appears on the most current Forest Service

(m) ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT OF CONVENTIONAL POLLUTANTS
NOT REQUIRED.—To the extent a treatment works (as defined in

Section 101:
section 212 of this Act) which is publicly owned is not meeting the
requirements of a permit issued under this section for such treat-
ment works as a result of inadequate design or operation of such
treatment works, the Administrator, in issuing a permit under this

Section 102:
section, shall not require pretreatment by a person introducing con-
ventional pollutants identified pursuant to a section 304(a)(4) of
this Act into such treatment works other than pretreatment re-
quired to assure compliance with pretreatment standards under
subsection (b)(8) of this section and section 307(b)(1) of this Act.
Nothing in this subsection shall affect the Administrator’s author-
ity under sections 307 and 309 of this Act, affect State and local
authority under sections 307(b)(4) and 510 of this Act, relieve such
treatment works of its obligations to meet requirements established
under this Act, or otherwise preclude such works from pursuing
whatever feasible options are available to meet its responsibility to
comply with its permit under this section.

(1) STATE SUBMISSION.—The Governor of a State may submit
under subsection (b) of this section a permit program for a por-
tion of the discharges into the navigable waters in such State.
(2) MINIMUM COVERAGE.—A partial permit program under
this subsection shall cover, at a minimum, administration of a
major category of the discharges into the navigable waters of
the State or a major component of the permit program required
by subsection (b).
(3) APPROVAL OF MAJOR CATEGORY PARTIAL PERMIT PRO-
GRAMS.—The Administrator may approve a partial permit pro-
gram covering administration of a major category of discharges
under this subsection if—
(A) such program represents a complete permit program
and covers all of the discharges under the jurisdiction of
a department or agency of the State; and
(B) the Administrator determines that the partial pro-
gram represents a significant and identifiable part of the
State program required by subsection (b).

(A) the Administrator determines that the partial pro-
gram represents a significant and identifiable part of the
State program required by subsection (b); and
(B) the State submits, and the Administrator approves,
a plan for the State to assume administration by phases
of the remainder of the State program required by sub-

Section 103:
section (b) by a specified date not more than 5 years after
submission of the partial program under this subsection
and agrees to make all reasonable efforts to assume such
administration by such date.
(o) ANTI-BACKSLIDING.—
(1) GENERAL PROHIBITION.—In the case of effluent limita-
tions established on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this sec-
tion, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified on
the basis of effluent guidelines promulgated under section
304(b) subsequent to the original issuance of such permit, to
contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the
comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit. In the
case of effluent limitations established on the basis of section
301(b)(1)(C) or section 303(d) or (e), a permit may not be re-
newed, reissued, or modified to contain effluent limitations
which are less stringent than the comparable effluent limita-
tions in the previous permit except in compliance with section
303(d)(4).
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—A permit with respect to which paragraph
(1) applies may be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a
less stringent effluent limitation applicable to a pollutant if—
(A) material and substantial alterations or additions to
the permitted facility occurred after permit issuance which
justify the application of a less stringent effluent limita-
tion;
(B)(i) information is available which was not available at
the time of permit issuance (other than revised regula-
tions, guidance, or test methods) and which would have
justified the application of a less stringent effluent limita-
tion at the time of permit issuance; or
(ii) the Administrator determines that technical mis-
takes or mistaken interpretations of law were made in
issuing the permit under subsection (a)(1)(B);
(C) a less stringent effluent limitation is necessary be-
cause of events over which the permittee has no control
and for which there is no reasonably available remedy;
(D) the permittee has received a permit modification
under section 301(c), 301(g), 301(h), 301(i), 301(k), 301(n),
or 316(a); or
(E) the permittee has installed the treatment facilities
required to meet the effluent limitations in the previous
permit and has properly operated and maintained the fa-
cilities but has nevertheless been unable to achieve the
previous effluent limitations, in which case the limitations
in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may reflect
the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall
not be less stringent than required by effluent guidelines
in effect at the time of permit renewal, reissuance, or
modification).

Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any revised waste load al-
locations or any alternative grounds for translating water qual-
ity standards into effluent limitations, except where the cumu-
lative effect of such revised allocations results in a decrease in
the amount of pollutants discharged into the concerned waters,
and such revised allocations are not the result of a discharger
eliminating or substantially reducing its discharge of pollut-
ants due to complying with the requirements of this Act or for
reasons otherwise unrelated to water quality.
(3) LIMITATIONS.—In no event may a permit with respect to
which paragraph (1) applies be renewed, reissued, or modified
to contain an effluent limitation which is less stringent than
required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time the permit
is renewed, reissued, or modified. In no event may such a per-
mit to discharge into waters be renewed, reissued, or modified
to contain a less stringent effluent limitation if the implemen-
tation of such limitation would result in a violation of a water
quality standard under section 303 applicable to such waters.
(p) MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER DISCHARGES.—
(1) GENERAL RULE.—Prior to October 1, 1994, the Adminis-
trator or the State (in the case of a permit program approved
under section 402 of this Act) shall not require a permit under
this section for discharges composed entirely of stormwater.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect
to the following stormwater discharges:

(C) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer
system serving a population of 250,000 or more.
(D) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer
system serving a population of 100,000 or more but less
than 250,000.
(E) A discharge for which the Administrator or the
State, as the case may be, determines that the stormwater
discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality
standard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to
waters of the United States.
(3) PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.—
(A) INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES.—Permits for discharges as-
sociated with industrial activity shall meet all applicable
provisions of this section and section 301.
(B) MUNICIPAL DISCHARGE.—Permits for discharges from
municipal storm sewers—
(i) may be issued on a system- or jurisdiction-wide
basis;
(ii) shall include a requirement to effectively pro-
hibit non-stormwater discharges into the storm sew-
ers; and
(iii) shall require controls to reduce the discharge of
pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, includ-
ing management practices, control techniques and sys-
tem, design and engineering methods, and such other

(B) INCLUSIONS IN INTEGRATED PLAN.—An integrated
plan incorporated into a permit issued under this section
may include the implementation of—
(i) projects, including innovative projects, to reclaim,
recycle, or reuse water; and
(ii) green infrastructure.
(4) COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—A permit issued under this section
that incorporates an integrated plan may include a sched-
ule of compliance, under which actions taken to meet any
applicable water quality-based effluent limitation may be
implemented over more than 1 permit term if the schedule
of compliance—
(i) is authorized by State water quality standards;
and
(ii) meets the requirements of section 122.47 of title
40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the
date of enactment of this subsection).
(B) TIME FOR COMPLIANCE.—For purposes of subpara-
graph (A)(ii), the requirement of section 122.47 of title 40,
Code of Federal Regulations, for compliance by an applica-
ble statutory deadline under this Act does not prohibit im-
plementation of an applicable water quality-based effluent
limitation over more than 1 permit term.
(C) REVIEW.—A schedule of compliance incorporated into
a permit issued under this section may be reviewed at the
time the permit is renewed to determine whether the
schedule should be modified.

(A) APPLICABLE STANDARDS.—Nothing in this subsection
modifies any obligation to comply with applicable tech-
nology and water quality-based effluent limitations under
this Act.
(B) FLEXIBILITY.—Nothing in this subsection reduces or
eliminates any flexibility available under this Act, includ-
ing the authority of a State to revise a water quality
standard after a use attainability analysis under section

Section 104:
131.10(g) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a suc-
cessor regulation), subject to the approval of the Adminis-
trator under section 303(c).
(6) CLARIFICATION OF STATE AUTHORITY.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Nothing in section 301(b)(1)(C) pre-
cludes a State from authorizing in the water quality stand-
ards of the State the issuance of a schedule of compliance
to meet water quality-based effluent limitations in permits
that incorporate provisions of an integrated plan.
(B) TRANSITION RULE.—In any case in which a discharge
is subject to a judicial order or consent decree, as of the
date of enactment of this subsection, resolving an enforce-
ment action under this Act, any schedule of compliance
issued pursuant to an authorization in a State water qual-
ity standard may not revise a schedule of compliance in
that order or decree to be less stringent, unless the order
or decree is modified by agreement of the parties and the
court.

(t) EXPRESSION OF WATER QUALITY-BASED EFFLUENT LIMITA-
TIONS.—If the Administrator (or a State, in the case of a permit pro-
gram approved by the Administrator) determines that a water qual-
ity-based limitation on a discharge of a pollutant is necessary to in-
clude in a permit under this section in addition to any appropriate
technology-based effluent limitations included in such permit, the
Administrator (or the State) may include such water quality-based
limitation in such permit only in the form of a limitation that—
(1) specifies the pollutant to which it applies; and
(2) clearly describes the manner in which compliance with the
limitation may be achieved, which shall include—
(A) a numerical limit on the discharge of such pollutant;
(B) a narrative description of required actions to be ap-
plied to the discharge (including any measures or practices
required to be applied); or
(C) a narrative description of a limitation on the dis-
charge that specifies the level of control to be applied.
(u) DISCHARGES OF PESTICIDES.—
(1) NO PERMIT REQUIREMENT.—Except as provided in para-
graph (2), a permit shall not be required by the Administrator
or a State under this Act for a discharge from a point source
into navigable waters of a pesticide authorized for sale, dis-
tribution, or use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act, or the residue of such a pesticide, resulting
from the application of such pesticide.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the fol-
lowing discharges of a pesticide or pesticide residue:
(A) A discharge resulting from the application of a pes-
ticide in violation of a provision of the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that is relevant to pro-
tecting water quality, if—
(i) the discharge would not have occurred but for the
violation; or
(ii) the amount of pesticide or pesticide residue in the
discharge is greater than would have occurred without
the violation.
(B) Stormwater discharges subject to regulation under
subsection (p).
(C) The following discharges subject to regulation under
this section:

under this subsection, the Secretary shall publish the notice re-
quired by this subsection.
(b) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, each such disposal
site shall be specified for each such permit by the Secretary (1)
through the application of guidelines developed by the Adminis-
trator, in conjunction with the Secretary, which guidelines shall be
based upon criteria comparable to the criteria applicable to the ter-
ritorial seas, the contiguous zone, and the ocean under section
403(c), and (2) in any case where such guidelines under clause (1)
alone would prohibit the specification of a site, through the applica-
tion additionally of the economic impact of the site on navigation
and anchorage.
ø(c) The Administrator¿ (c) SPECIFICATION OR USE OF DEFINED
AREA.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator is authorized to prohibit
the specification (including the withdrawal of specification) of
any defined area as a disposal site, and he is authorized to
deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specification
(including the withdrawal of specification) as a disposal site,
whenever he determines, during the period described in para-
graph (2) and after notice and opportunity for public hearings,
that the discharge of such materials into such area will have
an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies,
shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and
breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas. Before making
such determination, the Administrator shall consult with the
Secretary. The Administrator shall set forth in writing and
make public his findings and his reasons for making any deter-
mination under this subsection.
(2) PERIOD OF PROHIBITION.—The period during which the
Administrator may prohibit the specification (including the
withdrawal of specification) of any defined area as a disposal
site, or deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specifica-
tion (including the withdrawal of specification) as a disposal
site, under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) begin on the date on which an applicant submits all
the information required to complete an application for a
permit under this section; and
(B) end on the date on which the Secretary issues the per-
mit.

(1) PERMITS AUTHORIZED.—In carrying out his functions re-
lating to the discharge of dredged or fill material under this

Section 105:
section, the Secretary may, after notice and opportunity for
public hearing, issue general permits on a State, regional, or
nationwide basis for any category of activities involving dis-
charges of dredged or fill material if the Secretary determines
that the activities in such category are similar in nature, will
cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when per-
formed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative ad-
verse effect on the environment. Any general permit issued
under this subsection shall (A) be based on the guidelines de-
scribed in subsection (b)(1) of this section, and (B) set forth the

(2) TERM.—No general permit issued under this subsection
shall be for a period of more than øfive years¿ ten years after
the date of its issuance and such general permit may be re-
voked or modified by the Secretary if, after opportunity for
public hearing, the Secretary determines that the activities au-
thorized by such general permit have an adverse impact on the
environment or such activities are more appropriately author-
ized by individual permits.
(3) CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining the environmental ef-
fects of an activity under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary—
(A) shall consider only the effects of any discharge of
dredged or fill material resulting from such activity;
(B) shall consider any effects of a discharge of dredged
or fill material into less than 3 acres of navigable waters
to be a minimal adverse environmental effect; and
(C) may consider any effects of a discharge of dredged or
fill material into 3 acres or more of navigable waters to be
a minimal adverse environmental effect.
(4) NATIONWIDE PERMITS FOR LINEAR PROJECTS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of
this section, the Secretary shall maintain general permits
on a nationwide basis for—
(i) linear infrastructure projects that result in a dis-
charge of dredged or fill material into less than 3 acres
of navigable waters for each single and complete
project; and
(ii) linear pipeline projects that do not result in the
loss of navigable waters in an amount that is greater
than 0.5 acres for each single and complete project.

Section 119:
section. The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types,
and sizes within any category of discharges.

poration, a copy of such order shall be served on any appropriate
corporate officers.

MINORITY VIEWS
We oppose H.R. 3898. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the nation’s
bedrock environmental law for ‘‘restoring and maintaining the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.’’
H.R. 3898 defies the Act’s overarching intent to keep our nation’s
water clean, guts the authority of federal agencies to minimize the
impact that projects have on water resources, and undermines the
authority of states and Tribes to protect locally important
waterbodies.
This bill significantly restricts U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) oversight
and regulatory authorities under the Act, which, when paired with
the Trump Administration’s efforts to eviscerate federal funding
and purge agency personnel, will leave the federal agencies power-
less to fulfill their responsibilities under the law. This bill also un-
dermines the ‘‘cooperative federalism’’ partnership the federal gov-
ernment has with states and Tribes to prevent pollution under the
Clean Water Act, weakening the ability of states and Tribes to de-
fend local waterbodies.
Simply put, this partisan bill makes it easier to release harmful
and toxic pollution into our nation’s rivers, streams, lakes, and
other waterbodies through loopholes, legal shields, and limited
oversight of polluters. The bill eviscerates over 50 years of Clean
Water Act success that has doubled the percentage of waters that
are safe for fishing, swimming, and use as drinking water. H.R.
3898 undermines permitting requirements; eliminates judicial re-
view and public engagement; rolls back oversight of mining compa-
nies and industrial polluters; slows down permit processing with
increased bureaucracy; and weakens state-led decisions on locally
important waters.
Congressional Republicans offer these overarching, anti-Clean
Water Act changes as their response to specific projects that have
been blocked or to address the grievances of special interests and
polluters rather than provide a sustainable solution for reasonable
permitting efforts or to ensure the protection of water quality for
current or future generations.
For example, large-scale mining proposals, such as Pebble Mine
in Alaska or Spruce Mine in West Virginia, or ecologically dev-
astating flood control projects, such as the Yazoo Pumps in Mis-
sissippi, were blocked by presidential administrations from both
parties under the EPA’s Section 404(c) authority once the impacts
were thoroughly documented and publicly evaluated. Although
EPA has utilized this authority very sparingly (only 14 times
among the tens-of-millions of permitted activities since 1972), H.R.
3898 will effectively eliminate the authority altogether.
Similarly, for over 50 years, states and Tribes have judiciously
used section 401 of the CWA to ensure that projects or activities
(109)

carried out within their jurisdictions are consistent with state
water quality standards and other relevant state and Tribal laws.
Yet, in response to two specific instances where states legitimately
used this authority to prevent the construction of fossil fuel-related
facilities within their borders, H.R. 3898 changes the law to allow
special interests to override state and Tribal concerns over poten-
tial development within their own borders.
In a multitude of ways, H.R. 3898 will weaken federal, state, and
local efforts to restore, maintain, or clean up local waterbodies. The
bill tells communities of all sizes, especially rural, minority, and
economically-disadvantaged communities, that clean water is sim-
ply too costly for them to have. At the same time, the bill increases
the likelihood that American families will have to spend more for
safe drinking water for their homes or to access water-related rec-
reational areas, if such resources are still available. For example,
H.R. 3898 increases the likelihood for discharges of toxic chemicals
and pesticides, such as PFAS, mercury, and arsenic—chemicals
that, once in a local drinking water source, are extremely expen-
sive, and potentially impossible, to remove completely. Under this
bill, permittees are discouraged from investigating what toxic
chemicals might be in their waste-stream, which increases the like-
lihood of exposure to American families, including vulnerable popu-
lations, such as pregnant women, infants, and children. Yet, even
the Trump Administration’s Make America Healthy Again Com-
mission’s report recognizes the obvious risk to human health from
increased exposure to toxic chemicals and pesticides.1
The bill also exacerbates the likelihood of downstream contami-
nation and flooding as upstream waters and wetlands are devel-
oped or destroyed—increasing the risk and the cost to American
families, businesses, and economies. H.R. 3898 rewards polluters
and special interests by reducing their responsibility to prevent or
treat their waste—shifting the cost from polluters to American
families who will be forced to pay more for clean water.
H.R. 3898 also allows private industry and development to
steamroll through towns and states, polluting waterbodies due to
minimal review and disregarding local perspectives. The bill
greenlights large projects with minimal review while also limiting
opportunities for public comment or challenges to ecologically dam-
aging permits or projects. The bill also prevents judicial review by
vastly shortening the statute of limitations; limiting standing to file
suit; and limiting the Court’s options for recourse.
If H.R. 3898 is enacted, the potential adverse impacts to
waterbodies (such as reduced water quality or availability); to the
environment (such as increased greenhouse gas emissions or other
contamination); and to residents (such as perpetuating environ-
mental justice concerns) will be borne by the local and surrounding
communities without a voice or venue to have their concerns heard.
This legislation puts polluters over people.
Ironically, H.R. 3898 also contradicts itself by slowing down per-
mitting processes, sowing uncertainty, and decreasing flexibility.
For example, H.R. 3898 will add a formal rulemaking process in
1See https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assess
ment.pdf.

place of an existing and more efficient guidance process. This will
slow down the issuance of water quality criteria without increasing
transparency or public participation and remove flexibility for up-
dates. It will also open the criteria to judicial review, allowing ag-
grieved polluters another opportunity to challenge state and local
efforts to protect local waterbodies and human health.
Proponents of H.R. 3898 contend that it will speed up jurisdic-
tional determinations and wetland permits following the U.S. Su-
preme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA. That decision severely re-
stricted what waters remain subject to CWA protection and is esti-
mated to have removed such protection on at least 50% of wetlands
and at least 60% of streams nationwide. Yet, section 17 seeks to,
again, redefine what waters and wetlands remain subject to federal
protection. When combined with the Trump Administration’s ef-
forts to redefine by rulemaking the scope of federally protected
waters and eliminate federal employees responsible for permitting
requirements, the net result will be more confusion and uncertainty
and longer wait times for necessary permits.
Congressional Republicans can claim, over and over, that they
support clean water and healthy communities; however, their sup-
port for this bill tells the real story. If Republicans were serious
about protecting our water resources, our families, and our water-
related economy, they would look comprehensively at the remain-
ing sources of impairment to our rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands,
and coastal areas, and take the necessary steps and make the nec-
essary investment to address these challenges. When Democrats
last controlled the U.S. House of Representatives, we not only en-
acted the single largest investment in wastewater infrastructure
ever through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but we initiated
efforts to repair the damage to the Clean Water Act caused by a
conservative Supreme Court and worked towards finally achieving
the elusive goal of ‘‘fishable and swimmable’’ waters for all Ameri-
cans.
The litany of loopholes, legal shields, and limited oversight con-
tained in H.R. 3898 are the opposite of what Congress needs to be
doing to protect our water resources. Exposing the waters and wet-
lands that remain under Clean Water Act protections to unre-
stricted and unchallengeable pollution or destruction will do noth-
ing to restore and maintain clean water.
During consideration of H.R. 3898, several Committee Democrats
sought to lessen the negative impacts of this legislation and require
EPA to verify that the changes in the bill would not adversely im-
pact the health, safety, and availability of clean water in commu-
nities nationwide.
Ranking Member Rick Larsen (WA–02) offered an amendment to
remove several provisions from the bill which undermine the ‘‘coop-
erative federalism’’ partnership the federal government has with
states and Tribes to protect against the pollution of local
waterbodies. The amendment would have restored the ability of
states and Tribes to make locally important decisions related to the
protection of locally important waterbodies. In many instances,
states are better suited to understand the unique needs, demands,
and importance on local waterbodies; this amendment would allow
states to continue to lead local efforts to protect clean water.

Representative Dina Titus (NV–01) offered an amendment to
highlight how the bill’s attempt to codify the draconian losses of
Clean Water Act protections from the Sackett decision will dis-
proportionately and adversely affect certain states. For example, in
the state of Nevada, the loss of Clean Water Act protections for
ephemeral streams will mean that close to 88 percent of the stream
miles covered before the Sackett decision will no longer be federally
protected.2 Similarly, under the most damaging scenario, 92 per-
cent of wetland area in the State of Washington has likely lost fed-
eral protection under the rationale of the Supreme Court and this
legislation.
Representatives Emilia Sykes (OH–13) and Shomari Figures
(AL–02) each offered an amendment to ensure that the loopholes,
legal shields, and limited oversight of polluters contained in H.R.
3898 do not disproportionately impact rural, economically-dis-
advantaged, and Tribal communities. Nine out of 10 Americans re-
ceive their drinking water from public water systems that rely on
a network of surface and subsurface waters to provide the water
entering our homes and businesses. The Sykes and Figures amend-
ments sought to prevent any increase in the volume, toxicity, or
concentration of pollution entering our waters and to prevent any
corresponding increase in local utility rates that would be required
to remove increased pollution levels caused by this bill. We cannot
continue to allow the economic and human health burdens of in-
creased pollution to be placed on those communities that are least
able to bear these burdens.
Representatives Hillary Scholten (MI–03), Laura Gillen (NY–04),
and Pat Ryan (NY–18) each offered an amendment to protect com-
munities, families, and individuals from increased exposure to pol-
lution that would result from the changes in H.R. 3898. The
Scholten amendment sought to retain existing Clean Water Act
protections for the use of pesticides that could adversely affect the
health of pregnant women, fetal development, infants, or children.
The Gillen amendment sought to protect communities and individ-
uals from the increased likelihood of exposure to chemicals and ma-
terials linked to cancer, such as PFAS, arsenic, nitrates, nitrites,
pesticides, chromium, radium, and uranium that would result from
the changes in this bill. The Ryan amendment delays the effective
date of the bill until the EPA Administrator determines that the
changes will not result in increased discharges of forever chemicals
(such as PFAS) or nutrients that cause harmful algal blooms. The
amendment would have ensured that communities are not left with
the environmental and economic burden of cleaning up and remov-
ing such pollutants.
Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet (MI–08) offered an
amendment that would protect the Great Lakes and other Clean
Water Act geographic programs from the potential for increased
discharges of pollution because of this bill. The Great Lakes are the
largest source of freshwater in the United States, containing 21
percent of the world’s surface freshwater by volume. This amend-
ment would prevent the changes contained in H.R. 3898 from re-

sulting in increased discharges of pollution to the Great Lakes, and
other critical regional waterbodies, which could degrade the
human, ecological, and economic health of the region that depends
on clean water.
Representative Laura Friedman (CA–30) offered an amendment
that sought to minimize the discharge of pollutants into
waterbodies that states, especially western states, are using to aug-
ment local water supplies through water recapture, water reuse
and recycling, and groundwater recharge. The availability of safe,
reliable, and affordable water is critical, not only to the survival of
life, but also to the economic health of communities and regions,
contributing to the success of industry, manufacturing, agriculture,
transportation, and recreation. This amendment would have en-
sured that forward-looking states and Tribes, which are rightly
preparing for the future through maximizing efforts to conserve,
reuse, and replenish every drop of water, are not hindered by in-
creased levels of pollution resulting from the changes in H.R. 3898.
Representative Nellie Pou (NJ–09) offered an amendment that
sought to prevent this bill from increasing the discharge of raw or
partially treated sewage into our waters. The Clean Water Act cur-
rently requires dischargers of wastewater to take every step pos-
sible to treat sewage before it is released into the environment.
H.R. 3898 would weaken those requirements, calling into question
whether polluters will still be required to implement treatment
technologies sufficient to prevent the discharge of raw or partially
treated sewage into our nation’s waters, especially if a polluter sug-
gests that such technologies are ‘‘too expensive’’ or ‘‘not commer-
cially available in the United States . . . at comparable scale.’’ The
Pou amendment would have prevented these new loopholes from
resulting in an increase in combined and sanitary sewer overflows
or an increase in the risk (and economic consequences) of flooding
associated with the discharge of increased volumes of industrial or
municipal stormwater.
The Clean Water Act has been an effective tool for improving the
health of our rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Unfortunately,
progress restoring impaired waterbodies has slowed and, in some
areas, reversed. Communities face new challenges from emerging
contaminants and impacts of climate change, and an increased
need for affordable federal assistance—especially rural, minority,
and economically-disadvantaged communities; yet the Trump Ad-
ministration proposes to decimate funding for federal and state
clean water agencies, as well as critical infrastructure funding for
communities of all sizes. An activist conservative court has reinter-
preted the CWA to protect significantly fewer waterbodies and pre-
vent fewer discharges of pollutants. Rather than address these
growing challenges to fishable and swimmable water for all Ameri-
cans, H.R. 3898 provides additional loopholes, legal shields, and
limited oversight for special interests and polluters.
In our view, this legislation is unnecessary, unwarranted, and a
dangerous attack on clean water nationwide. For these reasons, we
oppose H.R. 3898.

PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 3898, as amended, is to amend the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act to make targeted with respect to
waters of the United States, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary law governing water
quality of the Nation’s surface waters.1 Congress enacted the 1972
amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which is
commonly referred to as the CWA, with the objective to ‘‘restore
and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the
Nation’s waters.’’2
The CWA consists of two major parts: (1) the authorization of fi-
nancial assistance for construction of municipal wastewater treat-
ment plants, and (2) the regulatory requirements that apply to
those who discharge into navigable waters, including for industrial
and municipal actors.3 Planning, financial, and technical assistance
for various regions and issues are also addressed.4 Title III of the
CWA establishes the authority for the technological and water
quality-based effluent limitation guidelines that must be abided by
point source dischargers.5 Whereas Title III of the CWA largely fo-
cuses on the creation of water quality guidelines and limitations,
Title IV primarily deals with application of the regulatory program,

informed by the guidelines created pursuant to Title III, through
which dischargers must receive permits or certifications.6
In order to achieve its objectives, the CWA is predicated on the
principle that discharges into waters of the United States are only
lawful if authorized by a permit.7 Therefore, the application of var-
ious CWA components require a regulatory program. While certain
regulatory programs under the law may only be carried out by the
Federal Government, through either the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps), certain responsibilities can be assumed by states approved
by the EPA.8
Broadly, H.R. 3898, as amended, strives to once again find bal-
ance within the regulatory and permitting process originally envi-
sioned by the CWA by providing a comprehensive package of com-
monsense reforms to support energy producers, the agriculture sec-
tor, builders, and utilities. The bill includes necessary reforms to
promote regulatory efficiency, increase transparency, avoid frivo-
lous litigation, and protect and promote clean water, all while bal-
ancing states’ rights.
Prior to enactment of the CWA, water quality was seen as an
issue primarily concerning states and localities, except where inter-
state waters were concerned.9 As such, the CWA continued this rec-
ognition that states and localities play an essential role in main-
taining the quality of their own waters, rather than only the Fed-
eral Government.10 At the Federal level, EPA is the primary agen-
cy tasked with carrying out the CWA, while the Corps is also
tasked with certain responsibilities. Additionally, the various per-
mitting and environmental protection statutes in the CWA were
meant to be shared between the Federal Government and state and
local governments.11 The CWA is a law predicated on the principle
of cooperative Federalism, with the Federal Government and states
each playing a role in protecting water quality.
In keeping with the Federal-state goals of the CWA, Section 401
requires an applicant for a Federal license or permit that may re-
sult in a discharge into navigable waters to obtain a water quality
certification from the state or Tribe (or EPA, in the case of tribal
lands where a tribe has not been granted treatment as a state) in
which a discharge is to take place.12 The purpose of the water qual-
ity certification issued by the state or Tribe is to certify that any
discharges from a Federally permitted activity will comply with
certain water quality requirements of the CWA, including effluent
limitations and performance standards, water quality standards,
and toxic pretreatment standards.13
Examples of Federally licensed or permitted projects commonly
requiring water quality certification include those requiring dis-

charge permits under sections 402 and 404 of the CWA, or sections
9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, licenses from the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), bridge permits from the
Coast Guard, shoreline permits from the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity, and more.14 These statutes cover a wide variety of projects, in-
cluding hydropower projects, wastewater treatment plants, pipeline
projects, infrastructure development, mining projects, water re-
source development projects, and residential or commercial devel-
opment.15
Current implementation practices of section 401, however, have
been shaped by decades-worth of litigation and unclear guidance.
Until 2020, implementation regulations for section 401 published in
1971 were in effect.16 These regulations implemented the certifi-
cation provisions of section 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act of 1948, but EPA did not update the regulations to re-
flect the changes in the statutory text for nearly fifty years.17 Dur-
ing this time, many processes evolved in practice that were not re-
flected in the statute. H.R. 3898, as amended, codifies certain prac-
tices and clarifies others, to balance the role of state and Federal
Government, and provide certainty and predictability to permittees
and licensees that depend on a clear and useable 401 process.
In particular, some stakeholders have raised concerns that states
have misused the section 401 process, specifically weaponizing sec-
tion 401 to prevent important energy projects from obtaining cer-
tification and halting their progress in construction.18 For example,
some states have cited non-water quality related reasons in the 401
process to delay projects, expanded the scope of review beyond the
direct effects of a discharge, and circumvented the timelines set out
in statute.
In 2017, the Washington Department of Ecology denied water
quality certification with prejudice for a proposed energy export
terminal project, meaning that the applicants could not reapply in
the future. In doing so, the Department cited nine adverse impacts
for denial—air quality, vehicle transportation, noise and vibration,
social and community resources, rail transportation, rail safety,
vessel transportation, cultural resources, and tribal resources—
none of which affected water quality.19
In 2020, the New York Department of Environmental Protection
denied water quality certification to a proposed natural gas pipe-
line expansion project into Raritan Bay, despite FERC in 2019 de-
termining that with project proponent’s ‘‘plan of impact avoidance,
minimization and mitigation measures . . . all project effects
would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.’’20

The State of Oregon delayed a proposed LNG export terminal by
requesting more information from project proponents before even-
tually denying certification.21 By citing the need for additional in-
formation, the state was able to argue that the one-year ‘‘shot
clock’’ for review of a request for certification should start over once
a request is resubmitted.22
In California, some hydropower relicensing projects have been
delayed for decades due to the State’s various attempts to cir-
cumvent the one-year timeline for review. For example, at a Water
Resources and Environment Subcommittee hearing in February
2025, the Committee received testimony for the record from the
Modesto Irrigation District and Turlock Irrigation District that ex-
plained the State ‘‘has abused and expanded this opportunity,
using it not as the opportunity to ensure that any federally author-
ized discharge complies with applicable water quality, but rather
as an opportunity to seize control and oversight of the [Don Pedro
irrigation] Project as a whole to achieve policy goals that are often
only tangentially related to water quality and which have nothing
to do with the licensed activity itself.’’23
Section five of H.R. 3898, as amended, aims to mitigate the prob-
lems of permitting uncertainty and weaponization of Section 401
under the CWA. This section promotes the development of the Na-
tion’s energy infrastructure and myriad other projects by clarifying
the scope of review to include only water quality reasons from the
discharge at issue, defines what is required to be included in a re-
quest for certification, codifies what actions states may take after
receipt of a request for certification, and clarifies the entity in
charge of enforcing conditions added in through the 401 process.
Another key aspect of the CWA’s framework of cooperative Fed-
eralism is the ability for States to carry out the permitting pro-
grams set up by sections 402 and 404 of the CWA. While 47 states
have assumed the ability to carry out the National Pollution Dis-
charge Elimination System (NPDES) programs under section 402,
only two states (Michigan and New Jersey) have been delegated
authority to administer their own 404 dredge and fill programs.24
Florida had begun administering its own 404 permitting program
after the program was approved in December 2020; currently, how-
ever, the program has been divested of its authority due to a Fed-
eral judicial order.25 Other states have acknowledged interest in
implementing their own 404 program, but concerns about taking on
the costs of running such a program are often a barrier.26

Sections 14 and 16 of H.R. 3898, as amended, are focused on pro-
viding clarity to the process of state assumption of dredge and fill
permitting under section 404 of the CWA. Section 16 requires EPA
to complete a review of the applicable regulations to state assump-
tion of the section 404 program and implement revisions necessary
to encourage state assumption. Section 14 establishes a deadline
relating to EPA’s review of a state’s application to assume section
404 permitting. Section 20 of H.R. 3898, as amended, encourages
states with delegated permitting authorities under the CWA to uti-
lize the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council to im-
prove coordination across relevant Federal and state agencies. In
general, H.R. 3898, as amended, furthers the goals of cooperative
Federalism that the CWA is based upon by encouraging states to
take the lead in administering CWA permits.
Furthermore, CWA section 303(c) directs states to adopt water
quality standards (WQS) for navigable waters. The EPA is charged
with approving the state-developed standards. WQS serve as the
basis for several CWA programs, including the development of total
maximum daily loads (TMDLs), certifications of Federal licenses
and permits under section 401, NPDES permits under section 402,
and dredge and fill permits under section 404.
Currently, CWA section 402(q) requires municipalities with com-
bined sewer overflows to develop long-term control plans (LTCPs)
to minimize or eliminate discharges. It also instructs states to re-
view and, as appropriate, modify existing WQS while municipali-
ties are developing and implementing LTCPs to support compliance
with the CWA. Those reviews, however, have largely not happened,
and despite municipalities investing millions of dollars in upgrad-
ing their facilities, many are no closer to being deemed in compli-
ance with the CWA.27 Many stakeholders have also raised concerns
about states developing WQS that are not attainable based on
available technology.28 For example, the State of Washington has
set WQS that are so low many industries are concerned they will
not be able to comply with the CWA.29
While the CWA protects ‘‘navigable waters,’’ which are broadly
defined in the CWA as the ‘‘waters of the United States, including
the territorial seas,’’30 the CWA does not further define the term
‘‘waters of the United States’’ (WOTUS). Ultimately, the CWA
grants authority to the EPA and the Corps to implement the CWA,
and EPA and the Corps have promulgated several sets of rules de-
fining WOTUS as it governs the scope of CWA authority. There has
been a substantial amount of regulation and litigation in the Fed-
eral Courts on the scope of CWA jurisdiction over the years, includ-
ing multiple United States Supreme Court cases. In May 2023, the
Supreme Court concluded in Sackett v. EPA (Sackett) that the
CWA’s jurisdiction encompasses waters that are ‘‘relatively perma-
nent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water ‘forming geo-
graphical features’ that are described in ordinary parlance as

‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.’’’31 The Supreme Court also
held that jurisdictional wetlands ‘‘must be indistinguishably part of
a body of water that itself constitutes ‘waters’’ under the CWA.’’32
The recent Sackett decision provided additional direction on the
WOTUS definition, and therefore, the jurisdiction of the CWA.
However, the conforming rule issued by the EPA and the Corps
during the Biden Administration did not include or clarify certain
phrases and terms applied in Sackett. The Biden Administration
developed additional guidance to implement the ‘‘continuous sur-
face connection’’ test outlined by Sackett, while simultaneously
working through individual requests for CWA jurisdictional deter-
minations in light of the Sackett decision. However, many stake-
holders in the regulated community have raised concerns about the
slow pace at which the Biden Administration directed EPA and the
Corps to implement Sackett, as well as the lack of clear direction
the Biden Administration provided to the regulated public, even
through its supplemental guidance.
Although the Trump Administration is initiating a process to re-
vise the Biden rule and published updated implementation guid-
ance,33 the regulatory ambiguities following the Sackett decision
caused confusion in applying the rule, especially for Corps districts
who are tasked with issuing jurisdictional determinations (JDs),
which are generally required as part of the CWA section 404 per-
mit process.34 For example, the Army Corps of Engineers has re-
cently reported there are currently 3,588 pending JDs.35 This back-
log is delaying permits from moving forward that are critical to
building new roads, homes, and other important infrastructure
projects across the country. Because of this, section 17 of H.R.
3898, as amended, requires the Army Corps of Engineers to allo-
cate all necessary resources and staff to address the backlog of JDs.
Despite the continuously changing definition of a WOTUS, there
have been certain exclusions to the definition that have endured
both Democrat and Republican administrations for waste treat-
ment systems,36 ephemeral features,37 prior converted cropland,38
and groundwater.39 Section 18 of H.R. 3898, as amended, codifies
those exclusions into law, providing certainty and durability for the

36The waste treatment system exclusion, which includes features like treatment ponds and
lagoons that are intended to improve water quality, was first codified ion in 1979. This exclusion
was maintained by subsequent administrations, including the Biden Administration.
37Ephemeral features, which flow only in direct response to precipitation, have been consist-
ently excluded from the WOTUS definition. The Reagan and Bush Administrations generally
treated these features as non-jurisdictional, but the Obama Administration included some
ephemeral streams as jurisdictional, which was a flashpoint for litigation. The Trump Adminis-
tration explicitly excluded ephemeral features in their 2020 regulations, which was ultimately
maintained by the Biden Administration because of the Supreme Court ruling in Sackett.
38Prior Converted Cropland, which are wetlands that were converted to agricultural lands
and cultivated with a commodity crop prior to December 23, 1985, have been continuously ex-
cluded from the WOTUS definition since 1993.
39There has been increased interest from environmental organizations in making ground-
water jurisdictional under the CWA. However, the CWA is only authorized to regulate surface
waters.

regulated community who have utilized those exemptions for dec-
ades.
Section 402 of the CWA authorizes the National Pollutant Dis-
charge Elimination System (NPDES) program to regulate dis-
charges of pollutants from point sources into navigable waters.40
Point sources are defined as ‘‘any discernible, confined and discrete
conveyance, such as a pipe, ditch, channel, conduit, discrete fissure,
or container,’’41 and also include ‘‘vessels or other floating craft’’
from which pollutants may be discharged.42 Certain agriculture,
silviculture, and stormwater runoff are exempted from requiring a
NPDES permit.43 Sections 9 and 10 of H.R. 3898, as amended, fur-
ther clarifies these exemptions for agriculture runoff and aerial
fire-retardant, respectively, which have experienced legal uncer-
tainty over the last decade.
The CWA explicitly excludes ‘‘agricultural stormwater dis-
charges’’ and ‘‘return flows from irrigated agriculture’’ from the def-
inition of a point source, which means these discharges are not re-
quired to be regulated under the NPDES program.44 Despite this
clear exemption, in 2011, the EPA ordered a poultry farmer, Lois
Alt, in West Virginia to obtain a NPDES permit for stormwater
runoff from her farmyard, which is the area directly outside of the
poultry production house.45 The EPA claimed that chicken feath-
ers, manure, dander, and other debris that had been pushed out of
the poultry house through the ventilation system, and landed in
areas outside the poultry production houses, qualify as a discharge.
Ms. Alt challenged this order, and the United States Court for the
Northern District of West Virginia ruled against EPA in 2013, re-
jecting its argument that the CWA regulates ordinary stormwater
runoff from non-production areas at livestock or poultry farms.46
The EPA initially appealed the case, but it voluntarily withdrew
the appeal a few months later. In a public statement, the EPA stat-
ed that it ‘‘remains committed to working with the agricultural
community to ensure compliance with this legal requirement and
to pursue enforcement when necessary,’’47 indicating its intent to
circumvent the agricultural stormwater exemption in the CWA.
Section 9 of H.R. 3898, as amended, clarifies the scope of the agri-
culture stormwater exemption under the NPDES program to pre-
vent future EPA’s from unlawfully requiring agricultural oper-
ations from requiring a NPDES permit for stormwater discharges.
Conversely, the EPA has historically not required a permit for
aerial fire-retardant discharges under the NPDES program. How-
ever, in October 2022, the Forest Service Employees for Environ-
mental Ethics (FSEEE) brough suit against the United States For-
est Service (USFS) for discharging aerially deployed fire retardant
into navigable waters without a NPDES permit, in violation of the

CWA.48 The United States District Court for the District of Mon-
tana subsequently granted, in part, FSEEE’s motion for summary
judgement on the basis that USFS had violated the CWA for the
discharge of aerial fire retardant without a NPDES permit and re-
quired the EPA to work with USFS to develop a permit.49 Section
10 of H.R. 3898, as amended, clarifies that aerially discharged fire-
retardant does not require a NPDES permit.
Similarly, for more than three decades following the enactment
of the CWA, EPA did not consider registered pesticides used in
compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA) as pollutants that required additional permits through
the NPDES program, formalized in a 2006 Rule promulgated by
EPA.50 However, in 2009, the United States Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals held in National Cotton Council, et al, v. EPA, that the
final rule was not a reasonable interpretation of the CWA and va-
cated the rule.51 The court held that NPDES permits are required
for the application of biological pesticides or the application of
chemical pesticides that leave a residue in water when such appli-
cations are made to, or conveyed into, a WOTUS.52
Concerns were raised at the time of the National Cotton Council
case that requiring additional regulation of pesticides under the
CWA would create a duplicative permitting process without pro-
viding any additional health benefits. For example, then-Secretary
of Agriculture Tom Vilsack wrote to then-EPA Administrator Lisa
Jackson, stating, ‘‘subjecting FIFRA-compliant pesticides to the ad-
ditional regulatory regime of the CWA is duplicative and will not
help protect the environment.’’53 Section 11 of H.R. 3898, as
amended, restores EPA’s longstanding interpretation that FIFRA-
compliant pesticides do not require a duplicative permitting process
through the NPDES program.
Since all point source dischargers are subject to the NPDES pro-
gram, a total of more than 65,000 industrial and municipal conven-
tional dischargers are required to obtain permits pursuant to sec-
tion 402.54 In addition, NPDES permits are required for
stormwater discharges from industrial and municipal sources, in-
cluding over 150,000 individual sources.55 NPDES permits require
the point source to attain technology-based effluent limits, while
specifying the numerical effluent limitations that sources must
meet in order to guarantee water quality where possible, and a
deadline for compliance.56 Point sources may, in some instances,

apply for a NPDES general permit as opposed to a NPDES indi-
vidual permit. An individual NPDES permit is written for site-spe-
cific discharges that are unique to a specific location or discharge.57
Currently, general and individual NPDES permits are issued for
up to five years and must be renewed thereafter if discharges con-
tinue.58 However, if the permittee provides a complete application,
but is not reissued a permit prior the date of expiration, the permit
may be ‘‘administratively continued.’’59 Permit applications are
considered backlogged for new applications if they are not issued
or denied within 365 days of receipt, and for extensions if they are
administratively continued for 180 days or more.60 H.R. 3898, as
amended, seeks to provide more certainty for all NPDES permit
holders. Section 7 authorizes NPDES permits to be issued for up
to ten years, and Section 7 requires EPA to provide two-year notice
to general permit holders if that permit will not be renewed and
allows the permit to continue past its expiration date if two-year
notice is not provided to the permit holder.
Under section 304(a) of the CWA, the EPA is required to develop,
publish, and, from time to time, revise criteria for water quality.
These criteria serve as recommendations to states for defining am-
bient surface water conditions of a water body to protect against
adverse effects to aquatic life and human health.61 These criteria
are often adopted by states and help inform the development of
water quality-based effluent limits included in NPDES permits.62
Currently, the EPA voluntarily accepts comments on proposed cri-
teria under 304(a) and subjects them to review from its own
Science Advisory Board. In a hearing before the Subcommittee on
May 16, 2023, a witness representing the National Association of
Clean Water Agencies, Mickey Conway, Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) of Metro Water Recovery in Denver, CO, testified, ‘‘[a]s utili-
ties face complex and costly infrastructure challenges over the next
fifty years, it is critical that the limits imposed in NPDES permits
be based on the best available science and a complete record, not
political whim or expedience.’’63 Section 3 of H.R. 3898, as amend-
ed, increases the transparency of the process of creating limits for
NPDES permits by requiring that water quality criteria are devel-
oped through an official rulemaking, which allows outside com-
ments made by stakeholders, experts, and others, to be considered.
It also ensures that the rulemaking is subject to limited judicial re-
view.
The CWA provides for two types of general limits on pollution
discharges—a technology-based limit (TBEL) and a more-stringent
water quality-based limit (WQBEL) when technology-based limits
alone, are insufficient to address local water quality concerns. Per-
mit writers must consider the potential impact of every proposed

surface water discharge on the quality of the receiving water. If
TBELs are not sufficient to meet the water quality standards in
the receiving water, the CWA (section 303(b)(1)(B)) and NPDES
regulations (40 C.F.R. 122.44(d)) require that the permit writer de-
velop more stringent, water quality-based effluent limits
(WQBELs).64
TBELs for industrial dischargers reflect effluent limitation guide-
lines (ELGs). ELGs are technology-based, wastewater discharge
standards that are developed by the EPA on an industry-by-indus-
try basis. ELGs are intended to represent the greatest pollutant re-
ductions that are economically achievable for an industry and are
based on available technologies.65 Since 1972, EPA has promul-
gated ELGs for 59 industrial categories, including the steam elec-
tric power industry—which covers power plants that use nuclear or
fossil fuels to generate steam used to produce electricity.66 Some
have raised concerns that the technologies used to develop the ELG
for steam electric power under the Biden Administration was based
on data from foreign countries, including China.67 Section 4 of H.R.
3898, as amended, requires ELGs to be based on technology that
is commercially available in the United States that has also been
demonstrated at an applicable scale.
Section 402(k) of the CWA provides a ‘‘permit shield’’ for permit
holders.68 Under this provision, if a permittee is in compliance with
its NPDES permit terms, they are shielded from enforcement ac-
tion from agencies and third parties. The United States Supreme
Court has held that this permit shield serves to ‘‘insulate permit
holders from changes in various regulations during the period of a
permit and to relieve permit holders of having to litigate the ques-
tion of whether their permits are sufficiently strict. In short, sec-
tion 402(k) serves the purpose of giving permits finality.’’69
Some permit holders contend that permit writers are inappropri-
ately incorporating generic requirements within NPDES permits as
enforceable effluent limitations, which have attracted legal chal-
lenges. For example, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
(SFPUC) sued the EPA for requiring their NPDES permit to in-
clude broad language outside of clear effluent limitations man-
dating their discharges to not ‘‘cause or contribute to the violation
of water quality standards.’’70
In March 2025, the Supreme Court held in City and County of
San Francisco v. Environmental Protection Agency that the CWA
allows EPA to issue permits that limit a permitholder’s discharges
and that these ‘‘end-result’’ requirements, routinely imposed in
NPDES permits through generic language, were inconsistent with
the CW.71 Specifically, the court stated: ‘‘[W]e hold that

§1311(b)(1)(C) does not authorize the EPA to include ‘‘end-result’’
provisions in NPDES permits. Determining what steps a permittee
must take to ensure that water quality standards are met is the
EPA’s responsibility, and Congress has given it the tools needed to
make that determination. If the EPA does what the CWA demands,
water quality will not suffer.’’72
Section 8 of H.R. 3898, as amended, would reaffirm the Supreme
Court’s ruling in San Francisco v. EPA and clarify the scope of the
permit shield as outlined by a 1994 EPA policy guidance docu-
ment.73 The 1994 guidance specified that permittees are shielded
from liability under lawful NPDES permits for (1) pollutants spe-
cifically limited in a permit; (2) pollutants specifically identified as
present in a permit; or (3) pollutants not specifically identified as
present, but which are constituents of operations or processes that
are specifically identified in a permit.74 It also requires permit
writers to include specific information on the pollutant limitation,
therefore reducing ambiguity and the use of generic language in
NPDES permits.
A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is often referred to as a
‘‘pollution diet’’ and is defined as the ‘‘calculation of the maximum
amount of a pollutant allowed to enter a waterbody so that the
waterbody will meet and continue to meet water quality standards
for that particular pollutant’’.75 In waters where industrial and mu-
nicipal sources have achieved TBELs, but WQS have not been met,
dischargers may be required to meet additional pollution control re-
quirements through a TMDL, which can impact both point source
and non-point source dischargers.76 The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is
the largest, most comprehensive TMDL developed by EPA. It en-
compasses 64,000 square miles across six states and the District of
Columbia.77
EPA established the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010 pursuant to
consent decrees resolving litigation over impairment of waters in
Virginia and the District of Columbia, following years of voluntary
and cooperative measures taken amongst states within the Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed.78 The TMDL set two broad goals: an interim
goal of having 60 percent of pollution control measures needed to
attain water quality standards in place by 2017 and a final goal of
having 100 percent of the measures in place by 2025.79 Litigation
has taken place over the last fifteen years against the EPA for the
implementation of the TMDL, as well as against certain Bay
states—Pennsylvania in particular—due to concerns surrounding
implementation. Section 21 of H.R. 3898, as amended, expresses
that it’s the sense of Congress that the EPA should take a collabo-
rative and cooperative approach in working with the states and the

District of Columbia to achieve compliance with the Chesapeake
Bay TMDL.
Section 404 of the CWA authorizes a separate type of permit re-
quired to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters.
Activities covered under the section 404 program include those as-
sociated with pipeline projects; water resources projects such as
levees and dams; mining projects such as those for critical min-
erals; infrastructure development such as highways and airports;
and other development.80 Some activities are exempt from section
404 permitting requirements, such as certain farming and forestry
activities.81
Pursuant to section 404, the Corps issues two types of permits:
general and individual. The CWA authorizes the issuance of gen-
eral permits for discharges that are ‘‘similar in nature, will cause
only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed sepa-
rately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the
environment’’82 and are issued on a Nationwide, regional, or state
basis for particular categories of activities.83 Nationwide Permits
(NWPs) and Regional General Permits are issued by the Corps on
a National basis and are designed to ‘‘enhance regulatory efficiency
and provide clarity for the regulated public without decreasing en-
vironmental protections.’’84 The most recent reissuance of NWPs
went into effect in February 2022, covering 59 distinct activity cat-
egories, including mooring buoys, residential developments, utility
lines, road crossings, and mining activities.85 On June 18, 2025,
the Corps released a proposed rule titled ‘‘Proposal to Reissue and
Modify Nationwide Permits’’.86 Similar to other permits, NWPs are
often subject to litigation.87 Section 13 of H.R. 3898, as amended,
would, in effect, codify the current process followed by the Corps
in relation to its NWP program. The section also establishes min-
imum acreage requirements for all NWPs.
Section 404 also authorizes the EPA to restrict, prohibit, deny,
or withdraw the specification by the Corps of a site for the dis-
charge of dredged or fill material, if the agency determines that the
discharge will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal
water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or rec-
reational areas.88 Section 404(c) is commonly referred to as the
EPA’s ‘‘veto authority.’’ Since the CWA’s enactment, the EPA has
issued fourteen section 404(c) determinations, most recently for the
Pebble Deposit Area in Alaska.89 Concerns have been raised about
the EPA’s use of the 404(c) authority to retroactively issue a veto

after a project has received a permit or preemptively veto a project
before an application for a 404 permit is filed.
For example, in 2007, the Corps issued a permit for Spruce No.
1 Mine located in Logan Co., West Virginia. After a change in Ad-
ministration and legal action delaying the beginning of construc-
tion, the EPA vetoed the permit retroactively in 2011.90 In January
2023, the EPA preemptively vetoed a Section 404 permit for mine
development at the Pebble Deposit Area in Bristol Bay, Alaska.
This determination was made without an active section 404 permit
and based on Pebble Limited Partnership’s mine plan from 2020.91
Section 12 of H.R. 3898, as amended, would only permit the EPA
to issue a veto when there is an active application for a Section 404
permit, providing more certainty to permit seekers and holders, as
well as permitted projects. This legislation would not have any ret-
roactive impact on projects that have already underwent a veto
process.
In addition to the EPA’s veto authority, the Administrative Pro-
cedure Act provides a six-year statute of limitations for challenges
to section 404 permits, which provides third parties an opportunity
to legally challenge the issuance of a permit.92 This six-year win-
dow for legal action has caused project delays, added costs, and cre-
ated uncertainty for permit seekers, as well as for the Federal Gov-
ernment. Mr. Noah Hanners, on behalf of the National Association
of Manufacturers, at a Water Resources and Environment Sub-
committee Hearing in February 2025 stated:
‘‘Limiting the timeline for judicial review and supporting the
permit shield will cut down on unnecessary litigation that
delays projects and adds costs. Reasonable restrictions to the
EPA’s authority under Section 404(c) of the CWA to prohibit
areas as disposal sites—limiting retroactive vetoes of permits—
will likewise increase confidence in the permitting process.’’93
Section 15 of H.R. 3898, as amended, would apply a 60-day stat-
ute of limitations to Section 404 individual permits and general
permit verifications, in addition to EPA’s approval of a state’s as-
sumption of the 404 permit program. If a court does identify com-
pliance issues with the underlying statute, the court would be re-
quired to remand the permit back to the agency with specific
timelines to take court-ordered action, generally within 180 days.
Section 19 of H.R. 3898, as amended, aims to better balance the
scales of regulation and financial resources for agricultural pro-
ducers under the CWA. Section 311(j)(1)(C) of the CWA directs the
Federal Government to establish procedures, methods, and equip-
ment requirements to prevent the discharge of oil and hazardous
substances, which EPA has done through various rules.94 Section

(WRRDA) set parameters for which farms require no certification,
self-certification, or certification from a professional engineer under
the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Rule,
based on storage size of individual tanks, aggregate storage
amounts, and history of discharges.95 Section 19 raises the thresh-
old for which farms require certification under which category, al-
lowing more farmers to take responsibility, rather than forcing
them to hire the services of certified professional engineers.

the Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Con-
gressional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this legislation is to provide regulatory and judicial
certainty for regulated entities and communities, increase trans-
parency, and promote water quality, and for other purposes.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
3898, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the
Federal government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

TITLE III—STANDARDS AND ENFORCEMENT
* * * * * * *
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
SEC. 303. (a)(1) In order to carry out the purpose of this Act, any
water quality standard applicable to interstate waters which was
adopted by any State and submitted to, and approved by, or is
awaiting approval by, the Administrator pursuant to this Act as in
effect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, shall remain in
effect unless the Administrator determined that such standard is
not consistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in ef-
fect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. If the Adminis-
trator makes such a determination he shall, within three months
after the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, notify the State and specify the changes
needed to meet such requirements. If such changes are not adopted
by the State within ninety days after the date of such notification,
the Administrator shall promulgate such changes in accordance
with subsection (b) of this section.
(2) Any State which, before the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, has adopted,
pursuant to its own law, water quality standards applicable to
intrastate waters shall submit such standards to the Administrator
within thirty days after the date of enactment of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Each such standard
shall remain in effect, in the same manner and to the same extent
as any other water quality standard established under this Act un-
less the Administrator determines that such standard is incon-
sistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in effect im-
mediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pol-
lution Control Act Amendments of 1972. If the Administrator
makes such a determination he shall not later than the one hun-
dred and twentieth day after the date of submission of such stand-
ards, notify the State and specify the changes needed to meet such
requirements. If such changes are not adopted by the State within
ninety days after such notification, the Administrator shall promul-
gate such changes in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.
(3)(A) Any State which prior to the date of enactment of the Fed-
eral Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 has not
adopted pursuant to its own laws water quality standards applica-
ble to intrastate waters shall, not later than one hundred and
eighty days after the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act Amendments of 1972, adopt and submit such
standards to the Administrator.
(B) If the Administrator determines that any such standards are
consistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in effect
immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, he shall approve such
standards.

(C) If the Administrator determines that any such standards are
not consistent with the applicable requirements of this Act as in ef-
fect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, he shall, not
later than the ninetieth day after the date of submission of such
standards, notify the State and specify the changes to meet such
requirements. If such changes are not adopted by the State within
ninety days after the date of notification, the Administrator shall
promulgate such standards pursuant to subsection (b) of this sec-
tion.
(b)(1) The Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish pro-
posed regulations setting forth water quality standards for a State
in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Act as in ef-
fect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, if—
(A) the State fails to submit water quality standards within
the times prescribed in subsection (a) of this section,
(B) a water quality standard submitted by such State under
subsection (a) of this section is determined by the Adminis-
trator not to be consistent with the applicable requirements of
subsection (a) of this section.
(2) The Administrator shall promulgate any water quality stand-
ard published in a proposed regulation not later than one hundred
and ninety days after the date he publishes any such proposed
standard, unless prior to such promulgation, such State has adopt-
ed a water quality standard which the Administrator determines to
be in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.
(c)(1) øThe Governor of a State¿ (A) The Governor of a State or
the State water pollution control agency of such State shall from
time to time (but at least once each three year period beginning
with the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972) hold public hearings for the purpose of
reviewing applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate,
modifying and adopting standards. øResults of such review shall be
made available to the Administrator.¿
(B) Reviews under this paragraph shall include review, for pur-
poses of ensuring that combined sewer overflow controls are cost ef-
fective, of any water quality standard applicable to a body of water
into which, pursuant to a permit, order, or decree issued pursuant
to this Act, a municipal combined storm and sanitary sewer dis-
charges.
(C) Results of each review under this paragraph shall be made
available to the Administrator.
(2)(A) Whenever the State revises or adopts a new standard, such
revised or new standard shall be submitted to the Administrator.
Such revised or new water quality standard shall consist of the
designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the water
quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses. Such stand-
ards shall be such as to protect the public health or welfare, en-
hance the quality of water and serve the purposes of this Act. Such
standards shall be established taking into consideration (I) their
use and value for public water supplies, propagation of fish and
wildlife, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial, and
other purposesø, and also taking into consideration¿; (ii) their use
and value for navigation; and (iii) the cost and commercial avail-

ability in the United States of treatment technologies (including
whether the technologies have been demonstrated at an applicable
scale) that may be required to be applied to point sources in order
to result in compliance with such standards.
(B) Whenever a State reviews water quality standards pursuant
to paragraph (1) of this subsection, or revises or adopts new stand-
ards pursuant to this paragraph, such State shall adopt criteria for
all toxic pollutants listed pursuant to section 307(a)(1) of this Act
for which criteria have been published under section 304(a), the
discharge or presence of which in the affected waters could reason-
ably be expected to interfere with those designated uses adopted by
the State, as necessary to support such designated uses. Such cri-
teria shall be specific numerical criteria for such toxic pollutants.
Where such numerical criteria are not available, whenever a State
reviews water quality standards pursuant to paragraph (1), or re-
vises or adopts new standards pursuant to this paragraph, such
State shall adopt criteria based on biological monitoring or assess-
ment methods consistent with information published pursuant to
section 304(a)(8). Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit
or delay the use of effluent limitations or other permit conditions
based on or involving biological monitoring or assessment methods
or previously adopted numerical criteria.
(3) If the Administrator, within sixty days after the date of sub-
mission of the revised or new standard, determines that such
standard meets the requirements of this Act, such standard shall
thereafter be the water quality standard for the applicable waters
of that State. If the Administrator determines that any such re-
vised or new standard is not consistent with the applicable require-
ments of this Act, he shall not later than the ninetieth day after
the date of submission of such standard notify the State and speci-
fy the changes to meet such requirements. If such changes are not
adopted by the State within ninety days after the date of notifica-
tion, the Administrator shall promulgate such standard pursuant
to paragraph (4) of this subsection.
(4) The Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish pro-
posed regulations setting forth a revised or new water quality
standard for the navigable waters involved—
(A) if a revised or new water quality standard submitted by
such State under paragraph (3) of this subsection for such
waters is determined by the Administrator not to be consistent
with the applicable requirements of this Act, or
(B) in any case where the Administrator determines that a
revised or new standard is necessary to meet the requirements
of this Act.
The Administrator shall promulgate any revised or new standard
under this paragraph not later than ninety days after he publishes
such proposed standards, unless prior to such promulgation, such
State has adopted a revised or new water quality standard which
the Administrator determines to be in accordance with this Act.
(d)(1)(A) Each State shall identify those waters within its bound-
aries for which the effluent limitations required by section
301(b)(1)(A) and section 301(b)(1)(B) are not stringent enough to
implement any water quality standard applicable to such waters.
The State shall establish a priority ranking for such waters, taking

into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made
of such waters.
(B) Each State shall identify those waters or parts thereof within
its boundaries for which controls on thermal discharges under sec-
tion 301 are not stringent enough to assure protection and propa-
gation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and
wildlife.
(C) Each State shall establish for the waters identified in para-
graph (1)(A) of this subsection, and in accordance with the priority
ranking, the total maximum daily load, for those pollutants which
the Administrator identifies under section 304(a)(2) as suitable for
such calculation. Such load shall be established at a level necessary
to implement the applicable water quality standards with seasonal
variations and a margin of safety which takes into account any
lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between effluent lim-
itations and water quality.
(D) Each State shall estimate for the waters identified in para-
graph (1)(B) of this subsection the total maximum daily thermal
load required to assure protection and propagation of a balanced,
indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife. Such estimates
shall take into account the normal water temperatures, flow rates,
seasonal variations, existing sources of heat input, and the dissipa-
tive capacity of the identified waters or parts thereof. Such esti-
mates shall include a calculation of the maximum heat input that
can be made into each such part and shall include a margin of safe-
ty which takes into account any lack of knowledge concerning the
development of thermal water quality criteria for such protection
and propagation in the identified waters or parts thereof.
(2) Each State shall submit to the Administrator from time to
time, with the first such submission not later than one hundred
and eighty days after the date of publication of the first identifica-
tion of pollutants under section 304(a)(2)(D), for his approval the
waters identified and the loads established under paragraphs
(1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), and (1)(D) of this subsection. The Adminis-
trator shall either approve or disapprove such identification and
load not later than thirty days after the date of submission. If the
Administrator approves such identification and load, such State
shall incorporate them into its current plan under subsection (e) of
this section. If the Administrator disapproves such identification
and load, he shall not later than thirty days after the date of such
disapproval identify such waters in such State and establish such
loads for such waters as he determines necessary to implement the
water quality standards applicable to such waters and upon such
identification and establishment the State shall incorporate them
into its current plan under subsection (e) of this section.
(3) For the specific purpose of developing information, each State
shall identify all waters within its boundaries which it has not
identified under paragraph (1)(A) and (1)(B) of this subsection and
estimate for such waters the total maximum daily load with sea-
sonal variations and margins of safety, for those pollutants which
the Administrator identifies under section 304(a)(2) as suitable for
such calculation and for thermal discharges, at a level that would
assure protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous popu-
lation of fish, shellfish and wildlife.

(4) LIMITATIONS ON REVISION OF CERTAIN EFFLUENT LIMITA-
TIONS.—
(A) STANDARD NOT ATTAINED.—For waters identified
under paragraph (1)(A) where the applicable water quality
standard has not yet been attained, any effluent limitation
based on a total maximum daily load or other waste load
allocation established under this section may be revised
only if (i) the cumulative effect of all such revised effluent
limitations based on such total maximum daily load or
waste load allocation will assure the attainment of such
water quality standard, or (ii) the designated use which is
not being attained is removed in accordance with regula-
tions established under this section.
(B) STANDARD ATTAINED.—For waters identified under
paragraph (1)(A) where the quality of such waters equals
or exceeds levels necessary to protect the designated use
for such waters or otherwise required by applicable water
quality standards, any effluent limitation based on a total
maximum daily load or other waste load allocation estab-
lished under this section, or any water quality standard
established under this section, or any other permitting
standard may be revised only if such revision is subject to
and consistent with the antidegradation policy established
under this section.
(e)(1) Each State shall have a continuing planning process ap-
proved under paragraph (2) of this subsection which is consistent
with this Act.
(2) Each State shall submit not later than 120 days after the
date of the enactment of the Water Pollution Control Amendments
of 1972 to the Administrator for his approval a proposed continuing
planning process which is consistent with this Act. Not later than
thirty days after the date of submission of such a process the Ad-
ministrator shall either approve or disapprove such process. The
Administrator shall from time to time review each State’s approved
planning process for the purpose of insuring that such planning
process is at all times consistent with this Act. The Administrator
shall not approve any State permit program under title IV of this
Act for any State which does not have an approved continuing
planning process under this section.
(3) The Administrator shall approve any continuing planning
process submitted to him under this section which will result in
plans for all navigable waters within such State, which include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(A) effluent limitations and schedules of compliance at least
as stringent as those required by section 301(b)(1), section
301(b)(2), section 306, and section 307, and at least as strin-
gent as any requirements contained in any applicable water
quality standard in effect under authority of this section;
(B) the incorporation of all elements of any applicable
areawide waste management plans under section 208, and ap-
plicable basin plans under section 209 of this Act;

any water treatment processing;
(H) an inventory and ranking, in order of priority, of needs
for construction of waste treatment works required to meet the
applicable requirements of sections 301 and 302.
(f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any efflu-
ent limitation, or schedule of compliance required by any State to
be implemented prior to the dates set forth in sections 301(b)(1)
and 301(b)(2) nor to preclude any State from requiring compliance
with any effluent limitation or schedule of compliance at dates ear-
lier than such dates.
(g) Water quality standards relating to heat shall be consistent
with the requirements of section 316 of this Act.
(h) For the purposes of this Act the term ‘‘water quality stand-
ards’’ includes thermal water quality standards.

Administrator of new or revised water quality criteria
under section 304(a)(9), each State having coastal recre-
ation waters shall adopt and submit to the Administrator
new or revised water quality standards for the coastal
recreation waters of the State for all pathogens and patho-
gen indicators to which the new or revised water quality
criteria are applicable.
(2) FAILURE OF STATES TO ADOPT.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If a State fails to adopt water quality
criteria and standards in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)
that are as protective of human health as the criteria for
pathogens and pathogen indicators for coastal recreation
waters published by the Administrator, the Administrator
shall promptly propose regulations for the State setting
forth revised or new water quality standards for pathogens
and pathogen indicators described in paragraph (1)(A) for
coastal recreation waters of the State.
(B) EXCEPTION.—If the Administrator proposes regula-
tions for a State described in subparagraph (A) under sub-
section (c)(4)(B), the Administrator shall publish any re-
vised or new standard under this subsection not later than
42 months after the date of the enactment of this sub-
section.
(3) APPLICABILITY.—Except as expressly provided by this
subsection, the requirements and procedures of subsection (c)
apply to this subsection, including the requirement in sub-

(b) For the purpose of adopting or revising effluent limitations
under this Act the Administrator shall, after consultation with ap-
propriate Federal and State agencies and other interested persons,
publish within one year of enactment of this title, regulations, pro-
viding guidelines for effluent limitations, and, at least annually
thereafter, revise, if appropriate, such regulations. Such regula-
tions shall—
(1)(A) identify, in terms of amounts of constituents and
chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of the best practicable control technology currently avail-
able for classes and categories of point sources (other than pub-
licly owned treatment works); and
(B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining
the control measures and practices to be applicable to point
sources (other than publicly owned treatment works) within
such categories or classes. Factors relating to the assessment
of best practical control technology currently available to com-
ply with subsection (b)(1) of section 301 of this Act shall in-
clude consideration of the total cost of application of technology
in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved
from such application, and shall also take into account the age
of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the
engineering aspects of the application of various types of con-
trol techniques, process changes, non-water quality environ-
mental impact (including energy requirements), the commercial
availability in the United States of the technology (including
whether the technology has been demonstrated at an applicable
scale), and such other factors as the Administrator deems ap-
propriate;
(2)(A) identify, in terms of amounts of constituents and
chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of the best control measures and practices achievable in-
cluding treatment techniques, process and procedure innova-
tions, operating methods, and other alternatives for classes
and categories of point sources (other than publicly owned
treatment works); and
(B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining
the best measures and practices available to comply with sub-
section (b)(2) of section 301 of this Act to be applicable to any
point source (other than publicly owned treatment works) with-
in such categories or classes. Factors relating to the assess-
ment of best available technology shall take into account the
age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed,
the engineering aspects of the application of various types of
control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such
effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (in-
cluding energy requirements), the commercial availability in
the United States of the technology (including whether the tech-
nology has been demonstrated at an applicable scale), and such
other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate;

nate the discharge of pollutants from categories and classes of
point sources, taking into account the cost of achieving such
elimination of the discharge of pollutants; and
(4)(A) identify, in terms of amounts of constituents and
chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of pollutants,
the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the applica-
tion of the best conventional pollutant control technology (in-
cluding measures and practices) for classes and categories of
point sources (other than publicly owned treatment works);
and
(B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining
the best conventional pollutant control technology measures
and practices to comply with section 301(b)(2)(E) of this Act to
be applicable to any point source (other than publicly owned
treatment works) within such categories or classes. Factors re-
lating to the assessment of best conventional pollutant control
technology (including measures and practices) shall include
consideration of the reasonableness of the relationship between
the costs of attaining a reduction in effluents and the effluent
reduction benefits derived, and the comparison of the cost and
level of reduction of such pollutants from the discharge from
publicly owned treatment works to the cost and level of reduc-
tion of such pollutants from a class or category of industrial
sources, and shall take into account the age of equipment and
facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering as-
pects of the application of various types of control techniques,
process changes, non-water quality environmental impact (in-
cluding energy requirements), the commercial availability in
the United States of the technology (including whether the tech-
nology has been demonstrated at an applicable scale), and such
other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.
(c) The Administrator, after consultation, with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, shall issue to
the States and appropriate water pollution control agencies within
270 days after enactment of this title (and from time to time there-
after) information on the processes, procedures, or operating meth-
ods which result in the elimination or reduction of the discharge
of pollutants to implement standards of performance under section
306 of this Act. Such information shall include technical and other
data, including costs, as are available on alternative methods of
elimination or reduction of the discharge of pollutants. Such infor-
mation, and revisions thereof, shall be published in the Federal
Register and otherwise shall be made available to the public.

novative and alternative wastewater treatment processes and tech-
niques referred to in section 201(g)(5) of this Act.
(4) For the purposes of this subsection, such biological treatment
facilities as oxidation ponds, lagoons, and ditches and trickling fil-
ters shall be deemed the equivalent of secondary treatment. The
Administrator shall provide guidance under paragraph (1) of this
subsection on design criteria for such facilities, taking into account
pollutant removal efficiencies and, consistent with the objective of
the Act, assuring that water quality will not be adversely affected
by deeming such facilities as the equivalent of secondary treat-
ment.
(e) The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, may publish
regulations, supplemental to any effluent limitations specified
under subsections (b) and (c) of this section for a class or category
of point sources, for any specific pollutant which the Administrator
is charged with a duty to regulate as a toxic or hazardous pollutant
under section 307(a)(1) or 311 of this Act, to control plant site run-
off, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, and drainage from
raw material storage which the Administrator determines are asso-
ciated with or ancillary to the industrial manufacturing or treat-
ment process within such class or category of point sources and
may contribute significant amounts of such pollutants, to navigable
waters. Any applicable controls established under this subsection
shall be included as a requirement for the purposes of section 301,
302, 306, 307, or 403, as the case may be, in any permit issued to
a point source pursuant to section 402 of this Act.
(f) The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Fed-
eral and State agencies and other interested persons, shall issue to
appropriate Federal agencies, the States, water pollution control
agencies, and agencies designated under section 208 of this Act,

interstate water pollution control agency having jurisdiction over
the navigable waters at the point where the discharge originates or
will originate, that any such discharge will comply with the appli-
cable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of this Act.
In the case of any such øactivity¿ discharge for which there is not
an applicable effluent limitation or other limitation under sections
301(b) and 302, and there is not an applicable standard under sec-
tions 306 and 307, the State shall so certify, except that any such
certification shall not be deemed to satisfy section 511(c) of this
Act. Such State or interstate agency shall establish procedures for
public notice in the case of all øapplications¿ requests for certifi-
cation by it and, to the extent it deems appropriate, procedures for
public hearings in connection with specific øapplications¿ requests.
In any case where a State or interstate agency has no authority to
give such a certification, such certification shall be from the Ad-
ministrator. Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of
the PERMIT Act, each State and interstate agency that has author-
ity to give such a certification, and the Administrator, shall publish
requirements for certification to demonstrate to such State, such
interstate agency, or the Administrator, as the case may be, compli-
ance with the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306,
and 307. A decision to grant or deny a request for certification shall
be based only on compliance with the applicable provisions of sec-
tions 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307, and the grounds for the decision
shall be set forth in writing and provided to the applicant. Not later
than 90 days after receipt of a request for certification, the State,
interstate agency, or Administrator, as the case may be, shall iden-
tify in writing all specific additional materials or information nec-
essary for the request for certification to be complete, as described
in subsection (g). The State, interstate agency, or the Administrator,
as the case may be, may grant a request for certification with or
without conditions, deny a request for certification, or waive the re-
quirement for certification under this subsection with respect to
such Federal application. If the State, interstate agency, or Admin-
istrator, as the case may be, fails or refuses to øact on a request
for certification, within a reasonable period of time (which shall not
exceed one year) after receipt of such request, the certification re-
quirements of this subsection¿ grant the request for certification
with or without conditions, deny the request for certification, or
waive the requirement for certification under this subsection with
respect to such Federal application, within a reasonable period of
time to be determined by the licensing or permitting agency (which
shall not exceed one year) after receipt of such request, the require-
ment for certification under this subsection shall be waived with re-
spect to such Federal application. No license or permit shall be
granted until the certification required by this section has been ob-
tained or has been øwaived as provided in the preceding sentence¿
waived under this paragraph. No license or permit shall be granted
if certification has been denied by the State, interstate agency, or
the Administrator, as the case may be.

Whenever such a discharge may affect, as determined by the Ad-
ministrator, the quality of the waters of any other State, the Ad-
ministrator within thirty days of the date of ønotice of application
for such Federal license or permit¿ receipt of a notice under the pre-
ceding sentence shall so notify such other State, the licensing or
permitting agency, and the applicant. If the Administrator deter-
mines under the preceding sentence that such a discharge will not
affect the waters of any other State, no such notification is required.
If, within sixty days after receipt of such notification, such other
State determines that such discharge will affect the quality of its
waters so as to violate øany water quality requirement in such
State¿ any water quality standard in effect for the State under sec-
tion 303, and within such sixty-day period notifies the Adminis-
trator and the licensing or permitting agency in writing of its objec-
tion to the issuance of such license or permit and requests a public
hearing on such objection, the licensing or permitting agency shall
hold such a hearing at a time that is agreed to by such State and
the applicant. The Administrator shall at such hearing submit his
evaluation and recommendations with respect to any such objection
to the licensing or permitting agency. Such agency, based upon the
recommendations of such State, the Administrator, and upon any
additional evidence, if any, presented to the agency at the hearing,
shall condition such license or permit in such manner as may be
necessary to øinsure compliance with applicable water quality re-
quirements.¿ ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of

in connection with any other Federal license or permit required for
the operation of such facility unless, after notice to the certifying
State, agency, or Administrator, as the case may be, which shall be
given by the Federal agency to whom application is made for such
operating license or permit, the State, or if appropriate, the inter-
state agency or the Administrator, notifies such agency within sixty
days after receipt of such notice that there is no longer reasonable
assurance that øthere will be compliance¿ any such discharge will
comply with the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303,
306, and 307 of this Act because of changes since the construction
license or permit certification was issued in (A) the construction or
operation of the facility, (B) the characteristics of the waters into
which such discharge is made, (C) the water quality criteria appli-
cable to such waters or (D) applicable effluent limitations or other
requirements. This paragraph shall be inapplicable in any case
where the applicant for such operating license or permit has failed
to provide the certifying State, or, if appropriate, the interstate
agency or the Administrator, with notice of any proposed changes
in the construction or operation of the facility with respect to which
a construction license or permit has been granted, which changes
may result in violation of øsection¿ any applicable provision of sec-
tion 301, 302, 303, 306, or 307 of this Act.

(4) Prior to the initial operation of any federally licensed or per-
mitted facility or activity which may directly result in any dis-
charge into the navigable waters and with respect to which a cer-
tification has been obtained pursuant to paragraph (1) of this sub-
section, which facility or activity is not subject to a Federal oper-
ating license or permit, the licensee or permittee shall provide an
opportunity for such certifying State, or, if appropriate, the inter-
state agency or the Administrator to review the manner in which
the facility or activity shall be operated or conducted for the pur-
poses of assuring that øapplicable effluent limitations or other limi-
tations or other applicable water quality requirements will not be
violated¿ no applicable provision of section 301, 302, 303, 306, or
307 will be violated. Upon notification by the certifying State, or
if appropriate, the interstate agency or the Administrator that the
operation of any such federally licensed or permitted facility or ac-
tivity øwill violate applicable effluent limitations or other limita-
tions or other water quality requirements¿ will directly result in a
discharge that violates an applicable provision of section 301, 302,
303, 306, or 307, such Federal agency may, after public hearing,
suspend such license or permit. If such license or permit is sus-
pended, it shall remain suspended until notification is received
from the certifying State, agency, or Administrator, as the case
may be, that there is reasonable assurance that øsuch facility or
activity will not violate the applicable provisions¿ operation of such
facility or activity will not directly result in a discharge that vio-
lates any applicable provision of section 301, 302, 303, 306, or 307
of this Act.
(5) Any Federal license or permit with respect to which a certifi-
cation has been obtained under paragraph (1) of this subsection
may be suspended or revoked by the Federal agency issuing such
license or permit upon the entering of a judgment under this Act
that such facility or activity has been operated in violation of øthe
applicable provisions¿ any applicable provision of section 301, 302,
303, 306, or 307 of this Act.
(6) Except with respect to a permit issued under section 402 of
this Act, in any case where actual construction of a facility has
been lawfully commenced prior to April 3, 1970, no certification
shall be required under this subsection for a license or permit
issued after April 3, 1970, to operate such facility, except that any
such license or permit issued without certification shall terminate
April 3, 1973, unless prior to such termination date the person hav-
ing such license or permit submits to the Federal agency which
issued such license or permit a certification and otherwise meets
the requirements of this section.
(b) øNothing in this section¿ Except as provided in subsection (e),
nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
any department or agency pursuant to any other provision of law
to require compliance with any applicable water quality require-
ments. The Administrator shall, upon the request of any Federal
department or agency, or State or interstate agency, or applicant,
provide, for the purpose of this section, any relevant information on
applicable effluent limitations, or other limitations, standards, reg-
ulations, or requirements, or water quality criteria, and shall,
when requested by any such department or agency or State or
interstate agency, or applicant, comment on any methods to comply

retary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is au-
thorized, if he deems it to be in the public interest, to permit the
use of spoil disposal areas under his jurisdiction by Federal licens-
ees or permittees, and to make an appropriate charge for such use.
Moneys received from such licensees or permittees shall be depos-
ited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
(d) Any certification provided under this section shall set forth
any effluent limitations and other limitations, and monitoring re-
quirements necessary to assure that any øapplicant for a Federal
license or permit will comply with any applicable effluent limita-
tions and other limitations, under section 301 or 302 of this Act,
standard of performance under section 306 of this Act, or prohibi-
tion, effluent standard, or pretreatment standard under section 307
of this Act, and with any other appropriate requirement of State
law set forth in such certification, and shall become a condition on
any Federal license or permit subject to the provisions of this sec-
tion¿ discharge subject to this section will comply with the applica-
ble provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307, and any such
limitations or requirements shall be imposed by the licensing or per-
mitting agency as a condition on any Federal license or permit sub-
ject to the provisions of this section.
(e) Notwithstanding section 505, any condition imposed on a Fed-
eral license or permit by a licensing or permitting agency under this
section may be enforced only by such licensing or permitting agency.

NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM
SEC. 402. (a)(1) Except as provided in sections 318 and 404 of
this Act, the Administrator may, after opportunity for public hear-
ing, issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, or combina-
tion of pollutants, notwithstanding section 301(a), upon condition
that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable requirements
under sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, and 403 of this Act, or (B)
prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions relating to all
such requirements, such conditions as the Administrator deter-
mines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.
(2) The Administrator shall prescribe conditions for such permits
to assure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this
subsection, including conditions on data and information collection,
reporting, and such other requirements as he deems appropriate.
(3) The permit program of the Administrator under paragraph (1)
of this subsection, and permits issued thereunder, shall be subject
to the same terms, conditions, and requirements as apply to a
State permit program and permits issued thereunder under sub-
section (b) of this section.
(4) All permits for discharges into the navigable waters issued
pursuant to section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, shall be deemed
to be permits issued under this title, and permits issued under this
title shall be deemed to be permits issued under section 13 of the
Act of March 3, 1899, and shall continue in force and effect for
their term unless revoked, modified, or suspended in accordance
with the provisions of this Act.
(5) No permit for a discharge into the navigable waters shall be
issued under section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, after the date
of enactment of this title. Each application for a permit under sec-
tion 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, pending on the date of enact-
ment of this Act shall be deemed to be an application for a permit
under this section. The Administrator shall authorize a State,
which he determines has the capability of administering a permit
program which will carry out the objective of this Act, to issue per-
mits for discharges into the navigable waters within the jurisdic-
tion of such State. The Administrator may exercise the authority
granted him by the preceding sentence only during the period
which begins on the date of enactment of this Act and ends either
on the ninetieth day after the date of the first promulgation of

guidelines required by section 304(i)(2) of this Act, or the date of
approval by the Administrator of a permit program for such State
under subsection (b) of this section, whichever date first occurs,
and no such authorization to a State shall extend beyond the last
day of such period. Each such permit shall be subject to such condi-
tions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Act. No such permit shall issue if the Admin-
istrator objects to such issuance.
(6) GENERAL PERMITS.—
(A) PERMITS AUTHORIZED.—The Administrator may issue
general permits under this section on a State, regional, or
nationwide basis, or for a delineated area, for discharges
associated with any category of activities, which discharges
are of similar types and from similar sources.
(B) PERMIT EXPIRATION NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.—If
a general permit issued under this section will expire and
the Administrator decides not to issue a new general permit
for discharges similar to those covered by the expiring gen-
eral permit, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal
Register a notice of such decision at least two years prior
to the expiration of the general permit.
(C) APPLICATION OF PERMIT TERMS OF AN EXPIRED PER-
MIT.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—If a general permit issued under
this section expires and the Administrator has not pub-
lished a notice in accordance with subparagraph (B),
the Administrator shall, until the date described in
clause (ii)—
(I) continue to apply the terms, conditions, and
requirements of the expired general permit to any
discharge that was covered by the expired general
permit; and
(II) apply such terms, conditions, and require-
ments to any discharge that would have been cov-
ered by the expired general permit (in accordance
with any relevant requirements for such coverage)
if the discharge had occurred before such expira-
tion.
(ii) DATE DESCRIBED.—The date described in this
clause is the earlier of—
(I) the date on which the Administrator issues a
new general permit for discharges similar to those
covered by the expired general permit; or

which the Administrator publishes in the Federal
Register a notice of a decision not to issue a new
general permit for discharges similar to those cov-
ered by the expired general permit.
(b) At any time after the promulgation of the guidelines required
by subsection (i)(2) of section 304 of this Act, the Governor of each
State desiring to administer its own permit program for discharges
into navigable waters within its jurisdiction may submit to the Ad-
ministrator a full and complete description of the program it pro-
poses to establish and administer under State law or under an
interstate compact. In addition, such State shall submit a state-

ment from the attorney general (or the attorney for those State
water pollution control agencies which have independent legal
counsel), or from the chief legal officer in the case of an interstate
agency, that the laws of such State, or the interstate compact, as
the case may be, provide adequate authority to carry out the de-
scribed program. The Administrator shall approve each such sub-
mitted program unless he determines that adequate authority does
not exist:
(1) To issue permits which—
(A) apply, and insure compliance with, any applicable re-
quirements of sections 301, 302, 306, 307, and 403;
(B) are for fixed terms not exceeding øfive years¿ ten years;
and
(C) can be terminated or modified for cause including, but
not limited to, the following:
(i) violation of any condition of the permit;
(ii) obtaining a permit by misrepresentation, or failure to
disclose fully all relevant facts;
(iii) change in any condition that requires either a tem-
porary or permanent reduction or elimination of the per-
mitted discharge;
(D) control the disposal of pollutants into wells;
(2)(A) To issue permits which apply, and insure compliance with,
all applicable requirements of section 308 of this Act, or
(B) To inspect, monitor, enter, and require reports to at least the
same extent as required in section 308 of this Act;
(3) To insure that the public, and any other State the waters of
which may be affected, receive notice of each application for a per-
mit and to provide an opportunity for public hearing before a ruling
on each such application;
(4) To insure that the Administrator receives notice of each appli-
cation (including a copy thereof) for a permit;
(5) To insure that any State (other than the permitting State),
whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may sub-
mit written recommendations to the permitting State (and the Ad-
ministrator) with respect to any permit application and, if any part
of such written recommendations are not accepted by the permit-
ting State, that the permitting State will notify such affected State
(and the Administrator) in writing of its failure to so accept such
recommendations together with its reasons for so doing;
(6) To insure that no permit will be issued if, in the judgment
of the Secretary of the Army acting through the Chief of Engineers,
after consultation with the Secretary of the department in which
the Coast Guard is operating, anchorage and navigation of any of
the navigable waters would be substantially impaired thereby;
(7) To abate violations of the permit or the permit program, in-
cluding civil and criminal penalties and other ways and means of
enforcement;
(8) To insure that any permit for a discharge from a publicly
owned treatment works includes conditions to require the identi-
fication in terms of character and volume of pollutants of any sig-
nificant source introducing pollutants subject to pretreatment
standards under section 307(b) of this Act into such works and a
program to assure compliance with such pretreatment standards by
each such source, in addition to adequate notice to the permitting

any source which would be a new source as defined in section 306
if such source were discharging pollutants, (B) new introductions of
pollutants into such works from a source which would be subject
to section 301 if it were discharging such pollutants, or (C) a sub-
stantial change in volume or character of pollutants being intro-
duced into such works by a source introducing pollutants into such
works at the time of issuance of the permit. Such notice shall in-
clude information on the quality and quantity of effluent to be in-
troduced into such treatment works and any anticipated impact of
such change in the quantity or quality of effluent to be discharged
from such publicly owned treatment works; and
(9) To insure that any industrial user of any publicly owned
treatment works will comply with sections 204(b), 307, and 308.
(c)(1) Not later than ninety days after the date on which a State
has submitted a program (or revision thereof) pursuant to sub-
section (b) of this section, the Administrator shall suspend the
issuance of permits under subsection (a) of this section as to those
discharges subject to such program unless he determines that the
State permit program does not meet the requirements of subsection
(b) of this section or does not conform to the guidelines issued
under section 304(i)(2) of this Act. If the Administrator so deter-
mines, he shall notify the State of any revisions or modifications
necessary to conform to such requirements or guidelines.
(2) Any State permit program under this section shall at all
times be in accordance with this section and guidelines promul-
gated pursuant to section 304(i)(2) of this Act.
(3) Whenever the Administrator determines after public hearing
that a State is not administering a program approved under this
section in accordance with requirements of this section, he shall so
notify the State and, if appropriate corrective action is not taken
within a reasonable time, not to exceed ninety days, the Adminis-
trator shall withdraw approval of such program. The Administrator
shall not withdraw approval of any such program unless he shall
first have notified the State, and made public, in writing, the rea-
sons for such withdrawal.
(4) LIMITATIONS ON PARTIAL PERMIT PROGRAM RETURNS AND
WITHDRAWALS.—A State may return to the Administrator ad-
ministration, and the Administrator may withdraw under
paragraph (3) of this subsection approval, of—
(A) a State partial permit program approved under sub-
section (n)(3) only if the entire permit program being ad-
ministered by the State department or agency at the time
is returned or withdrawn; and
(B) a State partial permit program approved under sub-
section (n)(4) only if an entire phased component of the
permit program being administered by the State at the
time is returned or withdrawn.
(d)(1) Each State shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of
each permit application received by such State and provide notice
to the Administrator of every action related to the consideration of
such permit application, including each permit proposed to be
issued by such State.

section objects in writing to the issuance of such permit, or (B) if
the Administrator within ninety days of the date of transmittal of
the proposed permit by the State objects in writing to the issuance
of such permit as being outside the guidelines and requirements of
this Act. Whenever the Administrator objects to the issuance of a
permit under this paragraph such written objection shall contain a
statement of the reasons for such objection and the effluent limita-
tions and conditions which such permit would include if it were
issued by the Administrator.
(3) The Administrator may, as to any permit application, waive
paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(4) In any case where, after the date of enactment of this para-
graph, the Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this sub-
section, objects to the issuance of a permit, on request of the State,
a public hearing shall be held by the Administrator on such objec-
tion. If the State does not resubmit such permit revised to meet
such objection within 30 days after completion of the hearing, or,
if no hearing is requested within 90 days after the date of such ob-
jection, the Administrator may issue the permit pursuant to sub-
section (a) of this section for such source in accordance with the
guidelines and requirements of this Act.
(e) In accordance with guidelines promulgated pursuant to sub-
section (i)(2) of section 304 of this Act, the Administrator is author-
ized to waive the requirements of subsection (d) of this section at
the time he approves a program pursuant to subsection (b) of this
section for any category (including any class, type, or size within
such category) of point sources within the State submitting such
program.
(f) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing
categories of point sources which he determines shall not be subject
to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section in any State
with a program approved pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes
within any category of point sources.
(g) Any permit issued under this section for the discharge of pol-
lutants into the navigable waters from a vessel or other floating
craft shall be subject to any applicable regulations promulgated by
the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is oper-
ating, establishing specifications for safe transportation, handling,
carriage, storage, and stowage of pollutants.
(h) In the event any condition of a permit for discharges from a
treatment works (as defined in section 212 of this Act) which is
publicly owned is violated, a State with a program approved under
subsection (b) of this section or the Administrator, where no State
program is approved or where the Administrator determines pursu-
ant to section 309(a) of this Act that a State with an approved pro-
gram has not commenced appropriate enforcement action with re-
spect to such permit, may proceed in a court of competent jurisdic-
tion to restrict or prohibit the introduction of any pollutant into
such treatment works by a source not utilizing such treatment
works prior to the finding that such condition was violated.
(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the author-
ity of the Administrator to take action pursuant to section 309 of
this Act.

(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), compliance with
a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed com-
pliance, for purposes of sections 309 and 505, with sections
301, 302, 306, 307, and 403, except any standard imposed
under section 307 for a toxic pollutant injurious to human
health. Until December 31, 1974, in any case where a permit
for discharge has been applied for pursuant to this section, but
final administrative disposition of such application has not
been made, such discharge shall not be a violation of (1) sec-
tion 301, 306, or 402 of this Act, or (2) section 13 of the Act
of March 3, 1899, unless the Administrator or other plaintiff
proves that final administrative disposition of such application
has not been made because of the failure of the applicant to
furnish information reasonably required or requested in order
to process the application. For the 180-day period beginning on
the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, in the case of any point source dis-
charging any pollutant or combination of pollutants imme-
diately prior to such date of enactment which source is not
subject to section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, the discharge
by such source shall not be a violation of this Act if such a
source applies for a permit for discharge pursuant to this sec-
tion within such 180-day period.
(2) SCOPE.—For purposes of paragraph (1), compliance with
the conditions of a permit issued under this section shall be
considered compliance with respect to a discharge of—
(A) any pollutant for which an effluent limitation is in-
cluded in the permit; and
(B) any pollutant for which an effluent limitation is not
included in the permit that is—
(i) specifically identified as controlled or monitored
through indicator parameters in the permit, the fact
sheet for the permit, or the administrative record relat-
ing to the permit;
(ii) specifically identified during the permit applica-
tion process as present in discharges to which the per-
mit will apply; or
(iii) whether or not specifically identified in the per-
mit or during the permit application process—
(I) present in any waste streams or processes of
the point source to which the permit applies, which
waste streams or processes are specifically identi-
fied during the permit application process; or
(II) otherwise within the scope of any operations
of the point source to which the permit applies,
which scope of operations is specifically identified
during the permit application process.

posed entirely of return flows from irrigated agriculture, nor
shall the Administrator directly or indirectly, require any State
to require such a permit.
(2) STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM OIL, GAS, AND MINING OPER-
ATIONS.—The Administrator shall not require a permit under
this section, nor shall the Administrator directly or indirectly
require any State to require a permit, for discharges of
stormwater runoff from mining operations or oil and gas explo-
ration, production, processing, or treatment operations or
transmission facilities, composed entirely of flows which are
from conveyances or systems of conveyances (including but not
limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) used for col-
lecting and conveying precipitation runoff and which are not
contaminated by contact with, or do not come into contact with,
any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished
product, byproduct, or waste products located on the site of
such operations.
(3) SILVICULTURAL ACTIVITIES.—
(A) NPDES PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR SILVICULTURAL
ACTIVITIES.—The Administrator shall not require a permit
under this section nor directly or indirectly require any
State to require a permit under this section øfor a dis-
charge from¿ for—
(i) a discharge from runoff resulting from the con-
duct of the following silviculture activities conducted
in accordance with standard industry practice: nursery
operations, site preparation, reforestation and subse-
quent cultural treatment, thinning, prescribed burn-
ing, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, sur-
face drainage, or road construction and
maintenanceø.¿; or
(ii) a discharge resulting from the aerial application
of a product used for fire control and suppression pur-
poses that appears on the most current Forest Service
Qualified Products List (or any successor list).
(B) OTHER REQUIREMENTS.—Nothing in this paragraph
exempts a discharge from silvicultural activity from any
permitting requirement under section 404, existing permit-
ting requirements under section 402, or from any other
federal law.
(C) The authorization provided in Section 505(a) does
not apply to any non-permitting program established
under 402(p)(6) for the silviculture activities listed in
402(l)(3)(A), or to any other limitations that might be
deemed to apply to the silviculture activities listed in
402(l)(3)(A).
(4) AGRICULTURAL STORMWATER DISCHARGE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall not require a
permit, nor directly or indirectly require any State to re-
quire a permit, under this section for discharges of
stormwater, including from subsurface drainage, from agri-
cultural land that occur in direct response to a precipita-
tion event.
(B) AGRICULTURAL LAND DEFINED.—In this paragraph,
the term ‘‘agricultural land’’ includes—

(i) land on which an agricultural input (such as ma-
nure and other crop nutrients, crop protection, or seed)
is applied;
(ii) land on which animals (including fish and shell-
fish), crops (including fruit and nut trees), crop res-
idue, plants, seed, or vegetation are present for pur-
poses of farming or ranching; and
(iii) land that is—
(I) immediately adjacent to, and functionally re-
lated to, land described in clause (i) or (ii); and
(II) necessary to support agricultural production,
soil conservation, flood control, or water quality.
(m) ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT OF CONVENTIONAL POLLUTANTS
NOT REQUIRED.—To the extent a treatment works (as defined in
section 212 of this Act) which is publicly owned is not meeting the
requirements of a permit issued under this section for such treat-
ment works as a result of inadequate design or operation of such
treatment works, the Administrator, in issuing a permit under this
section, shall not require pretreatment by a person introducing con-
ventional pollutants identified pursuant to a section 304(a)(4) of
this Act into such treatment works other than pretreatment re-
quired to assure compliance with pretreatment standards under
subsection (b)(8) of this section and section 307(b)(1) of this Act.
Nothing in this subsection shall affect the Administrator’s author-
ity under sections 307 and 309 of this Act, affect State and local
authority under sections 307(b)(4) and 510 of this Act, relieve such
treatment works of its obligations to meet requirements established
under this Act, or otherwise preclude such works from pursuing
whatever feasible options are available to meet its responsibility to
comply with its permit under this section.
(n) PARTIAL PERMIT PROGRAM.—
(1) STATE SUBMISSION.—The Governor of a State may submit
under subsection (b) of this section a permit program for a por-
tion of the discharges into the navigable waters in such State.

this subsection shall cover, at a minimum, administration of a
major category of the discharges into the navigable waters of
the State or a major component of the permit program required
by subsection (b).
(3) APPROVAL OF MAJOR CATEGORY PARTIAL PERMIT PRO-
GRAMS.—The Administrator may approve a partial permit pro-
gram covering administration of a major category of discharges
under this subsection if—
(A) such program represents a complete permit program
and covers all of the discharges under the jurisdiction of
a department or agency of the State; and
(B) the Administrator determines that the partial pro-
gram represents a significant and identifiable part of the
State program required by subsection (b).
(4) APPROVAL OF MAJOR COMPONENT PARTIAL PERMIT PRO-
GRAMS.—The Administrator may approve under this subsection
a partial and phased permit program covering administration
of a major component (including discharge categories) of a
State permit program required by subsection (b) if—

(A) the Administrator determines that the partial pro-
gram represents a significant and identifiable part of the
State program required by subsection (b); and
(B) the State submits, and the Administrator approves,
a plan for the State to assume administration by phases
of the remainder of the State program required by sub-
section (b) by a specified date not more than 5 years after
submission of the partial program under this subsection
and agrees to make all reasonable efforts to assume such
administration by such date.
(o) ANTI-BACKSLIDING.—
(1) GENERAL PROHIBITION.—In the case of effluent limita-
tions established on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this sec-
tion, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified on
the basis of effluent guidelines promulgated under section
304(b) subsequent to the original issuance of such permit, to
contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the
comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit. In the
case of effluent limitations established on the basis of section
301(b)(1)(C) or section 303(d) or (e), a permit may not be re-
newed, reissued, or modified to contain effluent limitations
which are less stringent than the comparable effluent limita-
tions in the previous permit except in compliance with section
303(d)(4).
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—A permit with respect to which paragraph
(1) applies may be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a
less stringent effluent limitation applicable to a pollutant if—
(A) material and substantial alterations or additions to
the permitted facility occurred after permit issuance which
justify the application of a less stringent effluent limita-
tion;
(B)(i) information is available which was not available at
the time of permit issuance (other than revised regula-
tions, guidance, or test methods) and which would have
justified the application of a less stringent effluent limita-
tion at the time of permit issuance; or
(ii) the Administrator determines that technical mis-
takes or mistaken interpretations of law were made in
issuing the permit under subsection (a)(1)(B);
(C) a less stringent effluent limitation is necessary be-
cause of events over which the permittee has no control
and for which there is no reasonably available remedy;
(D) the permittee has received a permit modification
under section 301(c), 301(g), 301(h), 301(i), 301(k), 301(n),
or 316(a); or
(E) the permittee has installed the treatment facilities
required to meet the effluent limitations in the previous
permit and has properly operated and maintained the fa-
cilities but has nevertheless been unable to achieve the
previous effluent limitations, in which case the limitations
in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may reflect
the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall
not be less stringent than required by effluent guidelines
in effect at the time of permit renewal, reissuance, or
modification).

Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any revised waste load al-
locations or any alternative grounds for translating water qual-
ity standards into effluent limitations, except where the cumu-
lative effect of such revised allocations results in a decrease in
the amount of pollutants discharged into the concerned waters,
and such revised allocations are not the result of a discharger
eliminating or substantially reducing its discharge of pollut-
ants due to complying with the requirements of this Act or for
reasons otherwise unrelated to water quality.
(3) LIMITATIONS.—In no event may a permit with respect to
which paragraph (1) applies be renewed, reissued, or modified
to contain an effluent limitation which is less stringent than
required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time the permit
is renewed, reissued, or modified. In no event may such a per-
mit to discharge into waters be renewed, reissued, or modified
to contain a less stringent effluent limitation if the implemen-
tation of such limitation would result in a violation of a water
quality standard under section 303 applicable to such waters.
(p) MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER DISCHARGES.—
(1) GENERAL RULE.—Prior to October 1, 1994, the Adminis-
trator or the State (in the case of a permit program approved

system serving a population of 100,000 or more but less
than 250,000.
(E) A discharge for which the Administrator or the
State, as the case may be, determines that the stormwater
discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality
standard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to
waters of the United States.
(3) PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.—
(A) INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES.—Permits for discharges as-
sociated with industrial activity shall meet all applicable
provisions of this section and section 301.
(B) MUNICIPAL DISCHARGE.—Permits for discharges from
municipal storm sewers—
(i) may be issued on a system- or jurisdiction-wide
basis;
(ii) shall include a requirement to effectively pro-
hibit non-stormwater discharges into the storm sew-

(i) projects, including innovative projects, to reclaim,
recycle, or reuse water; and
(ii) green infrastructure.
(4) COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—A permit issued under this section
that incorporates an integrated plan may include a sched-
ule of compliance, under which actions taken to meet any
applicable water quality-based effluent limitation may be
implemented over more than 1 permit term if the schedule
of compliance—
(i) is authorized by State water quality standards;
and
(ii) meets the requirements of section 122.47 of title
40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the
date of enactment of this subsection).
(B) TIME FOR COMPLIANCE.—For purposes of subpara-
graph (A)(ii), the requirement of section 122.47 of title 40,
Code of Federal Regulations, for compliance by an applica-
ble statutory deadline under this Act does not prohibit im-
plementation of an applicable water quality-based effluent
limitation over more than 1 permit term.

standard after a use attainability analysis under section
131.10(g) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a suc-
cessor regulation), subject to the approval of the Adminis-
trator under section 303(c).
(6) CLARIFICATION OF STATE AUTHORITY.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Nothing in section 301(b)(1)(C) pre-
cludes a State from authorizing in the water quality stand-
ards of the State the issuance of a schedule of compliance
to meet water quality-based effluent limitations in permits
that incorporate provisions of an integrated plan.
(B) TRANSITION RULE.—In any case in which a discharge
is subject to a judicial order or consent decree, as of the
date of enactment of this subsection, resolving an enforce-
ment action under this Act, any schedule of compliance
issued pursuant to an authorization in a State water qual-
ity standard may not revise a schedule of compliance in
that order or decree to be less stringent, unless the order
or decree is modified by agreement of the parties and the
court.

(t) EXPRESSION OF WATER QUALITY-BASED EFFLUENT LIMITA-
TIONS.—If the Administrator (or a State, in the case of a permit pro-
gram approved by the Administrator) determines that a water qual-
ity-based limitation on a discharge of a pollutant is necessary to in-
clude in a permit under this section in addition to any appropriate
technology-based effluent limitations included in such permit, the
Administrator (or the State) may include such water quality-based
limitation in such permit only in the form of a limitation that—
(1) specifies the pollutant to which it applies; and
(2) clearly describes the manner in which compliance with the
limitation may be achieved, which shall include—
(A) a numerical limit on the discharge of such pollutant;
(B) a narrative description of required actions to be ap-
plied to the discharge (including any measures or practices
required to be applied); or

charge that specifies the level of control to be applied.
(u) DISCHARGES OF PESTICIDES.—
(1) NO PERMIT REQUIREMENT.—Except as provided in para-
graph (2), a permit shall not be required by the Administrator
or a State under this Act for a discharge from a point source
into navigable waters of a pesticide authorized for sale, dis-
tribution, or use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act, or the residue of such a pesticide, resulting
from the application of such pesticide.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the fol-
lowing discharges of a pesticide or pesticide residue:
(A) A discharge resulting from the application of a pes-
ticide in violation of a provision of the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that is relevant to pro-
tecting water quality, if—
(i) the discharge would not have occurred but for the
violation; or
(ii) the amount of pesticide or pesticide residue in the
discharge is greater than would have occurred without
the violation.
(B) Stormwater discharges subject to regulation under
subsection (p).
(C) The following discharges subject to regulation under

under this subsection, the Secretary shall publish the notice re-
quired by this subsection.
(b) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, each such disposal
site shall be specified for each such permit by the Secretary (1)
through the application of guidelines developed by the Adminis-
trator, in conjunction with the Secretary, which guidelines shall be
based upon criteria comparable to the criteria applicable to the ter-
ritorial seas, the contiguous zone, and the ocean under section
403(c), and (2) in any case where such guidelines under clause (1)
alone would prohibit the specification of a site, through the applica-
tion additionally of the economic impact of the site on navigation
and anchorage.
ø(c) The Administrator¿ (c) SPECIFICATION OR USE OF DEFINED
AREA.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator is authorized to prohibit
the specification (including the withdrawal of specification) of
any defined area as a disposal site, and he is authorized to
deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specification
(including the withdrawal of specification) as a disposal site,

graph (2) and after notice and opportunity for public hearings,
that the discharge of such materials into such area will have
an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies,
shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and
breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas. Before making
such determination, the Administrator shall consult with the
Secretary. The Administrator shall set forth in writing and
make public his findings and his reasons for making any deter-
mination under this subsection.
(2) PERIOD OF PROHIBITION.—The period during which the
Administrator may prohibit the specification (including the
withdrawal of specification) of any defined area as a disposal
site, or deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specifica-
tion (including the withdrawal of specification) as a disposal
site, under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) begin on the date on which an applicant submits all
the information required to complete an application for a
permit under this section; and

(1) PERMITS AUTHORIZED.—In carrying out his functions re-
lating to the discharge of dredged or fill material under this
section, the Secretary may, after notice and opportunity for
public hearing, issue general permits on a State, regional, or
nationwide basis for any category of activities involving dis-
charges of dredged or fill material if the Secretary determines
that the activities in such category are similar in nature, will
cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when per-
formed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative ad-
verse effect on the environment. Any general permit issued
under this subsection shall (A) be based on the guidelines de-
scribed in subsection (b)(1) of this section, and (B) set forth the

(2) TERM.—No general permit issued under this subsection
shall be for a period of more than øfive years¿ ten years after
the date of its issuance and such general permit may be re-
voked or modified by the Secretary if, after opportunity for
public hearing, the Secretary determines that the activities au-
thorized by such general permit have an adverse impact on the
environment or such activities are more appropriately author-
ized by individual permits.
(3) CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining the environmental ef-
fects of an activity under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary—
(A) shall consider only the effects of any discharge of
dredged or fill material resulting from such activity;
(B) shall consider any effects of a discharge of dredged
or fill material into less than 3 acres of navigable waters
to be a minimal adverse environmental effect; and
(C) may consider any effects of a discharge of dredged or
fill material into 3 acres or more of navigable waters to be
a minimal adverse environmental effect.
(4) NATIONWIDE PERMITS FOR LINEAR PROJECTS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of
this section, the Secretary shall maintain general permits

after the receipt of such comments from the Administrator, or after
such ninetieth day, whichever first occurs. Such State shall not
issue such proposed permit after such ninetieth day if it has re-
ceived such written comments in which the Administrator objects
(A) to the issuance of such proposed permit and such proposed per-
mit is one that has been submitted to the Administrator pursuant
to subsection (h)(1)(E), or (B) to the issuance of such proposed per-
mit as being outside the requirements of this section, including, but

(l) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing
categories of discharges which he determines shall not be subject

section. The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types,
and sizes within any category of discharges.
(m) Not later than the ninetieth day after the date on which the
Secretary notifies the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the
Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that (1) an
application for a permit under subsection (a) of this section has
been received by the Secretary, or (2) the Secretary proposes to
issue a general permit under subsection (e) of this section, the Sec-
retary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, shall submit any comments with

maximum extent practicable, duplication, needless paperwork, and
delays in the issuance of permits under this section. Such agree-
ments shall be developed to assure that, to the maximum extent
practicable, a decision with respect to an application for a permit
under subsection (a) of this section will be made not later than the
ninetieth day after the date the notice of such application is pub-
lished under subsection (a) of this section.

discharge, including consideration of the guidelines developed
under subsection (b)(1) of this section, is included in an environ-
mental impact statement for such project pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and such environmental impact
statement has been submitted to Congress before the actual dis-
charge of dredged or fill material in connection with the construc-
tion of such project and prior to either authorization of such project

shall bring a civil action in accordance with paragraph (3) of this
subsection.
(2) A copy of any order issued under this subsection shall be sent

section shall be by personal service and shall state with reasonable
specificity the nature of the violation, specify a time for compliance,
not to exceed thirty days, which the Secretary determines is rea-
sonable, taking into account the seriousness of the violation and
any good faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements. In
any case in which an order under this subsection is issued to a cor-
poration, a copy of such order shall be served on any appropriate
corporate officers.
(3) The Secretary is authorized to commence a civil action for ap-
propriate relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction for

a civil penalty the court shall consider the seriousness of the viola-
tion or violations, the economic benefit (if any) resulting from the

comply with the applicable requirements, the economic impact of
the penalty on the violator, and such other matters as justice may

MINORITY VIEWS
We oppose H.R. 3898. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the nation’s
bedrock environmental law for ‘‘restoring and maintaining the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.’’
H.R. 3898 defies the Act’s overarching intent to keep our nation’s
water clean, guts the authority of federal agencies to minimize the
impact that projects have on water resources, and undermines the
authority of states and Tribes to protect locally important
waterbodies.
This bill significantly restricts U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) oversight
and regulatory authorities under the Act, which, when paired with
the Trump Administration’s efforts to eviscerate federal funding
and purge agency personnel, will leave the federal agencies power-
less to fulfill their responsibilities under the law. This bill also un-
dermines the ‘‘cooperative federalism’’ partnership the federal gov-
ernment has with states and Tribes to prevent pollution under the
Clean Water Act, weakening the ability of states and Tribes to de-
fend local waterbodies.
Simply put, this partisan bill makes it easier to release harmful
and toxic pollution into our nation’s rivers, streams, lakes, and
other waterbodies through loopholes, legal shields, and limited
oversight of polluters. The bill eviscerates over 50 years of Clean
Water Act success that has doubled the percentage of waters that
are safe for fishing, swimming, and use as drinking water. H.R.
3898 undermines permitting requirements; eliminates judicial re-
view and public engagement; rolls back oversight of mining compa-
nies and industrial polluters; slows down permit processing with
increased bureaucracy; and weakens state-led decisions on locally
important waters.
Congressional Republicans offer these overarching, anti-Clean
Water Act changes as their response to specific projects that have
been blocked or to address the grievances of special interests and
polluters rather than provide a sustainable solution for reasonable
permitting efforts or to ensure the protection of water quality for
current or future generations.
For example, large-scale mining proposals, such as Pebble Mine
in Alaska or Spruce Mine in West Virginia, or ecologically dev-
astating flood control projects, such as the Yazoo Pumps in Mis-
sissippi, were blocked by presidential administrations from both
parties under the EPA’s Section 404(c) authority once the impacts
were thoroughly documented and publicly evaluated. Although
EPA has utilized this authority very sparingly (only 14 times
among the tens-of-millions of permitted activities since 1972), H.R.
3898 will effectively eliminate the authority altogether.
Similarly, for over 50 years, states and Tribes have judiciously
used section 401 of the CWA to ensure that projects or activities
(109)

carried out within their jurisdictions are consistent with state
water quality standards and other relevant state and Tribal laws.
Yet, in response to two specific instances where states legitimately
used this authority to prevent the construction of fossil fuel-related
facilities within their borders, H.R. 3898 changes the law to allow
special interests to override state and Tribal concerns over poten-
tial development within their own borders.
In a multitude of ways, H.R. 3898 will weaken federal, state, and
local efforts to restore, maintain, or clean up local waterbodies. The
bill tells communities of all sizes, especially rural, minority, and
economically-disadvantaged communities, that clean water is sim-
ply too costly for them to have. At the same time, the bill increases
the likelihood that American families will have to spend more for
safe drinking water for their homes or to access water-related rec-
reational areas, if such resources are still available. For example,
H.R. 3898 increases the likelihood for discharges of toxic chemicals
and pesticides, such as PFAS, mercury, and arsenic—chemicals
that, once in a local drinking water source, are extremely expen-
sive, and potentially impossible, to remove completely. Under this
bill, permittees are discouraged from investigating what toxic
chemicals might be in their waste-stream, which increases the like-
lihood of exposure to American families, including vulnerable popu-
lations, such as pregnant women, infants, and children. Yet, even
the Trump Administration’s Make America Healthy Again Com-
mission’s report recognizes the obvious risk to human health from
increased exposure to toxic chemicals and pesticides.1
The bill also exacerbates the likelihood of downstream contami-
nation and flooding as upstream waters and wetlands are devel-
oped or destroyed—increasing the risk and the cost to American
families, businesses, and economies. H.R. 3898 rewards polluters
and special interests by reducing their responsibility to prevent or
treat their waste—shifting the cost from polluters to American
families who will be forced to pay more for clean water.
H.R. 3898 also allows private industry and development to
steamroll through towns and states, polluting waterbodies due to
minimal review and disregarding local perspectives. The bill
greenlights large projects with minimal review while also limiting
opportunities for public comment or challenges to ecologically dam-
aging permits or projects. The bill also prevents judicial review by
vastly shortening the statute of limitations; limiting standing to file
suit; and limiting the Court’s options for recourse.
If H.R. 3898 is enacted, the potential adverse impacts to
waterbodies (such as reduced water quality or availability); to the
environment (such as increased greenhouse gas emissions or other
contamination); and to residents (such as perpetuating environ-
mental justice concerns) will be borne by the local and surrounding
communities without a voice or venue to have their concerns heard.
This legislation puts polluters over people.
Ironically, H.R. 3898 also contradicts itself by slowing down per-
mitting processes, sowing uncertainty, and decreasing flexibility.
For example, H.R. 3898 will add a formal rulemaking process in
1See https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assess
ment.pdf.

111
place of an existing and more efficient guidance process. This will
slow down the issuance of water quality criteria without increasing
transparency or public participation and remove flexibility for up-
dates. It will also open the criteria to judicial review, allowing ag-
grieved polluters another opportunity to challenge state and local
efforts to protect local waterbodies and human health.
Proponents of H.R. 3898 contend that it will speed up jurisdic-
tional determinations and wetland permits following the U.S. Su-
preme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA. That decision severely re-
stricted what waters remain subject to CWA protection and is esti-
mated to have removed such protection on at least 50% of wetlands
and at least 60% of streams nationwide. Yet, section 17 seeks to,
again, redefine what waters and wetlands remain subject to federal
protection. When combined with the Trump Administration’s ef-
forts to redefine by rulemaking the scope of federally protected
waters and eliminate federal employees responsible for permitting
requirements, the net result will be more confusion and uncertainty
and longer wait times for necessary permits.
Congressional Republicans can claim, over and over, that they
support clean water and healthy communities; however, their sup-
port for this bill tells the real story. If Republicans were serious
about protecting our water resources, our families, and our water-
related economy, they would look comprehensively at the remain-
ing sources of impairment to our rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands,
and coastal areas, and take the necessary steps and make the nec-
essary investment to address these challenges. When Democrats
last controlled the U.S. House of Representatives, we not only en-
acted the single largest investment in wastewater infrastructure
ever through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but we initiated
efforts to repair the damage to the Clean Water Act caused by a
conservative Supreme Court and worked towards finally achieving
the elusive goal of ‘‘fishable and swimmable’’ waters for all Ameri-
cans.
The litany of loopholes, legal shields, and limited oversight con-
tained in H.R. 3898 are the opposite of what Congress needs to be
doing to protect our water resources. Exposing the waters and wet-
lands that remain under Clean Water Act protections to unre-
stricted and unchallengeable pollution or destruction will do noth-
ing to restore and maintain clean water.
During consideration of H.R. 3898, several Committee Democrats
sought to lessen the negative impacts of this legislation and require
EPA to verify that the changes in the bill would not adversely im-
pact the health, safety, and availability of clean water in commu-
nities nationwide.
Ranking Member Rick Larsen (WA–02) offered an amendment to
remove several provisions from the bill which undermine the ‘‘coop-
erative federalism’’ partnership the federal government has with
states and Tribes to protect against the pollution of local
waterbodies. The amendment would have restored the ability of
states and Tribes to make locally important decisions related to the
protection of locally important waterbodies. In many instances,
states are better suited to understand the unique needs, demands,
and importance on local waterbodies; this amendment would allow
states to continue to lead local efforts to protect clean water.

Representative Dina Titus (NV–01) offered an amendment to
highlight how the bill’s attempt to codify the draconian losses of
Clean Water Act protections from the Sackett decision will dis-
proportionately and adversely affect certain states. For example, in
the state of Nevada, the loss of Clean Water Act protections for
ephemeral streams will mean that close to 88 percent of the stream
miles covered before the Sackett decision will no longer be federally
protected.2 Similarly, under the most damaging scenario, 92 per-
cent of wetland area in the State of Washington has likely lost fed-
eral protection under the rationale of the Supreme Court and this
legislation.
Representatives Emilia Sykes (OH–13) and Shomari Figures
(AL–02) each offered an amendment to ensure that the loopholes,
legal shields, and limited oversight of polluters contained in H.R.
3898 do not disproportionately impact rural, economically-dis-
advantaged, and Tribal communities. Nine out of 10 Americans re-
ceive their drinking water from public water systems that rely on
a network of surface and subsurface waters to provide the water
entering our homes and businesses. The Sykes and Figures amend-
ments sought to prevent any increase in the volume, toxicity, or
concentration of pollution entering our waters and to prevent any
corresponding increase in local utility rates that would be required
to remove increased pollution levels caused by this bill. We cannot
continue to allow the economic and human health burdens of in-
creased pollution to be placed on those communities that are least
able to bear these burdens.
Representatives Hillary Scholten (MI–03), Laura Gillen (NY–04),
and Pat Ryan (NY–18) each offered an amendment to protect com-
munities, families, and individuals from increased exposure to pol-
lution that would result from the changes in H.R. 3898. The
Scholten amendment sought to retain existing Clean Water Act
protections for the use of pesticides that could adversely affect the
health of pregnant women, fetal development, infants, or children.
The Gillen amendment sought to protect communities and individ-
uals from the increased likelihood of exposure to chemicals and ma-
terials linked to cancer, such as PFAS, arsenic, nitrates, nitrites,
pesticides, chromium, radium, and uranium that would result from
the changes in this bill. The Ryan amendment delays the effective
date of the bill until the EPA Administrator determines that the
changes will not result in increased discharges of forever chemicals
(such as PFAS) or nutrients that cause harmful algal blooms. The
amendment would have ensured that communities are not left with
the environmental and economic burden of cleaning up and remov-
ing such pollutants.
Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet (MI–08) offered an
amendment that would protect the Great Lakes and other Clean
Water Act geographic programs from the potential for increased
discharges of pollution because of this bill. The Great Lakes are the
largest source of freshwater in the United States, containing 21
percent of the world’s surface freshwater by volume. This amend-
ment would prevent the changes contained in H.R. 3898 from re-

sulting in increased discharges of pollution to the Great Lakes, and
other critical regional waterbodies, which could degrade the
human, ecological, and economic health of the region that depends
on clean water.
Representative Laura Friedman (CA–30) offered an amendment
that sought to minimize the discharge of pollutants into
waterbodies that states, especially western states, are using to aug-
ment local water supplies through water recapture, water reuse
and recycling, and groundwater recharge. The availability of safe,
reliable, and affordable water is critical, not only to the survival of
life, but also to the economic health of communities and regions,
contributing to the success of industry, manufacturing, agriculture,
transportation, and recreation. This amendment would have en-
sured that forward-looking states and Tribes, which are rightly
preparing for the future through maximizing efforts to conserve,
reuse, and replenish every drop of water, are not hindered by in-
creased levels of pollution resulting from the changes in H.R. 3898.
Representative Nellie Pou (NJ–09) offered an amendment that
sought to prevent this bill from increasing the discharge of raw or
partially treated sewage into our waters. The Clean Water Act cur-
rently requires dischargers of wastewater to take every step pos-
sible to treat sewage before it is released into the environment.
H.R. 3898 would weaken those requirements, calling into question
whether polluters will still be required to implement treatment
technologies sufficient to prevent the discharge of raw or partially
treated sewage into our nation’s waters, especially if a polluter sug-
gests that such technologies are ‘‘too expensive’’ or ‘‘not commer-
cially available in the United States . . . at comparable scale.’’ The
Pou amendment would have prevented these new loopholes from
resulting in an increase in combined and sanitary sewer overflows
or an increase in the risk (and economic consequences) of flooding
associated with the discharge of increased volumes of industrial or
municipal stormwater.
The Clean Water Act has been an effective tool for improving the
health of our rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Unfortunately,
progress restoring impaired waterbodies has slowed and, in some
areas, reversed. Communities face new challenges from emerging
contaminants and impacts of climate change, and an increased
need for affordable federal assistance—especially rural, minority,
and economically-disadvantaged communities; yet the Trump Ad-
ministration proposes to decimate funding for federal and state
clean water agencies, as well as critical infrastructure funding for
communities of all sizes. An activist conservative court has reinter-
preted the CWA to protect significantly fewer waterbodies and pre-
vent fewer discharges of pollutants. Rather than address these
growing challenges to fishable and swimmable water for all Ameri-
cans, H.R. 3898 provides additional loopholes, legal shields, and
limited oversight for special interests and polluters.
In our view, this legislation is unnecessary, unwarranted, and a
dangerous attack on clean water nationwide. For these reasons, we
oppose H.R. 3898.
