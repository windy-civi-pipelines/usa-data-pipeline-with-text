The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Halting Uncertain Methods and Practices in Super-
vision Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘HUMPS Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) CAMELS ratings (Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earn-
ings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk) are a critical tool for evaluating
the safety and soundness of financial institutions, and the basis for determining
significant regulatory matters such as the evaluation for mergers and acquisi-
tions and a bank’s deposit insurance premiums;
(2) the CAMELS rating system relies heavily on examiner judgment, which
can lead to subjective and inconsistent ratings across similar institutions;
(3) establishing clear, objective measures for each CAMELS component and
their relative weighting in determining composite ratings will promote fairness,
consistency, and accountability in supervisory assessments; and
(4) examination and supervision, as well as the CAMELS rating system,
should focus on a financial institution’s core financial condition or solvency.
SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE CAMELS RATING SYSTEM.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of
1978 (12 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘SEC. 1012. AMENDMENTS TO THE CAMELS RATING SYSTEM.
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Council shall make recommendations to amend the Uni-
form Financial Institutions Rating System, and the CAMELS components there-
under, to—
‘‘(1) establish clear and objective criteria for assessing each CAMELS compo-
nent;
‘‘(2) revise the factors affecting each CAMELS component to derive a com-
posite rating that more accurately reflects the financial condition and risk pro-
file of the financial institutions being rated;
‘‘(3) either—
‘‘(A) eliminate the management component of the CAMELS rating sys-
tem; or
‘‘(B) revise the management component of the CAMELS rating system to
limit the assessment under such component to objective measures of the
governance and controls used to manage an institution’s risk profile;
‘‘(4) ensure that composite ratings consider the financial institution’s compli-
ance with—
‘‘(A) section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1829b);
‘‘(B) chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91–508 (12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.);
‘‘(C) subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code; and
‘‘(D) any other applicable requirements and implementing regulations re-
lating to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing; and
‘‘(5) ensure that composite ratings are determined based on a transparent
methodology that is limited to the objective criteria established for each CAM-
ELS component.
‘‘(b) RULEMAKING.—Not later than 12 months after the Council makes the rec-
ommendations required under subsection (a), the Federal financial institutions regu-
latory agencies shall, jointly, issue rules to carry out the recommendations described
under subsection (a).
‘‘(c) PUBLICCOMMENTPERIOD.—In issuing the rules required under subsection (b),
the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies shall—
‘‘(1) publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to such rules; and
‘‘(2) provide for a public comment period of not less than 90 days.
‘‘(d) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section may be construed to limit
the authority of the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies to take super-
visory or enforcement actions to ensure the safety and soundness of financial insti-
tutions.’’.
(b) WELLMANAGEDDEFINITION.—Section 2(o)(9)(A) of the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841(o)(9)(A)) is amended—
(1) by striking ‘‘achievement of’’ and all that follows through ‘‘a CAMEL’’ and
inserting ‘‘achievement of a CAMEL’’;
(2) by striking ‘‘; and’’ and inserting a period; and
(3) by striking clause (ii).

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on May 14, 2025, by Representative Scott Fitzgerald
(WI–05), H.R. 3379, the Halting Uncertain Methods and Practices
in Supervision (HUMPS) Act of 2025, requires the Federal Finan-
cial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to develop formal
recommendations to revise the CAMELS rating system. Federal
banking regulators would then be required to implement the rec-
ommendations through joint rulemakings.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The CAMELS rating system—comprising Capital adequacy,
Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to
market risk—was established by the FFIEC in 1979 as a tool for
evaluating the safety and soundness of financial institutions. De-
spite its longstanding use, the system has been criticized for its
heavy reliance on examiner judgment and subjective metrics, which
can lead to inconsistent ratings across institutions of similar risk
profiles. In particular, the Management component often acts as a
vague ‘‘catch-all’’ that allows for supervisory downgrades based on
non-material or intangible concerns. These ratings have far-reach-
ing implications, affecting matters such as merger approvals, de-
posit insurance premiums, and enforcement decisions. Subjectivity
in the CAMELS framework undermines transparency, account-
ability, and consistency in the supervisory process. The HUMPS
Act seeks to address these concerns by directing regulators to adopt
clear, objective standards that better reflect a financial institution’s
solvency and risk profile. By modernizing the rating framework,
the legislation aims to improve the fairness of bank evaluations
while preserving regulatory tools necessary to ensure safety and
soundness.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
119TH CONGRESS
On May 14, 2025, Representative Fitzgerald introduced H.R.
3379, the Halting Uncertain Methods and Practices in Supervision
(HUMPS) Act of 2025. The bill was referred solely to the Com-
mittee on Financial Services. The bill was attached to the April 29,
2025, hearing titled, ‘‘Regulatory Overreach: The Price Tag on
American Prosperity.’’
On May 21, 2025, the Committee on Financial Services met in
open session to consider, among others, H.R. 3379. The Committee
favorably reported H.R. 3379, as amended to the House of Rep-
resentatives.

COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and
against.
On May 21, 2025, the Committee ordered H.R. 3379, as amend-
ed, to be reported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 29
yeas and 23 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–
126).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
3379:
• Representative Fitzgerald offered an amendment in the
nature of a substitute, which clarified language related to su-
pervisory rating factors, explicitly requiring that composite rat-
ings consider compliance with anti-money laundering and
counter-terrorist financing laws. The amendment also extended
the deadline for issuing final reports from 60 days to 90 days.
This amendment was adopted by a voice vote.
• Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an
amendment (No. 6), designated AMEND_HR3379_15. This
amendment would prohibit any changes to the CAMELS rating
system recommended by the FFIEC from being applied to in-
sured depository institutions with over $1 trillion in assets or
to institutions that have violated federal law or regulations in
a manner that, in the aggregate, harmed one million or more
consumers. This amendment failed by a recorded vote of 23
yeas and 29 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No.
FC–125).

Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3379 is to establish objective,
quantifiable criteria for each CAMELS component, revise the
weighting methodology to better reflect actual risk, and either
eliminate or narrow the scope of the Management component.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3379. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section designates the short title as the ‘‘Halting Uncertain
Methods and Practices in Supervision Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘HUMPS
Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Findings
This section provides congressional findings, including:
• The CAMELS ratings system (Capital adequacy, Asset
quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to
market risk) is a critical tool used to assess the safety and
soundness of financial institutions and to inform significant
regulatory decisions such as mergers, acquisitions deposit in-
surance premiums;
• CAMELS ratings depend heavily on examiner discretion,
which can result in subjective and inconsistent ratings across
similar institutions;
• Establishing clear, objective measures for each CAMELS
component and their relative weighting in determining com-
posite ratings will promote fairness, consistency, and account-
ability in supervisory assessments; and
• Examination and supervision, as well as the CAMELS rat-
ing system, should focus on a financial institution’s core finan-
cial condition or solvency.
Section 3. Amendments to the Camels Rating System
This section amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examina-
tion Council Act of 1978 to require the Council to recommend up-
dates to the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System and the
CAMELS components. These updates must:
• Establish clear and objective criteria for assessing each
CAMELS component;
• Revise the factors used to assess each component to more
accurately reflect an institution’s financial condition and risk
profile;
• Either eliminate the management component or revise it
to focus solely on objective measures of governance and risk
controls;

• Ensure the composite ratings account for compliance with
anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of
terrorism (CFT) laws, including section 21 of the Federal De-
posit Insurance Act, chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91–508,
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, U.S. Code; and
• Ensure that the overall rating methodology is transparent
and based exclusively on objective criteria.
This section also requires that the federal financial regulators
jointly issue implementing rules within 12 months of the Council’s
recommendations and provide for a public comment period of at
least 90 days.
This section clarifies that nothing in the Act limits regulators’
authority to take supervisory or enforcement actions to ensure the
safety and soundness of financial institutions.

of the bank or company, or had already been found to have control
in a proceeding under paragraph (2)(C).
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection—
(A) No bank and no company owning or controlling voting
shares of a bank is a bank holding company by virtue of its
ownership or control of shares in a fiduciary capacity, except
as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (g) of this
section. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, bank shares
shall not be deemed to have been acquired in a fiduciary capac-

thority to exercise voting rights with respect thereto; except
that this limitation is applicable in the case of a bank or com-
pany acquiring such shares prior to the date of enactment of
the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 only if

a reasonable period not to exceed one year after the date of en-
actment of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of

not more than one year at a time, the two-year period referred

interest it holds in that company, will exceed 5 per centum of
any class of the voting shares of that company, except that this
limitation shall not be applicable to investments of the trust
company or mutual savings bank, direct and indirect, which
are otherwise in accordance with the limitations applicable to
national banks under section 5136 of the Revised Statutes. (12
U.S.C. 24)
(6) For the purposes of this Act, any successor to a bank holding
company shall be deemed to be a bank holding company from the

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill, previously referred to as CAMELS Rating Moderniza-
tion Act, would require the Federal Financial Institutions Exam-
ination Council (FFIEC) to develop recommendations and modify
their implementation of the CAMELS ratings framework, where
depository institutions are given composite and component exam
ratings for Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earn-
ings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk (CAMELS).1 In
doing so, regulators would either have to eliminate the manage-
ment component or limit its use. The bill also eliminates the con-
sideration of management with respect to certain provisions of the
Bank Holding Company Act, including with respect to acquiring
other banks and expanding the bank’s financial activities. This will
significantly diminish the ability to hold bank management ac-
countable for their actions.
While large banks argue the management component is too sub-
jective, being able to fully assess the adequacy of a bank’s manage-
ment capabilities, especially of a large, complex entity that enjoys
several Federal benefits (deposit insurance, access to Fed discount
window, access to Fed payment systems, etc.) has always been key
to the safe and sound operation of a bank. Moreover, it is difficult
for Congress or the public to assess whether bank examiners are
being fair and consistent with the ratings they give for manage-
ment or any aspect of the CAMELS ratings since these are con-
fidential supervisory information. To improve accountability, some
have proposed publicly releasing CAMELS ratings, including on a
delay.2
In the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank’s failure in 2023 that re-
quired regulators to invoke the systemic risk exception to prevent
contagion from spreading into a larger financial crisis, the GAO
conducted a review of the regulator’s supervision of the bank at the
request of former Chairman McHenry and Ranking Member
Waters.3 GAO found that Fed examiners gave SVB many ‘‘2’’ rat-
ings between 2018–2022, but by 2022, examiners gave the bank a
‘‘3’’ rating for mismanagement.4 GAO and others found that these
problems should have been escalated faster to ensure the bank
promptly addressed its management failures.5 If this bill were in

place before then, examiners may have downplayed management
problems if they focused exclusively on quantifiable data.
Consumer groups like Americans for Financial Reform (AFR) and
Public Citizen are opposed to the bill. Moreover, a former Treasury
official expressed strong concerns in recent testimony, saying ‘‘A
bank’s managerial character and capacity has long been a
foundational basis for evaluating whether a bank is worthy of re-
ceiving a charter or federal deposit insurance. . . . These factors
may not be precisely quantifiable in the way a bank’s capital ratio
can be calculated, but we have seen time and again that public per-
ception and confidence and sound management affect the stability
of banks and the entire banking system . . .’’6
During the debate, Ranking Member Waters offered an amend-
ment to exempt megabanks over $1 trillion that a Federal regu-
lator found in the past 10 years that the bank violated a federal
law or regulation, and that they found the bank harmed more than
1 million consumers. This would ensure large banks like Wells
Fargo, for example, that have been found to have repeatedly mis-
managed their operations and repeatedly violated the law, result-
ing in extensive consumer harm, would continue to have their man-
agement scrutinized by bank regulators. This amendment was re-
jected by Republicans.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3379.

MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
