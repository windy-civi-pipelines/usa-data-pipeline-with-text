SEA TURTLE RESCUE ASSISTANCE AND REHABILITATION
ACT OF 2025
JULY16, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 843]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 843) to require the Secretary of
Commerce to establish the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Grant
Program, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon
with an amendment and recommends that the bill, as amended, do
pass.1
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 843, Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Reha-
bilitation Act of 2025, is to integrate sea turtle rescue and response
into an existing stranding program at the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA).
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
There are six species of sea turtles found in U.S. waters, all of
which are listed and protected under the Endangered Species Act.2
Sea turtles play an important role in maintaining healthy marine
ecosystems and their protection is critical for the preservation of
marine biodiversity. Specifically, sea turtles help control popu-
lations of jellyfish, maintain healthy seagrass beds, and contribute
1At the markup, S. 843 was ordered to be reported without amendment, but post-markup,
a technical amendment required the bill to be reported favorably with an amendment.

to nutrient cycling in both ocean floor and beach ecosystems.3 Be-
cause they are a migratory species with a lifespan across decades,
sea turtles are also considered an indicator of the overall health of
the ocean and the impact of human activities.4 In addition to their
ecological importance, sea turtles are a part of coastal communities’
culture and traditions, and their presence can draw in tourists,
generating both economic benefits and occasional safety issues for
both humans and turtles.5
While most of their lives are spent at sea, sea turtles return to
land to lay eggs and nest every year. Sea turtles face threats both
on and off the land and are often harmed by bycatch,6 loss of nest-
ing and foraging habitats, marine debris entanglement, and vessel
strikes. In addition to bycatch, other factors such as red tide, viral
disease, and cold stunning during the winter can lead to turtle
strandings,7 both on land or in water when a sea turtle cannot
function properly due to injury, illness, or some other problem.8 Six
of the world’s seven sea turtle species are found in U.S. waters:
Kemp’s ridley, green turtle, loggerhead, hawksbill, olive ridley, and
leatherback. Three of these turtle species are found in Mississippi,
including Kemp’s ridley turtle, the world’s most critically endan-
gered sea turtle.9 In 2024, there were 916 sea turtle strandings in
Massachusetts and 799 sea turtle strandings in Texas.10
NOAA established the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Net-
work in 1980 to respond to and document all stranding incidents
in the United States.11 This network includes other Federal and
State agencies, academic institutions, and private organizations
that respond to and document stranded sea turtles, transport them
to rehabilitation facilities for care, perform necropsies of dead tur-
tles, and collect other information to identify causes of stranding.
NOAA has an existing stranding grant program, the John H.
Prescott Marine Mammal Stranding Grant program, which for
more than 20 years has provided funding response to stranded
whales, dolphins, seals, and other marine mammals.12
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 843 would do the following:
• Require the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Director
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop separate grant
application criteria for the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Grant

Program under the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue
and Response Grant Program.
• Require the grant application to be submitted to the Secretary
of Commerce and that all applicants must comply with existing
law, standard conditions for sea turtle care, and the Sea Turtle
Stranding and Salvage Network data collection requirements.
• Establish a new interest-bearing fund in the Treasury, the Sea
Turtle Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Rapid Response Fund, for
emergency assistance for sea turtles.

the existing Joseph R. Geraci Mammal Rescue and Rapid Re-
sponse Fund and the new Sea Turtle Rescue, Rehabilitation,
and Rapid Response Fund.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 843, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Act
of 2025, was introduced on March 4, 2025, by Senator Markey (for
himself and Senators Cornyn, Tillis, Graham, Van Hollen, and
Booker) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate. On March 12, 2025, the Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered
S. 843 reported favorably without amendment. After the markup,
the bill needed a technical fix, which required S. 843 to be reported
favorably with an amendment.
H.R. 347, the House companion bill to S. 843, was introduced on
January 13, 2025, by Representative Keating and was referred to
the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representa-
tives. Fifteen Representatives were later added as cosponsors.
118th Congress
S. 2086, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Act
of 2023, was introduced on June 21, 2023, by Senator Markey (for
himself and Senators Cornyn, Van Hollen, Graham, Wicker, and
Carper) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate. Senator Tillis was later added as
a cosponsor. On July 31, 2024, the Committee met in open Execu-
tive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 2086 reported favorably
with an amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
H.R. 2560, the House companion bill to S. 2086, was introduced
on April 10, 2023, by Representative Keating and was referred to
the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representa-
tives. Twelve Representatives and one Resident Commissioner
were later added as cosponsors. On October 26, 2023, that Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session and ordered H.R. 2560 re-
ported, as amended, by unanimous consent. On April 11, 2024, the
House passed H.R. 2560 under suspension of the rules by a vote
of 332–80.
117th Congress
S. 4432, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Act of 2022, was intro-
duced on June 16, 2022, by Senator Markey (for himself and Sen-
ator Cornyn) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Senators Graham, Van
Hollen, Booker, and Inhofe were later added as cosponsors.

H.R. 7918, a House companion bill to S. 4432, was introduced on
May 31, 2022, by Representative Keating and was referred to the
Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives.
Representatives Jayapal, Lynch, DelBene, and Resident Commis-
sioner Gonza´lez-Colo´n were later added as cosponsors. On Decem-
ber 8, 2022, that Committee met in open Executive Session and or-
dered H.R. 7918 reported, as amended, by unanimous consent.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 843 would authorize the appropriation of $5 million annually
for fiscal years 2025 through 2030 for the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service for grants to rescue and rehabilitate stranded marine tur-
tles. Those grants would support marine turtle rescue and recov-
ery, data collection, research, and the operating costs for research
and rehabilitation facilities. In 2024, NOAA allocated $3 million for
those activities.
S. 843 also would authorize the appropriation of $500,000 annu-
ally for fiscal years 2025 through 2030 for each of two trust funds
that are credited with interest on unspent balances. Under current
law, the Joseph R. Geraci Marine Mammal Rescue and Rapid Re-
sponse Fund is authorized to be appropriated $500,000 annually
through 2028. Therefore, CBO estimates the bill would authorize
the appropriation of a total of $4 million over the 2025–2030 period
for the two funds.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).

Enacting the bill also would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period for the spending
of interest credited to the trust funds.
aS. 843 would authorize the appropriation of $500,000 annually for fiscal years 2025 through 2030 for each of the two trust funds. Under
current law, one fund is authorized to be appropriated $500,000 annually through 2028.
CBO assumes that S. 843 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and
that the authorized amounts will be available in each year. Using
historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that implementing S.
843 would cost $31 million over the 2025–2030 period and $3 mil-
lion after 2030, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts.
Enacting the bill would increase direct spending because any in-
terest credited to the trust funds would be available without fur-
ther appropriation. Based on the projection of interest rates that
underlie CBO’s baseline, CBO estimates that the amount of inter-
est credited to the funds and subsequently spent would be less
than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Johnny Willing and
Aurora Swanson. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel
Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 843 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 6:
Section 2. Sea turtle rescue, rehabilitation, and response
This section would add an additional eligibility to the John H.
Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Response Grant Program to
fund the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Grant Program for sea tur-
tle rescue, rehabilitation, and response. Eligible entities and grant
conditions would be consistent with equivalent criteria and require-
ments as under the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and
Response Grant Program. Grant participants would be required to
comply with standard conditions for care of sea turtles and the Sea
Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network data collection require-
ments.
This section would establish a parallel fund to the Joseph R.
Geraci Marine Mammal Rescue and Rapid Response Fund, only for
use to provide emergency assistance. It would authorize appropria-
tions of $5 million for each fiscal year from 2025 through 2030 for
the purpose of sea turtle rescue, rehabilitation, and response, with-
in the Prescott Program. This section would also authorize appro-
priations of $500,000 for the Joseph R. Geraci Marine Mammal
Rescue and Rapid Response Fund and $500,000 for the Sea Turtle
Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Rapid Response Fund for each fiscal
year from 2025 through 2030.

PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 843, Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Reha-
bilitation Act of 2025, is to integrate sea turtle rescue and response
into an existing stranding program at the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA).
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
There are six species of sea turtles found in U.S. waters, all of
which are listed and protected under the Endangered Species Act.2
Sea turtles play an important role in maintaining healthy marine
ecosystems and their protection is critical for the preservation of
marine biodiversity. Specifically, sea turtles help control popu-
lations of jellyfish, maintain healthy seagrass beds, and contribute
1At the markup, S. 843 was ordered to be reported without amendment, but post-markup,
a technical amendment required the bill to be reported favorably with an amendment.

to nutrient cycling in both ocean floor and beach ecosystems.3 Be-
cause they are a migratory species with a lifespan across decades,
sea turtles are also considered an indicator of the overall health of
the ocean and the impact of human activities.4 In addition to their
ecological importance, sea turtles are a part of coastal communities’
culture and traditions, and their presence can draw in tourists,
generating both economic benefits and occasional safety issues for
both humans and turtles.5
While most of their lives are spent at sea, sea turtles return to
land to lay eggs and nest every year. Sea turtles face threats both
on and off the land and are often harmed by bycatch,6 loss of nest-
ing and foraging habitats, marine debris entanglement, and vessel
strikes. In addition to bycatch, other factors such as red tide, viral
disease, and cold stunning during the winter can lead to turtle
strandings,7 both on land or in water when a sea turtle cannot
function properly due to injury, illness, or some other problem.8 Six
of the world’s seven sea turtle species are found in U.S. waters:
Kemp’s ridley, green turtle, loggerhead, hawksbill, olive ridley, and
leatherback. Three of these turtle species are found in Mississippi,
including Kemp’s ridley turtle, the world’s most critically endan-
gered sea turtle.9 In 2024, there were 916 sea turtle strandings in
Massachusetts and 799 sea turtle strandings in Texas.10
NOAA established the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Net-
work in 1980 to respond to and document all stranding incidents
in the United States.11 This network includes other Federal and
State agencies, academic institutions, and private organizations
that respond to and document stranded sea turtles, transport them
to rehabilitation facilities for care, perform necropsies of dead tur-
tles, and collect other information to identify causes of stranding.
NOAA has an existing stranding grant program, the John H.
Prescott Marine Mammal Stranding Grant program, which for
more than 20 years has provided funding response to stranded
whales, dolphins, seals, and other marine mammals.12
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 843 would do the following:
• Require the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Director
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop separate grant
application criteria for the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Grant

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 843, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Act
of 2025, was introduced on March 4, 2025, by Senator Markey (for
himself and Senators Cornyn, Tillis, Graham, Van Hollen, and
Booker) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate. On March 12, 2025, the Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered
S. 843 reported favorably without amendment. After the markup,
the bill needed a technical fix, which required S. 843 to be reported
favorably with an amendment.
H.R. 347, the House companion bill to S. 843, was introduced on
January 13, 2025, by Representative Keating and was referred to
the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representa-
tives. Fifteen Representatives were later added as cosponsors.
118th Congress
S. 2086, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Act
of 2023, was introduced on June 21, 2023, by Senator Markey (for
himself and Senators Cornyn, Van Hollen, Graham, Wicker, and
Carper) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate. Senator Tillis was later added as
a cosponsor. On July 31, 2024, the Committee met in open Execu-
tive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 2086 reported favorably
with an amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
H.R. 2560, the House companion bill to S. 2086, was introduced
on April 10, 2023, by Representative Keating and was referred to
the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representa-
tives. Twelve Representatives and one Resident Commissioner
were later added as cosponsors. On October 26, 2023, that Com-
mittee met in open Executive Session and ordered H.R. 2560 re-
ported, as amended, by unanimous consent. On April 11, 2024, the
House passed H.R. 2560 under suspension of the rules by a vote
of 332–80.
117th Congress
S. 4432, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Act of 2022, was intro-
duced on June 16, 2022, by Senator Markey (for himself and Sen-

H.R. 7918, a House companion bill to S. 4432, was introduced on
May 31, 2022, by Representative Keating and was referred to the
Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives.
Representatives Jayapal, Lynch, DelBene, and Resident Commis-
sioner Gonza´lez-Colo´n were later added as cosponsors. On Decem-
ber 8, 2022, that Committee met in open Executive Session and or-

ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 843 would authorize the appropriation of $5 million annually
for fiscal years 2025 through 2030 for the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service for grants to rescue and rehabilitate stranded marine tur-
tles. Those grants would support marine turtle rescue and recov-
ery, data collection, research, and the operating costs for research
and rehabilitation facilities. In 2024, NOAA allocated $3 million for
those activities.
S. 843 also would authorize the appropriation of $500,000 annu-
ally for fiscal years 2025 through 2030 for each of two trust funds
that are credited with interest on unspent balances. Under current
law, the Joseph R. Geraci Marine Mammal Rescue and Rapid Re-
sponse Fund is authorized to be appropriated $500,000 annually
through 2028. Therefore, CBO estimates the bill would authorize
the appropriation of a total of $4 million over the 2025–2030 period
for the two funds.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).

Enacting the bill also would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period for the spending
of interest credited to the trust funds.
aS. 843 would authorize the appropriation of $500,000 annually for fiscal years 2025 through 2030 for each of the two trust funds. Under
current law, one fund is authorized to be appropriated $500,000 annually through 2028.
CBO assumes that S. 843 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and
that the authorized amounts will be available in each year. Using
historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that implementing S.
843 would cost $31 million over the 2025–2030 period and $3 mil-
lion after 2030, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts.
Enacting the bill would increase direct spending because any in-
terest credited to the trust funds would be available without fur-
ther appropriation. Based on the projection of interest rates that
underlie CBO’s baseline, CBO estimates that the amount of inter-
est credited to the funds and subsequently spent would be less
than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Johnny Willing and
Aurora Swanson. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel
Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 843 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 2. Sea turtle rescue, rehabilitation, and response
This section would add an additional eligibility to the John H.
Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Response Grant Program to
fund the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance Grant Program for sea tur-
tle rescue, rehabilitation, and response. Eligible entities and grant
conditions would be consistent with equivalent criteria and require-
ments as under the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and
Response Grant Program. Grant participants would be required to
comply with standard conditions for care of sea turtles and the Sea
Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network data collection require-
ments.
This section would establish a parallel fund to the Joseph R.
Geraci Marine Mammal Rescue and Rapid Response Fund, only for
use to provide emergency assistance. It would authorize appropria-
tions of $5 million for each fiscal year from 2025 through 2030 for
the purpose of sea turtle rescue, rehabilitation, and response, with-
in the Prescott Program. This section would also authorize appro-
priations of $500,000 for the Joseph R. Geraci Marine Mammal
Rescue and Rapid Response Fund and $500,000 for the Sea Turtle
Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Rapid Response Fund for each fiscal
year from 2025 through 2030.
