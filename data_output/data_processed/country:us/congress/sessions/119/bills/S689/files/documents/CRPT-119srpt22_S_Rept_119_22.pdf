TO APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WATER RIGHT
CLAIMS OF THE TULE RIVER TRIBE, AND FOR OTHER
PURPOSES
MAY12, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Ms. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Indian Affairs,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 689]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill,
S. 689, to approve the settlement of the water right claims of the
Tule River Tribe, and for other purposes, having considered the
same, reports favorably thereon, and recommends that the bill
without amendment do pass.
PURPOSE
S. 689 would recognize the federally reserved Indian water rights
of the Tule River Indian Tribe and authorize, ratify, and confirm
a 2007 water settlement agreement between the Tribe and down-
stream state-based water users, the Tule River Association, and
the South Tule Independent Ditch Company (‘‘2007 Agreement’’),
satisfying the Tribe’s claims to water rights in California. The bill
would also authorize funding for water development projects and
operation, maintenance, and repair, establish operating rules for
the facility to provide drinking water for the Tribe, guarantee
water deliveries to downstream state-based users, and transfer cer-
tain lands into trust status for the Tribe.
BACKGROUND AND NEED
The Tule River Indian Reservation (Reservation) was created in
1856 as part of the Tejon Reservation on San Joaquin Valley farm-
land in Tulare County. It was modified by a series of three Execu-
tive Orders issued between 1873 and 1878 that enlarged, and sub-

sequently shrank, the Reservation to its current state.1 The Res-
ervation is comprised of approximately 86 square miles (55,396
acres) on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, east
of Porterville in California’s Central Valley, which cover the Middle
Fork of the Tule River. Only about one percent of the Reservation
is functionally habitable, and most of that portion is constrained to
the lower reach of the South Fork of the Tule River on the western
third of the Reservation.
The Tule River’s South Fork flows through the Reservation into
the Tule River at Lake Success Reservoir. The Tribe generally
draws its water from surface flow available from the South Fork
and its tributaries as well as limited groundwater supplies from
aquifers and springs.2 The Reservation’s residents suffer from a
relatively low standard of living due, in part, to the absence of an
adequate and reliable potable water supply and system. Ground-
water is limited in both quantity and quality, and in years of aver-
age and below average precipitation, surface water supply falls
below community need. In the summer months, low groundwater
and surface water supplies create municipal water shortages, re-
sulting in Reservation residents having little to no access to run-
ning water. Current drought conditions and river level decreases
are forcing the Tribe to rely on bottled water and trucked water to
meet the basic needs of its Reservation residents.3 This state of
water insecurity interferes with Tribal members’ participation in
work, school, and other aspects of daily life; prevents the Tribe
from providing much-needed on-reservation housing to additional
Tribal members; and recently forced the Tribe to relocate its pri-
mary economic driver—the Eagle Mountain Casino—to Porterville.4
The only known adjudication of water rights on the South Fork
of the Tule River occurred in 1916,5 in which the United States
failed to consider, evaluate, or defend the Tribe’s pre-1873 senior
water rights claims to the South Fork of the Tule River. In 1922
the United States, on behalf of the Tribe, entered a contract with
a downstream state-based water user, the South Tule Independent
Ditch Company, for water deliveries without the Tribe’s involve-
ment or consent.6 The agreement apportioned the flow of the South
Tule River under shortage conditions, but failed to construct ade-
quate water storage and delivery systems for the Tribe on the Res-
ervation. In the absence of adequate water storage systems, the
Tribe relies on a small number of wells on the Reservation, but
flow rates are declining and some have run dry. The Tribe has pro-
posed developing a storage facility, such as a dam or reservoir to-
gether with other infrastructure, to meet future water demands.
After ten years of negotiation facilitated by the United States,
the Tule River Tribe, South Tule Independent Ditch Company, and
the Tule River Association, a consortium of downstream state-

based irrigators, reached consensus on how to avoid adverse impact
from a Tribal water storage project. In 2007, the Tribe entered into
a water settlement agreement with the Tule River Association and
the South Tule Independent Ditch Company to quantify the Tribe’s
water rights for the Reservation. The agreement allows the Tribe
to store up to 5,828 acre-feet per year of surface water from the
South Fork of the Tule River, and for the construction of a res-
ervoir, and requires the release of certain quantities of water to
meet downstream state-based needs.
According to the Tribe, the parties assessed the Tribe’s current
and future needs for domestic, commercial, municipal, industrial,
and agricultural purposes, and concluded that the Tribe cannot
meet its needs without a water storage facility to serve the Res-
ervation and quantification of its federally reserved water rights,
which were affirmed in principle in the 1922 agreement between
the Secretary of the Interior and the South Tule Independent Ditch
Company.7
S. 689 will address the Tribe’s ongoing water insecurity and re-
solve, fully and finally, all of the Tribe’s claims to water rights in
the State of California by authorizing, ratifying, and confirming the
2007 settlement agreement between the Tribe and the state-based
Tule River Association and South Tule Independent Ditch Com-
pany, and by providing funding and land to fulfill the settlement.
SUMMARY
S. 689 authorizes, ratifies, and confirms the 2007 Agreement, as
amended; ratifies, confirms, declares valid, and quantifies the
Tribe’s water right as 5,828 acre-feet per year of surface water
from the South Fork of the Tule River; establishes the Tule River
Indian Tribe Settlement Trust Fund and its subaccounts; author-
izes mandatory appropriations of $518,000,000 for the Tule River
Tribe Water Development Projects Account and $50,000,000 for the
Tule River Tribe Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Account; pro-
vides for certain federal and Tribally-owned fee lands to be trans-
ferred and placed in trust for the Tribe as part of the Tule River
Reservation; and places certain requirements on the Secretary of
the Interior.
