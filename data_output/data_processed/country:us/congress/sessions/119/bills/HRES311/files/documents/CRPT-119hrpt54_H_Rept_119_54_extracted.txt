STATEMENT OF BUDGET AUTHORITY AND RELATED ITEMS
The resolution does not provide new budget authority, new
spending authority, new credit authority, or an increase or de-
crease in revenues or tax expenditures and a statement under
House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(2) and section 308(a)(1) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 is not required.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
In compliance with House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(3), the Com-
mittee states that the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
did not submit a cost estimate and comparison under section 402
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
On January 3, 2025, Jrmar Jefferson (‘‘Contestant’’) filed a No-
tice of Contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives pur-
suant to the Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA).1 Contestant
ran as a Libertarian for the office of Representative to the United
States Congress representing the Thirtieth Congressional District
of the State of Texas in the November 5, 2024, general election.
The other principal candidate for the Thirtieth Congressional Dis-
trict was incumbent Democrat Jasmine Crockett (‘‘Contestee’’). On
November 25, 2024, the Texas Secretary of State, Jane Nelson,
along with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, issued a Certificate of
Election to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, certifying
Contestee as the winner of the Thirtieth Congressional District.
BASIS OF CONTEST
In his Notice of Contest, Contestant alleges that the official ap-
plication for office filed by Contestee was flawed due to its inclu-
sion of a non-Texas or ‘‘out of state’’ notary, in violation of Texas
state law. Contestant further alleged that Contestee’s post filing
activities are thus unlawful and fraudulent.
STANDING
To have standing under the FCEA, a contestant must have been
a candidate for election to the House of Representatives in the last
preceding election and claim a right to the Contestee’s seat.2 Con-
testant was the Libertarian nominee and his name appeared as a
candidate for the Thirtieth Congressional District on the official
ballot for the November 5, 2024 election, thereby satisfying the
standing requirement.
TIMING/NOTICE
FCEA requires that a contestant ‘‘shall, within thirty days after
the result of such election shall have been declared by the officer
or Board of Canvassers authorized by law to declare such result,
file with the Clerk and serve upon the contestee written notice of
his intention to contest such election.’’3 The Notice of Contest was
12 U.S.C. §§381–96.
22 U.S.C. §382(a).

filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives on January 3,
2025, which is after the statutory deadline prescribed by the FCEA.
ANALYSIS
The Committee finds that Contestant has failed to timely file his
notice of contest with the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
Under the FCEA, the deadline to file for Contestant to file with the
Clerk of the House of Representatives to contest this election would
have been December 25, 2024, 30 days after the Secretary of State
and Governor of Texas officially certified the election results for
this contest. Contestant filed his notice of contest with the Clerk
on January 3, 2025, a date occurring after the prescribed time pe-
riod, therefore the Committee finds that this claim must be dis-
missed due to untimely filing.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Committee therefore con-
cludes that this contest should be dismissed.
