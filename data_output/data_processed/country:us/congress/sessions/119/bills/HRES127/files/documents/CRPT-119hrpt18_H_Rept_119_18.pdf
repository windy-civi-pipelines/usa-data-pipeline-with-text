I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H. Res. 127 requests that the Secretary of the Treasury provide
the House of Representatives with documents related to: the access
to, or usage of, the Treasury payment systems by the Department
of Government Efficiency (‘‘DOGE’’), Elon Musk, or any member of
his team; access to, or usage of, confidential tax returns or return
information protected by Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue
Code by DOGE, Elon Musk, or any member of his team; and,
screenshots taken of Treasury payments systems data or records by
DOGE, Elon Musk, or any member of his team.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
On February 12, 2025, H. Res. 127 was introduced by Represent-
ative Lloyd Doggett. H. Res. 127 is a resolution of inquiry, which
is a method infrequently used by the House of Representatives to
obtain certain factual information from the Executive Branch.
Under clause 7 of rule XIII, a resolution of inquiry is subject to a
motion to discharge from committee if the resolution is not re-
ported by the committee to which it was referred within 14 legisla-
tive days of its introduction. Accordingly, the Committee on Ways
and Means scheduled a markup of H. Res. 127 within the 14-day
period.
The Committee reported the resolution unfavorably because sev-
eral weeks ago, the Treasury Department and the White House
signed a memorandum of understanding that prohibits DOGE from
accessing personal taxpayer data.1 According to public reports, the
memorandum of understanding includes ‘‘all protections’’ and
DOGE will have read-only access to anonymized tax data, the same
access granted to academic researchers and information technology
professionals who work on IRS systems.2 Democrats have not pro-
vided any evidence to suggest that DOGE’s access to Treasury’s
payment systems could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of tax-
payer information.
Those who have raised concerns about the unlawful disclosure of
taxpayer information should be equally concerned with when
ProPublica and The New York Times used illegally obtained tax-
payer information to publish stories attacking Americans who had
their data stolen.3 This resolution is nothing more than manufac-

VII. DISSENTING VIEWS
Americans’ right to privacy is under attack. Privacy is next to
liberty in our democratic system, yet the President and his billion-
aire cabinet are jeopardizing that value for their own power and
enrichment. This Resolution of Inquiry (ROI) is an important step
in ensuring Congress continues its important job of oversight over
the Executive Branch.
Elon Musk and the so-called, faux ‘‘Department of Government
Efficiency’’ (DOGE) have accessed, and are attempting to access,
millions of Americans’ personal and confidential information with-
out anyone knowing exactly what data they accessed and copied,
how the data is or will be used, and the names, clearance levels,
and training of the individuals accessing this data. This is an ex-
treme breach of privacy.
This ROI asks for documents related to DOGE’s access to, and
usage of: (1) the Treasury payment systems, (2) confidential tax-
payer information protected by federal tax law, and (3) screenshots
taken of Treasury payment systems’ data by a member of DOGE.
Mr. Musk and members of DOGE are ignoring two federal pri-
vacy laws: (1) Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code and (2)
the Privacy Act of 1974. Section 6103 provides that tax returns and
return information shall be confidential unless an exception ap-
plies. The term ‘‘return information’’ is very broad and includes,
among other things, a taxpayer’s name, address, social security
number, and nearly all information received or collected by the In-
ternal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to a tax return. Unau-
thorized disclosure of tax returns or return information is a felony
and is punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or imprisonment
of not more than 5 years, or both.
As the court noted in Comm. on Ways & Means, U.S. House of
Representatives v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 575 F. Supp. 3d.53, 59–
60 (D.D.C. 2021), Section 6103 was expanded after President Nixon
issued two executive orders authorizing the Department of Agri-
culture to inspect for ‘‘statistical purposes’’ the tax returns of all
farmers. Congress objected, and President Nixon revoked the or-
ders. More troubling to Congress, however, was that members of
the Nixon White House obtained IRS records, including tax re-
turns, for many of President Nixon’s political opponents. These rev-
elations worried the House committee members enough that they
proposed an article of impeachment alleging that President Nixon
had violated the constitutional rights of taxpayers.
As referenced above, Mr. Musk and DOGE are also ignoring the
Privacy Act, which was designed to provide individuals with more
control over the gathering, dissemination, and accuracy of agency
information about themselves. See Alliance for Retired Americans,
et al., v. Bessent, United States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia (Case No. 25–03013) (Mar. 7, 2025). It was Congress’s re-

sponse to a growing awareness that governmental agencies were
accumulating an ever-expanding stockpile of information about pri-
vate individuals that was readily susceptible to both misuse and
the perpetuation of inaccuracies that the citizen would never know
of, let alone have an opportunity to rebut or correct.
The Privacy Act imposes burdens on federal agencies and creates
rights for individuals when agencies collect, maintain, use, and dis-
seminate information about an individual. It provides criminal pen-
alties for willful violations of its requirements. Notably, it is also
a federal crime for any person to request or obtain any record con-
cerning an individual from an agency under false pretenses.
Courts rightfully have been concerned about the misuse of ever-
expanding information that government agencies accumulate about
private citizens. Let’s consider the personal and confidential infor-
mation that DOGE has or is attempting to access.
Members of DOGE first gained access to the Treasury Depart-
ment and its payment systems operated by the Bureau of the Fis-
cal Service (BFS). These payment systems contain extensive details
about individual recipients of federal payments. For any given
payee, these details may include: name; social security number;
employer identification number, or other agency identification or
account number; date and location of birth; physical and/or elec-
tronic mailing address; telephone numbers; payment amount; date
of issuance; trace number or other payment identification number,
such as Treasury check number and symbol; financial institution
information, including the routing number of his or her financial
institution and the payee’s account number at the financial institu-
tion; and vendor contract and/or purchase order number.
Next, members of DOGE gained access to the IRS and sought
broad access to the most sensitive IRS data systems, which are pro-
tected under Section 6103. According to reports, this broad access
gave DOGE the ability to ‘‘read’’ the data, and in some cases even
were granted ‘‘read/write access’’, to detailed information—includ-
ing bank accounts, payment balances, Social Security and other
personal identification numbers and, in some instances, medical in-
formation—on virtually every individual, business, and nonprofit in
the country. After multiple media reports and lawsuits on this
issue, the President and Treasury Department officials ‘‘agreed’’ to
prohibit DOGE from accessing personal taxpayer data.
Despite this agreement, we know that DOGE successfully gained
this information another way by accessing personal and confiden-
tial worker and taxpayer information at the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS). The HHS holds the National Directory
of New Hires (NDNH). The NDNH contains information about
every wage earner in the United States and their employers, in-
cluding wages, employer tax identification numbers, social security
numbers, verified dates of birth, addresses, unemployment insur-
ance benefit information, and other information derived from IRS
wage forms. By gaining this information, DOGE essentially made
an end-runaround the confidential taxpayer information protected
by the IRS.
It is both unclear and unsettling why DOGE continues to seek
access to private and confidential information at agencies across
government, behind closed doors, while telling the public something

different. No one should be rummaging around in the confidential
information of private citizens at any agency where protected infor-
mation resides. This is especially true for unaccountable and
unelected people with no experience in managing or auditing gov-
ernment systems and programs.
The risks are real, Americans’ personal data could be leaked,
lost, sold, or used to enrich a few. Identity theft is a threat that
too many Americans have already experienced. Thus, it is impera-
tive that we receive information requested in this ROI.
The President and Elon Musk should be answering the questions
members of Congress and the American people are asking: what
data they are harvesting, who is harvesting it, and what do they
plan to do with it. Executive oversight is a fundamental responsi-
bility of Congress. Passing this resolution would have helped to en-
sure transparency in our government. Yet the Majority voted to re-
ject this resolution, allowing the executive branch to hide in the
darkness from the American people and from Congress, unchecked
as they rifle through the people’s data.
For these reasons, we believe our Majority colleagues were wrong
to adversely report this ROI to the full House of Representatives.
Sincerely,
RICHARD E. NEAL,
Ranking Member.

DISSENTING VIEWS
Today’s markup of these two Resolutions of Inquiry is an impor-
tant step in ensuring Congress continues its important job of over-
sight over the executive branch. Let’s be clear: what we are seeking
today is simply transparency from the Trump Administration and
DOGE as to what they have done behind closed doors at agencies
that carry sensitive, personal information of every American tax-
payer. We are just looking for information. Passing these resolu-
tions would ensure transparency in our government, rejecting them
would allow the executive branch to hide in the darkness from the
American people and from Congress, unchecked as they rifle
through the people’s data.
It is important that as members of Congress that we continue
using every tool available to conduct necessary oversight of the
Trump Administration for the good of the American people. It is
both unclear and unsettling why DOGE continues to seek access to
private and confidential information at agencies across government
behind closed doors while telling the public something different. No
one should be rummaging around in the confidential information of
private citizens at any agency where protected information resides.
Privacy is next to liberty in our Democratic system, yet the Presi-
dent and his billionaire cabinet are jeopardizing that standard for
their own power and enrichment, and House Republicans haven’t
so much as raised an eyebrow. Americans should know this: every
time this Administration threatens the health and well-being of the
American people, Ways and Means Democrats will be there fight-
ing and sounding the alarm. I applaud Ranking Member Doggett
and Ranking Member Larson for their steadfast leadership in hold-
ing DOGE accountable and protecting the American people’s data.
What we have seen over the last 7 weeks is unacceptable. Unac-
countable and unelected people with no experience in the systems
of our government have been rifling through the people’s data.
Under a false guise of finding waste, fraud, and abuse, they are
seeking to dismantle institutions that tens of millions rely on. It’s
unfortunate we even have to mark up these resolutions today. The
President and Elon Musk should be answering the questions mem-
bers of Congress, and the American people are asking, what data
they are harvesting, who is harvesting it, and what they plan to
do with it. Executive oversight is a fundamental responsibility of
Congress, and Democrats are stepping up when Republicans won’t.
In fact, yesterday, our colleagues stripped this body of one of these
fundamental Constitutional obligations—oversight of the Executive
Branch on trade.
The Courts have spoken, putting limits on what DOGE is al-
lowed to access and tamper with. Yet, as we have seen recently,
DOGE representatives aren’t taking no for an answer. Now, they
are attempting to use a database at HHS as a back door entrance.

Trump and his allies have made clear that Americans’ private and
sensitive information is theirs to harvest and profit off of.
All the while, Republicans have been silent, and in some cases,
defending the invasions. But that’s not surprising. For years, Re-
publicans have been gunning for and fearmongering against benefit
programs in America, looking to weaken Social Security and Medi-
care’s brands as an excuse to destroy them.
The President and House Republicans are the greatest threat to
Social Security, which stands proudly as a bedrock for our seniors
and our nation’s economic security. They call it a Ponzi scheme. A
scam. The next ‘big thing’ to be cut. Democrats call it a promise.
An earned benefit. Something no billionaire or unelected and unac-
countable robber baron should have their hands on. Democrats are
fighting to protect the 70 million Social Security beneficiaries from
an out-of-control executive branch, and to protect the sensitive data
of every American.
Congress and the American people deserve answers to what is
happening behind closed doors at Social Security, Treasury, and
every government agency that has found itself in DOGE’s cross-
hairs. While Republicans might be too scared to ask the hard ques-
tions, afraid to find themselves on the wrong end of a social media
storm, Democrats will stand up, fight for the American people
against this gross executive overreach and get them answers they
deserve.
Sincerely,
RICHARD E. NEAL,
Ranking Member.
