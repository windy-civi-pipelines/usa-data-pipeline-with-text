on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 1402 requires sellers of event tick-
ets, on the primary and secondary markets, to disclose comprehen-
sive information to consumers about ticket prices, seat saver pro-
grams, and refunds. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will en-
force the provisions of the Act.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
According to the Wall Street Journal, nearly 60 percent of Ameri-
cans have had to cut back on spending on live entertainment be-
cause of rising costs, with 37 percent of survey respondents saying
they can’t keep up with the rising price of events they would like
to attend, and 20 percent being willing to take out debt to continue
to afford their favorite entertainment activities.1
Junk fees, associated with event ticketing, often mislead or con-
fuse consumers. Such fees, which often seem like they should be in-
cluded in the total price, are a way of increasing prices without in-
creasing prices.2 Consumers find these prices to be annoying, and
that they lack transparency leading to material information being
omitted from pricing information.3 This often harms consumers
who are price shopping for the best value. The worst part of these
fees are that they are often levied after the checkout process has
been completed. One expert, Jeff Galak, a professor of marketing
at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, ex-
plained that ‘‘[b]y the time the fee is tacked on, it’s too late . . .
It’s either actually too late, like ‘I’m standing at the hotel check-
in desk, I don’t have a choice anymore.’ Or it’s apparently too
late.’’4
By requiring sellers of event tickets on the primary and sec-
ondary markets to disclose comprehensive information to con-
sumers about ticket prices, seat saver programs, refunds, and curb-
ing deceptive websites claiming to sell event tickets, H.R. 1402 will
enhance the transparency of the ticketing market for consumers.
Additionally, it will provide an enforcement mechanism for fake
and deceptive websites claiming to be selling legitimate event tick-
ets.
COMMITTEE ACTION
On September 27, 2023, the Subcommittee on Innovation, Data,
and Commerce held a hearing entitled ‘‘Proposals to Enhance Prod-
uct Safety and Transparency for Americans’’ on the TICKET Act,
as well as a discussion draft to address speculative ticketing re-
forms. The Subcommittee received testimony from:

tion;

Section 2. All inclusive ticket price disclosure
Section 2 makes it unlawful, beginning 180 days after enact-
ment, for a ticket issuer, secondary market ticket issuer, or sec-
ondary market ticket exchange to offer for sale an event ticket un-
less the issuer or exchange: (1) clearly and conspicuously displays
the total event ticket price; (2) clearly and conspicuously discloses
to a prospective purchaser the total event ticket price the first time
the price is displayed and anytime thereafter throughout the ticket
buying process; and (3) provides an itemized list of the base event
ticket price and each ticket fee prior to the completion of the pur-
chase of a ticket.
Section 3. Speculative ticketing ban
Section 3 prohibits, beginning 180 days of enactment, an issuer
or ticket exchange from selling, offering for sale, or advertising
such sale of an event ticket for a ticket that the issuer or exchange
does not have actual or constructive possession of. This section does
not prohibit an issuer or exchange from offering a service to con-
sumers to obtain an event ticket on behalf of the consumer so long
as the issuer or exchange complies with the following: (1) does not
list the service as an event ticket; (2) maintains clear, distinct, and
easily discernable separation between the service and event tickets
that persists throughout the entire service selection and purchasing
process; and (3) clearly and conspicuously discloses before selection
of the service that the service is not an event ticket and the pur-
chase of such a service does not guarantee an event ticket.
Section 4. Disclosures
Section 4 states that issuers and exchanges must: (1) provide a
clear and conspicuous statement before purchase that the issuer or
exchange is engaged in the secondary sale of tickets; (2) not state
that the issuer or exchange is affiliated with or endorsed by a
venue, team, or artist, unless such a partnership agreement has
been executed; and (3) shall not use a domain name or any sub-
domain thereof, in the URL of the issuer or exchange that contains
the name of a venue unless authorized by the owner.
Section 5. Refund requirements
Section 5 details minimum refund requirements in the event of
a cancellation or postponement of an event, including full refunds
for cancelled events and replacement tickets for postponed events.
It requires disclosure of guarantee and refund policy, in addition to
how to obtain a refund required by the Act. It takes effect 180 days
after enactment.
Section 6. Report by the Federal Trade Commission on BOTS Act
of 2016 enforcement
Section 6 requires the Federal Trade Commission to submit a re-
port to Congress on the enforcement of the Better Online Ticket
Sales Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 114–275; 15 U.S.C. 45c), including any
enforcement action taken, challenges with enforcement and coordi-
