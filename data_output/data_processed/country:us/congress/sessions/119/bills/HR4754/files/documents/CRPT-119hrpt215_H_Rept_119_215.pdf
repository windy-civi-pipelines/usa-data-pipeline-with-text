HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL
The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee
has jurisdiction over a diverse group of agencies responsible for
managing Federal lands and national parks, protecting the envi-
ronment, reinforcing the Federal commitments to honor our trust
and treaty responsibilities to American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives, and supporting the arts and humanities. The activities of
these agencies are integral to the operations of our government.
The bill provides a total of $37,971,000,000 in discretionary
budget authority for fiscal year 2026.
Within the level of funding provided, the bill fully funds the Pay-
ments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, as well as Contract Sup-
port Costs and 105(l) lease costs, and prioritizes funding for Tribes,
domestic energy production, and Wildland Fire Management activi-
ties.
The bill provides $2,904,247,000 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA). Within this funding, the bill prioritizes Public Safety and
Justice activities and provides a total of $771,836,000 for fiscal
year 2026. The bill also provides $1,530,883,000 for the Bureau of
Indian Education (BIE) and $8,405,509,000 for the Indian Health
Service (IHS). In addition, the bill provides a fiscal year 2027 ad-
vance appropriations of $6,047,037,000 for the Indian Health Serv-
ice.
In addition to limiting spending, the bill continues several impor-
tant policy provisions from previous years to:
• Prohibit funds for EPA to impose mandatory reporting of
greenhouse gas emissions from manure management systems.
• Prohibit funds to regulate the lead content of ammunition
or fishing tackle under the Toxic Substances Control Act or
any other Act.
• Prohibit funds for EPA to implement permitting require-
ments for livestock emissions under the Clean Air Act.
• Require the Administration to implement policies that re-
flect the carbon neutrality of forest biomass.
• Restrict funding for acquisition of lands or interests in
lands from being used for declarations of taking or complaints
in condemnation.
• Prohibit funds for computer networks unless it blocks ac-
cess to pornography.
• Require the use of American iron and steel in EPA safe
drinking water projects.
And the bill adds new provisions to:
• Provide continued access to our public lands by blocking
restrictions on hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on
Federal lands and ensure multiple-use of these lands by stop-

ping the prior administration’s ‘‘Conservation and Landscape
Health’’ rule.
• Unleash America’s vast energy resources by reinstating
leases for critical minerals; requiring the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to resume onshore oil and gas lease sales; and conduct off-
shore lease sales in the Central Gulf of America Planning
Area, the Western Gulf of America Planning Area, and in the
Alaska region.
• Block job killing regulations from the prior Administration
related to power plants, ozone, and car regulations on light,
medium, and heavy-duty vehicles that would increase costs
and electricity prices for Americans.
• Block multiple U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rulings from
the prior Administration used to stifle access to land and en-
ergy production.
• Ensure that ancillary mining activities, including explo-
ration operations and construction of a mine access road, are
permitted with or without the discovery of a valuable mineral
deposit (a fix to the Rosemont decision).
• Advance forest and land management projects by address-
ing the Cottonwood Environmental Law Center v. United States
Forest Service decision.
• Prohibit Federal agencies from using the social cost of car-
bon in any rulemaking, guidance document, or environmental
decision-making process.
• Provide regulatory certainty to farmers, producers, and im-
pacted industries by clarifying pesticide labeling.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The following are the procedures governing reprogramming ac-
tions for programs and activities funded in the Department of the
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
The agencies funded in this Act are reminded that these re-
programming guidelines are in effect, and must be complied with.
Definitions. ‘‘Reprogramming’’ as defined in these procedures, in-
cludes the reallocation of funds from one budget activity, budget
line-item, or program area to another within any appropriation
funded in this Act.
For construction, land acquisition, and forest legacy accounts, a
reprogramming constitutes the reallocation of funds, including un-
obligated balances, from one construction, land acquisition, or for-
est legacy project to another such project. For fiscal year 2026, a
reprogramming also includes the list of Federal land acquisition
projects required to be submitted to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations pursuant to Section 428(a)(2) of this Act.
A reprogramming shall also consist of any significant departure
from the program described in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes all proposed reorganizations or other workforce ac-
tions detailed below which affect a total of 10 staff members or 10
percent of the staffing of an affected program or office, whichever
is less, even without a change in funding. Any change to the orga-
nization table presented in the budget justification shall also be
subject to this requirement.
Agencies are reminded that this bill continues longstanding Gen-
eral Guidelines for Reprogramming that require agencies funded by

this Act to submit reorganization proposals for the Committees’ re-
view prior to their implementation. It is noted that such re-
programming guidelines apply to proposed reorganizations, work-
force restructure, reshaping, transfer of functions, or bureau-wide
downsizing and include closures, consolidations, and relocations of
offices, facilities, and laboratories. In addition, no agency shall im-
plement any part of a reorganization that modifies regional or state
boundaries for agencies or bureaus that were in effect as of the
date of enactment of this Act unless approved, consistent with the
General Guidelines for Reprogramming procedures specified herein.
Any such reprogramming request submitted to the Committee shall
include a description of anticipated benefits, including anticipated
efficiencies and cost-savings, as well as a description of anticipated
personnel impacts and funding changes anticipated to implement
the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only when an unfore-
seen situation arises, and then only if postponement of the
project or the activity until the next appropriation year would
result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be deferred through
reprogramming, shall not later be accomplished by means of
further reprogramming, but instead, funds should again be
sought for the deferred project or activity through the regular
appropriations process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situations, reprogramming
should not be employed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by Congress, or to de-
crease allocations specifically increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to the Committee
for approval will be considered as expeditiously as possible,
and the Committee remind the agencies that in order to proc-
ess reprogramming requests, adequate and timely information
must be provided.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogramming must be submitted
to the Committee in writing prior to implementation if it exceeds
$1,000,000 annually or results in an increase or decrease of more
than 10 percent annually in affected programs or projects, which-
ever amount is less, with the following exceptions:
(a) With regard to the Tribal priority allocations of the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education
(BIE), there is no restriction on reprogrammings among these
programs. However, the Bureaus shall report on all
reprogrammings made during a given fiscal year no later than
60 days after the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, the Committee does not require
reprogramming requests associated with the States and Tribes
Partnership Grants or up to a cumulative total of $5,000,000
from carryover balances among the individual program areas
delineated in the Environmental Programs and Management
account, with no more than $1,000,000 coming from any indi-
vidual program area. No funds, however, shall be reallocated
from individual Geographic Programs.
(c) With regard to the National Park Service (NPS), the
Committee does not require reprogramming requests associ-

ated with the park base within the Park Management activity
in the Operation of the National Park System Account. The
NPS is required to brief the Committee on spending trends for
the park base not later than 60 days following the enactment
of this Act.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in these procedures shall
refer to any charges, reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget ac-
tivity or budget line-item for costs associated with general agency
administrative costs, overhead costs, working capital expenses, or
contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against any program,
budget activity, subactivity, budget line item, or project funded
by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act unless such assessment and the basis therefore are
presented to the Committee in the budget justifications and
are subsequently approved by the Committee. The explanation
for any assessment in the budget justification shall show the
amount of the assessment, the activities assessed, and the pur-
pose of the funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assessments, as such esti-
mates were presented in annual budget justifications, shall be
submitted through the reprogramming process and shall be
subject to the same dollar and reporting criteria as any other
reprogramming.
(c) Each agency or bureau which utilizes assessments shall
submit an annual report to the Committee, which provides de-
tails on the use of all funds assessed from any other budget ac-
tivity, line-item, subactivity, or project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or assessments be
used to finance projects and activities disapproved or limited
by Congress or to finance programs or activities that could be
foreseen and included in the normal budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget should not be ini-
tiated before enactment of the bill without notification to, and
the approval of, the Committee. This restriction applies to all
such actions regardless of whether a formal reprogramming of
funds is required to begin the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings between budget activi-
ties, budget line-items, program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this bill, including those below the monetary
thresholds established above, shall be reported to the Committee
within 60 days of the end of each quarter and shall include cumu-
lative totals for each budget activity or budget line-item, or con-
struction, land acquisition, or forest legacy project.
Legacy.—Lands shall not be acquired for more than the approved
appraised value, as addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–
646, unless such acquisitions are submitted to the Committee for
approval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, wherein the estimated value
of the Federal lands to be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000,
shall not be consummated until the Committee has had 30 days in
which to examine the proposed exchange. In addition, the Com-
mittee shall be provided advance notification of exchanges valued
between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

Budget Structure.—The budget activity or line-item structure for
any agency appropriation account shall not be altered without ad-
vance approval of the Committee.
OTHER COMMITTEE DIRECTION
Acreage Treated.—The Committee recognizes the Department of
the Interior and the Forest Service’s intention to moving beyond
acreage treated as a performance metric towards outcome-focused
measurements that accurately reflect the impact of the agencies’
forest restoration work on wildfire risk reduction and ecosystem re-
silience. The Committee believes that utilizing proven, existing,
commercially available advanced decision support tools and ana-
lytics are important for accomplishing this task and evaluating the
real-world outcomes of forest treatments and ensuring Federal in-
vestments yield the highest returns in terms of risk mitigation and
ecosystem health. The Committee directs the Forest Service, in co-
ordination with the Department of the Interior, to provide the
Committee an update not later than 45 days following the enact-
ment of this Act regarding how the agencies will report on out-
comes beyond acres treated and what decision support tools, espe-
cially those that are already commercially available, are needed to
accomplish this task.
Advertising.—The Committee directs all agencies to include ad-
vertising contracting information in its fiscal year 2027 budget jus-
tification, including total obligations in fiscal year 2025 and ex-
pected obligations for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 for advertising
services, and contracts for the advertising services with small busi-
nesses. For small businesses, both prime contracts and sub-
contracts, the agency shall identify obligations associated with
small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, service-disabled
veteran-owned small businesses, women owned small businesses,
and HUBZone small businesses. The agency shall also report if it
has met its small business goals in each of these categories in fiscal
year 2025.
All of the Above Energy.—The Committee recognizes the dra-
matic load growth on the electric grid over the next decade. The
Committee recognizes that in order to increase energy production
to avoid blackouts, an all of the above energy policy will be nec-
essary to promote grid reliability and security. The Committee di-
rects the Department of the Interior to conduct permitting proc-
esses as required by statute for all energy sources in order to pro-
mote grid reliability and security in a timely manner.
Bighorn Sheep.—The Committee is aware that the Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) use the Western Asso-
ciation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ occupied bighorn habitat
maps, telemetry data, and recent bighorn observations in con-
ducting Risk of Contact analyses and that risk of contact models
are currently being run on a State-wide basis where sufficient data
exists. The Committee directs the agencies to complete Risk of Con-
tact analyses using the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife
Agencies’ data. The Committee expects the agencies to continue to
share findings transparently and promptly with other Federal land
management agencies, State and local governments, State wildlife
agencies, and State and Federal animal health professionals, in-
cluding the Agricultural Research Service, permittees, and stake-

holders. The Committee further directs the Forest Service and
BLM to engage the Agricultural Research Service and the afore-
mentioned cooperating agencies and participants to ensure the best
professional scientific understanding of where and if disease trans-
mission occurs, and the degree of that risk, before making further
management decisions that impact permittees.
Bird Collisions on Federal Property.—The Committee encourages
all agencies funded by this Act to continue to advance best prac-
tices to enhance protections for avian species and continues direc-
tion provided in House Report 117–400 regarding bird collisions.
Cost of Litigation and Lack of Transparency.—The Committee is
concerned that many of the legitimate goals of the Forest Service,
EPA and the Department of the Interior jurisdiction are under-
mined by litigation filed in an effort to shift land management deci-
sions from the agencies to the courts, regardless of merit. It is ap-
parent that many activist groups are using the Federal court sys-
tem to stop any activities they do not support.
The Committee is also concerned with litigation costs funded
with agency discretionary appropriations and settlement’s funded
through the mandatory Judgment Fund. Accordingly, the Com-
mittee directs the Department of the Interior, EPA, and the Forest
Service to make publicly available, and include with each agency’s
annual budget submission thereafter, the following information: de-
tailed reports on the amount of discretionary program funds used;
detailed reports on the amount of mandatory funds from Judgment
Fund; the names of the fee recipients; the names of the Federal
judges; the disposition of the applications (including any appeals of
action taken on the applications); and the hourly rates of attorneys
and expert witnesses stated in the applications that was awarded,
for all Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) fee payments awarded
as a result of litigation against any of the Department of the Inte-
rior bureaus, EPA, or the Forest Service, or their respective em-
ployees. The report shall also include the information listed above
for litigation relating to the Endangered Species Act and the
amounts, outside of EAJA awards, paid in settlement for all litiga-
tion, regardless of the statute litigated.
In addition, the Committee is concerned by the lack of trans-
parency when a settlement is sealed. The Committee believes the
public has a right to know the resolution to court actions and how
taxpayer funds are used. To that end, the Committee directs the
Department of the Interior, EPA, and the Forest Service to report
to the Committee quarterly on the number of claims or judgments
against each agency that have been awarded and are under seal.
Customer Service.—The Committee directs all agencies funded by
this Act to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, includ-
ing the development of their organizational priority goals and out-
comes such as performance outcome measures, output measures,
efficiency measures, and customer service measures, as well as de-
veloping standards to improve customer service and incorporation
of the standards into the performance plans. The Departments of
the Interior, the Indian Health Service, the Forest Service, and the
EPA shall report on these efforts not later than 60 days following
the enactment of this Act.
Digitalization Technologies.—The Committee encourages agen-
cies, where applicable, to explore opportunities to help communities

incorporate digitalization technologies to increase the resiliency of
their infrastructure, enhance safety, and improve accessibility.
Funding.—The Committee notes that no funding is provided for
the American Climate Corps, ecogrief training, or environmental
justice activities.
Giant Sequoias.—The Committee remains concerned that over
the past several years, catastrophic wildfires in the State of Cali-
fornia have killed up to nineteen percent of all giant sequoias in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The Committee is aware that the
Forest Service and National Park Service are currently conducting
fuels reduction projects using emergency authorities in multiple
giant sequoia groves. The Committee directs the National Park
Service and Forest Service to continue to expedite these projects to
reduce the risk of wildfire-related mortality of giant sequoias and
to expand the use of these emergency authorities in additional
giant sequoia groves.
Hardrock Minerals.—The Committee recognizes that the need for
hardrock and rare earth mineral production is rising as technology
advances. Given price volatility and the People’s Republic of Chi-
na’s weaponization of its dominance in hardrock mineral supply
chains, the Committee directs agencies funded by this Act to in-
crease domestic production of hardrock and rare earth minerals to
improve the security and resilience of its supply chains for ad-
vanced technologies, while simultaneously promoting domestic job
growth and economic development.
Not later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act, the
Committee directs the Department of the Interior Office of the Sec-
retary, in coordination with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
other applicable Department of the Interior bureaus and Federal
agencies, and private enterprise, to provide a report to the Com-
mittee and relevant authorizing committees of jurisdiction out-
lining plans to advance a financial support mechanism using loans,
contract-for-differences, offtake backstops, market maker, and ad-
vance market commitments to mitigate price risks in varied domes-
tically mined or processed hardrock minerals. Consistent with Sec-
tion 7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 (30 U.S. Code Sec. 1606), agen-
cies should focus on hardrock minerals that are essential to the
economic or national security of the United States; the supply
chain of which is vulnerable to disruption; and serve an essential
function in the manufacturing of a product, the absence of which
would have significant consequences for the economic or national
security of the United States. As part of this report, the agencies
should discuss the additional authorities USGS and other agencies
funded by this Act may need to advance this work, potential cost
estimates, and the possibility of including additional items, such as
those that support domestic fertilizer production, on the next list
of critical minerals published by the Secretary of the Interior.
Agencies should also highlight potential opportunities to leverage
private enterprise and markets.
Indian Country—Narcotics Reduction Task Force.—The Com-
mittee directs the Department of the Interior to enter into agree-
ments with the Department of Justice and the Department of
Homeland Security to institute an expanded version of the Agency’s
Opioid Reduction Task Force created in March 2018. The Narcotics
Reduction Task Force’s goal will be to dismantle and disrupt

opioid, heroin, and other dangerous drug distribution networks in
Indian Country by identifying individuals involved in their trans-
portation, sale, distribution, and use based on intelligence obtained
from cooperating sources, law enforcement interdiction activities,
and current and historical drug trends, and to use that obtained in-
formation to further complex drug investigations targeting those
identified distribution networks. The Committee directs the De-
partment to submit a report on the task force not later than 60
days following the enactment of this Act and includes additional
funding direction within the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).—With the August
4, 2020, enactment of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public
Law 116–152), Congress provided a permanent appropriation of
$900,000,000 per year. The Act also mandated that account alloca-
tions and detailed project information be proposed by the Adminis-
tration each year through the annual budget submission, and that
such allocations, following review by the Committee, may be modi-
fied through an alternate allocation.
A table showing an LWCF alternate allocation by agency and ac-
count for the Department of the Interior, and an alternate alloca-
tion by account and project for the U.S. Forest Service, including
lists of specific Federal land acquisition projects and Forest Legacy
Program projects, is included at the end of this report.
Because the fiscal year 2026 budget request submitted by the Of-
fice of Management and Budget (OMB) did not contain allocations
for additional federal land acquisition projects, or detailed informa-
tion about specific projects, for the Department of the Interior, the
bill contains language requiring the Department of the Interior to
provide a list of individual projects, in the same format and level
of detail as prior years, totaling the alternate allocation as provided
in the table at the end of this report for ‘‘Federal Land Acquisition
Projects’’ to each federal land management agency, and requires
this list to be subject to reprogramming guidelines.
The bill does not include the proposal requested in the OMB’s
budget request to amend Section 200306 of title 54 to authorize
funding for deferred maintenance projects.
Consistent with prior years, the Committee will review and re-
vise, as appropriate, any revisions to the requested list of Federal
land acquisition projects and Forest Legacy Program projects under
the LWCF for fiscal year 2026 prior to enactment of this Act.
The Committee is aware that prior-year project data sheets ac-
companying the annual budget submission are not always the
projects that are completed for the Federal land listed in the ac-
count allocation table, particularly for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. While the Committee appreciates and understands that
shifting projects may be necessary given the timeline between the
release of the budget and receipt of LWCF funds, the Committee
is concerned that Congress is not fully aware of the intended use
of LWCF funding in instances where projects shift. Therefore, the
bill includes language requiring the Department of the Interior and
U.S. Forest Service to notify the Committee prior to expending
LWCF funding on a project within the federal land unit or bound-
ary funded in this, or any prior, allocation table that is different
than the specific project tract described in the associated project

data sheet for the project listed in this, or any prior, allocation
table.
The Committee includes bill language allowing the NPS to use
up to 7 percent of the funds provided for State Conservation Grants
as matching grants to support State program administrative costs.
These funds will provide states with additional support to cover ad-
ministrative costs associated with the program, which have in-
creased in recent years. The NPS is to apportion these funds to the
states, District of Columbia, and insular areas on the basis of need
as matching grants to support State administrative costs. Not later
than 60 days following the enactment of this Act, the Committee
directs the Department of the Interior to report on the number of
grants awarded and the amount of each grant awarded.
The Committee supports the Department of the Interior’s pilot
program to return limited appraisal functions to the Bureaus and
directs the Department to provide the resources necessary to sup-
port the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
pilot program. The Committee further directs the Department to
inform the Committee if additional authority is needed to transfer
funds between accounts to effectively implement the pilot program.
The Committee encourages the Department of the Interior and
the U.S. Forest Service to prioritize recreation access projects that
improve access to public lands that may be surrounded by non-pub-
lic lands, which can sometimes be addressed with acquisition of
small parcels.
The Committee is aware of efforts by the Department to review
the subsurface rights within the Big Cypress National Preserve
and Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and supports the
continuation of these efforts.
As specified in the table accompanying this report, fiscal year
2026 funds allocated to the U.S. Forest Service for the Chattahoo-
chee-Oconee National Forest shall not be used to acquire land or
easements in Georgia’s 9th congressional district.
As specified in the table accompanying this report, fiscal year
2026 funds allocated to the U.S. Forest Service for the Cherokee
National Forest shall not be used to acquire land or easements in
Virginia’s 9th congressional district.
The Committee is concerned that Federal restrictions were incor-
rectly applied by the National Park Service to the entirety of City
Park in New Orleans. The Committee directs the Service to evalu-
ate whether current restrictions are appropriate and, if not, revise
such restrictions in a timely manner. The Committee directs the
Service to brief the Committee not later than 90 days following the
enactment of this Act on its evaluation.
The Committee directs the Forest Service to consistently apply
national appraisal policy, complete timely appraisals, and encour-
age the full partnership of third parties. The Service is directed to
brief the Committee not later than 90 days following the enactment
of this Act regarding updated appraisal and land policies.
Legacy Restoration Fund.—The Committee looks forward to re-
viewing and revising the language in this bill and report, as nec-
essary, if a reauthorization of the Legacy Restoration Fund is en-
acted, which is proposed in the budget request.

The Committee directs each relevant agency to provide a briefing
not later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act outlining
the total amount of current outstanding deferred maintenance.
MAP Land Act.—The Committee supports the implementation of
the Modernizing Access to Our Public Land Act (Public Law 117–
114) and recognizes the role it plays in improving public access to
Federal lands for hunting, fishing, hiking, and other recreational
experiences. The Committee directs the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and
the U.S. Forest Service to prioritize data digitization and public ac-
cess objectives in Public Law 117–114.
Multiple-Use Activities on Federal Lands.—The Committee em-
phasizes that ensuring responsible multiple-use activities on U.S.
Federal lands and waters is the most appropriate use of these nat-
ural resources. Therefore, the Committee urges all Federal agen-
cies, in activities related to the enforcement or promulgation of new
and existing regulations, guidance, policies or initiatives, including
withdrawals, conservation areas, wildlife refuges, and resource
management plans, to adhere to multiple-use principles, as mod-
eled under the various multiple-use statutes contained in U.S.
code.
Marijuana on Public Lands.—The Committee is aware that tres-
passers illegally grow marijuana on public lands in California.
These unlawful activities harmfully impact the public, water, soil,
and wildlife. The Committee supports Forest Service efforts to de-
velop tools to detect and eradicate grow sites, including a potential
remote-sensing survey of Federal public lands to identify grow sites
and allow for the development of cost estimates for reclamation.
The Committee directs the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management to continue to cooperate with State, local, and Tribal
governments on survey, reclamation, and prevention efforts to the
maximum extent possible, including to prevent the displacement of
criminal activities to illegal grow sites on non-Federal lands. Addi-
tionally, the Committee directs each agency to convene and develop
a strategy with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security
to eliminate grow operations that are not sanctioned by State or
Tribal authorities and provide a report to the Committee on its ef-
forts and the estimated cost for reclamation not later than 180
days following the enactment of this Act. Additionally, the Com-
mittee encourages the Forest Service’s Law Enforcement and In-
vestigations to increase the use of novel models for the detection
of illegal marijuana cultivation sites on Forest System land.
Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Prioritization.—
The Committee notes that the National Mall is an important and
symbolic gathering area for millions of visitors every year. The
Committee is concerned with the lack of robust and ubiquitous
wireless communications coverage on the National Mall for public
safety due to the lack of permanent telecommunications infrastruc-
ture on the buildings surrounding the area. To ensure first re-
sponders have the communications tools necessary to keep these
visitors safe, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Smithso-
nian Institution and the Director of the National Gallery of Art to
work expeditiously and in good-faith on efforts towards the nec-
essary completion of building out the FirstNet Network, as estab-
lished in section 6202 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Cre-

ation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1422; Public Law 112–96), on their re-
spective buildings along the National Mall.
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act Compli-
ance.—The Committee remains concerned that compliance with the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990
is still incomplete, and in certain cases compliance has been flaunt-
ed by offenders of the law. Native American Tribal governments
are entitled to timely and professional responses to requests for re-
patriation, and the institutions housing these remains have a legal
and moral obligation to grant those requests. The Committee looks
forward to receiving the report directed in House Report 118–155
requiring the Department of the Interior to develop a strategy to
ensure full enforcement and compliance with the law.
Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).—The PILT program provides
compensation to local governments for the loss of tax revenue re-
sulting from the presence of Federal land in their county or State.
The recommendation includes full funding for PILT for fiscal year
2026 in section 113 of Title I General Provisions.
Public Access.—The Committee directs the Department of the In-
terior and the Forest Service to notify the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations in advance of any proposed project spe-
cifically intending to close an area to recreational shooting, hunt-
ing, or fishing on a nonemergency basis of more than 30 days.
Public Availability of Data—Permits to Drill.—The Committee
directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish on the website of the
Department of the Interior not later than 30 days following the en-
actment of this Act and each month thereafter: the number of
pending and approved applications for permits to drill in the pre-
ceding month nationwide and for each State and field office; and,
with respect to each month during the 5-year period ending on the
date of enactment of this Act, the number of approved and not ap-
proved applications for permits to drill during such a 5-year period.
Public Law 118–234.—Following the enactment of Public Law
118–234, the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experi-
ences (EXPLORE) Act, in January 2025, the Committee directs the
Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service to prioritize
available resources to implement EXPLORE Act provisions to im-
prove accessibility for veterans, members of the military, and indi-
viduals with disabilities; construct target shooting ranges on public
lands; improve data collection across the national parks; restore
overnight camping where appropriate, including in the Ouachita
National Forest; and streamline the permitting process for special
recreation permits.
Range Access.—The Committee recognizes the importance of in-
creasing recreational access to Federal lands and supports the ob-
jectives of the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experi-
ences Act (Public Law 118–234) to improve public access to shoot-
ing ranges on public lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and
the Bureau of Land Management.
Reorganization Proposals.—The Committee notes that the budget
request includes a number of important proposals to reform and re-
organize the Federal Government. The Committee applauds these
efforts to improve efficiency while reducing waste, fraud, and
abuse. The Committee notes that the authorizing committees of ju-
risdiction have not yet had the opportunity to consider these re-

organizational proposals. Accordingly, the Committee’s bill and re-
port reflect the current organizational structure of the agencies
funded herein. The Committee looks forward to working with the
authorizing committees of jurisdiction as they act on the Presi-
dent’s proposed organizational reforms.
As the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service
work to streamline agency operations and reduce overhead costs,
the Committee reminds both agencies of the important role staff
outside the National Capital Region—particularly those at the GS–
10 level and below—play in carrying out their missions in the field.
Additionally, the Committee reminds the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency of Section 2(f) of the Environmental Research, Develop-
ment, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C.
4363) as it works to right-size the Agency and focus on statutory
functions.
The Committee also reiterates the importance of certain Federal
facility leases across the country—especially in the West and
throughout Indian Country—and recognizes the role these essential
facilities play in advancing mission-critical work and delivering key
services to the public. Before terminating any such leases, the
Committee directs all agencies to brief the Committee on proposed
closure plans, ongoing consultations with affected stakeholders,
and actions to address potential service gaps.
Reorganization Proposals—Wildland Fire Management.—The
Committee appreciates the Administration’s goal of reducing waste
and improving efficiency across Federal agencies. The Committee
supports the Administration’s efforts to improve forest health, en-
hance wildfire resilience, and strengthen the capacity of the De-
partment of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Forest Service (Forest
Service) to manage land and fight wildfires. The Committee ac-
knowledges the importance of investing in sustainable land man-
agement practices, particularly in increasing timber production, re-
ducing hazardous fuels, and ensuring a robust and stable Federal
firefighting workforce.
While the Committee is supportive of these objectives, changes in
budgetary and management structure spark concerns about im-
pacted agencies’ abilities to consistently meet critical performance
benchmarks. Specifically, the Committee notes ongoing challenges
in achieving timber volume targets, meeting hazardous fuels reduc-
tion goals, and maintaining use of an adequately staffed and red
card-certified workforce necessary for wildfire response. The Com-
mittee is also concerned about how restructuring would influence
the fundamental purpose of the Forest Service, shifting from a
commodity focus to conservation.
To ensure these goals are met and that funding is utilized most
effectively, prior to the transfer of any resources or authorities, the
Committee directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to conduct a study regarding the proposed creation of a con-
solidated Fire Service within DOI that assesses the impacts on
reaching proposed timber targets, continued cohesion between
wildland fire management and the hazardous fuels reduction pro-
gram, continued use of the available red card-certified workforce,
and how this new consolidated Service differs from the role the Na-
tional Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) already plays to coordinate
fire response. Additionally, the study should evaluate the extent to

which states, localities, and Tribes were consulted regarding plans
for the creation of this new Fire Service and consider what impact
this transfer may have on these critical stakeholders.
Not later than 180 days following the enactment of this Act, the
Committee directs GAO to report its findings to the Committee, in-
cluding detailed recommendations for improving performance and
addressing any identified deficiencies with the proposal. The Com-
mittee further directs DOI and the Forest Service to provide a com-
prehensive response to GAO’s findings and consider these findings
when evaluating future actions and resources related to wildland
fire management.
The Committee emphasizes that continued support for this ini-
tiative is contingent upon demonstrable progress toward meeting
these performance benchmarks, with clear, measurable outcomes.
Review of Rulemakings.—Not later than 180 days following the
enactment of this Act, the Committee directs the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) to complete a review of ‘‘major rules,’’ as
defined by the Congressional Review Act, issued by the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, which were upheld by a final judgment
in a Federal appellate court, as of June 28, 2024, relying in whole
or in part on the decision in Chevron. The review should include
a list of the rules, citation to the case at issue, and a summary of
the court’s conclusion.
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.—The Committee directs the De-
partment of the Interior to brief the Committee not later than 90
days following the enactment of this Act on current and planned
activities related to water management, conservation, and infra-
structure upgrades in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
Search and Rescue Activities.—The Committee notes the crit-
ical—and often costly—work done by small local law enforcement
to conduct search and rescue activities on Federal lands. Not later
than 120 days following the enactment of this Act, the Committee
directs the Department of the Interior, in coordination with other
relevant agencies, to provide a briefing to the Committee on exist-
ing funding streams that could potentially be used and expanded
to help federally impacted communities offset the costs of these op-
erations.
Small Business Aviation.—The Committee notes the role that
small businesses play in bolstering local economies and their abil-
ity to operate in underserved regions across the Nation. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department of the Interior and the U.S. For-
est Service to explore opportunities to contract with small busi-
nesses—particularly vendors that are Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA) Section 145 compliant—for aircraft on ground repairs,
and the management of maintenance, repair, and overhaul serv-
ices.
STOP Act Efforts.—The Committee recognizes that the Ysleta
Del Sur Pueblo in Texas has made numerous unsuccessful at-
tempts to negotiate with the Dutch government on the return of
several sacred and cultural patrimony objects being held in a mu-
seum warehouse in the Netherlands. These items were taken from
Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo in 1882 and should be returned immediately.
The Committee is aware the Department of the Interior and the
U.S. Department of State recently began efforts to help Ysleta Del
Sur Pueblo regain possession of these items of patrimony. Not later

than 90 days following the enactment of this Act, the Committee
directs the Department of the Interior to provide a report outlining
efforts to secure the return of these items and feedback as to
whether the STOP Act (Public Law 117–258) provides necessary
authority to the U.S. government to assist Tribal governments with
the recovery of misappropriated items in foreign countries, or if
changes are required to best assist these Tribal governments.
Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to provide a
briefing to the Committee not later than 90 days following the en-
actment of this Act on the implementation of the STOP Act. The
briefing should provide information on which office within the BIA
will administer the implementation, include recommendations and
outcomes from any Tribal consultations, and identify any necessary
resources.
Tribal Consultations.—The Committee continues to stress the
importance of agencies conducting ‘‘true’’ and ‘‘meaningful’’ govern-
ment-to-government consultation with Tribes. While most agency
consultations solicit input and feedback from Tribes, the commu-
nication is one way, and agencies struggle to provide feedback to
Tribes. Tribes report that they do not know whether and how their
input is considered and how final allocations and decisions are
made. On decisions made in consultation with Tribes, the Com-
mittee directs agencies funded in this bill to publish decision ra-
tionale in the context of and in reasonable detail to the Tribal
input received during consultation.
Vacant Grazing Allotments.—The Bureau of Land Management
and the Forest Service are directed, to the greatest extent prac-
ticable, to make vacant grazing allotments available to a holder of
a grazing permit or lease when lands covered by the holder of the
permit or lease are unusable because of drought or wildfire.
Wildland Fire Cross-Boundary Project.—The Committee recog-
nizes the challenges wildland fire practitioners face in accessing
wildfire mitigation and suppression funding from multiple funding
sources to accomplish a single cross-boundary project with non-Fed-
eral partners. The Committee directs the Government Account-
ability Office to examine existing wildland fire programs, rules, and
authorities at the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest
Service that inhibit cross-boundary work with non-Federal partners
and brief the Committee on its preliminary findings not later than
180 days following the enactment of this Act.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
The Bureau of Land Management (Bureau) was created in 1946
to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public lands for
the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.
The Committee recommends $1,193,908,000 in new budget au-
thority for the Management of Lands and Resources appropriation.
Land Resources.—The Committee provides $289,485,000 for
Land Resources. Within the amount provided for Land Resources,
the Committee recommends $30,000,000 for prioritization of the

analysis, review, processing, and approval of grazing permits, as
well as the administration of grazing permit renewals.
Wild Horse and Burro Management.—The Committee rec-
ommends $144,000,000 to support continued implementation of the
May 2020 plan. Of the amount provided, $11,000,000 shall be used
for the administration of humane population growth suppression
strategies, including immunocontraceptive vaccines and permanent
sterilization efforts, prioritizing the implementation of existing
immunocontraceptive vaccines when appropriate.
The Committee continues to support plans that utilize a multi-
pronged management strategy that includes the use of multi-year
fertility control programs, targeted removals from the most heavily
ecologically impacted and populated areas, expanding cost-effective
off-range holding facilities, and increasing the number of animals
placed into private care and other adoption opportunities, such as
with Tribes. To better accomplish these goals, the Bureau should
increase public/private partnerships, to include working with vet-
erans and wild horse organizations.
The Bureau shall continue to abide by the Comprehensive Ani-
mal Welfare Program and the statutory restrictions on sale without
restriction, and the directives contained in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021,
2022, 2023 and 2024 House and Senate Reports and Explanatory
Statements, which make clear that the Bureau’s management
strategy will not include any sale or actions that result in the de-
struction of healthy animals, as continues to be prohibited by this
bill.
The Bureau has not fulfilled previous direction, so the Committee
restates the requirement for the Bureau to provide quarterly up-
dates to the Committee on the allocation of resources, achievement
of performance metrics, input from the Task Force, efficacy of iden-
tifying and relocating nonreproducing horses to different Herd
Management Areas, efforts to ensure adequate staffing in the field,
and any proposed changes to the current course of action.
Wildlife and Aquatic Habitat Management.—Within the funding
provided for Aquatic Habitat Management, the recommendation in-
cludes $2,500,000 for the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control
program. Additionally, within the amount provided for Wildlife
Habitat Management, the Committee recommends $73,000,000 for
sage-grouse habitat, $32,211,000 for threatened and endangered
species, and $20,600,000 for plant conservation.
Energy and Minerals.—The funding level provided for Energy
and Minerals reflects strong support for the President’s strategy to
unleash America’s vast energy resources on public lands. This ap-
proach promotes energy independence, generates critical Federal
revenue, and sustains well-paying American jobs in the energy sec-
tor, fully aligning with the Administration’s goals for economic
growth and national security.
Within the amount provided for Energy and Minerals,
$10,000,000 is provided for Renewable Energy. The Committee di-
rects the Bureau to utilize this funding to prioritize leasing and
permitting for geothermal energy development, to hold lease sales
in compliance with statutory requirements and to issue required
permits in a timely manner.
Resource Protection and Maintenance.—Within the amount pro-
vided for Resource Protection and Maintenance, the recommenda-

tion includes $11,000,000 in Resource Management Planning for
sage-grouse conservation activities and $29,975,000 for Law En-
forcement.
National Conservation Lands.—Within the amount provided for
National Conservation Lands, the Committee recommends
$11,248,000 for National Scenic and Historic Trails for trail oper-
ations, construction, and maintenance projects.
Communication Site Management.—The Committee recommends
$2,000,000 for communications site management. This amount is
offset by $2,000,000 in offsetting collections.
Mining Law Administration.—The Committee recommends
$42,696,000 for mining law administration. This amount is offset
by $76,000,000 in offsetting collections.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance related to activities funded in this account.
Aquifer Recharge.—The Committee continues to direct the Bu-
reau to work with the State of Idaho to provide appropriate access
to Federal lands for the purposes of recharge projects.
Land Use Permits.—The Committee expects organizers of largely
attended events on Bureau lands to foster collaborative relations
with the local government(s) of jurisdiction and provide documenta-
tion of such outreach. Additionally, the Committee supports the
Bureau in its role as steward of America’s public lands to periodi-
cally audit widely attended events requiring a Special Recreation
Permit.
Manned Aircraft.—The Committee encourages the Bureau to con-
tinue analyzing alternatives to its current practices for manage-
ment of wild free- roaming horses and burro populations which in-
cludes the use of helicopters and manned fixed-wing aircraft; ana-
lyze private job creation opportunities presented by both current
and alternative management practices; and continue to monitor the
effects of current management practices on wild-free roaming horse
and burro populations. The Committee directs the Bureau to in-
clude feedback on the findings during the quarterly meetings with
the Committee.
National Seed Strategy/Plant Conservation Program.—The Com-
mittee continues to support the Bureau’s implementation of the
National Seed Strategy and Plant Conservation Program. The
Committee encourages the Bureau to increase the development and
use of native seeds for restoration and rehabilitation across public
lands. The Committee directs the Bureau to brief the Committee
not later than 180 days following the enactment of this Act on the
Bureau’s efforts, including collaboration with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, to expand the
Seeds of Success program into the Pacific Islands.
Oil and Gas Operation Technologies.—The Committee encour-
ages the Department to support efforts to install new technologies
on wellheads or facilities located on Federal lands in coordination
with public-private partnerships.
Predator Control.—The Committee notes the role that the Ani-
mal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plays in the devel-
opment of a wildlife damage management strategy to control preda-
tors preying on livestock, poultry, or federally designated threat-
ened and endangered species. The Committee directs the Bureau to
align with APHIS on predator control methods on its public lands.

Permitting.—The Committee encourages the Bureau to collabo-
rate with artificial intelligence (A.I.) partners to find opportunities
where A.I. could streamline the federal permit process.
Red River Land Survey.—The Committee notes that the John D.
Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (Public
Law 116–9), required the Bureau to commission the necessary gra-
dient boundary survey of the 116-mile stretch of the Red River be-
tween Texas and Oklahoma within two years of the enactment of
the Act. The Committee reminds the Bureau that Public Law 116–
9 explicitly states the survey must be conducted by one or more
independent third-party licensed surveyors who are selected by the
Bureau, in consultation with the Texas General Land Office, Okla-
homa Commissioners of the Land Office, Oklahoma Attorney Gen-
eral, and the affected federally recognized Tribes in the area. Most
importantly, the Committee emphasizes that the law states that
surveyors must use the same methodology established by the Su-
preme Court in its Oklahoma v. Texas (1923) decision. The Com-
mittee is keenly aware that the Bureau is currently repudiating
and deviating from statutory instructions through actions that
would coerce third-party surveyors to complete the survey by meth-
ods that would result in an outcome predetermined by the Bureau.
The Committee directs the Bureau to work with potential inde-
pendent third-party surveyors, the required entities to consult
with, and the relevant Congressional delegation to transparently
address legal and ethical issues and find a path forward that en-
sures the survey is completed in compliance with current law. Not
later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act, the Com-
mittee directs the Bureau to provide an update on the status of se-
lecting an independent third-party licensed surveyor and the Bu-
reau’s plan, developed in coordination with Oklahoma and Texas
Land Offices, Oklahoma Attorney General, and the affected feder-
ally recognized Tribes in the area, to complete the survey.
Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act.—The Committee
reiterates that the funds from this account are to be used for activi-
ties authorized under Public Law 105–263.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee encourages the
Bureau to consider applications for virtual fencing technologies in
rangeland management. Not later than 90 days following the en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs the Bureau to provide
a report on rangeland improvements, benefits to wildlife habitat,
and expected costs resulting from the use of virtual fencing tech-
nologies on Federal grazing allotments.
OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS
The Committee recommends $104,954,000 for the Oregon and
California Grant Lands appropriation.
The Committee directs the Bureau to continue the long-term fire
protection agreement described in the Western Oregon Operating
Plan with the State of Oregon and the Douglas and Coos Forest
Protective Associations to maintain or enhance the current level of
fire protection for BLM-managed lands in Western Oregon.
The Committee encourages the Bureau to utilize available fund-
ing to accelerate wildfire risk reduction through timber sales in
dry, fire-prone forests in southwest Oregon, in accordance with the
2016 Southwest Oregon Resource Management Plan. The Com-

mittee also encourages the Bureau to reduce wildfire risk to com-
munities throughout the Oregon and California grant lands. The
Committee directs the Bureau to report commercial treatment
acres sold through timber sales, by district, on reserve land covered
by the 2016 Southwest Oregon Resource Plan.
RANGE IMPROVEMENTS
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation of not
less than $10,000,000 to be derived from public lands receipts and
Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act lands grazing receipts, as re-
quested.
SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation esti-
mated to be $30,000,000 for Service Charges, Deposits, and Forfeit-
ures. The appropriation is fully offset through collections.
MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation esti-
mated to be $26,000,000.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The Committee continues long-standing Administrative Provi-
sions that facilitate efficient operations.
UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
Originating in 1871, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) is the oldest Federal conservation agency, and the only
agency in the Federal Government whose primary responsibility is
management of biological resources for the American public.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The Committee recommends $1,374,576,000 for Resource Man-
agement.
Ecological Services.—The recommendation includes $269,278,000
for Ecological Services. Within the Ecological Service program,
funding is provided as follows:
Listing.—The recommendation includes $7,375,000 for Endan-
gered Species Act (ESA) listing determinations and related activi-
ties. The Committee continues to support the Service’s efforts with
local and regional stakeholders to develop voluntary solutions to
conserve targeted species.
Planning and Consultation.—The recommendation includes
$105,126,000 for timely evaluations and permitting of development
projects to ensure species are protected while allowing for develop-
ment that contributes to economic growth and job creation. This
recommendation provides no less than $4,000,000 for pesticide con-
sultations to provide more certainty and guidance to applicants for
how chemicals can continue to be available for production of food
and fiber in the United States. The recommendation includes
$4,000,000 for Gulf Coast restoration activities, $10,354,000 for en-
ergy activities, $4,000,000 for NEPA permitting activities, and
$77,141,000 for general program activities.

The recommendation provides $12,000,000 for Recovery Chal-
lenge matching grants. Recovery Challenge grants are to be used
to implement high priority recovery actions as prescribed in recov-
ery plans to recover federally listed species. In cases where Recov-
ery Plans are outdated or not finalized, proposed recovery actions
must be supported in other Federal or State species conservation
planning documents, including 5-year reviews, assessments, and
Service-authored reports. Project partners must provide contribu-
tions of at least 50 percent of the project cost, with the remaining
funding coming from Recovery Challenge funds. Partner contribu-
tion calculations may include in-kind services. Unless an affected
State is a partner on the project, no funds may be awarded to a
project until the project partners have consulted with the State.
The Committee urges the Service to continue its efforts with non-
governmental partners to recover northern aplomado falcons, Cali-
fornia condors, and other similar species.

Lake Erie, the Committee encourages the Service to continue to
support control activities by individuals, corporations, municipali-
ties, States, and Tribes such as public health control orders or spe-
cial double-crested cormorant permits to assure public health. Not
later than 180 days following the enactment of this Act, the Com-
mittee directs the Service to identify Federal agencies to partner
with in order to determine a populations control strategy for bird
species in the Great Lakes basin.
ePermits.—The Committee notes concerns remain regarding on-
going backlogs of the ePermits system for non-native Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed spe-
cies for international and interstate movement. The Committee di-
rects the Service to conduct a comprehensive review of the pro-
gram, focusing on streamlining procedures, increasing trans-
parency, and reducing discretionary delays. The Committee also
encourages consideration of alternative frameworks, such as per-
mit-by-rule or self-certification models, consistent with law and
treaty obligations, and expects coordination with relevant oversight

prevent the spread of quagga and zebra mussels, and $1,011,000 is
for Great Lakes Sea Lamprey administration costs.
The Committee is aware that Lake Tahoe, which is on ancestral
lands, faces a constant and serious threat from the introduction
and spread of aquatic invasive species. This harm includes impacts
to Native American Tribes. The Committee applauds the Service’s
partnership with California and Nevada to implement a prevention
program consisting of mandatory boat inspection and decontamina-
tion stations, successful Asian clam pilot eradication projects,
invasive plant control projects, and the creation of an early detec-
tion and rapid response program. Of the amount made available
under this section, no less than $6,000,000 shall be used for imple-
menting subsection (d)(2) of Section 5, of Public Law 106–506, as
amended. The recommendation also includes $5,000,000 for the im-
plementation of the Invasive Species in Alpine Lakes Pilot pro-
gram, as authorized by Public Law 117–263, to develop and carry

Park System. Additionally, the Committee directs the Service to
continue working with the Washoe Tribe, State, Federal partners,
and other collaborators to combat aquatic invasive species in Lake
Tahoe.
The Committee recognizes the threat from the highly invasive
golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei). Detection in the Sacramento-
San Joaquin Delta poses a threat to the Lake Tahoe basin and wa-
terways across the United States. Given the need for rapid re-
sources, tools, and coordination to control and eradicate the golden
mussel, the Committee directs the Service, through the Aquatic
Nuisance Species Task Force and its Western Regional Panel, in
coordination with appropriate State Fish and Wildlife agencies, to
develop a National Control and Management Plan to prevent the
introduction, establishment, and spread of the golden mussel and
to eradicate and control established populations. The Service is to
report to the Committee on this plan not later than 180 days fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act.
Recognizing the importance of the work conducted by the Service
to combat the serious threat of invasive carp, the Committee rec-
ommendation includes $22,000,000 for invasive carp and not less
than $3,000,000 for contract fishing. The Service should coordinate
with the U.S. Geological Survey on contract fishing efforts. The
Committee continues to support the Service in working to prevent
invasive carp from entering the Great Lakes, and to control and
eradicate them from the Mississippi River, its six sub-basins, the
Upper Mississippi River, Missouri River, Arkansas-Red White
River, Lower Mississippi River, Tennessee Cumberland River, and
Ohio River including Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley. Addition-
ally, $2,834,000 is provided for the National Invasive Species Act
of 1996 (NISA) State Plans and $1,566,000 for NISA implementa-
tion which helps control the spread of invasive carp.
Not later than 120 days following the enactment of this Act the
Committee directs the Service to update the Committee on ad-
vancements since the August 9, 2022 virtual forum on removal and
uses of invasive carp, to include any changes in opportunities for
increased use of harvested invasive carp and the benefits of holding
another one-day forum for Federal, State, and provincial agencies;

shellfish and fish stocks in the Gulf of America is economically, en-
vironmentally, and culturally important to the Alabama-Mississippi
Gulf Coast. The recommendation includes no less than $1,000,000
for the Service to support necessary university-based fisheries safe-
ty plus fish and shellfish health monitoring activities in the Gulf
of America.
The Committee recognizes that at-risk species mostly inhabit pri-
vate lands, and that the Service cannot accomplish its mission
without fully embracing non-regulatory and voluntary collaborative
conservation efforts with private landowners. The Committee di-
rects the Service to continue utilizing grants and other programs,
such as the Wildlife Conservation Initiative, to pursue collaborative
species conservation that leverages in-kind land access and exper-
tise from private landowners.
American Bison.—The Committee reminds the Service to consult
with the impacted States and Tribal governments on any actions
regarding the introduction or listing of bison. The Committee di-
rects the Service to comply with the State definition that bison are
livestock under Chapter 81 of the Montana Code.

rative efforts to protect, restore, and conserve habitats for one of
the greatest ecological treasures of the United States. The rec-
ommendation provides no less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted
level across multiple programs for Everglades restoration.
Military Readiness.—The Committee understands that some
military installations, such as Camp Bullis, are home to certain
animal species designated under the Endangered Species Act and
have established longstanding partnerships with local, state and
nonprofit entities and private landowners to monitor and protect
endangered species and their habitat. The Committee strongly en-
courages the Service to appropriately balance military readiness
and training operations with mitigation activities and requirements
under the Endangered Species Act.
Wildland Fire Response Coordination.—The Committee encour-
ages the Service to establish formal partnerships, where appro-
priate, to develop coordinated response structures for wildland fire-
fighting in geographically isolated areas near Service jurisdiction.

ties or equipment damaged or destroyed by storms, floods, fires,
and similar unanticipated natural events.
COOPERATIVE ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION FUND
The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund
(CESCF; Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act), administered by
the Service’s Ecological Services program, provides grant funding to
States and Territories for species and habitat conservation actions
on non-Federal lands, including habitat acquisition, conservation
planning, habitat restoration, status surveys, captive propagation
and reintroduction, research, and education.
The Committee recommends $18,700,000 for the Cooperative En-
dangered Species Conservation Fund.
The Committee recognizes that large-scale, programmatic Habi-
tat Conservation Plans (HCPs) provide valuable landscape-scale
conservation of listed species while streamlining the development
of infrastructure, housing, and transportation improvements in a
manner that promotes economic development and prosperity. The
Committee directs the Service to fulfil its commitments to certain
HCPs to fund HCP acquisition of lands that are essential to
achieve the full benefits of those plans and unlock the full potential
of public-private partnerships.
NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE FUND
The National Wildlife Refuge Fund shares refuge revenues and
makes payments in lieu of taxes to counties in which Service lands
are located.
The Committee recommends $13,228,000 for the National Wild-
life Refuge Fund.
NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION FUND

other cost recovery fees, and inspection fees totaling $65,000,000,
resulting in a final appropriation of $132,345,000.
Commingling.—The Committee acknowledges the Bureau’s re-
cent decision to implement new parameters for downhole commin-
gling in the Paleogene (Wilcox) reservoirs to expand the allowable
pressure differential from 200 psi to 1500 psi. The Committee en-
courages the Agency to continue its work on commingling by re-
viewing internal guidance and policies related to commingling in
all reservoirs. The Committee is aware of concerns that the current
guidance and policies related to commingling are based on a 2010
Knowledge Reservoir study that is outdated, and that new data
and science should be used to inform the Bureau’s relevant internal
guidance and policies.
Rigs to Reefs.—The Committee supports the Rigs to Reefs pro-
gram and encourages the Bureau to continue its policies related to
extensions for those entities interested in participating in the pro-
gram and to utilize the program to the maximum extent possible.
Blow Out Prevention Technology.—The Committee continues to
encourage the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement
(BSEE) to review and consider new and emerging technology, in-
cluding alternative procedures or equipment as appropriate given
the best available science and while ensuring that risks are prop-
erly identified and mitigated. BSEE is urged to develop a testing
framework for new technologies that takes into consideration the
cost of testing while still ensuring safety and effectiveness.
OIL SPILL RESEARCH
The Committee recommends $15,099,000 for the Oil Spill Re-
search appropriation.
THE OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT
REGULATION AND TECHNOLOGY
The Committee recommends $119,786,000 for the Regulation and
Technology appropriation. The detailed allocation of funding by ac-
tivity is included in the table accompanying this report.
Agency Delays.—The Committee is deeply concerned that the Of-
fice of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) has
been delinquent in meeting any court ordered deadlines for issuing
supplemental Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) thus result-
ing in vacatur of an existing mine permit. The Committee expects
the OSMRE to abide by the deadlines established and mandated by
the court.
ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND
The Committee recommends $168,231,000 for the Abandoned
Mine Reclamation Fund appropriation. Of the funds provided,
$33,231,000 are derived from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation
Fund and $135,000,000 are derived from the general treasury. The
detailed allocation of funding by activity is included in the table ac-
companying this report.

later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act. Recognizing
that all participating States in this program have primacy, OSMRE
is expected to provide technical assistance to grantees, but it is the
participating States’ sole responsibility to approve projects for eco-
nomic and community development in conjunction with the prior-
ities in section 403(a) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclama-
tion Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1233(a)).
The Committee is aware that no funding has been awarded to
projects in former coal producing counties in western Kentucky.
The Committee encourages participating States and Tribes to con-
sider geographic proportionality when selecting projects to receive
AMLER grants.
Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative (ARRI).—The Com-
mittee notes that the ARRI program is designed and implemented
to promote effective reforestation of mined lands resulting in re-
stored forested lands and ecosystems that enhance economic and
recreational opportunities throughout the Appalachian Region. To
support such efforts, of the funds provided, the Committee provides
no less than $500,000 for ARRI.
Timely Review of Amendments.—Mine plans and mine plan modi-
fications for operations on Federal coal leases are subject to review
under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Committee un-
derstands that there are over forty amendments from twenty-eight
state programs currently pending before OSMRE, some of which
have been pending since 2009. This has left affected coal mines un-
able to expand operations on current leases for which they have al-
ready paid bonus bid payments and continue to pay royalties. The
Committee directs the Office to brief the Committee not later than
60 days following enactment of this Act on the status of each mine
plan modification currently pending with the Office, including the
timeline of receiving each amendment, any agency actions that
have been taken on each amendment, and the projected timeline
for making a final decision on each amendment, and to provide reg-
ular updates to the Committee until these mine plan modifications
are fully processed.

ant Secretary, Indian Affairs (together, ‘‘Indian Affairs’’’) programs
serve 574 federally recognized Indian Tribes, a service population
of approximately two million American Indians and Alaska Natives
in Tribal and Native communities. BIA provides direct services and
funding for compacts and contracts for Tribes to provide Federal
programs for a wide range of activities necessary for community de-
velopment. Programs address Tribal government, natural resource
management, trust services, law enforcement, economic develop-
ment, and social service needs.

Tribal Management Development Program.—The recommenda-
tion includes $25,696,000 for the Tribal Management Development
Program, including $2,523,000 for the Inter-Tribal Buffalo Council
to support their work returning buffalo to Indian Country, includ-
ing through the Bison Conservation Transfer Program. The rec-
ommendation also includes $1,000,000 for the Native American
Fish & Wildlife Society and $1,500,000 for conservation law en-
forcement to support Tribal fish and game management programs

Trust-Real Estate Services.—The recommendation provides
$178,925,000 for Trust-Real Estate Services. The Committee en-
courages BIA to improve communication and processing times for
delivering real estate services to Tribes.
The Committee is concerned about the amount of time and re-
sources used to review trust land applications as a result of the
Carcieri v. Salazar decision. The Committee directs BIA to develop
and implement a plan to improve processes and streamline effi-
ciency for reviewing trust land applications to reflect the Federal
recognition of Tribes and their sovereign authority to put land into
trust, regardless of the date they became federally recognized. The
Committee directs BIA to provide a briefing not later than 180

$771,836,000 for Public Safety and Justice.
The Committee remains very concerned with reports of inter-
national criminal cartels targeting Tribal communities for human
and drug trafficking. The Committee directs the Office of Justice
Services, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations, to provide a report to
the Committee not later than 180 days following the enactment of
this Act regarding resources currently allocated, activities being
conducted, and additional resources needed to combat illegal crimi-
nal cartels targeting communities located on Tribal lands. The re-
port should also provide recommended strategies for improving
cross-jurisdictional relationships between Tribes and Federal law-
enforcement agencies to combat international cartel activity on In-
dian lands.
The Committee remains concerned about the Tribal law enforce-
ment and courts needs of Tribal governments in Public Law 83–280
States and previously directed BIA to conduct consultations with
Tribes located in these States to determine budgetary needs of
Tribal law enforcement. The Committee is concerned that there are
Tribes subject to Public Law 83–280 that are currently providing
law enforcement services without any funding from BIA. The Com-
mittee directs BIA to provide a briefing not later than 180 days fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act on the identified needs. The Com-
mittee notes that to address the challenges these Tribal govern-
ments face, any funding received for law enforcement and courts
needs may be used to enter into agreements with local or State au-
thorities to provide eligible services.
The Committee directs BIA headquarters to coordinate activities
with field offices that serve affected Tribes within the State of
Texas, and consult with such affected Tribes, to ensure State and
Federal laws related to criminal jurisdiction are interpreted con-
sistently and address potential inconsistencies in the treatment of
Tribal eligibility to receive Federal law enforcement funding. The
Committee directs BIA to provide a briefing not later than 120
days following the enactment of this Act on the status of these con-
sultations.
The Committee supports BIA’s efforts to recruit, train, and retain
its Tribal law enforcement personnel, including the work of the

The Committee recognizes that there is a significant outstanding
need to implement public safety changes resulting from the McGirt
v. Oklahoma decision, creating an immediate and severe shortage
of police and investigative personnel in the expanded Tribal crimi-
nal jurisdiction areas. The recommendation provides $130,000,000
for these activities. With the additional resources provided for
McGirt, the Committee encourages BIA to consult with impacted
Tribes regarding the distribution of funds.

investigators, software platforms, and evidence recovery equip-
ment. The Committee directs BIA to work with Tribal and Federal
law enforcement agencies to facilitate sharing law enforcement and
public records data and other technological tools to assist those
agencies in finding missing individuals.
The Committee applauds the Missing and Murdered Unit’s com-
mitment to addressing violence in Indian country through Oper-
ation Not Forgotten. The Committee directs BIA to provide quar-
terly updates on its progress and the additional resources needed
to maintain full operation of this initiative.
Facilities Operations and Maintenance.—The recommendation
provides $23,894,000.
Tribal Courts.—The recommendation includes $57,713,000 for
Tribal Courts.
The Committee notes that Tribes that are eligible to contract or
compact for law enforcement may reprogram a portion of this fund-
ing to use it for law enforcement purposes and therefore directs
BIA to engage with Tribes on how they want funds split between
Tribal Courts and Law Enforcement so Tribes can request a re-
programming.
Community and Economic Development.—The recommendation
includes $39,004,000, including $5,000,000 for Native businesses
and entrepreneurs to develop and grow their businesses through
the Indian Business Incubator Program.
The Committee highlights the success of the Job Placement and
Training program in assisting individuals in obtaining job skills
that support long-term employment. The Committee provides
$19,686,000 to support this program. Within the funding provided,
$5,000,000 is included for a Native American Technology and Man-
ufacturing Grant Pilot Program similar to the former BIA Iron-
worker Training Grant Program. Funding should support training
for modern manufacturing, such as digital fabrication workshops

ployees. The report shall include the frequency of such checks, the
standards used, and the process for addressing findings of concern.
Additionally, the report must specify the date of the most recent
background check conducted for each category of employees and
outline any gaps or delays in implementation.
The Committee appreciates the work of the Federal Indian
Boarding School Initiative and recommends BIA consider estab-
lishing an Indian Boarding School Commission to formally inves-
tigate, document, and report on the histories of Indian boarding
schools, Indian boarding school policies, and the long-term effect
those schools and policies have had on Native Americans. The
Commission would include 10 individuals who are survivors of In-
dian boarding schools, have experience in indigenous human rights
law, Tribal court justice systems, traditional and cultural resources
and practices in Tribal communities, and providing and coordi-
nating trauma-informed care. The Committee directs BIA to pro-
vide a briefing not later than 90 days following the enactment of
this Act identifying additional resources needed to support the es-
tablishment of this Commission.
Tiwahe.—The report ‘‘Tiwahe: Final Report to Congress’’ docu-
ments significant achievements, including a reduction in suicides,
recidivism, and removal of children from the community. It also
notes earlier parent/child reunifications, language revitalization,
and improvements to housing and homelessness, among other im-
provements. The recommendation provides $44,583,000 to continue
funding existing Tiwahe program sites for the same activities, in-
cluding funding to support women’s and children’s shelters.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation esti-
mated to be $350,000,000 for contract support costs incurred by In-
dian Affairs as required by law. The bill includes language making
available for two years such sums as are necessary to meet the
Federal Government’s full legal obligation and prohibiting the

existing BIE schools and would not significantly increase costs to
the Federal Government.
The bill continues language that allows the funds provided in
Tribal priority allocations to be adjusted if requested by a Tribe.
BUREAU OF TRUST FUNDS ADMINISTRATION
FEDERAL TRUST PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Congress has designated the Secretary of the Interior as the
trustee delegate with responsibility for approximately 55 million
surface acres of land, 57 million acres of subsurface mineral inter-
ests, and management of approximately $8.2 billion held in trust
by the Federal Government on behalf of American Indians, Alaska
Natives, and federally recognized Indian Tribes. The Bureau of
Trust Funds Administration (BTFA) has assumed the fiduciary
functions previously managed by the Office of the Special Trustee
for American Indians. BTFA is responsible for the financial man-
agement of these trust funds as well as the disbursement of funds
and the day-to-day management on behalf of Tribes and individ-
uals.
The recommendation includes $105,753,000 for Trust and Pro-

DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The Committee recommends $114,012,000 for the Office of the
Secretary, Departmental Operations appropriation. Within the
funds provided, the recommendation includes funding for imple-
mentation of the NATIVE Act at the fiscal year 2024 enacted level
and not less than $500,000 to carry out land assessments, apprais-
als, surveys and other activities in support of the Secretary’s re-
sponsibilities under the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act, in-
cluding up to $200,000 to add capacity related to infrastructure
programs. Additionally, the recommendation includes funding for
the Department to continue its efforts related to the implementa-
tion of the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act.
Archusa Dam.—The Committee notes that the Archusa Dam was
constructed by the then-Bureau of Outdoor Recreation in 1971 and
is in need of repair. The Committee directs the Secretary to brief
the Committee not later than 60 days following the enactment of
this Act on any financial or management responsibilities of the De-
partment over the Archusa Dam as well as any coordination with
other relevant Federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and U.S. Department of Agriculture, and with local
sponsors.
Blockchain.—The Committee is aware that the Department of
the Interior, in coordination with the General Services Administra-
tion (GSA), manages, rents, and oversees thousands of properties
and that the integration and management of the related govern-
ment records for such real estate is often cumbersome. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to consult with the Office of
Science and Technology Policy—which was authorized in Public
Law 117–263 to develop a strategy using Distributed Ledger Tech-
nology (DLT) to maintain a central depository database on U.S.
real estate—to investigate how emerging technologies could im-
prove the recording of these assets, including how DLT and fed-
erated blockchain might be employed. The Committee directs the
Department to provide a briefing not later than 180 days following
the enactment of this Act on how these technologies could be em-
ployed to improve the business processes of the Department.
Orphaned Wells.—The Committee directs the Department to im-
plement Section 40601(c) of Public Law 117–58 in accordance with
the language of the law. The Department’s guidance on State for-
mula grants deviates from the language of the law by adding unau-
thorized and unintended requirements. The Committee recognizes
the law does not require a State to use funding for any specific list-
ed purpose, such as measuring and tracking emissions of methane.
Instead, the law defers to each State to determine, in the best in-
terests of that State, which of the listed authorized purposes to ad-
dress with the awarded funds. The Committee reaffirms the De-
partment is prohibited from requiring a State to use funds awarded
under Section 40601(c) to address any particular purpose listed in
Section 40601(c)(2)(A) or requiring a State to report data on any of

the listed authorized purposes the State chooses not to address
with awarded funds.
Closeout of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation.—
The Committee directs the Department, including the Interior
Business Center, to take over any outstanding duties and respon-
sibilities of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation to sup-
port its closure, including but not limited to the management of
open and eligible cases and other essential administrative duties.
Vehicle Fleet.—The Committee supports creating further effi-
ciencies and cost-savings throughout the Department, including im-
provements to the management of the Department’s vehicle fleet
through telematics by using small, U.S.-based companies, when
practicable. Within available funding, the Committee directs the
Secretary to establish a pilot program—which should include all
light-duty, non-law enforcement trucks and SUVs owned by the De-
partment—to determine how standard-compliant telematics
through domestic small business can help improve efficiency and
decrease costs for the Federal Government. Not later than 180 days
following the enactment of this Act, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary to provide a briefing outlining implementation plans for the
pilot program, including how the Secretary will consider improve-
ments in driver safety, productivity, maintenance costs, fuel con-
sumption, finance management, and vehicle health.
Wild Horse and Burro Task Force.—In fiscal year 2022, Congress
directed the Secretary to establish a Task Force to bring experts
from all relevant agencies together to address the challenge of wild
horses and burros, as outlined in the report accompanying Public
Law 117–103. The Committee expects the Task Force to continue
holding its monthly meetings. The Committee has also included ad-
ditional direction in the Bureau of Land Management section of
this report specifying areas in which the Task Force should be en-
gaged. The Committee directs the Bureau of Land Management to
continue reporting to the Committee quarterly on the status of this
program and the work of the Task Force.
INSULAR AFFAIRS
ASSISTANCE TO TERRITORIES
The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) has administrative responsi-
bility for coordinating Federal policy in the territories of American
Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, and oversight of Federal programs
and funds in the freely associated states of the Federated States
of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Repub-
lic of Palau.
The Committee recommends $117,029,000 for Assistance to Ter-
ritories.
Brown Tree Snake Control.—The recommendation includes
$4,000,000 for Brown Tree Snake Control activities and the Com-
mittee encourages the Office of Insular Affairs, in coordination with
the Brown Tree Snake Technical Working Group, to utilize these
resources to continue seeking innovative solutions to manage, con-
trol, and eradicate brown tree snakes in Guam.
American Samoa Operations Grants.—The recommendation in-
cludes $29,000,000 for American Samoa Operations Grants and the

Additional Guidance.—The Committee includes the following ad-
ditional guidance:
Damage Assessments.—Not later than 180 days following the en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs the Office of Insular Af-
fairs, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security
and other relevant agencies, to provide a report assessing the dam-
age impacts Typhoon Mawar had on Guam in May 2023. The re-
port should outline estimated costs of damages to facilities, struc-
tures, property, and infrastructure, as well as plans to prepare for
and address damages from future natural disasters, including to
Federal buildings.
Energy Assurance.—Not later than 180 days following the enact-
ment of this Act, the Committee directs the Office of Insular Af-
fairs, in collaboration with the Department of Defense (DOD) and
U.S. Department of Energy, to provide a report to the Committee
outlining alternatives to provide reliable and resilient power to the
Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Guam in the
event of an extended commercial fuel disruption. The alternatives
should include need, siting, required investment, timing, and oper-
ations of portable and deployable nuclear power reactors currently
under development by DOD and private industry which would
eliminate the need for fuel resupply for up to ten years.
Excess Federal Lands.—Not later than 120 days following the en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs the Office of Insular Af-
fairs, in coordination with the Department of Defense, to provide
a briefing to the Committee discussing the potential feasibility of
returning excess Federal lands under the control of the military to
the person, or heirs of such person, who originally owned the land
in Guam.
Pacific Policy Reports.—Not later than 180 days following the en-
actment of this Act, the Committee encourages the Office of Insular
Affairs to provide a briefing to the Committee discussing the poten-
tial benefits of reinstating and modernizing the Pacific Policy Re-
ports, as authorized under Section 302 of Public Law 99–239.
Stray Animal Populations.—The Committee notes there are large
populations of stray dogs and cats throughout the U.S. Territories,
particularly in Guam. To control and potentially reduce these popu-
lations, the Committee encourages the Office of Insular Affairs to
provide a briefing to the Committee not later than 120 days fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act regarding agency resources avail-
able to address the stray dog and cat populations in Guam.
Territorial Federal Data Coordination.—In light of the findings
outlined in GAO Report 24–106574—titled U.S. Territories: Coordi-
nated Federal Approach Needed to Better Address Data Gaps—
that recommends that U.S.’s Chief Statistician develop ways to ad-
dress territorial data gaps, the Committee encourages the Office of
Insular Affairs to provide a briefing to the Committee not later
than 180 days following the enactment of this Act discussing how
OIA understands the current state of the territorial data gap issue,
and the Agency’s ongoing actions and additional recommendations
that could help the stakeholders at large address data gaps for the
U.S. Territories.

TITLE II—ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) was cre-
ated by Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, which consolidated nine
programs from five different agencies and departments. Major EPA
programs include air and water quality, drinking water, hazardous
waste, research, pesticides, radiation, toxic substances, enforcement
and compliance assurance, pollution prevention, Inland oil spill,
Superfund, Brownfields, and the Leaking Underground Storage
Tank program.
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee recommends $7,012,792,000
for the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Committee directs the Agency to follow all guidance in
House Report 117–83 under the headings titled ‘‘Reprogramming’’,
‘‘Congressional Budget Justification’’, ‘‘Operating Plan’’, and ‘‘Work-
force and Staffing Plans’’.
Consistent with the budget request, the Committee does not pro-
vide funding for the following activities, in addition to those men-
tioned in the front matter of this report: Interagency Working
Group on the Social Cost of Carbon; Interagency Working Group on
the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases; and the Justice, Equity, Di-
versity, and Inclusion Workgroup.
The recommendation supports the Agency’s proposed Workforce
Reshaping to right-size the Agency and effectively carry out the
Agency’s statutory authorities.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
The Science and Technology (S&T) account funds all EPA re-
search (including Superfund research activities paid for with funds
transferred into this account from the Hazardous Substance Super-
fund account).
The Committee recommends $522,413,000 for Science and Tech-
nology and recommends that $17,607,000 be transferred to this ac-
count from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account for ongo-
ing research activities.
Clean Air.—The Committee encourages the Agency to consider
partnerships with non-Federal entities, such as those in building
sciences and engineering, for its work on wildfire smoke.

Pesticide Licensing.—The Committee directs the Agency to pro-
vide a briefing not later than 180 days following the enactment of
this Act on the Agency’s work under Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations to determine the type of data needed for assessments
of pesticides and identify acceptable alternative tests to vertebrate
testing, particularly alternatives to testing on dogs.
Research: Air and Energy.—Within available funds, the Com-
mittee continues funding for the study outlined under the heading
‘‘Partnership Research’’ contained in the explanatory statement ac-
companying Public Law 115–141.
Research: Chemical Safety for Sustainability.—The Committee is
aware of private sector efforts to develop potential 6PPD alter-
natives. The Committee supports the Agency’s work to develop the
necessary testing protocol and data requirements in order to evalu-
ate a new chemical application for a potential alternative to 6PPD.
The Committee encourages the Agency to communicate these re-
quirements to known interested manufacturers as soon as avail-
able. The Committee directs the Agency to provide a briefing not
later than 60 days following the enactment of this Act on its
progress to develop toxicity testing and data requirements.
Research: National Priorities.—The bill provides $10,000,000 for
extramural research grants, independent of the Science to Achieve
Results (STAR) grant program, to fund high-priority water quality
and availability research by not-for-profit organizations who often
partner with the Agency. Because these grants are independent of
the STAR grant program, the Agency should strive to award grants
in as large an amount as is possible to achieve the most scientif-
ically significant research. Funds shall be awarded competitively
with priority given to partners proposing research of national scope
and who provide a 25 percent match. The Agency is directed to al-
locate funds to grantees not later than 180 days following the en-
actment of this Act.
The Committee remains supportive of the Agency’s effort to
prioritize new Federal research that will help farmers, ranchers,
and rural communities manage PFAS impacts in agricultural set-
tings and communities and provides $9,000,000 to continue this
work. The Committee directs the Agency to continue working with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to invest in agronomic research
to better understand PFAS uptake into plants and animals to help
reduce PFAS exposure in our food supply and promote farm viabil-
ity. This research should include the investigation of PFAS uptake
from residual treated soils and soil-to-groundwater modeling, as
well as the investigation of PFAS tolerant crops that can grow safe-
ly on contaminated land. The Committee directs the Agency to pro-
vide a briefing not later than 90 days following the enactment of
this Act on these ongoing efforts.
The bill provides $2,475,000 for advancing full scale applied re-
search and testing capabilities to address threats to drinking water
and drinking water infrastructure, including cybersecurity re-
search, weatherization equipment, SCADA control systems, and
water tanks at Water Security Test Bed facilities. Specifically,
funding is provided for continuing and ongoing operations as well
as the Agency’s proposed Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects to expand
capabilities to support cybersecurity research at the Water Security
Test Bed facility.

Research: Safe and Sustainable Water Resources.—The Com-
mittee directs that up to $5,000,000 be used for grants under sec-
tion 2007 of America’s Water Infrastructure Act (Public Law 115–
270).
Additionally, given the prevalence and impact of drought across
the country, the Committee’s recommendation includes funding for
the Agency to continue its work at labs specializing in groundwater
research.
Ensure Safe Water.—The Committee encourages the Agency to
consider including monodemethylated, didemethylated, and
hydroxylated metabolites of mifepristone in its Unregulated Con-
taminant Monitoring Rule 6 and to study, monitor, and track active
metabolites in wastewater and drinking water.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee includes the following ad-
ditional guidance:
Harmful Algal Blooms.—The Committee encourages the Agency
to conduct and support research that promotes scientific progress
towards preventing and controlling harmful algal blooms (HABs),
including research to: (1) develop methods to monitor, characterize,
and predict HABs for early action; (2) identify and evaluate exist-
ing excess nutrient prevention and treatment technologies; (3) iden-
tify emerging nutrient treatment technologies capable of being
scaled up and to evolve those technologies; and (4) develop best
management practices to help both rural and urban communities
reduce excess nutrients in their watersheds. The Committee pro-
vides $6,000,000 to investigate adverse health effects from expo-
sure to HABs and cyanobacteria toxins and to develop methods to
monitor, predict, and characterize blooms to allow for early action.
Additionally, the Committee encourages the Agency to continue
its efforts as a member agency of the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hy-
poxia Research and Control Act Interagency Working Group.
IRIS Program Integrity.—The Committee directs that no IRIS as-
sessment shall be used as the basis of any regulatory, permitting,
or enforcement action. Further, no IRIS assessment, including but
not limited to assessments for inorganic arsenic and formaldehyde,
shall be finalized that has a reference dose, reference concentra-
tion, or inhalation unit risk at or below background concentration
levels in air, water, soil, or sediment.
The bill also includes a provision prohibiting funding for final-
izing, implementing, administering, or enforcing the proposed in-
terim registration review decision and draft risk assessment adden-
dum for ethylene oxide described in the notice titled ‘‘Pesticide Reg-
istration Review; Proposed Interim Decision and Draft Risk Assess-
ment Addendum for Ethylene Oxide; Notice of Availability’’ (88
Fed. Reg. 22447) unless the Commissioner of Food and Drugs cer-
tifies that, as relevant, finalization, implementation, administra-
tion, or enforcement of such rule, decision, or addendum for ethyl-
ene oxide will not adversely impact the availability of ethylene
oxide to sterilize medical products in the United States or result in
the movement of any sterilization capacity of such products outside
of the United States. The Committee reiterates the essential role
of sterile medical devices, and sterilization capacity, in the United
States in ensuring public health and reliable domestic supply
chains. The Committee is aware that NASEM is currently review-
ing the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Ethylene

Oxide Development Support Document and expects that the Agen-
cy will evaluate the results of that review prior to making any reg-
ulatory decisions using the IRIS assessment.
Student Contracting.—The bill includes language in Title II Ad-
ministrative Provisions providing authority for the Office of Chem-
ical Safety and Pollution Prevention and the Office of Water to con-
tract directly with individuals or indirectly with institutions or
nonprofit organizations, without regard to 41 U.S.C. 5, for the tem-
porary or intermittent personal services of students or recent grad-
uates. The Committee encourages the Agency to evaluate ways that
this authority could be used to increase efficiencies in the relevant
program offices, such as addressing the backlog of chemical and
pesticide reviews, groundwater research, or administering Commu-
nity Project Funding.
Testing Alternatives.—Public Law 114–182 requires the Agency
to reduce and replace the use of vertebrate animals in the testing
of chemical substances with scientifically justified alternative test
methods. The Committee recognizes the Agency’s work on New Ap-
proach Methods (NAMs) and supports efforts to continue and accel-
erate this work, including providing information on how NAMs can
be used to meet statutory requirements, ensuring relevant Agency
staff are appropriately trained on NAMs, and continuing collabora-
tions to advance NAMs. The Committee directs the Agency to sub-
mit a report within one year of enactment of this Act detailing the
progress the Agency has made to reduce animal testing.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT
The Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account
encompasses a broad range of abatement, prevention, enforcement,
and compliance activities, and personnel compensation, benefits,
travel, and expenses for all programs of the Agency except Science
and Technology, Hazardous Substance Superfund, Leaking Under-
ground Storage Tank Trust Fund, Inland Oil Spill Programs, and
the Office of Inspector General.
The Committee recommends $2,272,083,000 for Environmental
Programs and Management.
Clean Air.—Within the funds provided, at least $32,000,000 is
for the Energy Star program as described in Section 131 of the En-
ergy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 6294a).
Compliance.—The Committee directs the Agency to submit a re-
port not later than one year following the enactment of this Act on
the status of the Agency’s implementation of the memorandum ti-
tled ‘‘PFAS Enforcement Discretion and Settlement Policy Under
CERCLA’’.
Environmental Protection: National Priorities.—The bill provides
$35,000,000. The Committee directs that funds be used for a com-
petitive grant program for qualified non-profit organizations to pro-
vide technical assistance for improved water quality or safe drink-
ing water, adequate wastewater to small systems, or individual pri-
vate well owners. The Agency shall provide $26,000,000 for Grass-
roots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act,
for activities specified under Section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking
Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j–1(e)(8)). The Agency is directed to pro-
vide funding to the most qualified and experienced non-profit orga-
nizations in providing technical assistance to small water systems

and to issue the grant awards from this program on an annual
basis. The Agency is also directed to provide $3,450,000 for grants
to qualified not-for-profit organizations for technical assistance for
individual private well owners, with priority given to organizations
that currently provide technical and educational assistance to indi-
vidual private well owners. The Agency is directed to provide on a
national and multi-State regional basis, $1,250,000 for grants to
qualified organizations, for the sole purpose of providing on-site
training and technical assistance for wastewater systems. The
Agency is directed to provide $4,300,000 for grants that may be
awarded on a non-competitive basis to qualified non-profit national
and multistate regional organizations with demonstrated experi-
ence in providing technical assistance support to small and rural
systems and communities for the purpose of providing technical as-
sistance to small and rural communities that have been recipients
of Community Project Funding in fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, or
in this Act, for assistance that includes, but is not limited to, pre-
paring necessary documentation or application materials, com-
plying with program requirements, and obtaining additional finan-
cial or technical resources. The Agency shall require each grantee
to provide a minimum 10 percent match, including in-kind con-
tributions. The Agency is directed to allocate funds to grantees
within 180 days following the enactment of this Act.
Geographic Programs.—The bill provides $651,226,000. In addi-
tion to the amounts provided under this heading, the Committee
notes that fiscal year 2026 funding is also provided to the Geo-
graphic Programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (Public Law 117–58).
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).—The Committee re-
mains concerned about the persistence of harmful algal blooms
(HABs) throughout the Great Lakes, including in the western Lake
Erie basin, Green Bay, and Saginaw Bay. The Committee urges the
Agency to focus program funds on HAB reduction efforts in Great
Lakes regions where nutrient loading contributes the most to
HABs and by investing in innovative projects such as wetland and
other natural infrastructure projects. The Committee directs the
Agency to provide a briefing on its current and historical allocation
of funds among the five focus areas, with a focus on Area 3 (nutri-
ents) and Area 4 (habitat). Additionally, as the Agency distributes
funds across the five focus areas, Tribal-related activities should be
maintained at not less than $15,000,000.
Chesapeake Bay.—From within the amount provided, at least
$11,000,000 is for nutrient and sediment removal grants, at least
$11,000,000 is for small watershed grants to control polluted runoff
from urban, suburban, and agricultural lands, and at least
$9,000,000 is for state-based implementation in the most effective
basins.
Puget Sound.—The Committee recommends $54,000,000 for
Puget Sound, which shall be allocated in the same manner as di-
rected in House Report 112–331.
South Florida.—Within the funds provided, $1,000,000 shall be
for the expansion of the water quality and ecosystem health moni-
toring and prediction network which uses cutting-edge technologies

Lake Champlain.—The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for
the Lake Champlain program. Funds should be allocated through
the Lake Champlain Basin Program Process to support implemen-
tation of Section 120 of the Clean Water Act, including partnering
with States, local organizations, and other stakeholders working to
address challenges in the area such as phosphorous pollution, toxic
substances, biodiversity, and aquatic invasive species, and to make
the lake and surrounding communities and ecosystems more resil-
ient.
Additionally, the Committee directs the Agency to evaluate the
performance of NEIWPCC in its role of administering the funds
provided for the Lake Champlain Basin program, including timeli-
ness in awarding and completing projects and cost effectiveness,
and provide a report to the Committee not later than 180 days fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act on the Agency’s findings.
Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Program.—
The Committee expects the Agency to continue to use funds from
the appropriate Geographic Programs to address invasive species
in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.
Information Exchange/Outreach.—Section 7351 of Public Law
116–92 (National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020)
requires the Agency to develop reporting requirements under Sec-
tion 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The Com-
mittee expects the Agency will adhere to the specific chemicals au-
thorized under Section 7352. The Committee also encourages the
Agency to consider appropriate reporting periods given the resource
and system needs for regulated entities to comply with such report-
ing.
Additionally, Section 7321 of Public Law 116–92 (National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020) requires the Agency
to develop new reporting requirements for the Toxic Release Inven-
tory (TRI). The Committee directs the Agency to implement this
section in a manner that is consistent with the purpose and intent
of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act
(EPCRA).
Pesticide Licensing.—The Committee encourages the Agency to
continue to review and update strategy guidance documents pro-
mulgated under the Endangered Species Act Workplan to include
improvements based on stakeholder input. The Committee also di-
rects the Agency to consider pesticide usage data, existing con-
servation practice data, real-world studies on the impact of spray
drift on ground water and surface water, and sub-county level spe-
cies range maps when conducting Endangered Species Act reviews
of pesticides. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Agency to
coordinate with and seek input from the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture and impacted stakeholders when designing pilot projects or
mitigation actions related to impacts of pesticides on listed species
and their designated critical habitat before publishing any pro-
posed interim decision or interim decision. The Committee also di-
rects the Agency to allow applicants or other third parties to de-
velop biological assessments as part of their application. The Com-
mittee also recommends that the Agency ensure that any epidemio-
logical study or data considered by the Agency for regulatory deci-
sion making in the pesticide review process meets existing data
quality requirements and can be verified and independently re-

viewed by the Agency. The Committee encourages the Agency to
update its guidance to ensure the above criteria are met.
Additionally, the Committee appreciates the Agency’s commit-
ment to completing the third-party assessment, as required by the
Pesticide Registration and Review Act (PRIA 5), and notes that the
planned date of completion is the end of fiscal year 2026.
Finally, the Committee encourages continued efforts by the
Agency to address the backlog of applications and reduce the
timeline for application reviews while ensuring decisions are based
on sound science. Such efforts can include using a wide range of
technologies, tools, and data to more efficiently and effectively re-
view applications. Additionally, the Committee directs the Agency
to identify resource needs, including adequate staffing levels within
each of the regulatory and science divisions of the Office of Pes-
ticide Programs in order to meet statutory obligations in a trans-
parent manner and address the backlog. The Committee directs the
Agency to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee regarding
its resource evaluation and efforts to improve application reviews.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).—Of the funds
provided under this program area, not less than $9,000,000 is for
implementation of a Federal permit program for coal combustion
residuals in non-participating States and Tribes, as authorized
under section 4005(d)(2)(B) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42
U.S.C. 6945(d)(2)(B)), or to provide technical assistance to States or
Tribes establishing their own permitting program under section
4005(d) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6945(d)). The
Committee directs the Agency to finalize the Federal permit pro-
gram as soon as possible, and to review State and Tribal applica-
tions for primacy in a timely manner.
Additionally, the bill includes language to prohibit funding from
implementing, administering, or enforcing the final rule titled
‘‘Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal
Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; Legacy CCR Surface
Impoundments’’ (89 Fed. Reg. 38950). The Committee recognizes
the Agency’s announcement to review the rule and encourages the
Agency to consider a range of alternatives in its review. The Com-
mittee further acknowledges information from the Agency that
companies choose beneficial use of coal ash because it can ‘‘produce
positive environmental, economic, and performance benefits such as
reduced use of virgin resources, lower greenhouse gas emissions,
reduced cost of coal ash disposal, and improved strength and dura-
bility of materials’’ and encourages the continued beneficial use of
coal ash in lieu of disposal.
The Committee also encourages the Agency to further efforts to
limit waste and reduce the need for new landfills by encouraging
the reuse of materials, which can improve resource conservation
and sustainability.
The Committee recognizes the critical role plastics and other re-
cyclable materials play in modern society. Advanced recycling en-
ables more of the plastics we rely upon today to be diverted from
landfills and reused. The Committee encourages the Agency to in-
corporate advanced recycling and substances manufactured from
recycling processes into its programs and strategies to improve col-
lection and reuse of materials and expand markets for recycled ma-
terials. The Committee further encourages the Agency to consider

ways to increase recycling rates and address hard-to-recycle plas-
tics, such as utilizing new and innovative technologies. Finally, the
Committee encourages the Agency to consider advanced recycling
as a manufacturing process under Clean Air Act Sections 111 and
112 rather than waste management subject to Clean Air Act Sec-
tion 129.
The Committee encourages the Agency to continue efforts to
track textile waste and notes that the Agency has previously meas-
ured the generation, recycling, composting, combustion with energy
recovery and landfilling of textile material in municipal solid
waste. The Committee directs the Agency to provide a briefing not
later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act regarding
past and current efforts on textile waste. The Committee also en-
courages the Agency to incorporate textiles as a material into sub-
sequent work stemming from the National Recycling Strategy.
Toxics Risk Review and Prevention.—The Committee remains
concerned that the statutory deadline for reviewing new chemical
applications is not being met under the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) and directs the Agency to address these delays. The
Committee notes that the budget request prioritizes realigning re-
sources, expertise, and FTE to more efficiently evaluate chemical
reviews, and is encouraged by this effort. Additionally, Public Law
119–4 provided $17,000,000 for IT modernization within the Office
of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and the Committee
looks forward to the resulting improvements and efficiencies that
will result from this modernization.
The Committee supports the Agency’s reconsideration of the final
rule titled ‘‘Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation under the
Toxic Substances Control Act’’ (TSCA) (89 Fed. Reg. 37028), specifi-
cally the Agency’s reconsideration of issuing a single risk deter-
mination rather than a risk evaluation based on the conditions of
use, as well as whether and how the use of personal protective
equipment (PPE) in an occupational setting should be incorporated
into risk evaluations. In its reconsideration, the Committee encour-
ages the Agency to also consider its authority under Section 9 of
TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2608) regarding other appropriate Federal agency
involvement in the risk evaluation process; evaluate the treatment
of de minimis levels of chemicals; and reconsider the decision to in-
clude aggregate exposure in Agency risk assessments.
Relatedly, the Committee is aware of concerns with the Agency’s
implementation of Section 9 of TSCA, which requires the Agency
to first engage with other Federal entities with relevant statutory
authority on a risk evaluation prior to initiating Agency regulatory
action that is covered under Section 9(a)(1). Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Agency to: (1) revise the Memorandum of Under-
standing (MOU) with the Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration (OSHA) to meaningfully delineate between each Agency’s
role and clearly articulate the areas of collaboration between the
agencies; (2) only consider regulating worker exposure limits if the
other relevant Federal agencies have responded under Section 9 of
TSCA that regulation by the Agency is warranted; and (3) refrain
from finalizing a worker exposure limit that is below background
levels or is not above the quantification level for a validated analyt-
ical test method.

Finally, the Agency is encouraged to robustly implement the
tiered testing approach.
Protecting Estuaries and Wetlands: National Estuary Program/
Coastal Waterways.—From within the amount provided, the Com-
mittee provides $850,000 per estuary for National Estuary Pro-
gram (NEP) grants funded under Section 320 of the Clean Water
Act. An additional $2,500,000 is provided for competitive grants.
The Committee encourages the Agency to work in consultation with
the NEP directors to identify worthy projects and activities. In ad-
dition to the amount provided under this heading, Public Law 117–
58 provides $26,400,000 for the NEP for fiscal year 2026.
Additionally, the Committee is aware that Public Law 118–152
amended Section 320(a)(2)(B) of the Clean Water Act to include the
Pensacola and Perdido Bays and encourages the Agency to take the
necessary steps to consider a National Estuary Program determina-
tion for Pensacola and Perdido Bays.
Ensure Safe Water.—Within available funds, the Committee pro-
vides no less than $5,000,000 for the Agency’s continued work with-
in the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program related to
Class VI wells for geologic sequestration to help develop expertise
and capacity at the Agency. These funds should be used by the
Agency to expeditiously review and process Class VI permits and
primacy applications from States and Tribes. In addition, the Com-
mittee provides no less than $1,800,000 to support regulator edu-
cation and training programs in conjunction with States or an asso-
ciation of States. Additionally, the Committee directs the Agency to
promptly undertake necessary improvements to promote process ef-
ficiencies that increase the number of completed reviews and deci-
sions on the Class VI applications and primacy applications related
to Class VI. Doing so will allow greater predictability for appli-
cants, investors, and States and Tribes seeking to address emis-
sions, particularly for projects with higher volumes, that are in an
advanced state of readiness planning, and have signed off-take
agreements.
In addition to the amount provided under this heading, the Com-
mittee notes that Public Law 117–58 provides $5,000,000 for fiscal
year 2026 for this effort.
Additionally, the Committee continues the directive from House
Report 117–400 requiring the Agency to provide an annual report
to the Committee on the status of Class VI injection well primacy
applications within the UIC Program. The report shall include the
status and progress of current primacy applications, including a
projected timeline for final decisions on the applications.
Ensure Clean Water.—The Committee supports the work of the
WaterSense, Urban Waters, and Trash Free Waters programs and
encourages the continuance of these programs.
Additionally, the Committee directs the Agency to continue and
expand its work coordinating with Federal, State, local, and Tribal
agencies to monitor and reduce transboundary hazardous contami-
nants in U.S.-British Columbia transboundary watersheds, includ-
ing the Kootenai watershed. These efforts should be funded at no
less than the enacted level.
Finally, the Committee is aware of efforts by the Agency to ad-
dress barriers to providing temporary water during an emergency
or natural disaster. As part of these efforts, the Committee encour-

ages the Agency to evaluate new mobile water treatment tech-
nologies for pre-approval. The Committee directs the Agency to pro-
vide a briefing not later than 60 days following the enactment of
this Act on the Agency’s work to pre-approve mobile water treat-
ment systems, including testing requirements and coordination
with States.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee has included the following
additional guidance with respect to funding provided under this ac-
count:
Administrator Priorities.—The Agency is directed to submit a re-
port not later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act that
identifies how any fiscal year 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 funding
was used, by account, program area, and program project. Each ac-
tivity funded should include a justification for the effort and any
anticipated results.
Analysis of Rulemaking.—The bill includes a provision prohib-
iting funding for finalizing, implementing, administering, or enforc-
ing the proposed rule titled ‘‘Clean Water Act Effluent Limitation
Guidelines and Standards for the Meat and Poultry Products Point
Source Category’’ (89 Fed. Reg. 4474). Instead, the Committee di-
rects the Agency, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture, to contract with land grant universities that have expertise
with each of the livestock processing sectors likely to be impacted
by the proposed rule to conduct an economic analysis of each of the
three options in the proposed rule. The report should also include
an analysis of the economic impact on the farmers and ranchers
who utilize the meat and poultry processing facilities.
Asthma Rates.—The Committee encourages the Agency to submit
a report on resources and data the Agency has related to trends in
asthma rates, including information on causes or geographic-spe-
cific trends, such as the influences of wildfire smoke and other air
pollutants.
Drinking Water Quality.—The Committee directs the Agency to
provide a briefing not later than 60 days following the enactment
of this Act on resources available for the Agency to assist States
and counties with a high prevalence of violations of drinking water
regulations, such as Wyoming County and McDowell County in
southern West Virginia.
Efforts to Combat Citrus Greening.—The Committee is aware
that citrus greening is one of the most serious diseases affecting
citrus and has caused citrus production to drop catastrophically by
90 percent in Florida alone since 2005. Therefore, the Committee
urges the Agency to explore all available, scientifically sound op-
tions to address citrus greening.
Labeling.—The bill includes language prohibiting any policy, reg-
ulatory action, or labeling change for a product registered under
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
that is inconsistent with, or in any respect different from the con-
clusion of a FIFRA human health assessment or a carcinogenicity
classification for a pesticide. The Committee reiterates that this
language does not preclude or prevent a review or re-review of a
registered product. The Committee further reiterates that this lan-
guage does not impact a State’s ability under current law to regu-
late the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide.

Monitoring Data.—The Committee directs the Agency to provide
a briefing not later than 90 days following the enactment of this
Act on monitoring data in the Coachella Valley, California.
National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recy-
cling Organics.—The Committee is aware of several comments sub-
mitted to the National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste
and Recycling Organics expressing concern that the importance of
rendering as a way to reduce food waste was not adequately cap-
tured. The Committee notes that prior Agency strategies on food
waste included rendering as a key waste management strategy.
The Committee encourages the Agency to revise the final National
Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling
Organics, as well as the Wasted Food Scale, to include rendering.
Nonattainment Petitions.—The Committee directs the Agency to
provide a briefing not later than 90 days following the enactment
of this Act on the process to petition for an exemption from a non-
attainment area, including allowable petitioners and exemptions of
particular areas within the nonattainment area.
Nonattainment Report.—The Committee directs the Agency to
provide a report not later than 60 days following the enactment of
this Act on the resources and funding the Agency believes are nec-
essary to address extreme nonattainment areas, and how the Agen-
cy will work with local, State, and relevant Federal agencies in
nonattainment areas where Federal sources are significant cause
for nonattainment.
Outstanding Permits and Requests for Technical Assistance.—
The Committee reminds the Agency that it is directed to review,
as quickly as possible, all outstanding permits for activities in the
U.S. Territories. Additionally, the Committee directs the Agency to
coordinate with the Department of Defense and provide technical
assistance as requested for such activities. This effort is important
for U.S. national security interests in order to deter aggression by
China in the area and to promote responsible economic develop-
ment locally.
Pre-Commercial Thinning.—The Committee directs the Agency to

less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted levels.
Urban Agroforestry.—The Committee encourages the Forest
Service to explore opportunities to support urban agroforestry ef-
forts that combine food and tree cultivation to improve carbon stor-
age, public health, and local food access.
Urban Heat Vulnerabilities.—The Committee is concerned that
shrinking urban tree canopies result in unsafe heat vulnerabilities
and encourages the Forest Service to engage in multi-organiza-
tional collaborations that prioritize tree plantings to increase can-
opy cover in areas that are most vulnerable and severely affected
by urban heat.
Weed Management Areas.—The Committee urges the Forest
Service to support collaborative efforts with local stakeholders to
manage and control unwanted vegetation, which, if left
unmanaged, increases the intensity, rate of spread, and total an-
nual acreage of forested areas burned.
NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM
The Committee recommends $1,866,465,000 for the National For-
est System.
Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness.—The recommendation pro-
vides $3,000,000 to support infrastructure and trails development
and to build the capacity of local user groups and partnership orga-
nizations for all National Recreation Areas administered by the
Forest Service and established after 1997; $2,000,000 to continue
implementation of the Native American Tourism and Improving
Visitor Experience (NATIVE) Act and to engage with Tribes, Tribal
organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations to promote sus-
tainable native tourism activities and to identify areas where tech-

nical assistance, training and cultural tourism development sup-
port is needed; $750,000 for the maintenance of rural airstrips; and
$500,000 to support infrastructure and trails development and to
build airstrip capacity of local user groups and partnership organi-
zations.
Grazing Management.—The recommendation provides $6,300,000
for grazing management for the Forest Service to address the back-
log of allotments still requiring National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) analysis and documentation. Within the amount provided,
the Forest Service is expected to administer existing permits to en-
sure grazing will be sustained at the appropriate levels.
Additionally, the Committee encourages the Forest Service to
prioritize projects that seek to map and limit encroachment of prai-
rie dogs on National Forest grasslands.
Hazardous Fuels Management.—The recommendation provides
$202,000,000 for fuels management activities and does not transfer
the program to Wildland Fire Management as requested. Of the
funds made available for fuels management, $30,000,000 is pro-
vided for Wood Innovation Grants and $8,000,000 is provided for
the Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes (SWERI), including
no less than $1,400,000 to create a new Interior West Institute in
the State of Nevada, as directed by the Committee the last two
years and as is consistent with Public Law 108–317. The Com-
mittee directs the current institutes to coordinate with the State of
Nevada and the appropriate University of Nevada to provide an
update to the Committee not later than 60 days following the en-
actment of this Act on the actions taken related to the creation of
the new institute.
The Committee recognizes the urgent need to significantly in-
crease fire resilience in the wildland urban interface, especially in
the Western United States. The Committee strongly encourages the
Forest Service to further public-private partnerships using new and
innovative technologies to streamline forest stewardship project im-
plementation and wildfire mitigation.
Vegetation and Watershed Management.—The recommendation
provides $30,000,000 for Vegetation and Watershed Management.
The Committee encourages the Forest Service to conduct additional
outreach to water users to utilize existing vegetation and water-
shed management funding to demonstrate the value of restoring
aquatic ecosystems to build resilience to natural hazards in source
watersheds.
Additional Guidance.—The Committee provides the following ad-
ditional guidance related to activities funded in this account.
Agency Timber Target.—The Committee supports the President’s
Executive Order titled ‘‘Immediate Expansion of Timber Produc-
tion’’ as a necessary step toward restoring responsible forest man-
agement and reinvigorating the domestic timber economy. The
Committee underscores the importance of meeting annual timber
harvest targets to support rural economies, reduce wildfire risk,
and ensure the long-term health and productivity of the National
Forest System. The Committee directs the Forest Service to set an-
nual timber targets at or near each forest’s sustainable yield, en-
suring that federally managed forests are contributing to the full
extent of their capacity. The Committee directs the Forest Service
to fully utilize existing statutory authorities—such as the Good

Neighbor Authority and stewardship contracting—to close produc-
tion gaps and maximize the use of available resources.
The Committee notes support for the personal use firewood pro-
gram as many rural residents rely on firewood cut and gathered
from National Forests to heat their homes. However, the Com-
mittee directs the agency to separate personal use firewood from
commercial forest products when calculating timber accomplish-
ments and cut and sold reports.
The Committee is concerned that Region 1 has consistently
missed its board feet goals with over 500 million board feet tied up
in litigation last year. The Committee directs the Forest Service to
provide a report to the Committee not later than 240 days fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act on efforts to coordinate with the
Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Divi-
sion and relevant stakeholders and state agencies on pending liti-
gation, steps during the NEPA process to avoid litigation, and ef-
forts to utilize authorities given to the Forest Service by Congress.
Appalachian National Scenic Trail.—The Committee encourages
the Forest Service to coordinate internally across forests and re-
gions and externally with the National Park Service for the admin-
istration of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.
Communication Sites Permitting.—The Committee urges the For-
est Service to continue to work with the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration to summarize, simplify,
and standardize permitting regulations and requirements to ensure
both timely action and responsible stewardship in order to make
progress toward national broadband objectives. The bill includes
language to permit the Forest Service to collect funds to cover the
costs of administering the communications site program.
El Yunque National Forest.—The Committee commends ongoing
joint efforts between the Forest Service and Puerto Rico to reduce
traffic congestion areas surrounding the El Yunque National Forest
to ensure rural communities have equitable access to the infra-
structure.
Good Neighbor Authority (GNA).—The Committee recognizes the
positive impact of existing authorities, such as the GNA, on Na-
tional Forest System lands in areas at high risk of wildfire. The
Committee encourages the Forest Service to continue engagement
with States and Tribes on GNA projects wherever applicable, espe-
cially in areas with high risk of fire.
Lake Tahoe Basin.—The Committee directs the Forest Service to
support the implementation of Public Law 106–506, as amended,
and restoration efforts in the greater Lake Tahoe fire shed, at no
less than the fiscal year 2024 enacted levels.
Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL).—The
Committee acknowledges the passage of Public Law 117–328 and
the unique role the LBL plays in protecting natural resources and
wildlife, promoting environmental conservation education, and pre-
serving over 170,000 acres of forests, wetlands, and open lands on
the peninsula between Kentucky and Barkley Lakes in Kentucky
and Tennessee. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Forest
Service to allocate annual appropriated funding at least commensu-
rate with the enacted level to accomplish deferred maintenance
projects, to support recreation and heritage activities, and to im-
prove transportation corridors and bridges, consistent with Public

Law 117–328. The Committee directs the Forest Service to provide
a list of deferred maintenance projects and a cost estimate of these
projects at the National Recreation Area and brief the Committee
not later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act.
Law Enforcement and Investigations.—The Committee is aware
of the Forest Service’s revision of criminal prohibitions to enhance
the consistency of its law enforcement practices with those of state
and other Federal land management agencies. The Committee di-
rects the Forest Service and its Special Agents in Charge to meet
with individual sheriffs to understand and address local concerns
or issues as the Forest Service finalizes local agreements.
Seedling Supplies.—The Committee encourages the Forest Serv-
ice to work with States and partners to support activities that in-
crease regional seedling supplies across subprograms, including es-
tablishment and expansion of Federal nurseries and seed
extractories.
Shaded Fuel Breaks.—The Committee notes that the American
Relief Act, which was signed into law on December 21, 2024, pro-
vided $75,000,000 to the Forest Service to develop, construct, and
maintain shaded fuel break projects in the Pacific Regions. This
critical investment will enhance wildfire resilience, protect vulner-
able towns, and save significant taxpayer dollars in the long term.
The Committee appreciates the quick action of the U.S. Secretary
of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service to enter into a
stewardship agreement to complete this work. The Committee di-
rects the Forest Service to update the Committee on a quarterly
basis on the status of this work and associated funding, any
changes made to initially selected fuel break project locations, les-
sons learned, and instances in which the fuel breaks were instru-
mental in stopping a wildfire’s progression. Not later than 240 days
following the enactment of this Act, the Committee directs the For-
est Service to provide a briefing regarding opportunities to expand
this work to other high priority areas across the Western United
States that would benefit from strategically connecting existing
fuel treatments to significantly increase wildfire resilience.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The Committee recommends $157,000,000 for Capital Improve-
ment and Maintenance. As in previous years, this amount is offset
with a scoring credit related to the Roads and Trails Fund.
National Scenic and Historic Trails.—The Committee directs the
Forest Service to continue to provide specific trail operation, main-
tenance, and construction funding and accomplishment data for the
National Scenic and Historic Trails in future budget justifications.
The Committee recommends no less than $15,000,000 for National
Scenic and Historic Trails funding.
Employee Housing.—The Committee directs the Forest Service to
prioritize, when possible, the maintenance of aging employee hous-
ing facilities that lack direct access to clean water and drinking
water. This includes, but is not limited to, building out infrastruc-
ture that allows for consistent access to water utilities, such as the
employee housing located in Bridgeport, CA.

sible opportunities, using Administrative Site Leasing authorities,
to partner for investment in unused facilities that may facilitate
long-term leasing arrangements to expand housing options for for-
est industry employees.
ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR NATIONAL FORESTS SPECIAL ACTS
The Committee recommends $664,000 for Acquisition of Lands
for National Forests Special Acts.
ACQUISITION OF LANDS TO COMPLETE LAND EXCHANGES
The Committee recommends $150,000 for Acquisition of Lands to
Complete Land Exchanges under the Act of December 4, 1967 (16
U.S.C. 484a).
RANGE BETTERMENT FUND
The Committee recommends $1,719,000 for the Range Better-
ment Fund, to be derived from grazing receipts from National For-
ests, pursuant to Public Law 94–579, and to be used for range re-
habilitation, protection, and improvements including seeding, re-
seeding, fence construction, weed control, water development, and
fish and wildlife habitat enhancement in 16 western States.
GIFTS, DONATIONS AND BEQUESTS FOR FOREST AND RANGELAND
RESEARCH
The Committee recommends $45,000 for Gifts, Donations and Be-
quests for Forest and Rangeland Research.
MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL FOREST LANDS FOR SUBSISTENCE USES
The Committee recommends $1,099,000 for the Management of
National Forest Lands for Subsistence Uses in Alaska.
WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Committee recommends $2,426,209,000 for Wildland Fire
Management.
Fire Operations.—The Committee recommends $192,000,000 for
preparedness, $1,011,000,000 for suppression operations, and
$1,223,209,000 for salaries and expenses, including the funding
needed for the Forest Service to continue to execute the new pay
table passed as a part of Public Law 119–4 as a permanent fix en-
suring the Federal agencies’ ability to recruit and retain wildland
firefighters and maintain current firefighter capacity.
Casualty Assistance Program.—The Committee understands the
need for a robust casualty assistance program for wildland fire-
fighters and support personnel who are critically injured, ill, or de-
ceased. The Committee encourages the Forest Service to continue
its efforts to provide support and build out its casualty assistance
program to meet the needs of its employees.
Firefighting Technologies.—The Committee directs the Forest
Service to evaluate new firefighting technologies, including but not
limited to flexible fiberglass-band mesh, to support the safety and

efficiency of wildland firefighters, as well as emerging technologies
for use in wildland fire suppression efforts such as infrared tech-
nology. The Committee directs the Forest Service to report back to
the Committee on this evaluation not later than one year following
the enactment of this Act.
The Committee also encourages the Forest Service to look at
proven technologies being developed by states and consider uti-
lizing new technologies to support wildfire detection, such as those
that can detect fire-starting lightning strikes.
Middle Fire Leaders Academy.—The Committee understands the
need to provide additional opportunities for retention and growth
of mid-career firefighters and support personnel. The Committee
encourages the Forest Service to determine the steps necessary to
establish a Middle Fire Leaders Academy as outlined in the recent
Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission Report,
dated September 2023.
Wildfire Forecasting.—The Committee understands the benefits
of AI-based tools supporting the next generation of wildland fire ob-
servations and how they can accomplish the goals of early fire de-
tection, prediction, and prevention. These tools can help provide
firefighters and commanders with enhanced awareness using real
time data while building a database of observations to better pre-
dict the spread of fire, shorten response times, and save lives and
property. The Committee includes $1,000,000 for the Forest Service
to utilize an existing partnership with a public research university
in a fire prone, western state with proximity to the National Inter-
agency Fire Center to develop AI-based wildfire activity forecasting
and modeling tools.
WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS RESERVE FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The bill includes $2,480,000,000 for the Wildfire Suppression Op-
erations Reserve Fund. Of the additional $2,850,000,000 available
for fire suppression operations, $2,480,000,000 is provided to the
Forest Service and the remaining $370,000,000 is available through
a transfer from the Department of the Interior.
The Committee provides these additional funds and authorities
to ensure that sufficient funds are available to protect American
homes, lands, and wildlife from catastrophic fires without requiring
a transfer of funds from the very activities that advance forest
health and prevent wildland fires. The Committee expects the For-
est Service to use suppression funds judiciously and continue to
work closely with the Office of Management and Budget and the
Department of the Interior to accurately account for expenditures
and recover costs.
COMMUNICATIONS SITE ADMINISTRATION

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
The provision of Federal health services to Indians is based on
a treaty and trust relationship between Indian Tribes and the U.S.
Government first set forth in the 1830s by the United States Su-
preme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall and numerous
treaties, statutes, constitutional provisions, and international laws
have reconfirmed this relationship. Principal among these is the
Snyder Act of 1921, which provides the basic authority for most In-
dian health services provided by the Federal Government to Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS)
provides primary health care and disease prevention services to ap-
proximately 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives
through a network of over 600 hospitals, clinics, and health sta-
tions on or near Indian reservations. Facilities are predominantly
located in rural primary care settings and are managed by IHS,
Tribal, and urban Indian health programs.
The Committee acknowledges the significant funding needs
across Indian Country, and the level of funding provided reflects
the Committee’s commitment to advancing the Federal Govern-
ment’s trust and treaty obligations. The Committee understands
that fixed costs continue to rise and flat funding results in a cut
to programmatic dollars.
The Committee directs IHS to provide a detailed spend plan for
fixed costs not later than 60 days following the enactment of this
Act, including a timeline for when the funds will be distributed.
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
The recommendation includes $5,354,645,000 that is available for
obligation in fiscal year 2026 for the Indian Health Services Ac-
count. This includes $4,722,738,000 provided as a fiscal year 2026
advance and $631,907,000 recommended in this bill and available
in this fiscal year. These funds are available for two years unless
otherwise specified.
The recommendation provides $78,409,000 to fund the most re-
cent estimate of the cost of staffing at new facilities. Funds may
not be allocated to a facility until such facility has achieved bene-
ficial occupancy status. The Committee understands that amounts
required for staffing new facilities continue to evolve, due in part
to when facilities achieve beneficial occupancy. The Committee ex-

pects IHS to provide an update as beneficial occupancy dates or
cost estimates change.
Clinical Services.—The recommendation includes $4,801,826,000
in budget year appropriations for Clinical Services.
Hospitals and Health Clinics.—The recommendation includes
$2,855,868,000 for Hospitals and Health Clinics.
The Committee recognizes the importance of Tribal Epidemiology
Centers (TEC) which conduct epidemiology and public health func-
tions critical to the delivery of health care services for Tribal and
urban Indian communities. The recommendation includes
$44,433,000 for TECs.
The recommendation includes $7,000,000 for IHS to expand, in
coordination with Tribes and Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs),
the Produce Prescription Pilot to implement a produce prescription
model to increase access to produce and other traditional foods
among its service population. The Committee encourages IHS to
provide a briefing to the Committee not later than 90 days fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act on the distribution of funds and
implementation efforts.
The recommendation includes $6,000,000 to continue Alzheimer’s
and related dementia activities. These funds will enable awardees
to continue to implement locally developed models of culturally ap-
propriate screening, diagnostics, and management of people living
with Alzheimer’s and other related dementia. This funding also
supports the Dementia ECHO program, designed to support clini-
cians and caregivers to strengthen their knowledge and care
around dementia for Tribal patients.
The recommendation also includes $3,000,000 for Improving Ma-
ternal Health. The Committee also recognizes the importance of in
vitro diagnostics tools for the detection of diseases, infections, and
other medical conditions. These tools provide valuable information
to aid providers in accurate diagnostics, treatment planning, and
monitoring of patient health. The Committee encourages the use of
in vitro diagnostics in IHS health clinics and medical facilities.
Dental Health.—The recommendation includes $287,085,000 for
Dental Health services.
The Committee recognizes the importance of Dental Support
Centers (DSC) in providing technical support, training, and assist-
ance in clinical and preventive efforts of the dental program. Many
IHS dentists practice in isolated areas without immediate access to
specialty services. DSCs provide them with the necessary expertise
and experience they need to address challenging oral health de-
mands. The Committee includes $8,000,000 to continue expanding
DSCs to all 12 service areas with the flexibility to regionalize DSC
operations as needed. The Committee directs IHS to provide a
briefing not later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act
on how IHS allocated funds, including where and how it expanded
DSCs across its service areas and if it regionalized any DSC oper-
ations to provide their services more efficiently.
The Committee commends IHS for its successful installation of
the dental records system. The Committee provides $6,500,000 for
managing the current Electronic Dental Records (EDR) system.

is still facing as the program is being implemented. The Committee
also directs IHS to expand efforts in planning and developing
greater data and information exchange between the electronic
health records system and the EDR system.
Mental Health.—The recommendation includes $144,946,000 for
Mental Health/Social Services.
The recommendation includes $2,000,000 for a new behavioral
health pilot program to support no more than 10 pilots that award
grants to an Indian Tribe, Tribal organization, or consortium of In-
dian Tribes to operate and implement special behavioral health
programs authorized by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act
(25 U.S.C. 1665 et seq.) on or near an Indian Reservation. The
Committee directs that grants should be awarded for two years and
should be no less than $10,000 and no more than $100,000 each
year and should not increase State administrative costs or the ben-
efits provided in any program. The Committee directs IHS to pro-
vide a report not later than one year following the enactment of
this Act on the status and outcomes of the pilot.
Alcohol and Substance Abuse.—The recommendation includes
$286,389,000 for Alcohol and Substance Abuse programs.
Purchase and Referred Care.—The recommendation includes
$1,054,066,000 for Purchase and Referred Care (PRC).
The Committee is aware that some IHS areas are considered
Purchased and Referred Care Dependent and Tribes in PRC-de-
pendent areas must rely solely on PRC for emergency, hospital,
and special health care services. The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of these funds for PRC-dependent areas and directs IHS
to provide a report not later than 90 days following the enactment
of this Act on the funding distribution methodology and how PRC-
dependent areas, including those in California, are receiving the
necessary PRC funds needed to purchase lifesaving care for Tribal
members.
Preventative Health.—The recommendation includes
$230,035,000 for Preventative Health.
Other Services.—The recommendation includes $322,784,000 for
Other Services.
The Committee recognizes the Federal trust responsibility to pro-
vide health care services to American Indian and Alaska Native
citizens and acknowledges that approximately seventy-one percent
live in urban areas. The recommendation includes $105,992,000 for
Urban Indian Health programs.
The recommendation includes $95,252,000 for Indian Health Pro-
fessions programs. The Committee continues to support Indian
Health Professions programs and expects IHS to allocate the fund-
ing provided across all programs, including the Scholarship Pro-
gram, Loan Repayment Program, Indians Into Medicine Program
(INMED), American Indians into Nursing (RAIN) Program, and the
American Indians into Psychology Programs.
The Committee reminds IHS that any grant made under Sec. 112
of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended (Public
Law 94 437) to the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into
Nursing Program is not intended to reduce the eligibility of any
other applicants to receive grants under Sec. 112 of the Indian
Health Care Improvement Act, as amended. The Committee directs
IHS to provide a report not later than 30 days following the enact-

ment of this Act on actions taken to ensure that the regional loca-
tion of a Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into Nursing Pro-
gram grant recipient does not disqualify other applicants to receive
grants under Sec. 112 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act,
as amended.
The Committee appreciates the opportunities made available
through Indian Health Professions programs like the Loan Repay-
ment Program (LRP). The recommendation includes $53,000,000
for LRP. LRP provides grants to help offset student loan costs in
exchange for two years of service at an Indian health program.
While the Committee greatly appreciates programs like LRP, the
Committee is concerned about the tax assessments associated with
this grant program. The Committee directs IHS to provide a report
not later than 180 days following the enactment of this Act identi-
fying the impact tax liabilities have on the program. The report
should calculate the tax liability assessed to recipients, the impact
this has on program participation, the resources used by IHS to
help offset the tax owed by recipients, and how many additional
grants could be provided if a tax liability was not incurred. The
Committee directs IHS to work with other applicable Bureaus or
Agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, to complete the report.
The Committee directs IHS to continue its collaboration with
Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Health Resources and Services Ad-
ministration (HRSA) on graduate medical education and provide
quarterly reports updating the Committee on its progress in bring-
ing additional coordinated training opportunities to Tribal commu-
nities.
Staffing.—While the Committee appreciates efforts to increase
efficiency across the Federal government, the Committee also rec-
ognizes the vital role health care staff play in Tribal communities
across the nation. The Committee directs IHS to provide a report
not later than 90 days following the enactment of this Act outlining
programs and authorities being used to increase staff numbers and
retain permanent personnel across IHS programs.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation esti-
mated to be $1,819,000,000 for contract support costs incurred by
the agency as required by law. The bill continues language making
available such sums as are necessary to meet the Federal Govern-
ment’s full legal obligation and prohibiting the transfer of funds to
any other account for any other purpose. In addition, the bill in-
cludes language specifying carryover funds may be applied to sub-
sequent years’ contract support costs.
The Committee strongly encourages the Indian Health Service to
fully reimburse activities covered by contract support costs, includ-
ing activities normally carried out by the Secretary, but not fully
paid for in the Secretarial account.
PAYMENTS FOR TRIBAL LEASES
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation esti-
mated to be $366,000,000 for Payments for Tribal Leases incurred

ment’s full legal obligation and prohibits the transfer of funds to
any other account for any other purpose.
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
The recommendation includes $865,864,000 that is available for
obligation in fiscal year 2026. This includes $510,774,000 provided
as a fiscal year 2026 advance and $355,090,000 recommended in
this bill and available in this fiscal year.
The Committee continues advance appropriations for programs
advanced in fiscal year 2025 and expands advance appropriations
to the Indian Health Facilities Sanitation Facilities Construction
and Health Care Facilities Construction accounts.
The recommendation provides $8,726,000 to fund the most recent
estimate of the cost of staffing at new facilities. Funds may not be
allocated to a facility until such facility has achieved beneficial oc-
cupancy status. The Committee understands that amounts re-
quired for staffing new facilities continue to evolve, due in part to
when facilities achieve beneficial occupancy. IHS is expected to up-
date the Committee as beneficial occupancy dates or cost estimates
change.
Sanitation Facilities Construction.—The recommendation in-
cludes $130,968,000 for Sanitation Facilities Construction.
Health Care Facilities Construction.—The recommendation in-
cludes $188,702,000 for Health Care Facilities Construction.
The recommendation includes $14,000,000 for Staff Quarters for
staff housing across the IHS health care delivery system to support
the recruitment and retention of quality healthcare professionals
across Indian country.
Equipment.—The Committee is aware that certain jurisdictions
have adopted de-energization protocols to reduce the risks of cata-
strophic wildfires. While these protocols are useful in limiting loss
of life in affected communities, they can also have dire con-
sequences for Tribal Health Programs located in impacted areas.
To increase the resilience of these facilities, the recommendation
includes $8,000,000 to purchase generators, including for IHS,
Tribal Health Programs, and Urban Indian Organizations located
in areas impacted by de-energization events. In procuring backup
generators, the Committee directs the Indian Health Service to de-
termine the most cost-effective method, which may include leasing.
In determining the most cost-effective procurement method, the
Committee directs the Service to account for life-cycle maintenance
costs associated with direct ownership and clinics’ capabilities to
maintain these generators.

that remaining funds that have not been distributed for adminis-
trative functions or other grants across NEA be used to support
State and Regional partnerships.
Creative Forces.—The Committee commends NEA on its partner-
ship with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, on the

nership provides creative arts therapies and arts engagement strat-
egies that promote healing and support the reintegration of service
members and veterans recovering from traumatic brain injuries
and psychological health issues.
National Garden of American Heroes.—The Committee supports
the Administration’s proposal to establish a statuary park to honor
250 individuals that have embodied the American spirit of daring

loyalty, and love. The Committee supports NEA’s role in the cre-
ation of the National Garden of American Heroes.

tive that assists small and rural communities with economic devel-
opment and community planning with a focus on creative
placemaking and encourages NEA to continue the program.

tinue support for projects that promote the culture, language, and
related arts of indigenous peoples’ communities, including Amer-
ican Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.

NEH’s efforts leading up to America’s Semiquincentennial and the
America 250 activities that educate and engage communities about
the past, present, and future of our Nation.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee appreciates NEH’s grow-
ing interest in examining human perspectives on Artificial Intel-
ligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. The Committee sup-
ports NEH’s efforts to examine humanities perspectives and impli-
cations of these rapidly expanding technology fields. Further, the
Committee encourages NEH to collaborate primarily with under-
graduate and non-research-intensive institutions in these efforts to
provide a wider workforce pipeline of students graduating with AI
humanities perspectives and literacy.
Collaboration with State and Regional Humanities Councils.—
The Committee commends NEH for its ongoing, successful collabo-
ration with State humanities councils in each of the 50 states,
Washington, D.C., the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, and American Samoa. The recommendation includes at least
$72,000,000 to support Federal and State partnerships. The Com-
mittee encourages that remaining funds that have not been distrib-
uted for administrative functions or other grants across NEH be
used to support State and Regional partnerships.
Diaspora Groups.—The Committee recognizes the cultural con-
tributions of diaspora groups from nations and communities across
the world to the United States and appreciates the value in pre-
serving their traditions. The Committee recognizes the important
work NEH is doing to support the archiving of stories, documents,
and other materials from cultural diasporas worldwide. The Com-
mittee supports NEH’s efforts to partner with cultural organiza-
tions across the country to collect additional stories, documents and
materials from families and institutions dedicated to diaspora com-
munities, particularly in Eastern Europe.
Documenting the American Experience.—The Committee recog-
nizes the need to document the American experience, including the
production of books and pamphlets similar to the American Guide
Series, and supports NEH’s efforts to chronicle American life across
the country.
National Garden of American Heroes.—The Committee supports
the Administration’s proposal to establish a statuary park to honor
250 individuals that have embodied the American spirit of daring
and defiance, excellence and adventure, courage and confidence,
loyalty, and love. The Committee supports NEA’s role in the cre-
ation of the National Garden of American Heroes.
Tribal and Native Hawaiian Heritage and Culture.—The Com-
mittee commends NEH for its ongoing support to American Indian
and Alaska Native communities in preserving their cultural and
linguistic heritage through the Documenting Endangered Lan-
guages program and the preservation and access grants that enable

make their cultural artifacts broadly accessible.

As part of the effort to preserve this history and culture, the
Committee encourages NEH to explore ways to increase its efforts
in local libraries, museums, or other historical institutions related
to local Tribal histories, particularly in areas where few Tribal in-
terests remain.
Veterans Programs.—The Committee commends NEH for its sup-
port of grant programs to benefit wounded warriors and to ensure
educational opportunities for veterans and service members
transitioning to civilian life. The Committee supports the programs
that State humanities councils, in conjunction with NEH, have de-
veloped and delivered to veterans, their families, and caregivers.

caust Memorial Council with the mandate to create and oversee a
living memorial/museum to victims of the Holocaust. The museum
opened in April 1993. Construction costs for the museum came
solely from donated funds raised by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum Campaign, and appropriated funds were used for plan-
ning and development of programmatic components, overall admin-
istrative support, and annual commemorative observances. Since
the opening of the museum, appropriated funds have been provided
to pay for the ongoing operating costs of the museum as authorized

MINERAL LEASING ACT
* * * * * * *
SEC. 17. (a) All lands subject to disposition under this Act which
are known or believed to contain oil or gas deposits may be leased
by the Secretary.
(b)(1)(A) All lands to be leased which are not subject to leasing
under paragraph (2) shall be leased as provided in this paragraph
to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding
under general regulations in units of not more than 2,560 acres, ex-
cept in Alaska, where units shall be not more than 5,760 acres.
Such units shall be as nearly compact as possible. Lease sales shall
be conducted by oral bidding, except as provided in subparagraph
(C). Lease sales shall be held for each State where eligible lands
are available at least quarterly and more frequently if the Sec-
retary of the Interior determines such sales are necessary. Eligible
lands comprise all lands subject to leasing under this Act and not
excluded from leasing by a statutory or regulatory prohibition.
Available lands are those lands that have been designated as open
for leasing under a land use plan developed under section 202 of
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and that
have been nominated for leasing through the submission of an ex-
pression of interest, are subject to drainage in the absence of leas-
ing, or are otherwise designated as available pursuant to regula-
tions adopted by the Secretary. A lease shall be conditioned upon
the payment of a royalty at a rate of not less than 162⁄
3
percent
in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the
lease or, in the case of a lease issued during the 10-year period be-
ginning on the date of enactment of the Act titled ‘‘An Act to pro-
vide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14’’, 162⁄
3
percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from
the lease. The Secretary shall accept the highest bid from a respon-
sible qualified bidder which is equal to or greater than the national
minimum acceptable bid, without evaluation of the value of the
lands proposed for lease. Leases shall be issued within 60 days fol-
lowing payment by the successful bidder of the remainder of the
bonus bid, if any, and the annual rental for the first lease year. All
bids for less than the national minimum acceptable bid shall be re-
jected.
(B) The national minimum acceptable bid shall be $10 per acre
during the 10-year period beginning on the date of enactment of
the Act titled ‘‘An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title
II of S. Con. Res. 14’’. Thereafter, the Secretary, subject to para-
graph (2)(B), may establish by regulation a higher national min-
imum acceptable bid for all leases based upon a finding that such
action is necessary: (i) to enhance financial returns to the United

115
States; and (ii) to promote more efficient management of oil and
gas resources on Federal lands. Ninety days before the Secretary
makes any change in the national minimum acceptable bid, the
Secretary shall notify the Committee on Natural Resources of the
United States House of Representatives and the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate. The pro-
posal or promulgation of any regulation to establish a national
minimum acceptable bid shall not be considered a major Federal
action subject to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
(C) In order to diversify and expand the Nation’s onshore leasing
program to ensure the best return to the Federal taxpayer, reduce
fraud, and secure the leasing process, the Secretary may conduct
onshore lease sales through Internet-based bidding methods. Each
individual Internet-based lease sale shall conclude within 7 days.
(2)(A)(i) If the lands to be leased are within a special tar sand
area, they shall be leased to the highest responsible qualified bid-
der by competitive bidding under general regulations in units of
not more than 5,760 acres, which shall be as nearly compact as
possible, upon the payment by the lessee of such bonus as may be
accepted by the Secretary.
(ii) Royalty shall be 162⁄
3
percent in amount of value of produc-
tion removed or sold from the lease subject to section 17(k)(1)(c).
(iii) The Secretary may lease such additional lands in special tar
sand areas as may be required in support of any operations nec-
essary for the recovery of tar sands.
(iv) No lease issued under this paragraph shall be included
in any chargeability limitation associated with oil and gas
leases.
(B) For any area that contains any combination of tar sand and
oil or gas (or both), the Secretary may issue under this Act, sepa-
rately—
(i) a lease for exploration for and extraction of tar sand; and
(ii) a lease for exploration for and development of oil and gas.
(C) A lease issued for tar sand shall be issued using the same
bidding process, annual rental, and posting period as a lease issued
for oil and gas, except that the minimum acceptable bid required
for a lease issued for tar sand shall be $10 per acre.
(D) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or alter any requirement
under section 26 that a permittee under a permit authorizing
prospecting for tar sand must exercise due diligence, to promote
any resource covered by a combined hydrocarbon lease.
(c) ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING.—Land made
available for leasing under subsection (b)(1) for which no bid is ac-
cepted or received, or the land for which a lease terminates, ex-
pires, is cancelled, or is relinquished, may be made available by the
Secretary of the Interior for a new round of competitive bidding
under that subsection.
(d) All leases issued under this section, as amended by the Fed-
eral Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987, shall be con-
ditioned upon payment by the lessee of a rental of not less than
$3 per acre per year during the 2-year period beginning on the date
the lease begins for new leases, and after the end of that 2-year
period, $5 per acre per year for the following 6-year period, and not
less than $15 per acre per year thereafter, or, in the case of a lease

issued during the 10-year period beginning on the date of enact-
ment of the Act titled ‘‘An Act to provide for reconciliation pursu-
ant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14’’, $3 per acre per year during the
2-year period beginning on the date the lease begins, and after the
end of that 2-year period, $5 per acre per year for the following 6-
year period, and $15 per acre per year thereafter. A minimum roy-
alty in lieu of rental of not less than the rental which otherwise
would be required for that lease year shall be payable at the expi-
ration of each lease year beginning on or after a discovery of oil or
gas in paying quantities on the lands leased.
(e) TERM OF LEASE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Any lease issued under this section, includ-
ing a lease for tar sand areas, shall be for a primary term of
10 years.
(2) CONTINUATION OF LEASE.—A lease described in para-
graph (1) shall continue after the primary term of the lease for
any period during which oil or gas is produced in paying quan-
tities.
(3) ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS.—Any lease issued under this
section for land on which, or for which under an approved co-
operative or unit plan of development or operation, actual drill-
ing operations were commenced and diligently prosecuted prior
to the end of the primary term of the lease shall be extended
for 2 years and for any period thereafter during which oil or
gas is produced in paying quantities.
(f) At least 45 days before offering lands for lease under this sec-
tion, and at least 30 days before approving applications for permits
to drill under the provisions of a lease or substantially modifying
the terms of any lease issued under this section, the Secretary
shall provide notice of the proposed action. Such notice shall be
posted in the appropriate local office of the leasing and land man-
agement agencies. Such notice shall include the terms or modified
lease terms and maps or a narrative description of the affected
lands. Where the inclusion of maps in such notice is not prac-
ticable, maps of the affected lands shall be made available to the
public for review. Such maps shall show the location of all tracts
to be leased, and of all leases already issued in the general area.
The requirements of this subsection are in addition to any public
notice required by other law.
(g) The Secretary of the Interior, or for National Forest lands,
the Secretary of Agriculture, shall regulate all surface-disturbing
activities conducted pursuant to any lease issued under this Act,
and shall determine reclamation and other actions as required in
the interest of conservation of surface resources. No permit to drill
on an oil and gas lease issued under this Act may be granted with-
out the analysis and approval by the Secretary concerned of a plan
of operations covering proposed surface-disturbing activities within
the lease area. The Secretary concerned shall, by rule or regula-
tion, establish such standards as may be necessary to ensure that
an adequate bond, surety, or other financial arrangement will be
established prior to the commencement of surface-disturbing activi-
ties on any lease, to ensure the complete and timely reclamation
of the lease tract, and the restoration of any lands or surface
waters adversely affected by lease operations after the abandon-
ment or cessation of oil and gas operations on the lease. The Sec-

retary shall not issue a lease or leases or approve the assignment
of any lease or leases under the terms of this section to any person,
association, corporation, or any subsidiary, affiliate, or person con-
trolled by or under common control with such person, association,
or corporation, during any period in which, as determined by the
Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Agriculture, such entity
has failed or refused to comply in any material respect with the
reclamation requirements and other standards established under
this section for any prior lease to which such requirements and
standards applied. Prior to making such determination with re-
spect to any such entity the concerned Secretary shall provide such
entity with adequate notification and an opportunity to comply
with such reclamation requirements and other standards and shall
consider whether any administrative or judicial appeal is pending.
Once the entity has complied with the reclamation requirement or
other standard concerned an oil or gas lease may be issued to such
entity under this Act.
(h) The Secretary of the Interior may not issue any lease on Na-
tional Forest System Lands reserved from the public domain over
the objection of the Secretary of Agriculture.
(i) No lease issued under this section which is subject to termi-
nation because of cessation of production shall be terminated for
this cause so long as reworking or drilling operations which were
commenced on the land prior to or within sixty days after cessation
of production are conducted thereon with reasonable diligence, or
so long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities as a result
of such operations. No lease issued under this section shall expire
because operations or production is suspended under any order, or
with the consent, of the Secretary. No lease issued under this sec-
tion covering lands on which there is a well capable of producing
oil or gas in paying quantities shall expire because the lessee fails
to produce the same unless the lessee is allowed a reasonable time,
which shall be not less than sixty days after notice by registered
or certified mail, within which to place such well in producing sta-
tus or unless, after such status is established, production is discon-
tinued on the leased premises without permission granted by the
Secretary under the provisions of this Act.
(j) Whenever it appears to the Secretary that lands owned by the
United States are being drained of oil or gas by wells drilled on ad-
jacent lands, he may negotiate agreements whereby the United
States, or the United States and its lessees, shall be compensated
for such drainage. Such agreements shall be made with the consent
of the lessees, if any, affected thereby. If such agreement is entered
into, the primary term of any lease for which compensatory royalty
is being paid, or any extension of such primary term, shall be ex-
tended for the period during which such compensatory royalty is
paid and for a period of one year from discontinuance of such pay-
ment and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying
quantities.
(k) If, during the primary term or any extended term of any lease
issued under this section, a verified statement is filed by any min-
ing claimant pursuant to subsection (c) of section 7 of the Multiple
Mineral Development Act of August 13, 1954 (68 Stat. 708), as
amended (30 U.S.C. 527), whether such filing occur prior to enact-
ment of the Mineral Leasing Act Revision of 1960 or thereafter, as-

serting the existence of a conflicting unpatented mining claim or
claims upon which diligent work is being prosecuted as to any
lands covered by the lease, the running of time under such lease
shall be suspended as to the lands involved from the first day of
the month following the filing of such verified statement until a
final decision is rendered in the matter.
(l) The Secretary of the Interior shall, upon timely application
therefor, issue a new lease in exchange for any lease issued for a
term of twenty years, or any renewal thereof, or any lease issued
prior to August 8, 1946, in exchange for a twenty-year lease, such
new lease to be for a primary term of five years and so long there-
after as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities and at a royalty
rate of not less than 162⁄
3
percent in amount of value of the produc-
tion removed or sold from such leases, except that the royalty rate
shall be 162⁄
3
percent in amount or value of the production removed
or sold from said leases as to (1) such leases, or such parts of the
lands subject thereto and the deposits underlying the same, as are
not believed to be within the productive limits of any producing oil
or gas deposit, as such productive limits are found by the Secretary
to have existed on August 8, 1946; and (2) any production on a
lease from an oil or gas deposit which was discovered after May 27,
1941, by a well or wells drilled within the boundaries of the lease,
and which is determined by the Secretary to be a new deposit; and
(3) any production on or allocated to a lease pursuant to an ap-
proved cooperative or unit plan of development or operation from
an oil or gas deposit which was discovered after May 27, 1941, on
land committed to such plan, and which is determined by the Sec-
retary to be a new deposit, where such lease, or a lease for which
it is exchanged, was included in such plan at the time of discovery
or was included in a duly executed and filed application for the ap-
proval of such plan at the time of discovery.
(m) For the purpose of more properly conserving the natural re-
sources of any oil or gas pool, field, or like area, or any part thereof
(whether or not any part of said oil or gas pool, field, or like area,
is then subject to any cooperative or unit plan of development or
operation), lessees thereof and their representatives may unite
with each other, or jointly or separately with others, in collective
adopting and operating under a cooperative or unit plan of develop-
ment or operation of such pool, field, or like area, or any part
thereof, whenever determined and certified by the Secretary of the
Interior to be necessary or advisable in the public interest. The
Secretary is thereunto authorized, in his discretion, with the con-
sent of the holders of leases involved, to establish, alter, change, or
revoke drilling, producing, rental, minimum royalty, and royalty re-
quirements of such leases and to make such regulations with ref-
erence to such leases, with like consent on the part of the lessees,
in connection with the institution and operation of any such cooper-
ative or unit plan as he may deem necessary or proper to secure
the proper protection of the public interest. The Secretary may pro-
vide that oil and gas leases hereafter issued under this Act shall
contain a provision requiring the lessee to operate under such a
reasonable cooperative or unit plan, and he may prescribe such a
plan under which such lessee shall operate, which shall adequately
protect the rights of all parties in interest, including the United
States.

Any plan authorized by the preceding paragraph which includes
lands owned by the United States may, in the discretion of the Sec-
retary, contain a provision whereby authority is vested in the Sec-
retary of the Interior, or any such person, committee, or State or
Federal officer or agency as may be designated in the plan, to alter
or modify from time to time the rate of prospecting and develop-
ment and the quantity and rate of production under such plan. All
leases operated under any such plan approved or prescribed by the
Secretary shall be excepted in determining holdings or control
under the provisions of any section of this Act.
When separate tracts cannot be independently developed and op-
erated in conformity with an established well-spacing or develop-
ment program, any lease, or a portion thereof, may be pooled with
other lands, whether or not owned by the United States, under a
communitization or drilling agreement providing for an apportion-
ment of production or royalties among the separate tracts of land
comprising the drilling or spacing unit when determined by the
Secretary of the Interior to be in the public interest, and operations
or production pursuant to such an agreement shall be deemed to
be operations or production as to each such lease committed there-
to.
Any lease issued for a term of twenty years, or any renewal
thereof, or any portion of such lease that has become the subject
of a cooperative or unit plan of development or operation of a pool,
field, or like area, which plan has the approval of the Secretary of
the Interior, shall continue in force until the termination of such
plan. Any other lease issued under any section of this Act which

that contains a general provision for allocation of oil or gas shall
continue in force and effect as to the land committed so long as the
lease remains subject to the plan: Provided, That production is had
in paying quantities under the plan prior to the expiration date of
the term of such lease. Any lease heretofore or hereafter committed
to any such plan embracing lands that are in part within and in
part outside of the area covered by any such plan shall be seg-
regated into separate leases as to the lands committed and the
lands not committed as of the effective date of unitization: Pro-
vided, however, That any such lease as to the nonunitized portion
shall continue in force and effect for the term thereof but for not
less than two years from the date of such segregation and so long

imum royalty or discovery rental under any lease that has become
subject to any cooperative or unit plan of development or operation,
or other plan that contains a general provision for allocation of oil
or gas, shall be payable only with respect to the lands subject to
such lease to which oil or gas shall be allocated under such plan.
Any lease which shall be eliminated from any such approved or
prescribed plan, or from any communitization or drilling agreement
authorized by this section, and any lease which shall be in effect
at the termination of any such approved or prescribed plan, or at

The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, on such condi-
tions as he may prescribe, to approve operating, drilling, or devel-
opment contracts made by one or more lessees of oil or gas leases,
with one or more persons, associations, or corporations whenever,
in his discretion, the conservation of natural products or the public
convenience or necessity may require it or the interests of the
United States may be best subserved thereby. All leases operated
under such approved operating, drilling, or development contracts,
and interests thereunder, shall be excepted in determining holdings
or control under the provisions of this Act.
The Secretary of the Interior, to avoid waste or to promote con-
servation of natural resources, may authorize the subsurface stor-
age of oil or gas, whether or not produced from federally owned
lands, in lands leased or subject to lease under this Act. Such au-
thorization may provide for the payment of a storage fee or rental
on such stored oil or gas or, in lieu of such fee or rental, for a roy-
alty other than that prescribed in the lease when such stored oil
or gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously pro-
duced. Any lease on which storage is so authorized shall be ex-
tended at least for the period of storage and so long thereafter as
oil or gas not previously produced is produced in paying quantities.
(n)(1)(A) The owner of (1) an oil and gas lease issued prior to the
date of enactment of the Combined Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of
1981 or (2) a valid claim to any hydrocarbon resources leasable
under this section based on a mineral location made prior to Janu-
ary 21, 1926, and located within a special tar sand area shall be
entitled to convert such lease or claim to a combined hydrocarbon
lease for a primary term of ten years upon the filing of an applica-
tion within two years from the date of enactment of that Act con-
taining an acceptable plan of operations which assures reasonable
protection of the environment and diligent development of those re-
sources requiring enhanced recovery methods of development or
mining. For purposes of conversion, no claim shall be deemed in-
valid solely because it was located as a placer location rather than
a lode location or vice versa, notwithstanding any previous adju-
dication on that issue.
(B) The Secretary shall issue final regulations to implement this
section within six months of the effective date of this Act. If any
oil and gas lease eligible for conversion under this section would
otherwise expire after the date of this Act and before six months
following the issuance of implementing regulations, the lessee may
preserve his conversion right under such lease for a period ending
six months after the issuance of implementing regulations by filing
with the Secretary, before the expiration of the lease, a notice of
intent to file an application for conversion. Upon submission of a
complete plan of operations in substantial compliance with the reg-
ulations promulgated by the Secretary for the filing of such plans,
the Secretary shall suspend the running of the term of any oil and
gas lease proposed for conversion until the plan is finally approved
or disapproved. The Secretary shall act upon a proposed plan of op-
erations within fifteen months of its submittal.
(C) When an existing oil and gas lease is converted to a combined
hydrocarbon lease, the royalty shall be that provided for in the
original oil and gas lease and for a converted mining claim, 162⁄

(2) Except as provided in this section, nothing in the Combined
Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981 shall be construed to diminish or
increase the rights of any lessee under any oil and gas lease issued
prior to the enactment of such Act.
(o) CERTAIN OUTSTANDING OIL AND GAS.—(1) Prior to the com-
mencement of surface-disturbing activities relating to the develop-
ment of oil and gas deposits on lands described under paragraph
(5), the Secretary of Agriculture shall require, pursuant to regula-
tions promulgated by the Secretary, that such activities be subject
to terms and conditions as provided under paragraph (2).
(2) The terms and conditions referred to in paragraph (1) shall
require that reasonable advance notice be furnished to the Sec-
retary of Agriculture at least 60 days prior to the commencement
of surface disturbing activities.
(3) Advance notice under paragraph (2) shall include each of the
following items of information:
(A) A designated field representative.
(B) A map showing the location and dimensions of all im-
provements, including but not limited to, well sites and road
and pipeline accesses.
(C) A plan of operations, of an interim character if necessary,
setting forth a schedule for construction and drilling.
(D) A plan of erosion and sedimentation control.
(E) Proof of ownership of mineral title.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any author-
ity of the State in which the lands concerned are located to impose
any requirements with respect to such oil and gas operations.
(4) The person proposing to develop oil and gas deposits on lands
described under paragraph (5) shall either—
(A) permit the Secretary to market merchantable timber
owned by the United States on lands subject to such activities;
or
(B) arrange to purchase merchantable timber on lands sub-
ject to such surface disturbing activities from the Secretary of
Agriculture, or otherwise arrange for the disposition of such
merchantable timber, upon such terms and upon such advance
notice of the items referred to in subparagraphs (A) through
(E) of paragraph (3) as the Secretary may accept.
(5)(A) The lands referred to in this subsection are those lands
referenced in subparagraph (B) which are under the administration
of the Secretary of Agriculture where the United States acquired
an interest in such lands pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1911 (36
Stat. 961 and following), but does not have an interest in oil and
gas deposits that may be present under such lands. This subsection
does not apply to any such lands where, under the provisions of its
acquisition of an interest in the lands, the United States is to ac-
quire any oil and gas deposits that may be present under such
lands in the future but such interest has not yet vested with the
United States.
(B) This subsection shall only apply in the Allegheny National
Forest.

MINORITY VIEWS
The fiscal year 2026 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies
(Interior) Appropriations bill is deeply flawed. The bill would raise
utility bills and energy prices, worsen the climate crisis, put pol-
luters over public health, and abandon stewardship of our National
Parks, all to benefit billionaires and big corporations.
The bill compounds the damage our agencies, states, and commu-
nities are dealing with in wake of the President’s illegal funding
freezes, rescissions, and the majority’s unwillingness to negotiate
full-year funding bills.
The bill cuts funding to states for water infrastructure through
the State Revolving Funds by 62 percent. It also cuts the grant pro-
grams that fund state environmental programs, and slashes fund-
ing for EPA operating programs by 23 percent. The Minority made
multiple attempts to restore funding in the bill, but the Majority
strongly resisted these efforts. Both Ranking Member DeLauro’s
amendment to restore State Revolving Funds and Representative
Watson Coleman’s to restore Environmental Justice funding failed
along party lines.
Withdrawing federal funding will mean states and local govern-
ments will be forced to raise their taxes or services will be cut. No-
body benefits. Republicans just increased the federal deficit by $3.4
trillion during reconciliation, and at the same time, they are cut-
ting funding for programs that protect public health and the envi-
ronment, maintain our national parks, and support the arts and
humanities.
The cuts in this bill, taken together with the rescissions in H.R.
1, will debilitate America’s ability to address the climate crisis. It
has become clear that the administration has moved beyond cli-
mate change denial and into actively dismantling the government’s
climate work.
If we are going to keep the public safe, building resilience and
fighting against the impact of climate change is a commonsense
measure. Yet Republicans clawed back those funds so that they
could give tax breaks to billionaires.
The bill cuts the National Park Service by $213 million. That is
on top of the nearly half a billion dollars Republicans rescinded
from national parks and public lands in H.R. 1. That funding
would have supported conservation projects, habitat restoration,
and staffing at our parks.
Making matters worse, the majority’s failure to reauthorize the
Great American Outdoors Act means that the National Park Serv-
ice will no longer receive an annual $1.3 billion to address deferred
maintenance. Taken together, these cuts have created a crisis that
risks destroying the legacy of our national park system.

This administration is trying to sideline anything it deems artis-
tically or culturally offensive, regardless of the effect its decisions
will have on people and communities.
The Trump Administration has illegally terminated thousands of
grants at both the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the
National Endowment for Humanities (NEH). It fired nearly 80 per-
cent of NEH staff and revoked funding for the State Humanities
Councils. In the wake of these assaults, it is critical that Congress
assert its support for the NEA and NEH, but the bill cuts each en-
dowment by $72 million or 35%. Ranking Member Pingree’s
amendment would have restored funding for both endowments to
fiscal year 2025 enacted levels, but once again it was rejected by
the Majority.
The bill also cuts funding for cultural institutions, such as the
National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Institution. This
comes on the heels of the President accusing the Smithsonian of
promoting ‘‘divisive, race-centered ideology,’’ and not doing enough
to ‘‘promote American greatness.’’
Attempting to recast entire agencies in one’s own political image,
or silence expression one does not like, goes against the values we
hold dear: free speech, equal opportunity and the idea that our de-
mocracy is strengthened when everyone has access to knowledge,
culture and a voice in the national story.
The President’s attempt to dismantle our artistic and cultural in-
stitutions will not ‘‘Make America Great Again’’, and it must not
be tolerated. Sadly, instead of condemning this behavior, the Ma-
jority supported Chairman Simpson’s amendment to name the
Opera House in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts after a family member of the President.
Finally, the bill includes 73 poison pill riders that cripple envi-
ronmental protection, undermine climate change policies, and add
to the national deficit.
This bill has been considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since taking office in January 2025, the
executive branch has been engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and
unconstitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular, the Of-
fice of Management and Budget has been at the center of a govern-
ment-wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s laws in
its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the agency’s
legally-binding budget decisions (known as apportionments) in con-
travention of an unambiguous and constitutionally sound assertion
of the Congress’s authority to impose transparency requirements
upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all Democrats on the Committee, the
debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just as former
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States William
Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney General
with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’

The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any funds in the bill, so too does the Committee decide
the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the Com-
mittee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or upper
limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does so in
contrast to every other instance where it has included a specific
amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear intent to
be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
In its current form, this bill fails the American people by cutting
environmental protection; shredding safeguards that protect our
air, water, and endangered species; and allowing rampant corrup-
tion in the Executive Branch to go unchecked. Given these short-
comings, we cannot support this bill in its current form. Despite
our current opposition, we intend to continue to work with Chair-
man Simpson through this year’s appropriations process to produce
a responsible bill that both parties can support.
