The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Automotive Support Services to Improve Safe
Transportation Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘ASSIST Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION REGARDING INCLUSION OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY AUTOMOBILE
ADAPTATIONS IN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS DEFINITION OF ‘‘MEDICAL
SERVICES’’.
Section 1701(6)(I) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
‘‘(I) The provision of any medically necessary automobile adaptations for driv-
er or passenger use, including—
‘‘(i) ramp and kneeling systems;
‘‘(ii) raised doors or lowered floors;
‘‘(iii) raised roofs;
‘‘(iv) air conditioning;
‘‘(v) occupied and unoccupied mobility lifts;
‘‘(vi) ingress or egress accessibility modifications;
‘‘(vii) wheelchair tiedowns; and
‘‘(viii) adapted seating.’’.
SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF CERTAIN LIMITS ON PAYMENTS OF PENSION.
Section 5503(d)(7) of title 38, United States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘Novem-
ber 30, 2031’’ and inserting ‘‘September 30, 2032’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1364, the ‘‘Automotive Support Services to Improve Safe
Transportation Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘ASSIST Act of 2025’’ was intro-
duced by Rep. Tom Barrett of Michigan on February 14, 2025. H.R.
1364, as amended, would amend current law to address language
that inadvertently omitted coverage for some of the adaptive equip-
ment needed for disabled veterans to safely adapt their motor vehi-
cles through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Automobile
Adaptive Equipment (AAE) Program. Additionally, this bill would
codify the adaptations that are allowed for both drivers and pas-
sengers.
Finally, the bill would also provide an offset for the cost of these
programs by recovery of pension payments.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Automotive Support Services to
Improve Safe Transportation Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘ASSIST Act of
2025’’.
Section 2: Clarification Regarding Inclusion of Medically Necessary
Automobile Adaptations in Department of Veterans Affairs Defi-
nition of ‘‘Medical Services’’
During a hearing held on November 2, 2023, during the 118th
Congress by the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Subcommittee
on Economic Opportunity, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
witness mentioned in their testimony1 additional changes and al-
lowances to adaptive automobile equipment that should be made.
VA recommended that Congress make technical corrections to the
amendments of Section 22 of the Veterans Auto and Education Im-
provement Act of 2022 [P.L. 117–333].2 This section amended the

definition of medical services under 38 U.S.C. §1701(6) to include
the provision of medically necessary van lifts, raised doors, raised
roofs, air conditioning, and wheelchair tiedowns for passenger use.3
It was intended to codify VA’s existing practice of furnishing cer-
tain adaptive items for automobiles; however, this language speci-
fied the types of modifications permissible and inadvertently ex-
cluded all other adaptive items veterans may need. Consequently,
VA recommended technical amendments to authorize lower floors,
ramps and kneeling systems, mobility device lifts, and ingress and
egress accessibility modifications. Additionally, VA recommended to
Congress that wheelchair tie downs should not be limited to pas-
senger use.
This section would amend 38 U.S.C. §1701(6)(I) and would allow
for the additions that VA requested in their testimony to ade-
quately meet disabled veterans’ needs. Additionally, this section
would ensure that these changes reflect Congressional intent and
expand the definition of items by adding ‘‘including’’ to allow VA
to cover other items that may be deemed necessary. The Committee
believes that non-articulating trailers are also included in the
items eligible for adaptation.
This section would expand the definition of eligible items and
allow for adaptations for passenger and driver use. By enacting
this section, disabled veterans and their caretakers would have ac-
cess to the assistance needed to modify vehicles for use by disabled
veterans. This section would allow for disabled veterans to connect
with community organizations and provide greater opportunities to
find employment. The Committee believes this would help to im-
prove the overall wellbeing and economic opportunities for disabled
veterans.
Section 3: Extension of Certain Limits on Payments of Pension
Under current law (38 U.S.C. §5503(d)), the amount of VA pen-
sion paid to veterans having no spouse nor child, veterans’ sur-
viving spouses having no child, and veterans’ children who are ad-
mitted to a VA or Medicaid sponsored nursing facility is capped at
$90 a month. This section would cover the costs of the other sec-
tions of this bill by extending this pension limitation from Novem-
ber 30, 2031, until September 30, 2032. Because they receive gov-
ernment sponsored care in a nursing home, these pension bene-
ficiaries do not require the full amount of pension to cover their
cost of living. The Committee believes this short-term extension of
the current limit on pension payments is a reasonable way to cover
the costs associated with the other sections of this bill.

• Extend the reduction of pensions VA pays to veterans and
survivors residing in Medicaid nursing homes
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Purchasing additional adaptative equipment
• Reducing pension payments
Bill summary: H.R. 1364 would expand the types of adaptative
equipment that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can pur-
chase for vehicles belonging to veterans who have received medical
care from the department. The bill also would extend the reduction
of pension payments for veterans and survivors who reside in Med-
icaid nursing homes.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effects of H.R.
1364 are shown in Table 1. The bill would decrease net direct
spending by $29 million and increase spending subject to appro-
priation by $26 million over the 2025–2035 period. The costs of the
legislation fall within budget functions 550 (health) and 700 (vet-
erans benefits and services).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R.
1364 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and that provisions will
take effect upon enactment. CBO also estimates that outlays will
follow historical spending patterns for affected programs.
Provisions that affect spending subject to appropriation and di-
rect spending: Section 2 would expand the types of adaptative
equipment that VA can purchase for the vehicles of eligible vet-
erans who receive medical care at VA facilities. In addition to
equipment that VA provides under its current policy, section 2
would authorize VA to provide kneeling systems. Those systems
lower the side or rear of a vehicle to reduce the incline of a ramp,
making it easier for people using wheelchairs or other mobility de-
vices to access the vehicle. Using information from VA, CBO esti-
mates that the department would purchase kneeling systems for
roughly 55 veterans each year at a cost of about $63,000 on aver-
age, for a total of $37 million over the 2025–2035 period.
Some of the veterans who would acquire kneeling systems under
section 2 would be veterans who have been exposed to environ-
mental hazards; thus, CBO expects that some of the costs of imple-
menting the bill would be paid from the Toxic Exposures Fund
(TEF) established by Public Law 117–168, the Honoring our PACT
Act. The TEF is a mandatory appropriation that VA uses to pay
for health care, disability claims processing, medical research, and
information technology modernization that benefit veterans who
were exposed to environmental hazards. Additional spending from

the TEF occurs if legislation increases the costs of similar activities
that benefit veterans with such exposure. Thus, in addition to in-
creasing spending subject to appropriation, enacting section 2
would increase amounts paid from the TEF, which are classified as
direct spending.
CBO projects that the proportion of costs paid by the TEF will
grow over time based on the amount of formerly discretionary ap-
propriations that CBO expects will be provided through the manda-
tory appropriation as specified in the Honoring our PACT Act.1
CBO estimates that over the 2025–2035 period, implementing sec-
tion 2 would increase spending subject to appropriation by $26 mil-
lion and direct spending by $11 million.
Direct spending: In addition to expanding benefits that would
partly be covered by the TEF, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
would affect direct spending by reducing pension payments to vet-
erans and survivors who reside in Medicaid nursing homes. In
total, the bill would decrease net direct spending by $29 million
over the 2025–2035 period (see Table 2).
Under current law, VA reduces pension payments to veterans
and survivors who reside in Medicaid nursing homes to $90 per
month. That required reduction expires November 30, 2031. Sec-
tion 3 would extend that reduction for ten months, through Sep-
tember 30, 2032. CBO estimates that extending that requirement
would reduce VA benefits by $10 million per month. (Those bene-
fits are paid from mandatory appropriations and are therefore con-
sidered direct spending.) As a result of that reduction in bene-
ficiaries’ income, Medicaid would pay more of the cost of their care,
increasing spending for that program by $6 million per month.
Thus, enacting section 3 would reduce net direct spending by $40
million over the 2025–2035 period.

of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go proce-
dures are shown in Table 2.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting H.R. 1364 would not increase net direct spend-
ing by more than $2.5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-year
periods beginning in 2036.
CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1364 would not increase on-
budget deficits by more than $5 billion in any of the four consecu-
tive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sec-
tor mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Paul B.A. Holland; Man-
dates: Brandon Lever.
Estimate reviewed by: David Newman, Chief, Defense, Inter-
national Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost Estimates Unit; Kath-
leen FitzGerald Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; Chris-
tina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Con-
trol Act (as amended by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandate
Reform Act, P.L. 104–4) is inapplicable to H.R. 1364, as amended.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act would be created by H.R. 1364, as
amended.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H.R. 1364, as amended, does not relate
to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public serv-
ices or accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of
the Congressional Accountability Act.
STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.

1364, as amended, would establish or reauthorize a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section would establish the short title of the bill as the
‘‘Automotive Support Services to Improve Safe Transportation Act
of 2025’’ or the ‘‘ASSIST Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Clarification regarding inclusion of medically necessary
automobile adaptations in Department of Veterans Affairs defi-
nition of ‘‘Medical Services.’’
This section would amend 38 U.S.C. §1701(6)(I) to include ramp
and kneeling systems, raised doors or lowered floors, raised roofs,
air conditioning, occupied and unoccupied mobility lifts, ingress
and egress accessibility modifications, wheelchair tiedowns, and
adaptive seating in the additional medically necessary automobile
adaptations.
Section 3. Extension of certain limits on payments of pension
Section 3 would extend the limitation of pension payable to cer-
tain veterans, their surviving spouses, and their children as estab-
lished in section 5503(d)(7) of title 38, United States Code, from
November 30, 2031, to September 30, 2032.

stitutionalized veterans
(a)(1)(A) Where any veteran having neither spouse nor child is
being furnished domiciliary care by the Department, no pension in
excess of $90 per month shall be paid to or for the veteran for any
period after the end of the third full calendar month following the
month of admission for such care.
(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph,
where any veteran having neither spouse nor child is being fur-
nished nursing home care by the Department, no pension in excess
of $90 per month shall be paid to or for the veteran for any period
after the end of the third full calendar month following the month
of admission for such care. Any amount in excess of $90 per month
to which the veteran would be entitled but for the application of
the preceding sentence shall be deposited in a revolving fund at the
Department medical facility which furnished the veteran nursing
care, and such amount shall be available for obligation without fis-
cal year limitation to help defray operating expenses of that facil-
ity.
(C) No pension in excess of $90 per month shall be paid to or for
a veteran having neither spouse nor child for any period after the
month in which such veteran is readmitted for care described in
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph and furnished by the De-
partment if such veteran is readmitted within six months of a pe-
riod of care in connection with which pension was reduced pursu-
ant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph.
(D) In the case of a veteran being furnished nursing home care
by the Department and with respect to whom subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph requires a reduction in pension, such reduction
shall not be made for a period of up to three additional calendar
months after the last day of the third month referred to in such
subparagraph if the Secretary determines that the primary purpose
for the furnishing of such care during such additional period is for
the Department to provide such veteran with a prescribed program
of rehabilitation services, under chapter 17 of this title, designed
to restore such veteran’s ability to function within such veteran’s
family and community. If the Secretary determines that it is nec-
essary, after such period, for the veteran to continue such program
of rehabilitation services in order to achieve the purposes of such

program and that the primary purpose of furnishing nursing home
care to the veteran continues to be the provision of such program
to the veteran, the reduction in pension required by subparagraph
(B) of this paragraph shall not be made for the number of calendar
months that the Secretary determines is necessary for the veteran
to achieve the purposes of such program.
(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall also apply to a veteran
being furnished such care who has a spouse but whose pension is
payable under section 1521(b) of this title. In such a case, the Sec-
retary may apportion and pay to the spouse, upon an affirmative
showing of hardship, all or any part of the amounts in excess of
the amount payable to the veteran while being furnished such care
which would be payable to the veteran if pension were payable
under section 1521(c) of this title.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any
other provision of law, no reduction shall be made in the pension
of any veteran for any part of the period during which the veteran
is furnished hospital treatment, or institutional or domiciliary care,
for Hansen’s disease, by the United States or any political subdivi-
sion thereof.
(c) Where any veteran in receipt of an aid and attendance allow-
ance described in subsection (r) or (t) of section 1114 of this title
is hospitalized at Government expense, such allowance shall be dis-
continued from the first day of the second calendar month which
begins after the date of the veteran’s admission for such hos-
pitalization for so long as such hospitalization continues. Any dis-
continuance required by administrative regulation, during hos-
pitalization of a veteran by the Department, of increased pension
based on need of regular aid and attendance or additional com-
pensation based on need of regular aid and attendance as described
in subsection (l) or (m) of section 1114 of this title, shall not be ef-
fective earlier than the first day of the second calendar month
which begins after the date of the veteran’s admission for hos-
pitalization. In case a veteran affected by this subsection leaves a
hospital against medical advice and is thereafter admitted to hos-
pitalization within six months from the date of such departure,
such allowance, increased pension, or additional compensation, as
the case may be, shall be discontinued from the date of such read-
mission for so long as such hospitalization continues.

cility, no pension in excess of $90 per month shall be paid to or for
the veteran for any period after the month of admission to such
nursing facility.

rity Act, the amount of the payment paid a nursing facility pursu-

eran under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(4) A veteran is not liable to the United States for any payment
of pension in excess of the amount permitted under this subsection
that is paid to or for the veteran by reason of the inability or fail-
ure of the Secretary to reduce the veteran’s pension under this sub-
section unless such inability or failure is the result of a willful con-
cealment by the veteran of information necessary to make a reduc-
tion in pension under this subsection.
(5)(A) The provisions of this subsection shall apply with respect
to a surviving spouse having no child in the same manner as they
apply to a veteran having neither spouse nor child.
