PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 24, 2025, by Representative Rogers Wil-
liams, H.R. 1549, the China Financial Threat Mitigation Act of
2025, would require the Secretary of the Department of the Treas-
ury to report to Congress on global economic risks emanating from
the Chinese financial sector.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 1549 results from previous bipartisan Committee discus-
sions to require a Treasury report on financial stability risks ema-
nating from China. Such risks have been addressed in the annual
report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, but in limited
detail. Former Treasury Secretary Yellen has also addressed Chi-
nese financial risks in response to Republican questioning before
the Committee, particularly with respect to China’s real estate sec-
tor. Understanding these risks more comprehensively will help U.S.
officials better evaluate vulnerabilities in the global economy and
work through bodies such as the IMF and Financial Stability
Board to mitigate them.
H.R. 1549 requires the Secretary of the Department of the Treas-
ury to report to Congress on global economic risks emanating from
the Chinese financial sector. The bill is necessary to better under-
stand the governance, opacity, and potential instability of the Chi-
nese financial system.
