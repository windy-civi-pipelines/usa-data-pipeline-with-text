YOUTH POISONING PROTECTION ACT
JULY29, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 289]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 289) to ban the sale of products with
a high concentration of sodium nitrite to individuals, and for other
purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon
without amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 289 is to ban the sale of any consumer product
containing a concentration of 10 or more percent by weight of so-
dium nitrite.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Sodium nitrite is a widely used chemical salt used in low con-
centrations to preserve and cure meat and fish.1 Consumers com-
monly use sodium nitrite for personal meat preservation—generally
with curing salts that contain 6.25 percent sodium nitrite con-
centration.2 Commercially, sodium nitrite is also used as a chem-
ical reagent used in dye and pigment manufacturing, as a metal

coating and corrosion inhibitor, and in pharmaceuticals including
as a treatment for vasodilation and cyanide poisoning.3
Although sodium nitrite has many important uses, it can be le-
thal to consume—even at low concentrations.4 Since 2017, the Na-
tional Poison Data System has shown an increase in self-poisonings
by use of sodium nitrite.5 Sodium nitrite is inexpensive and sold
online, making it easily accessible.6 Just one teaspoon of sodium ni-
trite can be lethal and effects are felt quickly due to its high water
solubility, making it more deadly than other poisons.7
A 2021 investigation by the New York Times into an online sui-
cide forum found not only that sodium nitrite was becoming pop-
ular for self-poisoning, but that online suicide forums were anony-
mously providing suicide kits or detailed instruction on how to ob-
tain and how to die using substances like sodium nitrite.8 Because
high concentrations were so easily available on e-commerce sites,
including Amazon, which previously sold sodium nitrite at 99 per-
cent purity, it was relatively easy for youth to obtain the ingredi-
ents and follow the suicide instructions.9 Due to an increased
awareness campaign on the use of sodium nitrite for suicide, sev-
eral online retailers have removed the substance for purchase from
their online marketplaces.10
This legislation would classify consumer products containing a
high concentration of sodium nitrite as a banned hazardous prod-
uct, which would prevent the product from being sold in physical
and online stores. There is no intent to affect commercial or indus-
trial uses. The legislation would define a high concentration of so-
dium nitrite as concentration of 10 percent or more by weight of
sodium nitrite.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 289 would require consumer products with high-concentration
sodium nitrite—defined as concentration over 10 percent by weight
of sodium nitrite—to be considered banned hazardous products in
the Consumer Product Safety Act.11 Commercial or industrial uses
would not be impacted.

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, was introduced on
January 29, 2025, by Senator Duckworth (for herself and Senators
Curtis and Moreno) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Senator Baldwin
is an additional cosponsor. On March 12, 2025, the Committee met
in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 289 to be
reported favorably without amendment.
118th Congress
S. 2233 was introduced on July 11, 2023, by Senator Duckworth
(for herself and Senator Vance) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On July
31, 2024, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by
voice vote, ordered S. 2233 to be reported favorably with an amend-
ment (in the nature of a substitute). Senator Collins was later
added as a cosponsor.
H.R. 4310, a House companion bill, was introduced on June 22,
2023, by Representative Lori Trahan (for herself and Representa-
tives Carey, Porter, and Stewart) and was referred to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.
Representatives Clarke, Neguse, Soto, Caraveo, and Maloy became
additional cosponsors. On December 6, 2023, that Committee met
in open Executive Session, and H.R. 4310 was ordered to be re-
ported by a vote of 42–0. On May 15, 2024, the House passed H.R.
4310 under suspension of the rules by a recorded vote of 376–33.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

Summary of legislation: On March 12, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
14 bills. This document provides estimates for 3 of those bills. One
bill, S. 414, was reported on June 24, 2025.
S. 289 would ban the sale of certain products covered by the Con-
sumer Product Safety Act and S. 389 would require the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to adopt voluntary safety
standards for lithium-ion batteries. S. 414 would require digital ad-
vertising platforms to report annually to the Federal Trade Com-
mission (FTC).
Estimated Federal cost: The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 370 (commerce and housing credit) and 550
(health).
Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that each bill
will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2025 and that the esti-
mated amounts will be available each year. The cost estimate does
not include any effects of interactions among the bills. If all three
bills were combined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the
effects could be different from the sum of the separate estimates,
although CBO expects that any differences would be small.
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, would ban the sale
of products containing 10 percent or more by weight of sodium ni-
trite that are covered under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The
legislation would not affect the sale or use of commercial or indus-
trial products not ordinarily intended for consumer use or con-
sumption.
Using information from the Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion, CBO estimates that implementing S. 289 would cost $2 mil-
lion over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission

within 180 days of enactment, to adopt certain voluntary safety
standards—specifically ANSI/CAN/UL 2271, 2849, and 2272—con-
cerning rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric bicycles,
scooters, and other micromobility devices. The bill also would re-
quire the CPSC to determine the applicable scope of covered con-
sumer products and to monitor and evaluate future revisions to the
voluntary standards and report to the Congress within five years
of enactment.
Using information from the CPSC, CBO estimates that imple-
menting S. 389 would cost $8 million over the 2025–2030 period;
any related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, would require
certain digital advertising platforms to report annually to the Fed-
eral Trade Commission about advertising on their platforms for
certain mental health services, including information on the num-
ber, percent, and dollar value of such advertisements. Platforms
that would be affected by the bill include social media platforms,
public facing websites, online services, and mobile applications
with more than 100 million unique monthly users. The bill also
would require the FTC to report annually to the Congress summa-
rizing that data. CBO estimates that enacting S. 414 would cost
less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any related spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. None of the
bills would affect direct spending or revenues; thus, pay-as-you-go
procedures do not apply.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting S. 289, S. 389 and S. 414 would not increase
net direct spending or deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: All three bills would impose private-sector mandates
as defined in in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).
None of the bills would impose intergovernmental mandates.
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, would impose a pri-
vate-sector mandate as defined in UMRA by banning the sale of
consumer products containing 10 percent or more of sodium nitrite
by weight. The prohibition would not apply to industrial uses or to
food preservation. Because there is only a small market for con-
sumer products containing that much sodium nitrite and some
states already have curtailed the sale of products containing so-
dium nitrite, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would
not exceed the private- sector threshold established in UMRA ($206
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in
UMRA by requiring manufacturers of electric mobility devices, in-
cluding bicycles and scooters, to comply with a prospective Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission safety standard related to the
risk of fire in lithium-ion batteries. Based on voluntary compliance
with the specified standard by domestic manufacturers and current
state and local laws requiring compliance, CBO estimates that the
cost of the mandate would not exceed the annual private-sector

threshold established in UMRA ($206 million in 2025, adjusted an-
nually for inflation).
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, would require
certain digital advertising platforms to report to the FTC on their
public service advertisements for mental and behavioral health.
That requirement would impose a private-sector mandate as de-
fined by UMRA. CBO estimates the cost of the mandate would be
small and not exceed the threshold established in UMRA ($206
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation) because the man-
dated entities generally already possess or collect the information
required to be reported under the bill.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Cyrus Ekland (for the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission); Johnny Willing (for the Fed-
eral Trade Commission). Mandates: Andrew Laughlin (for the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission); Rachel Austin (for the Federal
Trade Commission).

Programs and Prescription Drugs Cost Estimates Unit; Justin
Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Housing, and Education Cost Estimates
Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates
Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 289 would prohibit the sale of consumer products containing
a high concentration of sodium nitrite. Therefore, the number of
persons covered is (1) manufacturers of consumer products con-
taining a high concentration of sodium nitrite; and (2) sellers of
consumer products containing a high concentration of sodium ni-
trite.
Economic Impact
S. 289 is expected to have minimal economic impact. Commercial
or industrial uses of high concentration sodium nitrite are per-
mitted under this Act. Additionally, large online retailers have al-
ready removed consumer products containing a high concentration
of sodium nitrite from their websites for purchase.
Privacy
S. 289 would not have a significant impact on the privacy rights
of individuals.
Paperwork
S. 289 would not generate any additional paperwork.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions

contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 4:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 5:
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Youth Poisoning Protection Act’’.

Section 6:
Section 2. Banning of products containing a high concentration of
sodium nitrite
Subsection (a) would provide that any consumer product with a
high concentration of sodium nitrite shall be a banned hazardous
product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act.12
Subsection (b) would create a rule of construction that nothing in
this section shall be construed to (1) prohibit commercial or indus-
trial purposes of high concentration sodium nitrite that are not cus-
tomarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption
by, or enjoyment of, a consumer; and (2) apply to high concentra-
tion sodium nitrite that meets the definition of the terms ‘‘drug’’,
‘‘device’’, or ‘‘cosmetic’’ (as defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act13) or ‘‘food’’, including poultry, poultry products,
meat and meat food products, or egg and egg products.
Subsection (c) would provide definitions: (1) the term ‘‘consumer
product’’ has the same meaning given under section 3(a)(5) of the
Consumer Product Safety Act;14 (2) the term ‘‘high concentration
of sodium nitrite’’ means a concentration of 10 or more percent by
weight of sodium nitrite.
Subsection (d) would provide for the effective date of this Act to
be 90 days after enactment.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.

ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

Summary of legislation: On March 12, 2025, the Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported
14 bills. This document provides estimates for 3 of those bills. One
bill, S. 414, was reported on June 24, 2025.
S. 289 would ban the sale of certain products covered by the Con-
sumer Product Safety Act and S. 389 would require the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to adopt voluntary safety
standards for lithium-ion batteries. S. 414 would require digital ad-
vertising platforms to report annually to the Federal Trade Com-
mission (FTC).
Estimated Federal cost: The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 370 (commerce and housing credit) and 550
(health).
Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that each bill
will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2025 and that the esti-
mated amounts will be available each year. The cost estimate does
not include any effects of interactions among the bills. If all three
bills were combined and enacted as a single piece of legislation, the
effects could be different from the sum of the separate estimates,
although CBO expects that any differences would be small.
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, would ban the sale
of products containing 10 percent or more by weight of sodium ni-
trite that are covered under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The
legislation would not affect the sale or use of commercial or indus-
trial products not ordinarily intended for consumer use or con-
sumption.
Using information from the Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion, CBO estimates that implementing S. 289 would cost $2 mil-
lion over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission

within 180 days of enactment, to adopt certain voluntary safety
standards—specifically ANSI/CAN/UL 2271, 2849, and 2272—con-
cerning rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric bicycles,
scooters, and other micromobility devices. The bill also would re-
quire the CPSC to determine the applicable scope of covered con-
sumer products and to monitor and evaluate future revisions to the
voluntary standards and report to the Congress within five years
of enactment.
Using information from the CPSC, CBO estimates that imple-
menting S. 389 would cost $8 million over the 2025–2030 period;
any related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, would require
certain digital advertising platforms to report annually to the Fed-
eral Trade Commission about advertising on their platforms for
certain mental health services, including information on the num-
ber, percent, and dollar value of such advertisements. Platforms
that would be affected by the bill include social media platforms,
public facing websites, online services, and mobile applications
with more than 100 million unique monthly users. The bill also
would require the FTC to report annually to the Congress summa-
rizing that data. CBO estimates that enacting S. 414 would cost
less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any related spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. None of the
bills would affect direct spending or revenues; thus, pay-as-you-go
procedures do not apply.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting S. 289, S. 389 and S. 414 would not increase
net direct spending or deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: All three bills would impose private-sector mandates
as defined in in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).
None of the bills would impose intergovernmental mandates.
S. 289, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act, would impose a pri-
vate-sector mandate as defined in UMRA by banning the sale of
consumer products containing 10 percent or more of sodium nitrite
by weight. The prohibition would not apply to industrial uses or to
food preservation. Because there is only a small market for con-
sumer products containing that much sodium nitrite and some
states already have curtailed the sale of products containing so-
dium nitrite, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would
not exceed the private- sector threshold established in UMRA ($206
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
S. 389, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Bat-
teries Act, would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in
UMRA by requiring manufacturers of electric mobility devices, in-
cluding bicycles and scooters, to comply with a prospective Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission safety standard related to the
risk of fire in lithium-ion batteries. Based on voluntary compliance
with the specified standard by domestic manufacturers and current
state and local laws requiring compliance, CBO estimates that the
cost of the mandate would not exceed the annual private-sector

threshold established in UMRA ($206 million in 2025, adjusted an-
nually for inflation).
S. 414, the ADS for Mental Health Services Act, would require
certain digital advertising platforms to report to the FTC on their
public service advertisements for mental and behavioral health.
That requirement would impose a private-sector mandate as de-
fined by UMRA. CBO estimates the cost of the mandate would be
small and not exceed the threshold established in UMRA ($206
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation) because the man-
dated entities generally already possess or collect the information
required to be reported under the bill.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Cyrus Ekland (for the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission); Johnny Willing (for the Fed-
eral Trade Commission). Mandates: Andrew Laughlin (for the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission); Rachel Austin (for the Federal
Trade Commission).
Estimate reviewed by: Sean Dunbar, Chief, Low-Income Health
Programs and Prescription Drugs Cost Estimates Unit; Justin
Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Housing, and Education Cost Estimates
Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates
Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 289 would prohibit the sale of consumer products containing
a high concentration of sodium nitrite. Therefore, the number of
persons covered is (1) manufacturers of consumer products con-
taining a high concentration of sodium nitrite; and (2) sellers of
consumer products containing a high concentration of sodium ni-
trite.
Economic Impact
S. 289 is expected to have minimal economic impact. Commercial
or industrial uses of high concentration sodium nitrite are per-
mitted under this Act. Additionally, large online retailers have al-
ready removed consumer products containing a high concentration
of sodium nitrite from their websites for purchase.
Privacy
S. 289 would not have a significant impact on the privacy rights
of individuals.
Paperwork
S. 289 would not generate any additional paperwork.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions

contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Youth Poisoning Protection Act’’.
Section 2. Banning of products containing a high concentration of
sodium nitrite
Subsection (a) would provide that any consumer product with a
high concentration of sodium nitrite shall be a banned hazardous
product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act.12
Subsection (b) would create a rule of construction that nothing in
this section shall be construed to (1) prohibit commercial or indus-
trial purposes of high concentration sodium nitrite that are not cus-
tomarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption
by, or enjoyment of, a consumer; and (2) apply to high concentra-
tion sodium nitrite that meets the definition of the terms ‘‘drug’’,
‘‘device’’, or ‘‘cosmetic’’ (as defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act13) or ‘‘food’’, including poultry, poultry products,
meat and meat food products, or egg and egg products.
Subsection (c) would provide definitions: (1) the term ‘‘consumer
product’’ has the same meaning given under section 3(a)(5) of the
Consumer Product Safety Act;14 (2) the term ‘‘high concentration
of sodium nitrite’’ means a concentration of 10 or more percent by
weight of sodium nitrite.
Subsection (d) would provide for the effective date of this Act to
be 90 days after enactment.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
