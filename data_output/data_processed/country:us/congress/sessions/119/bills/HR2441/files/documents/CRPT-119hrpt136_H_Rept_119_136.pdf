PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 2441, the Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2025,
was introduced on March 27, 2025, by Representative Bill
Huizenga (MI–04). H.R. 2441 would direct the Securities and Ex-
change Commission (SEC) to promulgate rules with respect to the
electronic delivery of certain required disclosures to investors.
Under the bill, such rules would allow registered investment com-
panies (i.e., mutual funds, closed end funds, and exchange-traded
funds), business development companies (BDCs), registered broker-
dealers, registered advisers, and other SEC-regulated entities to
meet their obligations under U.S. securities laws to deliver regu-
latory documents to investors electronically.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
A 2022 survey found that 85 percent of individual investors
would be comfortable with e-delivery as the default for investor
communications if they have the choice to opt-in to paper delivery.1
H.R. 2441 preserves the ability for investors who prefer to receive
paper notices and disclosures to do so by requiring the SEC to in-
corporate investor protections into its rules, such as providing a
means for investors to opt out of electronic delivery at any time.
Aside from reducing the environmental impact of tons of disposed
paper each year, the benefits of making electronic delivery the de-
fault method for the entities listed above include facilitating posi-
tive investor engagement, as investors can more easily search for
and find information most relevant to them. Additionally, electronic
delivery enhances the effectiveness of investor communications for
individuals with disabilities or those for whom English is not their
primary language. At a time when so many households, even senior
households, have transitioned to online management of their fi-
nances, H.R. 2441 is a significant and critical step forward in mod-
ernizing how investor disclosures are delivered while preserving
choice.

cost estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
once it has been prepared.

of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a

Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 1807 as the ‘‘Improving Disclosure for In-
vestors Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Electronic delivery
This section directs the SEC to promulgate rules to allow a cov-
ered entity to meet its obligations to deliver regulatory documents
required under the securities laws to investors using electronic de-
livery. Within this section, a ‘‘covered entity’’ is defined as a reg-
istered investment company, a business development company, a
registered broker or dealer, a registered municipal securities deal-
er, a registered government securities broker or government securi-
ties dealer, a registered investment adviser, a registered transfer
agent, or a registered funding portal.
Section 2 also states that the rules will: (1) for any investors who
do not receive all regulatory documents electronically, provide for
delivery of an initial communication regarding electronic delivery
in paper, include a transition period not longer than 180 days, and
during a period not to exceed two years, provide investors with an
annual notice in paper reminding investors that they can opt out
of electronic delivery at any time; (2) set forth the requirements for
the initial communication to investors; (3) set forth the require-
ments for providing investors with notice that regulatory docu-
ments are available on a website and the contents of the notice; (4)
provide a mechanism for investors to opt out of electronic delivery
and to receive paper versions of regulatory documents; (5) include
measures to identify and remediate failed electronic deliveries; (6)
set forth requirements regarding readability and retainability of
regulatory documents delivered electronically; and (7) require
measures designed to ensure the confidentiality of personal infor-
mation. Moreover, this section specifies exemptions, rules of con-
struction, and notes that if rules are not completed in a timely
manner, a covered entity may deliver regulatory documents elec-
tronically to satisfy its obligations under the securities laws.
This section also directs the SEC to review the rules to deter-
mine whether any rules require delivery of written documents to
investors and to promulgate amendments to the rules to provide
that delivery of regulatory documents in writing may be satisfied

electronically. Finally, this section directs self-regulatory organiza-
tions to adopt rules or amend their rules consistent with the SEC’s
final rules on electronic delivery.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 2441 does not repeal or amend any section of a statute.
Therefore, the Office of Legislative Counsel did not prepare the re-
port required under clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the House of Rep-
resentatives.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill directs the SEC to promulgate rules to allow broker-
dealers, mutual funds, retirement plans, etc., to satisfy their disclo-
sure and statements delivery obligations through electronic means.
Importantly, the bill includes a clause that self-effectuates the bill,
should the SEC not complete the rulemaking in time. This bill ig-
nores the reality that many investors, particularly seniors, do not
have access to or the ability to review electronic documents, or sim-
ply do not prefer electronic delivery of financial documents. This
bill requires investors to proactively opt-in to receive paper docu-
ments, which would effectively prevent individuals who do not have
easy access to the internet from viewing important financial docu-
ments about the securities they invest in. Furthermore, the bill—
concerningly—would automatically enroll investors in e-delivery
even if they affirmatively opted to receive paper documents.
Several major investor advocate groups strongly oppose this bill,
including AARP, NASAA, Consumer Federation of America, Ameri-
cans for Financial Reform, and Public Citizen. AARP in particular
is critical of this bill in its current form, writing:
‘‘Full and meaningful disclosure is critical to individual
financial planning. Millions of Americans, many who are
50 and older or living in rural areas, do not have regular
broadband internet access or do not routinely use com-
puters at home. This means they would miss out on critical
account information if the default delivery were electronic
[. . .] If enacted as currently drafted, this legislation would
amount to no disclosure at all for many consumers.’’
The SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee has previously rec-
ommended against the policy contained within this bill at a prior
meeting. Additionally, in a letter to the Committee, the Consumer
Federation of America warns that:
‘‘Importantly, this bill would unwind the paper delivery
of pro-investor disclosure improvements that the SEC final-
ized recently that would make shareholder reports more
concise and visually appealing.’’1
Ranking Member Waters raised serious concerns with a prior
version of this bill in the 118th Congress, but consented to a voice
vote on the condition that it would undergo changes needed to miti-
gate concerns raised by consumer advocates. The current bill does
not address the Ranking Member’s concerns.
