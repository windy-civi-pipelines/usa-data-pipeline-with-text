PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 1373, as amended, is to require certain
meetings of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to be trans-
parent and open to the public, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
TVA is an independent government corporation that provides
power generation, flood control, and land management services to
the Tennessee River Valley region.1 TVA was originally authorized
in the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (TVA Act).2
Section 2 of the TVA Act establishes a TVA Board of Directors
(TVA Board) and outlines the duties and obligations of the TVA
Board in the operations of the TVA.3 Certain TVA Board meetings
are subject to the open meetings requirements of the Government
in the Sunshine Act, which aims to ensure accountability and

transparency in government meetings.4 H.R. 1373, as amended,
amends the TVA Act to further clarify which TVA Board meetings
are subject to such public disclosure and open meetings require-
ments by explicitly expanding the definition to include deliberative
meetings for which a vote is not scheduled. In addition, H.R. 1373,
as amended, requires that TVA publish notice of meetings subject
to the Government in the Sunshine Act online.
In recent years TVA has taken certain voluntary steps to in-
crease meeting transparency, such as publishing minutes, presen-
tations, and videos of TVA Board meetings for which a vote was
scheduled on its website.5 H.R. 1373, as amended, codifies some of
these actions, and builds upon them by requiring information re-
quired to be disclosed under the Government in the Sunshine Act
to be published on the TVA Board website.
Additionally, H.R. 1373, as amended, provides exceptions for
TVA Board meetings or portions of such meetings that pertain to
sensitive and confidential information relating to power availability
requests, contract negotiations, and other exceptions as laid out
under the Government in the Sunshine Act. H.R. 1373, as amended,
also exempts emergency meetings of the TVA Board from the
seven-day public notice requirement.
H.R. 1373, as amended, ensures that the TVA Board remains ac-
countable and transparent to constituents, while not endangering
its competitive status and ability to provide power to the Tennessee
Valley region.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of rule XIII, clause 3(c)(6)(A) of the 119th Con-
gress, no hearing was used to develop or consider H.R. 1373, as
amended.
In the 118th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water Resources
and Environment held a hearing entitled, ‘‘Review of Fiscal Year
2024 Budget Request: Agency Perspectives (Part I).’’ This hearing
provided Members with an opportunity to conduct oversight and re-
view the President’s Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request, as well as
the Administration’s program priorities within the jurisdiction of
the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. At the
hearing, the Subcommittee received testimony from the Honorable
Michael L. Connor, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil
Works, Department of the Army; Major General William ‘‘Butch’’
H. Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers and Deputy Commanding
General, United States Army Corps of Engineers; Mr. Jeff Lyash,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Tennessee Valley Authority;
and Mr. Adam Tindall-Schlicht, Administrator, Great Lakes St.
Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of Rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee’s over-
sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to the filing of the report and is included in the re-
port. Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1373, as amended, from the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office:
Legislation Considered Under Suspension of the Rules
The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives announces
bills that will be considered under suspension of the rules in that
chamber. Under suspension, floor debate is limited, all floor
amendments are prohibited, points of order against the bill are
waived, and final passage requires a two-thirds majority vote.
At the request of the Majority Leader and the House Committee
on the Budget, CBO estimates the effects of those bills on direct
spending and revenues. CBO has limited time to review the legisla-
tion before consideration. Although it is possible in most cases to

determine whether the legislation would affect direct spending or
revenues, time may be insufficient to estimate the magnitude of
those effects. If CBO has prepared estimates for similar or identical
legislation, a more detailed assessment of budgetary effects, includ-
ing effects on spending subject to appropriation, may be included.

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this legislation is to maintain effective Congres-
sional oversight over entities within the federal government by re-
quiring TVA to file a report to Congress on TVA employees at the
management level or above making the maximum rate for GS–15,
or more.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1373, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the
Federal government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED
TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of the rule XXI.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(Public Law 104–4).
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that H.R. 1373, as amended, does not preempt any state, local, or
tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the definition of Section 5(b) of
Public Law 92–463 (5 U.S.C. 1004(b)), are created by this legisla-
tion.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (Public Law 104–1).
