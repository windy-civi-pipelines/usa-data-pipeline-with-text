PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on May 7, 2025, by Representative Andy Barr (KY–
06), H.R. 3230, the Financial Institution Regulatory Tailoring En-
hancement Act, increases the asset thresholds at which financial in-
stitutions become subject to certain regulatory requirements, from
$10 billion to $50 billion.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Over the past two decades, industry consolidation and inflation
have significantly changed the financial landscape. However, regu-
latory thresholds have remained frozen, subjecting relatively small
and lower-risk banks to the same requirements as the largest insti-
tutions. This has driven up compliance costs, particularly for com-
munity and regional banks, leading to more mergers and closures—
especially in rural areas where traditional banking services remain
essential. The Federal Reserve has noted that online banking does
not fully substitute for in-person services such as cash handling,
deposit services, and financial counseling. When branches close,
communities often lose key civic and financial resources, deepening
economic isolation and reducing access to credit.
H.R. 3230 updates outdated regulatory thresholds to reflect mod-
ern economic realities. This bill ensures that financial institutions
are subject to requirements appropriate to their respective size and
risk profile. The result is a more competitive, accessible, and stable
banking system.

sor. This bill is an earlier iteration of H.R. 3230. The bill was re-
ferred solely to the Committee on Financial Services. The text of

ience and Regulatory Improvement Act. On May 16, 2024, H.R.

of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3230 is to update outdated reg-
ulatory thresholds to reflect modern economic realities to ensure
that financial institutions are subject to requirements appropriate
to their respective size and risk profile, which will result in a more
competitive, accessible, and stable banking system.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3230. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

priate, shall order, after due notice and opportunity for hear-
ing, the banking entity or nonbank financial company super-
vised by the Board to terminate the activity and, as relevant,

§129C. Minimum standards for residential mortgage loans
(a) ABILITY TO REPAY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In accordance with regulations prescribed
by the Board, no creditor may make a residential mortgage
loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith de-
termination based on verified and documented information
that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has
a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms,
and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guar-
antee insurance), and assessments.
(2) MULTIPLE LOANS.—If the creditor knows, or has reason to
know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured by the
same dwelling will be made to the same consumer, the creditor
shall make a reasonable and good faith determination, based
on verified and documented information, that the consumer
has a reasonable ability to repay the combined payments of all
loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those
loans and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage
guarantee insurance), and assessments.
(3) BASIS FOR DETERMINATION.—A determination under this
subsection of a consumer’s ability to repay a residential mort-
gage loan shall include consideration of the consumer’s credit
history, current income, expected income the consumer is rea-
sonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt-to-in-
come ratio or the residual income the consumer will have after
paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obligations,
employment status, and other financial resources other than
the consumer’s equity in the dwelling or real property that se-
cures repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine the
ability of the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that
fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.
(4) INCOME VERIFICATION.—A creditor making a residential
mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that

26
such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, includ-
ing expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer’s In-
ternal Revenue Service Form W–2, tax returns, payroll re-
ceipts, financial institution records, or other third-party docu-
ments that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the con-
sumer’s income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudu-
lent reporting, any consideration of a consumer’s income his-
tory in making a determination under this subsection shall in-
clude the verification of such income by the use of—
(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax returns;
or
(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies income
documentation by a third party subject to rules prescribed
by the Board.
(5) EXEMPTION.—With respect to loans made, guaranteed, or
insured by Federal departments or agencies identified in sub-
section (b)(3)(B)(ii), such departments or agencies may exempt
refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from this income
verification requirement as long as the following conditions are
met:
(A) The consumer is not 30 days or more past due on the
prior existing residential mortgage loan.
(B) The refinancing does not increase the principal bal-
ance outstanding on the prior existing residential mort-
gage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed
by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or in-
suring the refinancing.
(C) Total points and fees (as defined in section
103(aa)(4), other than bona fide third party charges not re-
tained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate
of the creditor or mortgage originator) payable in connec-
tion with the refinancing do not exceed 3 percent of the
total new loan amount.
(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is lower
than the interest rate of the original loan, unless the bor-
rower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate
loan, under guidelines that the department or agency shall
establish for loans they make, guarantee, or issue.
(E) The refinancing is subject to a payment schedule
that will fully amortize the refinancing in accordance with
the regulations prescribed by the department or agency
making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.
(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in a bal-
loon payment, as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii).
(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being refinanced
and the refinancing satisfy all requirements of the depart-
ment or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refi-
nancing.
(6) NONSTANDARD LOANS.—
(A) VARIABLE RATE LOANS THAT DEFER REPAYMENT OF
ANY PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST.—For purposes of determining,
under this subsection, a consumer’s ability to repay a vari-
able rate residential mortgage loan that allows or requires
the consumer to defer the repayment of any principal or

27
interest, the creditor shall use a fully amortizing repay-
ment schedule.
(B) INTEREST-ONLY LOANS.—For purposes of deter-
mining, under this subsection, a consumer’s ability to
repay a residential mortgage loan that permits or requires
the payment of interest only, the creditor shall use the
payment amount required to amortize the loan by its final
maturity.
(C) CALCULATION FOR NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION.—In mak-
ing any determination under this subsection, a creditor
shall also take into consideration any balance increase
that may accrue from any negative amortization provision.
(D) CALCULATION PROCESS.—For purposes of making any
determination under this subsection, a creditor shall cal-
culate the monthly payment amount for principal and in-
terest on any residential mortgage loan by assuming—
(i) the loan proceeds are fully disbursed on the date
of the consummation of the loan;
(ii) the loan is to be repaid in substantially equal
monthly amortizing payments for principal and inter-
est over the entire term of the loan with no balloon
payment, unless the loan contract requires more rapid
repayment (including balloon payment), in which case
the calculation shall be made (I) in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Board, with respect to
any loan which has an annual percentage rate that
does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a com-
parable transaction, as of the date the interest rate is
set, by 1.5 or more percentage points for a first lien
residential mortgage loan; and by 3.5 or more percent-
age points for a subordinate lien residential mortgage
loan; or (II) using the contract’s repayment schedule,
with respect to a loan which has an annual percentage
rate, as of the date the interest rate is set, that is at
least 1.5 percentage points above the average prime
offer rate for a first lien residential mortgage loan;
and 3.5 percentage points above the average prime
offer rate for a subordinate lien residential mortgage
loan; and
(iii) the interest rate over the entire term of the loan
is a fixed rate equal to the fully indexed rate at the
time of the loan closing, without considering the intro-
ductory rate.
(E) REFINANCE OF HYBRID LOANS WITH CURRENT LEND-
ER.—In considering any application for refinancing an ex-
isting hybrid loan by the creditor into a standard loan to
be made by the same creditor in any case in which there
would be a reduction in monthly payment and the mort-
gagor has not been delinquent on any payment on the ex-
isting hybrid loan, the creditor may—
(i) consider the mortgagor’s good standing on the ex-
isting mortgage;
(ii) consider if the extension of new credit would pre-
vent a likely default should the original mortgage

reset and give such concerns a higher priority as an
acceptable underwriting practice; and
(iii) offer rate discounts and other favorable terms to
such mortgagor that would be available to new cus-
tomers with high credit ratings based on such under-
writing practice.
(7) FULLY-INDEXED RATE DEFINED.—For purposes of this sub-
section, the term ‘‘fully indexed rate’’ means the index rate pre-
vailing on a residential mortgage loan at the time the loan is
made plus the margin that will apply after the expiration of
any introductory interest rates.
(8) REVERSE MORTGAGES AND BRIDGE LOANS.—This sub-
section shall not apply with respect to any reverse mortgage or
temporary or bridge loan with a term of 12 months or less, in-
cluding to any loan to purchase a new dwelling where the con-
sumer plans to sell a different dwelling within 12 months.
(9) SEASONAL INCOME.—If documented income, including in-
come from a small business, is a repayment source for a resi-
dential mortgage loan, a creditor may consider the seasonality
and irregularity of such income in the underwriting of and
scheduling of payments for such credit.
(b) PRESUMPTION OF ABILITY TO REPAY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Any creditor with respect to any residential
mortgage loan, and any assignee of such loan subject to liabil-
ity under this title, may presume that the loan has met the re-
quirements of subsection (a), if the loan is a qualified mort-
gage.

lowing definitions shall apply:

allow the consumer to defer repayment of prin-
cipal;
(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (E), the
terms of which do not result in a balloon payment,

that is more than twice as large as the average of ear-
lier scheduled payments;
(iii) for which the income and financial resources re-
lied upon to qualify the obligors on the loan are
verified and documented;

derwriting process is based on a payment schedule
that fully amortizes the loan over the loan term and
takes into account all applicable taxes, insurance, and
assessments;

the underwriting is based on the maximum rate per-
mitted under the loan during the first 5 years, and a
payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over

contain terms under which a consumer must pay a prepayment
penalty for paying all or part of the principal after the loan is
consummated in excess of the following limitations:
(A) During the 1-year period beginning on the date the
loan is consummated, the prepayment penalty shall not ex-
ceed an amount equal to 3 percent of the outstanding bal-

period described in subparagraph (B), the prepayment pen-
alty shall not exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of the
outstanding balance on the loan.
(D) After the end of the 3-year period beginning on the

(4) OPTION FOR NO PREPAYMENT PENALTY REQUIRED.—A cred-
itor may not offer a consumer a residential mortgage loan
product that has a prepayment penalty for paying all or part
of the principal after the loan is consummated as a term of the
loan without offering the consumer a residential mortgage loan
product that does not have a prepayment penalty as a term of
the loan.
(d) SINGLE PREMIUM CREDIT INSURANCE PROHIBITED.—No cred-
itor may finance, directly or indirectly, in connection with any resi-
dential mortgage loan or with any extension of credit under an
open end consumer credit plan secured by the principal dwelling of
the consumer, any credit life, credit disability, credit unemploy-
ment, or credit property insurance, or any other accident, loss-of-
income, life, or health insurance, or any payments directly or indi-
rectly for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement or con-
tract, except that—
(1) insurance premiums or debt cancellation or suspension
fees calculated and paid in full on a monthly basis shall not
be considered financed by the creditor; and
(2) this subsection shall not apply to credit unemployment
insurance for which the unemployment insurance premiums

pensation in connection with the unemployment insurance pre-
miums, and the unemployment insurance premiums are paid
pursuant to another insurance contract and not paid to an af-
filiate of the creditor.
(e) ARBITRATION.—

which require arbitration or any other nonjudicial procedure as
the method for resolving any controversy or settling any claims
arising out of the transaction.
(2) POST-CONTROVERSY AGREEMENTS.—Subject to paragraph
(3), paragraph (1) shall not be construed as limiting the right
of the consumer and the creditor or any assignee to agree to
arbitration or any other nonjudicial procedure as the method
for resolving any controversy at any time after a dispute or
claim under the transaction arises.
(3) NO WAIVER OF STATUTORY CAUSE OF ACTION.—No provi-
sion of any residential mortgage loan or of any extension of
credit under an open end consumer credit plan secured by the
principal dwelling of the consumer, and no other agreement be-
tween the consumer and the creditor relating to the residential
mortgage loan or extension of credit referred to in paragraph
(1), shall be applied or interpreted so as to bar a consumer
from bringing an action in an appropriate district court of the
United States, or any other court of competent jurisdiction,
pursuant to section 130 or any other provision of law, for dam-
ages or other relief in connection with any alleged violation of
this section, any other provision of this title, or any other Fed-
eral law.
(f) MORTGAGES WITH NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION.—No creditor may
extend credit to a borrower in connection with a consumer credit
transaction under an open or closed end consumer credit plan se-
cured by a dwelling or residential real property that includes a
dwelling, other than a reverse mortgage, that provides or permits
a payment plan that may, at any time over the term of the exten-
sion of credit, result in negative amortization unless, before such
transaction is consummated—
(1) the creditor provides the consumer with a statement
that—
(A) the pending transaction will or may, as the case may
be, result in negative amortization;
(B) describes negative amortization in such manner as
the Board shall prescribe;
(C) negative amortization increases the outstanding
principal balance of the account; and
(D) negative amortization reduces the consumer’s equity
in the dwelling or real property; and
(2) in the case of a first-time borrower with respect to a resi-
dential mortgage loan that is not a qualified mortgage, the
first-time borrower provides the creditor with sufficient docu-
mentation to demonstrate that the consumer received home-
ownership counseling from organizations or counselors certified
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as com-
petent to provide such counseling.
(g) PROTECTION AGAINST LOSS OF ANTI-DEFICIENCY PROTEC-
TION.—
(1) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this subsection, the term
‘‘anti-deficiency law’’ means the law of any State which pro-
vides that, in the event of foreclosure on the residential prop-
erty of a consumer securing a mortgage, the consumer is not
liable, in accordance with the terms and limitations of such
State law, for any deficiency between the sale price obtained

on such property through foreclosure and the outstanding bal-
ance of the mortgage.
(2) NOTICE AT TIME OF CONSUMMATION.—In the case of any
residential mortgage loan that is, or upon consummation will
be, subject to protection under an anti-deficiency law, the cred-
itor or mortgage originator shall provide a written notice to the
consumer describing the protection provided by the anti-defi-
ciency law and the significance for the consumer of the loss of
such protection before such loan is consummated.
(3) NOTICE BEFORE REFINANCING THAT WOULD CAUSE LOSS OF
PROTECTION.—In the case of any residential mortgage loan that
is subject to protection under an anti-deficiency law, if a cred-
itor or mortgage originator provides an application to a con-
sumer, or receives an application from a consumer, for any
type of refinancing for such loan that would cause the loan to
lose the protection of such anti-deficiency law, the creditor or
mortgage originator shall provide a written notice to the con-
sumer describing the protection provided by the anti-deficiency
law and the significance for the consumer of the loss of such
protection before any agreement for any such refinancing is
consummated.
(h) POLICY REGARDING ACCEPTANCE OF PARTIAL PAYMENT.—In
the case of any residential mortgage loan, a creditor shall disclose

gated under this section do not apply to an extension of credit re-

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would raise the minimum threshold from $10 billion to
$50 billion in total assets for depository institutions to be exempt
from CFPB supervision, Qualified Mortgage (QM) requirements,
and the Volcker Rule’s prohibition on proprietary trading. It would
also expand the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR), allowing
banks with up to $50 billion to be exempt from other risk-based
and leverage ratio requirements if they meet the CBLR, currently
set at 9%. This bill would exempt 70% of the largest banks from
these requirements. According to the latest data, simply adjusting
for inflation would suggest those thresholds should only increase to
about $14.7 billion, not quintupling those thresholds.
Of the 8,942 banks and credit unions in the country, only 179
(2%) have more than $10 billion in assets.1 It is unclear what the
justification is to dramatically raise these $10 billion thresholds by
500% to $50 billion. Many of these thresholds were set in July
2010, when Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act into law. According to the latest data,
simply adjusting for inflation would suggest those thresholds
should only increase to about $14.7 billion,2 not quintupling those
thresholds. The CBLR threshold was established by Congress in
May 2018, which in today’s dollars would be about $12.75 billion.3
For comparison, of the 179 depository institutions with more than
$10 billion in assets, there are 41 depository institutions (23%)
with between $10 billion and $15 billion in assets, and there are
127 depository institutions (70%) with between $10 billion and $50
billion in assets.4
Consumer groups like Americans for Financial Reform (AFR) and
Public Citizen oppose the bill. When a similar bill was considered
by the Committee last year, AFR wrote, ‘‘Safety and soundness and
consumer protection oversight will suffer substantially from these
changes. The banking agencies have acknowledged that clusters of
midsize banks with similar concentrations are vulnerable to con-
tagion. This may include some firms’ overreliance on uninsured de-
posits on the liability side, and vulnerable or opaque loans or secu-
rities concentrations on the asset side of the balance sheet. This
also includes weakened CRE portfolios and rising loan exposures to
non- bank financial institutions.’’5
During the debate, Ranking Member Waters offered an amend-
ment to stipulate that the bill would not take effect unless CFPB
certifies they have at least the average number of supervisory and
examination staff that are performing their supervisory and exam-

Kathy Kraninger’s tenure leading the CFPB during Trump’s first
term, when they felt compelled to follow the law and still had at
least 1,400 employees on staff carrying out the CFPB’s mission.
This amendment was rejected by Republicans.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3320.
