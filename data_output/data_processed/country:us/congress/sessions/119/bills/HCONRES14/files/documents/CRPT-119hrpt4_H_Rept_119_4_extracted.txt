INTRODUCTION
Our Nation has reached a breaking point with large and growing
Federal deficits. The gross national debt currently exceeds the
World War II high of 116 percent and is increasingly driven by
higher interest costs. Interest spending more than doubled under
President Biden and currently exceeds spending on national de-
fense. This is a disastrous result of his reckless spending spree,
which ballooned the debt, triggered rampant inflation, and in-
creased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. It’s a per-
ilous path for a nation to spend more to finance its past than to
secure its future. If interest costs continue to spiral out of control,
it will undermine economic stability and global trust in the dollar.
To realize the benefits of pro-growth policies such as tax reform
and regulatory relief, we must root out wasteful, fraudulent, and
unnecessary spending and restore the fiscal health of our country.
True fiscal discipline is the only path forward.
Reconciliation will pave the way to address our country’s immi-
nent national security threats by bolstering our national defense
and securing our southern border. Additionally, we must return to
the pro-growth policies of Trump 1.0, which will launch an era of
unparalleled strength and prosperity. To ensure long-term eco-
nomic strength, we must unleash American innovation, investment,
and job creation. A strong, competitive economy is built on fiscal
discipline and policies that promote entrepreneurship and economic
freedom. By prioritizing growth and responsible spending, we can
restore prosperity and secure a brighter future for our children and
grandchildren.

THE ECONOMY AND ECONOMIC
ASSUMPTIONS
President Biden’s Reckless Spending and Failed Economic
Policies
During President Biden’s time in office, Democrats pursued a
radical agenda and vast expansion of the Federal Government.
Under the guise of COVID relief, Democrats’ unbridled spending
and President Biden’s failed economic policies lit the fuse on an in-
flationary firestorm that resulted in soaring interest rates, a fragile
economy, and a Nation on the precipice of an irreparable debt cri-
sis.
President Biden’s ‘‘Inflation Reduction Act’’ (IRA) tax-and-spend
monstrosity imposed massive tax hikes on job creators, strangled
domestic oil and gas production, unleashed an army of Internal
Revenue Service agents on working families and small businesses,
expanded Obamacare subsidies for wealthy Americans, and handed
out hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy tax breaks.
He enacted policies that paid people more to stay home than to
return to their jobs and waived work requirements for able-bodied
adults—creating a labor shortage and trapping a whole new gen-
eration of Americans in poverty and government dependence.
He unleashed an unprecedented barrage of regulations and exec-
utive actions, adding a record $1.8 trillion in new regulatory costs
on the economy. To put this into perspective, this is over 31⁄
2
times
the regulatory costs added under President Obama ($494 billion)
during his first term in office.1
In addition, President Biden launched a whole-of-government at-
tack on American energy—the lifeblood of our economy, a corner-
stone of our national security, and the blessing of affordable elec-
tricity and gas for families across the country.
All told, his policies resulted in a cost-of-living crisis as prices
have skyrocketed by over 20 percent and real earnings declined by

Section 10:
3.6 percent, the equivalent of more than $8,000 in lost real income
per worker.
Despite numerous opportunities to recognize this somber eco-
nomic reality and reverse course, President Biden repeatedly dou-
bled down on his increased spending and failed economic policies—
forcing Americans to further tighten their belts.
It is within the context of this economic crisis, and the plethora
of other crises of the past four years, that the American people re-

elected President Trump in a landslide victory—resoundingly re-
jecting the policies of the Biden Administration.
The Economic Outlook
While the economic outlook is trending up for Americans, cur-
rently available forecasts inherently assume continuation of failed
Biden-era policies and as such project modest economic outcomes
throughout the decade. The most recent President’s budget, pub-
lished under President Biden, expects average real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 2.1 percent, compared to expected growth
of 1.8 and 2.0 percent by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
and Blue Chip, respectively.
Expectations for inflation and 10-year Treasury yields are rough-
ly identical across forecasters at about 2.2 and 3.8 percent, respec-
tively. A somewhat more noticeable difference exists in projected
short-term rates where CBO projects average 3-month yields of 3.2
percent while the Biden Administration and Blue Chip projected
just 3.0 percent. Yet, a larger difference between forecasters exists
in unemployment projections.
On average, CBO projects an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent
over the decade compared to projections from the Administration
and Blue Chip of 3.8 and 4.1 percent, respectively.
This budget resolution breaks from the status quo of sluggish
growth by supporting fiscal and economic policies that restrain
spending, cut taxes, and reignite the economy.
Economic Assumptions of the Budget Resolution
Economic growth is essential to reining in our deficits and reduc-
ing our Nation’s indebtedness. Growth generates more revenue for
our country, reduces spending by lifting American families out of
poverty and off of government dependence, and allows people to
keep more of their hard-earned money.
To achieve faster economic growth, this budget resolution com-
bines spending restraint with pro-growth policies including:
• Eliminating the regulatory state
• Locking in tax cuts, unlocking opportunities for all
• Restoring the dignity of work
• Unleashing American energy dominance
As a result of these policies, the Committee on the Budget esti-
mates that economic growth will average 2.6 percent over ten
years—generating a substantial $2.6 trillion in deficit reduction.

MACROECONOMIC FEEDBACK EFFECTS
OF PRO-GROWTH POLICIES
Economic growth is one of the major determinants of revenue
and spending levels—and therefore the size of budget deficits over
a given period. For instance, a higher rate of gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) growth can lead to lower projected spending if it trans-
lates into reduced burdens on government safety net programs. It
can also generate higher revenue due to increases in taxable in-
comes. Naturally, such a pattern would cause a reduction in Fed-
eral deficits and debt relative to current law projections. Con-
versely, lower rates of growth can cause the opposite outcomes:
higher rates of spending increases and slower revenue growth.
Federal policies themselves can affect the economy’s potential to
grow, generating positive feedback into budgetary outcomes. Con-
sequently, fiscally responsible policies that improve the economy’s
long-term growth prospects can help reduce the size of budget defi-
cits over a given period.
As noted in the previous section, this budget resolution is based
on an economic forecast that incorporates all of the pro-growth poli-
cies advanced in this budget resolution, including: regulatory re-
form; expanding domestic energy production; building on the suc-
cess of Republican tax reform; eliminating disincentives to work;
and lower spending.
These initiatives are all a departure from the policies embedded
in current law. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
is obligated to produce an economic forecast that assumes an in-
definite extension of current law, including the explosion of deficit
and debt levels over the next decade. This is partly why CBO is
forecasting average real GDP growth of just 1.8 percent over the
next ten years, well below the long-term growth trend of 3.1 per-
cent in the United States.
The Committee on the Budget estimates that under the pro-
growth policies in the fiscal year 2025 budget resolution, real eco-
nomic growth of 2.6 percent can be achieved over the budget win-
dow.

FUNCTION-BY-FUNCTION
PRESENTATION
FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE
Function Summary
The National Defense budget function includes funds to com-
pensate, train, maintain, and equip the military forces of the
United States. The majority of National Defense programs are dis-
cretionary and funded through the annual appropriations process.
These programs include all military activities of the Department of
Defense (DOD); activities of the Department of Energy (DOE), in-
cluding the National Nuclear Security Administration, environ-
mental clean-up of weapons production, and research sites; and
other defense-related activities (primarily in connection with
counterterrorism). Mandatory spending primarily funds benefits for
military retirees within the National Defense budget function.
The committees of jurisdiction—the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices and Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense—should con-
tinue effective oversight of DOD to ensure resources are used effi-
ciently to achieve desired results. The Committee on the Budget’s
authority applies solely to the budgetary parameters for each com-
mittee of jurisdiction.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
The budget resolution calls for $888 billion in budget authority
and $883.8 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2025. Of that total, dis-
cretionary spending in fiscal year 2025 is $861.6 billion in budget
authority and $858.9 billion in outlays. Mandatory spending in fis-
cal year 2025 is $26.5 billion in budget authority and $24.9 billion
in outlays. The 10-year totals for budget authority and outlays are
$9.9 trillion and $9.7 trillion, respectively.

FUNCTION 150: INTERNATIONAL
AFFAIRS
Function Summary
The International Affairs budget function includes the Federal
Government’s spending for the following programs: international
development, food security, and humanitarian assistance; inter-
national security assistance; the conduct of foreign affairs; foreign
information and exchange activities; and international financial
programs. The primary agencies responsible for executing these
programs are the Departments of Agriculture, State, and the
Treasury. The Department of State’s basic operations and foreign
aid account for the majority of discretionary spending within the
International Affairs budget function.
The committees of jurisdiction—the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs and Appropriations Subcommittee on National Security, De-
partment of State, and Related Programs—should continue effec-
tive oversight of the Department of State and related foreign oper-
ations to ensure resources are used efficiently to achieve desired re-
sults. The Committee on the Budget’s authority applies solely to
the budgetary parameters for each committee of jurisdiction.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
The budget resolution calls for $66 billion in budget authority
and $69.2 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2025. Of that total, dis-
cretionary spending in fiscal year 2025 totals $60.9 billion in budg-
et authority and $74.4 billion in outlays. Mandatory spending in
this function—totaling $5.1 billion in budget authority and ¥$5.2
billion in outlays for fiscal year 2025—includes loan guarantee pro-
grams, payments to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability
Fund, and foreign-military sales programs. The negative figures re-
flect receipts from foreign-military sales and financing programs.
The 10-year totals for budget authority and outlays are $690.2 bil-
lion and $675.6 billion, respectively.

Program, Part B Supplementary Medical Insurance Program, Part
C Medicare Advantage Program, and Part D Prescription Drug

beneficiaries. The various parts of the program are financed in dif-
ferent ways.
Part A benefits are financed primarily by a payroll tax, the reve-
nues from which are credited to the Hospital Insurance Trust
Fund. For Part B, premiums paid by beneficiaries cover about one
quarter of outlays, and the Treasury General Fund covers the rest.
Payments to private insurance plans under Part C are financed by
a share of funds from Parts A and B.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
In fiscal year 2025, the budget resolution calls for $950.9 billion

FUNCTION 650: SOCIAL SECURITY
Function Summary
Function 650 consists of the Social Security program, including
Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) benefits and Disability In-
surance (DI) benefits. Social Security is the largest program in
terms of dollars in the Federal Government’s budget and is almost
entirely mandatory spending.
DI provides income support for almost nine million persons with
disabilities and their families who have not yet reached retirement
age.2 Similar to OASI, DI is funded primarily through payroll tax
revenues.
OASI provides retirement benefits to more than 58 million older
Americans or their surviving spouses and children.3 Benefits for
current recipients are funded primarily through payroll taxes paid
by current workers, and the size of the benefit is based on the
beneficiary’s earning history. The Congressional Budget Office
projects the OASI Trust Fund will be insolvent in 2033.4 The Social
Security Trustees project the OASI Trust Fund will be depleted in
2033, at which time the Fund will only be able to cover 79 percent
of its scheduled benefits.5
The authorizing committee of jurisdiction for Function 650 is the
Committee on Ways and Means. Discretionary funding is provided
by the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution

FUNCTION 900: NET INTEREST
Function Summary
As the Federal Government runs chronic deficits and adds to its
debt, it continues running up interest costs. These payments pro-
vide no benefits and finance no government service or operations.
They are simply excess costs resulting from a history of spending
beyond the government’s means. According to the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO), if government programs are not reformed, net
interest payments are projected to increase from $881 billion in fis-
cal year 2024 to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2034.6 In fiscal year
2024, interest on the debt became the government’s third largest
budget line item, following only Social Security and Medicare.
These costs are reflected in Function 900, which presents the in-
terest paid for the Federal Government’s borrowing minus the in-
terest received by the Federal Government from trust fund invest-
ments and loans to the public. It is a mandatory payment, in the
truest sense of the word, with no policy options and no discre-
tionary components.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
The budget resolution calls for $959.9 billion in mandatory
spending for net interest payments in fiscal year 2025. Over ten
years, interest payments are expected to total $13.1 trillion.
On-budget mandatory spending—or net interest payments unre-
lated to Social Security—totals $1.0 trillion in fiscal year 2025 and
$13.6 trillion over ten years. The on-budget figure is larger than
the Function 900 total because the former is offset by off-budget in-
terest payments to the Social Security Trust Fund. These off-budg-
et payments are presented as negative numbers, as they reflect
money coming into, rather than flowing out of, the U.S. Treasury.
Off-budget mandatory spending is ¥$67.8 billion in fiscal year
2025 and ¥$464.2 billion over ten years.

FUNCTION 920: ALLOWANCES AND
FUNCTION 990: ACROSS-THE-BOARD
ADJUSTMENT
Function Summary
The Allowances and Across-the-Board Adjustment categories rep-
resent placeholders for certain budgetary impacts that the Congres-
sional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to assign to a specific budget
function. In the case of this budget resolution, there are two pre-
sented as Function 920 and 990 in the summary tables. The par-
ticulars of the categories are described below.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
FUNCTION 920
The CBO baseline does not include any projected amounts for
Function 920. Therefore, the budget resolution includes a total of
$0 for budget authority and outlays.
FUNCTION 990
The CBO baseline for Function 990 includes spending of $42 mil-
lion in budget authority and $0 in outlays over ten years. The
budget resolution recommends no changes in this function.

FUNCTION 930: GOVERNMENT–WIDE
SAVINGS
Function Summary
A number of policies assumed in the budget resolution cut across
multiple agencies or functional categories and have government-
wide effects. These are reflected in Function 930. For ease of un-
derstanding, the budget employs this function, Government-Wide
Savings, to describe these assumptions.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
In fiscal year 2025, the budget resolution calls for ¥$120 billion
in budget authority and ¥$120 billion in outlays. Mandatory
spending comprises the entire total in fiscal year 2025 for both
budget authority and outlays. The 10-year totals for budget author-
ity and outlays are ¥$3.7 trillion and ¥$3.0 trillion, respectively.

FUNCTION 950: UNDISTRIBUTED
OFFSETTING RECEIPTS
Function Summary
Offsetting receipts to the Treasury are recorded in this function
as negative budget authority and outlays. These receipts are either
intra-budgetary (a payment from one Federal agency to another,
such as agency payments to the retirement trust funds) or propri-
etary (a payment from the public for some kind of business trans-
action with the Federal Government). The main types of receipts
presented are the payments Federal agencies make to employee re-
tirement and health care funds; payments made by companies for
the right to explore and produce oil and gas on the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf; and payments by those who bid for the right to buy
or use public property or resources, such as the electromagnetic
spectrum. The function also contains an off-budget component that
reflects the Federal Government’s share of Social Security contribu-
tions for Federal employees.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
The budget resolution calls for $127.6 billion in budget authority
and $127.6 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2025. The 10-year totals
for budget authority and outlays are $1.5 trillion and $1.5 trillion,
respectively.

REVENUE AND TAX REFORM
Summary of Revenue Projections
For the purpose of the budget resolution, revenues encompass all
collected tax monies, fees and fines, and customs duties. The budg-
et resolution assumes $4.5 trillion in lower revenues than projected
by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The budget resolution
assumes $4.7 trillion in revenues in fiscal year 2025. The 10-year
total projection for revenues is $60.2 trillion.
If combined reconciliation recommendations from committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit do not achieve at least $2 trillion in
net deficit reduction, then the instruction to the Committee on
Ways and Means would be reduced by a commensurate amount. If
combined reconciliation recommendations from committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit achieve more than $2 trillion in net
deficit reduction, then the instruction to the Committee on Ways
and Means would be increased by a commensurate amount.
This budget resolution provides sufficient room for extension of
expired and expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
2017 (TCJA) and other improvements to the tax code.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The TCJA made sweeping changes to the way tax law impacts
Americans.7 The goal was to advance a bold, pro-growth overhaul
of the Nation’s tax code for the first time in over three decades. In
reality, the TCJA accomplished that and much more, leading to
more jobs, higher productivity, bigger paychecks for American fami-
lies, and a stronger economy.
On the individual income side, the 2017 tax reform lowered indi-
vidual taxes and doubled the standard deduction from $6,500 and
$13,000 to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married cou-
ples, respectively. These two changes enable Americans to keep
more of their hard-earned paychecks. For example, a typical Amer-
ican family earning the median income saw a tax cut of $2,059.8
This is more than $2,000 in the pockets of Americans—money that
eases the strain of inflation on daily home budgeting.
On the business side, the TCJA lowered the corporate tax rate
to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. This was vital to ensure
American headquartered employers could remain internationally
competitive. It enabled businesses to grow and expand by allowing

them to write off immediately the full cost of new equipment. The
TJCA eliminated the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and
modernized the international tax structure. Taken together, these
and other corporate tax reforms have already and will continue to
provide wide-spread relief for job creators, helping expand oppor-
tunity and the American economy in the process.
After the TCJA, American workers enjoyed the fastest wage
growth in a decade. This spread to Americans across the income
distribution, with lower-wage workers experiencing 50 percent
higher wage growth than high-income workers.9 Higher wages lead
to a rapid growth in household income. In just the two years after
enactment of the tax cuts, real median household income rose by
over $5,000.10 In total, TCJA’s pro-growth policies helped con-
tribute to 3.0 percent growth in 2018 and 2.6 percent growth in
2019—well above CBO’s pre-TCJA projections of 2.2 percent and

Section 14:
1.7 percent, respectively.
Advancing Pro-Growth Tax Reform
The Committee on Ways and Means has jurisdiction on revenue
measures.
While the TCJA has proven very successful, several of the law’s
most important provisions are not permanent policy. Much of the
tax relief for families is set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2025.
Vital provisions that removed tax disincentives for business invest-
ment have already expired or are phasing out, including expensing
for capital expenditures (also known as bonus depreciation), ex-
pensing for research and development costs, and deductions for in-
terest expenses.
This budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions allow-
ing the Committee on Ways and Means to work to extend tax cuts
for families and businesses.

THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET: A BRIEF
SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE
PRESIDENT’S FISCAL YEAR 2025 BUDGET REQUEST11
Spending. President Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget would spend
$86.6 trillion, or 24.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) (16
percent above the 50-year average), over ten years. This is the
highest sustained level of spending in American history. Federal
spending would exceed the pre-COVID peacetime record, as a per-
centage of GDP, in every year of the budget. However, defense
spending would fall to the lowest level as a percentage of GDP
since the attack on Pearl Harbor. Annual spending is equivalent to
$66,000 per household.
Deficits. President Biden’s budget proposes deficits of $16.3 tril-
lion, or 4.6 percent of GDP (24 percent above the 50-year average),
over ten years. This is the highest sustained level in American his-
tory. Annual deficits never fall back to pre-COVID levels.
Taxes. President Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget proposes $70.3
trillion, or 19.7 percent of GDP (14 percent above the 50-year aver-
age), over ten years. This is the highest sustained level in Amer-
ican history. By 2031, Federal taxes would be more than a fifth of
GDP, a level previously only reached during the height of World
War II.
Interest Payments on the Debt. President Biden’s fiscal year 2025
budget proposes to spend $12.2 trillion (3.4 percent of GDP) for in-
terest payments on the debt, over the next ten years. This is $2.5
trillion more than spending on national defense over the same pe-

Section 30:
SECTION-BY-SECTION DESCRIPTION
The Fiscal Year 2025 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget es-
tablishes an overall budgetary framework. As required under the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Budget Act), this concurrent res-
olution includes aggregate levels of new budget authority, outlays,
revenues, the amount by which revenues should be changed, the
surplus or deficit, new budget authority and outlays for each major
functional category, debt held by the public, and debt subject to the
statutory limit. This concurrent resolution also sets appropriate
budgetary levels for fiscal years 2026 through 2034.
This concurrent resolution provides reconciliation instructions to
11 authorizing committees in the House of Representatives. This
budget resolution follows the convention of not reconciling Senate
committees and assumes that instructions to Senate authorizing
committees will be incorporated in any final budget agreement. It
is envisioned that the reconciliation process will be used to reduce
mandatory spending by at least $1.5 trillion over ten years in addi-
tion to providing for tax reform, border security, and defense
spending. It also instructs the Committee on Ways and Means to
increase the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion. This concurrent res-
olution also includes rulemaking provisions necessary to enforce
the budget resolution, procedures for adjusting the budget resolu-
tion, and certain policy assumptions underlying the budget resolu-
tion.

Section 31:
Section 1. Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025
Subsection (a) establishes the budget for fiscal year 2025 and
each of the nine ensuing fiscal years, 2026 through 2034, at the
levels that appear subsequently in the resolution, replacing all
prior concurrent resolutions on the budget. Section 301(a) of the
Budget Act requires the budget resolution to establish budgetary
levels for the fiscal year for which such resolution is adopted and
for at least each of the four ensuing fiscal years.
Subsection (b) sets out the table of contents of the budget resolu-
tion.
TITLE I—RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND AMOUNTS

Section 32:
Section 1001. Recommended Levels and Amounts

Section 33:
Section 1001, as required by section 301 of the Budget Act, estab-
lishes the recommended levels for revenues, the amount by which
revenues should be changed, total new budget authority, total out-
lays, surpluses or deficits, debt subject to the statutory limit, and
debt held by the public.

While the revenue level operates as a floor against which all rev-
enue legislation is measured, the recommended levels of new budg-
et authority and outlays serve as a ceiling for spending legislation.
The surplus or deficit levels include only on-budget outlays and
revenue.
Most outlays and receipts related to the Social Security program
and United States Postal Service are not included because both ac-
counts are statutorily off-budget.
Debt subject to the limit reflects the gross Federal debt, but ex-
cludes debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank or by non-Treas-
ury agencies. Debt held by the public is the amount of debt issued
and held by entities or individuals other than the U.S. Government
and includes Treasury debt held by the Federal Reserve system.

Section 34:
Section 1002. Major Functional Categories

Section 35:
Section 1002, as required by section 301(a) of the Budget Act, es-
tablishes the budgetary levels for each major functional category
for fiscal year 2025 and for fiscal years 2026 through 2034.
These major functional categories include:
050 National Defense
150 International Affairs
250 General Science, Space, and Technology
270 Energy
300 Natural Resources and Environment
350 Agriculture
370 Commerce and Housing Credit
400 Transportation
450 Community and Regional Development
500 Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services
550 Health
570 Medicare
600 Income Security
650 Social Security
700 Veterans Benefits and Services
750 Administration of Justice
800 General Government
900 Net Interest
920 Allowances
930 Government-Wide Savings
950 Undistributed Offsetting Receipts
990 Across-the-Board Adjustment
TITLE II—RECONCILIATION AND RELATED MATTERS

Section 36:
Section 2001. Reconciliation in the House of Representatives

Section 37:
Section 2001 sets forth reconciliation instructions to 11 author-
izing committees in the House.
Subsection (a) specifies a deadline of March 27, 2025, for the in-
structed authorizing committees, pursuant to section 310 of the
Budget Act, to submit changes in laws within their jurisdictions
achieving specified amounts of savings or spending to the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the House.

Subsection (b) instructs 11 authorizing Committees in the House.
The committees instructed and their reconciled amounts over the
period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 are as follows:
Committee on Agriculture ........................ reduce the deficit by at least $230 billion
Committee on Armed Services ................. increase the deficit by no more than
$100 billion
Committee on Education and Workforce reduce the deficit by at least $330 billion
Committee on Energy and Commerce ..... reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion
Committee on Financial Services ............ reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion
Committee on Homeland Security ........... increase the deficit by no more than $90
billion
Committee on the Judiciary ..................... increase the deficit by no more than
$110 billion
Committee on Natural Resources ............ reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion
Committee on Oversight and Govern- reduce the deficit by at least $50 billion
ment Reform.
Committee on Transportation and Infra- reduce the deficit by at least $10 billion
structure.
Committee on Ways and Means .............. increase the deficit by no more than $4.5
trillion
Reconciliation instructions to reduce the deficit act as a floor on
the required amount of savings for each committee receiving this
type of instruction is required to achieve. These targets are for the
total of the 10-fiscal-year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit act as a ceiling
on the amount of spending that each committee receiving this type
of instruction can spend. These targets are for the total of the 10-
fiscal-year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Subsection (c) instructs the Committee on Ways and Means to
submit changes in laws within its jurisdiction that increase the
statutory debt limit by $4 trillion for the period of fiscal years 2025
through 2034.
A central tenant of the budget reconciliation process is that the
authorizing committees determine their own policies as long as
they meet their reconciliation targets. Therefore, the authorizing
committees can meet the reconciled amounts with any combination
of policies within their jurisdiction that achieve the required
amount of deficit reduction or increase in the deficit, as applicable.
All reconciled committees are required to mark up legislation
that meets their reconciliation target and transmit the legislation
to the Committee on the Budget rather than reporting the legisla-
tion to the House.
Other than transmitting their legislation to the Committee on
the Budget, the authorizing committees are expected to follow reg-
ular order in complying with the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives and Committee rules regarding markup procedures and re-
porting requirements.
The Committee on the Budget will then combine all the submis-
sions and report the bill to the House. Under section 310(b) of the
Budget Act, the Committee on the Budget must report the author-
izing committee’s submissions without substantive revision.

TITLE III—RESERVE FUND

Section 38:
Section 3001. Reserve Fund for Reconciliation Legislation
Subsection (a) permits the Chair of the House Committee on the
Budget to adjust the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate
levels in the budget resolution for reconciliation legislation consid-
ered pursuant to section 2001 by the necessary amounts to accom-
modate the budgetary effects of the legislation if the budgetary ef-
fects of the legislation comply with the reconciliation instructions
under this concurrent resolution.
Subsection (b) stipulates that for purposes of this section compli-
ance with the reconciliation instructions under this concurrent res-
olution shall be determined by the Chair of the House Committee
on the Budget.

Section 39:
Section 3002. Adjustment for Spending Cuts of At Least $2.5 Tril-
lion

Section 40:
Section 3002 motivates the 11 authorizing committees instructed
to reduce the deficit under title II of this concurrent resolution to
achieve $2 trillion in total deficit reduction over the period of fiscal
years 2025 through 2034.
Subsection (a) stipulates that if $2 trillion in total deficit reduc-
tion over the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 is not
achieved by the 11 authorizing committees instructed to reduce the
deficit under title II of this concurrent resolution then the Chair of
the House Committee on the Budget is required to reduce the rec-
onciliation instruction for the Committee on Ways and Means
under section 2001(b)(11) of this concurrent resolution, the alloca-
tions to the Committee on Ways and Means, the aggregate levels
of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, and other appropriate
levels in the budget resolution by an amount that is equal to the
difference between $2 trillion and the total dollar amount of the
reconciliation recommendations submitted by the committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit.
Subsection (b) stipulates that if at least $2 trillion in total deficit
reduction over the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 is
achieved by the 11 authorizing committees instructed to reduce the
deficit under title II of this concurrent resolution then the Chair of
the House Committee on the Budget is required to increase the rec-
onciliation instruction for the Committee on Ways and Means
under section 2001(b)(11) of this concurrent resolution, the alloca-
tions to the Committee on Ways and Means, the aggregate levels
of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, and other appropriate
levels in the budget resolution by an amount that is equal to the
difference between $2 trillion and the total dollar amount of the
reconciliation recommendations submitted by the committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit.
Subsection (c) stipulates that no adjustment under section 3002
may be made unless the Chair of the House Committee on the
Budget, using cost estimates provided by the Congressional Budget
Office and Joint Committee on Taxation (as applicable), certifies in
writing that the applicable reconciliation recommendations either:
(1) do not achieve net deficit reduction of at least $2 trillion over
the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 pursuant to subsection

(a); or (2) achieve net deficit reduction of at least $2 trillion over
the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 pursuant to subsection
(b).
Subsection (d) states that the dollar amount resulting from any
adjustment made under section 3002 to the reconciliation instruc-
tions for the Committee on Ways and Means under subsection
2001(b)(11) shall be substituted for $4.5 trillion and shall be
deemed to be the reconciliation instructions for the Committee on
Ways and Means. Subsection (d) also states that any recommenda-
tions on changes in laws within the jurisdiction of the Committee
shall be consistent with the goals of this concurrent resolution, in-
cluding spending reduction, tax policy changes, reforms, or other
measures deemed appropriate by the Chair of the House Com-
mittee on the Budget.
Subsection (e) states that any reconciliation instructions receiv-
ing an adjustment under section 3002 of this concurrent resolution
shall not be considered in violation of the budgetary levels estab-
lished by this concurrent resolution.
TITLE IV—POLICY STATEMENTS

Section 41:
Section 4001. Policy Statement on Economic Growth
Subsection (a) sets out findings.
Subsection (b) states it is the policy of this concurrent resolution
to pursue policies that embrace the free market and promote eco-
nomic growth policies that reduce Federal spending; expand Amer-
ican energy production; lower taxes that discourage work, savings,
and investment; deregulate the economy and enact reforms to di-
minish bureaucratic red tape; and eliminate barriers to work so
more Americans enter (or reenter) the job market.

Section 42:
Section 4002. Policy Statement on Mandatory Spending Reduction
Subsection (a) sets out findings.
Subsection (b) states it is the goal of this concurrent resolution
to reduce mandatory spending by $2 trillion over the budget win-
dow and if the combined deficit reduction provided by the author-
izing committees through the reconciliation process is below this
target then it is the policy of the House Committee on the Budget
that the reconciliation instruction provided to the Committee on
Ways and Means should be reduced by a commensurate amount to
offset the difference.

Section 43:
Section 4003. Policy Statement on Government Deregulation
Subsection (a) sets out findings.
Subsection (b) states it is the policy of this concurrent resolution:
that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the burdens of
overregulation throughout the Federal Government; that Congress
is ready to promote initiatives that will reduce government bu-
reaucracy, enhance Federalism, and increase economic prosperity
through deregulation; and to enact legislation through the rec-
onciliation process that strengthens Congress, scales back Federal
regulations, limits future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes eco-
nomic growth such as the Regulations from the Executive in Need
of Scrutiny (REINS) Act.

TITLE V—OTHER MATTERS

Section 44:
Section 5001. Enforcement Filing in the House of Representatives

Section 45:
Section 5001 requires, if the Fiscal Year 2025 Concurrent Resolu-
tion on the Budget is agreed to by the House of Representatives
and the Senate without the appointment of a committee of con-
ference, the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget to submit
for printing in the Congressional Record a statement that includes
an allocation for the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year
2025 consistent with the budget resolution and allocations for all
authorizing committees, consistent with the budget resolution, for
fiscal year 2025 and for the period of fiscal years 2025 through

Section 46:
2034.

Section 47:
Section 5002. Budgetary Treatment of Administrative Expenses in
the House of Representatives
Subsection (a) provides that the administrative expenses of the
Social Security Administration and the United States Postal Serv-
ice are reflected in the allocation to the Committee on Appropria-
tions even though both are technically off-budget. This language is
necessary to ensure the Committee on Appropriations retains con-
trol over administrative expenses for these agencies through the
annual appropriations process. This budgetary treatment is based
on the long-term practice of the House and Senate Committees on
the Budget.
Subsection (b) requires administrative expenses to be included in
the cost estimates for the relevant appropriation measure, which
are used to determine if a measure exceeds the budget resolution’s
spending limits.

Section 48:
Section 5003. Application and Effect of Changes in Allocations, Ag-
gregates, and Other Budgetary Levels
Subsection (a) specifies the procedure for adjusting the levels es-
tablished by the budget resolution under the reserve fund and
other special procedures in this concurrent resolution. It provides
that the adjustments apply while the legislation is under consider-
ation and take effect upon enactment of the legislation. The Chair
of the House Committee on the Budget must submit any adjust-
ments to the budget resolution for printing in the Congressional
Record.
Subsection (b) clarifies that the adjusted levels in the budget res-
olution are fully enforceable under the Budget Act and other budg-
et rules.
Subsection (c) stipulates that the Chair of the House Committee
on the Budget is the ultimate arbiter of the cost estimates for legis-
lation used to enforce the budget resolution and budget rules.
Subsection (d) clarifies that legislation for which an adjustment
to the budget resolution is made, such as those in the reserve fund
in title III, is not subject to the point of order set forth in clause
10 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House Representatives, com-
monly referred to as the House Cut-As-You-Go rule.

an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate and that the House of Representatives and
the Senate have the constitutional right to change these rules.

RECONCILIATION

Section 55:
Section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C.
641) (Budget Act) sets out a special procedure that allows a concur-
rent resolution on the budget to direct one or more authorizing
committees to produce legislation that changes direct spending,
revenue, or the debt limit to bring these levels into compliance with
budget resolution policies. Reconciliation instructions must be in-
cluded in a concurrent resolution on the budget adopted by both
the House of Representatives and the Senate to be valid.
In general, reconciliation instructions include the amount of
budgetary change to be achieved; the time period over which such
budgetary change should be measured; and a deadline for the au-
thorizing committees to report legislation. When more than one au-
thorizing committee receives reconciliation instructions, each com-
mittee considers a bill to comply with these instructions as it would
any other bill, but the legislative text and other materials are sub-
mitted to the Committee on the Budget instead of being reported
to the House of Representatives. The Committee on the Budget
then incorporates all submissions together, without any sub-
stantive revision, into a single bill and reports it to the House of
Representatives. If only one authorizing committee receives rec-
onciliation instructions, then that committee’s bill is reported di-
rectly to the House of Representatives and is not submitted to the
Committee on the Budget.
In the House of Representatives, the Committee on Rules reports
a special rule governing the consideration of a reconciliation bill.
Typically, the rule will allow for 2 or 3 hours of general debate
equally divided. The Committee on the Budget determines whether
an authorizing committee is in compliance with its reconciliation
instructions. Under section 310 of the Budget Act, authorizing com-
mittees must comply with reconciliation instructions. If an author-
izing committee does not comply with its instructions, the Com-
mittee on Rules may make in order amendments that achieve the
required budgetary changes pursuant to section 310(d)(5) of the
Budget Act.
A reconciliation bill is a privileged measure in the Senate. Dis-
tinct from most Senate bills, debate is limited to 20 hours and only
requires a simple majority to pass (51 votes) rather than the 60
votes otherwise required for cloture. In the Senate, the ‘‘Byrd Rule’’
(section 313 of the Budget Act) limits the content of a reconciliation
bill. The Byrd Rule prohibits the consideration of extraneous provi-
sions in a reconciliation bill. If a provision is found to violate the
Byrd Rule, it is removed from the bill or conference report unless
60 Senators vote to waive it.

This Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025,
as reported by the Committee on the Budget, provides for such rec-
onciliation legislation. It includes reconciliation instructions to 11
authorizing committees in the House of Representatives. The rec-
onciliation instructions included in the Concurrent Resolution on
the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025 create a process to reduce manda-
tory spending by at least $1.5 trillion over ten years. The reconcili-
ation instructions also provide for tax reform, border security, and
defense spending. The Committee on Ways and Means is also in-
structed to increase the debt limit by $4 trillion. Each authorizing
committee must submit legislative text and associated material to
the Committee on the Budget by March 27, 2025.
For a detailed description of the reconciliation instructions in-
cluded in this concurrent resolution on the budget, see title II of
the Section-by-Section Description.

THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
PROCESS
The budget resolution’s spending levels are implemented through
allocations to the Committee on Appropriations and authorizing
committees.
As required under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act
of 1974 (Budget Act), the budget resolution’s discretionary spending
levels are allocated to the Committee on Appropriations of each
House of Congress and the budget resolution’s direct spending lev-
els are allocated to each authorizing committee in the House of
Representatives and the Senate. These allocations are included in
the report accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget
and are enforced through points of order (see the section of this re-
port titled: ‘‘Enforcing Budgetary Levels’’).

Section 56:
Section 302 of the Budget Act requires the budget resolution to
provide allocations of budget authority for the first fiscal year and
at least the four ensuing fiscal years (except for the Committee on
Appropriations, which receives an allocation only for the budget
year). This report provides allocations of budget authority and out-
lays for the Committee on Appropriations for the budget year (fis-
cal year 2025) and allocations of budget authority and outlays for
authorizing committees for the budget year (fiscal year 2025) and
the 10-year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Committee on Appropriations—302(a) and 302(b) Allocations
302(a) Allocation. The Committee on Appropriations receives a
lump sum of discretionary budget authority and corresponding out-
lays. It is included in the report accompanying a concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget for the fiscal year for which the budget resolu-
tion is adopted. This allocation operates as a ceiling on the amount
of discretionary budget authority that can be appropriated for that
fiscal year. This budget resolution provides a 302(a) allocation to
the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2025.
302(b) Allocations. Once a 302(a) allocation is provided, the Com-
mittee on Appropriations is then required, in full committee, to di-
vide this allocation among its 12 subcommittees. The amount each
subcommittee receives constitutes its suballocation under section
302(b) of the Budget Act. Each subcommittee’s regular appropria-
tions bill is capped at the level of its 302(b) suballocation and the
bill is subject to a point of order if it exceeds this amount. Under

Section 57:
section 302(c) of the Budget Act, once the Committee on Appropria-
tions receives its 302(a) allocation appropriations bills may not be
considered on the floor of the House of Representatives until the
(87)

Committee on Appropriations provides 302(b) suballocations to its
subcommittees.
Authorizing Committees—302(a) Allocations
The report accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget
allocates to each authorizing committee an amount of new budget
authority and corresponding outlays required to accommodate the
direct spending (i.e., mandatory spending) within each authorizing
committee’s jurisdiction. If the budget resolution assumes increases
in direct spending for new or expanded programs with no offsetting
reductions in direct spending, additional budget authority may be
allocated to authorizing committees. Conversely, the allocation may
reflect negative budget authority (relative to the projected current
baseline) if the budget resolution assumes the enactment of legisla-
tion reducing direct spending.
Because the spending authority for these direct spending pro-
grams is multi-year or permanent, the allocations to the author-
izing committees cover both the budget year and the entire period
of the budget resolution. This budget resolution provides alloca-
tions for authorizing committees for fiscal year 2025 and for the 10-
year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Each authorizing committee is provided a single allocation of new
budget authority reflective of the fiscal effects of expected policy ac-
tion relative to current law. These committees are not required to

ENFORCING BUDGETARY LEVELS
The congressional budget process includes various mechanisms to
enforce the budget resolution, including provisions of the budget
resolution, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Budget Act), and
the Rules and Separate Orders of the House of Representatives.
The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget
The budget resolution establishes overall limits on spending and
revenue. The report accompanying the budget resolution contains
allocations to congressional committees that are binding on Con-
gress when it considers subsequent spending and tax legislation.
Legislation breaching the levels set forth in the budget resolution
is subject to points of order on the floor of the House of Representa-
tives. The budget resolution is established pursuant to the Budget
Act, which includes various requirements regarding its content and
enforcement. In addition to setting levels of spending, revenue,
deficits, and debt, the budget resolution may also include special
procedures to execute and enforce congressional budgetary deci-
sions.
The levels established in the budget resolution are not self-en-
forcing. Members must raise a point of order against legislation
that breaches the budget resolution’s allocations and aggregate lev-
els. If a point of order is sustained, then the House of Representa-
tives is precluded from further consideration of the measure. Some
of the points of order in the Budget Act and budget-related provi-
sions in the Rules of the House of Representatives are listed below.
Budget Act

Section 62:
Section 302(f). Section 302(f) of the Budget Act prohibits the con-
sideration of legislation that exceeds a committee’s allocation of
budget authority. For authorizing committees, this section applies
to the first fiscal year and the period of fiscal years covered by the
budget resolution. For appropriations bills, however, it applies only
to the first fiscal year.

Section 63:
Section 303. Section 303 prohibits the consideration of spending
and revenue legislation before the House of Representatives has
passed a budget resolution for a particular fiscal year. Legislation
that changes revenue or increases budget authority in a fiscal year
for which a budget resolution has not been agreed to violates sec-
tion 303(a). Section 303(a) does not apply to budget authority and
revenue provisions first effective in a year following the first fiscal
year to which a budget resolution applies or to appropriations bills
after May 15.

Section 64:
Section 311. Section 311 prohibits the consideration of legislation
that would exceed the budget resolution’s overall limits on budget
authority and outlays or cause revenue levels to fall below the rev-
enue floor established by the budget resolution. If legislation
causes the aggregate spending levels of budget authority or outlays
to be exceeded in the first fiscal year of the budget resolution, then
the legislation violates section 311. Legislation also violates section
311 if it causes revenue to be lower than the revenue floor in the
first fiscal year or the period of fiscal years covered by the budget
resolution. Section 311 does not apply to legislation that provides
budget authority but does not exceed a committee’s 302(a) alloca-
tion.

Section 65:
Section 314(f). Section 314(f) prohibits the consideration of legis-
lation that causes the statutory spending limits established in sec-
tion 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 to be exceeded.
Budget-Related Provisions Under the Rules of the House of
Representatives
Rule XIII, Clause 8. This clause requires, to the extent prac-
ticable, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation to incorporate the macroeconomic effects of
major legislation into official cost estimates.
Rule XXI, Clause 10. This clause prohibits the consideration of
legislation that increases net direct spending over two time periods:
(1) the current year, the budget year, and the four fiscal years fol-
lowing that budget year; or (2) the current year, the budget year,
and the nine fiscal years following that budget year. Any increase
in net direct spending in either of these time periods must be offset
by a corresponding reduction in net direct spending. If an amend-
ment offered to a measure increases direct spending in either of
these time periods, then the amendment must also reduce direct
spending by at least the same amount. This rule is commonly re-
ferred to as Cut-As-You-Go.
Rule XXIX, Clause 4. This clause specifies that the Chair of the
Committee on the Budget is responsible for providing authoritative
guidance regarding the budgetary impact of a legislative propo-
sition, including levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct
spending, new entitlement authority, and revenues.

Section 66:
Section 3, Separate Orders, House Resolution 5 (119th Congress).
House Resolution 5 adopted the rules from the 118th Congress,
with amendments to the standing rules, as the Rules of the House
of Representatives for the 119th Congress and included additional
provisions related to the budget process.

Section 67:
Section 3(c)(1) requires CBO, to the extent practicable, to prepare
an estimate of whether a measure reported by a committee (other
than the Committee on Appropriations), or any amendment or con-
ference report, would cause a net increase in direct spending in ex-
cess of $2.5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal-year peri-
ods beginning with the first fiscal year occurring ten fiscal years
after the current fiscal year. It also establishes a point of order
against consideration of any bill or joint resolution reported by a
committee, or any amendment or conference report, that causes a
net increase in direct spending in excess of $2.5 billion in any of

the four consecutive 10-fiscal-year periods described above. For
purposes of section 3(c)(1), the levels of any net increase in direct
spending shall be determined on the basis of estimates provided by
the Chair of the Committee on the Budget.

Section 68:
Section 3(c)(3) requires CBO, to the extent practicable, to provide
an estimate of the inflationary impacts of any legislation that
shows changes in direct spending causing a gross budgetary effect
in any fiscal year over a 10-year period equal to or greater than

Section 69:
0.25 percent of the projected gross domestic product (GDP) (meas-
ured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) for
the current fiscal year. The Chair of the Committee on the Budget
may also request such an estimate.

Section 70:
Section 3(e)(4) requires CBO, to the extent practicable, for any
estimate of legislation that impacts the Federal Hospital Insurance
Trust Fund or the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
Trust Funds (OASDI) that in any fiscal year over a 10-year period
causes a gross budgetary effect equal to or greater than 0.25 per-
cent of projected GDP (measured by the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers) for the current fiscal year to display: (1) the
impact such legislation would have on unfunded liabilities of the
Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund over a 25-year projection,
including solvency projections and the net present value of such li-
abilities; and (2) the impact on unfunded liabilities of OASDI over
a 75-year projection, including solvency projections and the net
present value of such liabilities. The Chair of the Committee on the
Budget may also request such an estimate.

Section 71:
Section 3(b) requires each general appropriation bill to include a
spending reduction account section and provides for spending re-
duction account transfer amendments.

OTHER MATTERS UNDER THE RULES
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Committee on the Budget Oversight Findings and
Recommendations
Clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives requires each committee report to contain oversight findings
and recommendations pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X. The
Committee on the Budget has no findings to report at this time.
New Budget Authority, Entitlement Authority, and Tax
Expenditures
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives provides that committee reports must contain the statement
required by section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
This report does not contain such a statement because, as a concur-
rent resolution setting forth a blueprint for the congressional budg-
et, the budget resolution does not provide new budget authority,
new entitlement authority, or changes revenues.
General Performance Goals and Objectives
Clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives requires each committee report on a legislative measure to
contain a statement of general performance goals and objectives,
including outcome-related goals and objectives, for which the meas-
ure authorizes funding. The Committee on the Budget has no such
goals and objectives to report at this time.
Views of Committee Members
Clause 2(l) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires each committee to afford members of the committee
two days to file minority, additional, dissenting, or supplemental
views on reported legislative measures, and to include the views in
the report accompanying such legislation. The following views were
submitted:

MINORITY VIEWS
FY 2025 Republican Economic Plan to Betray
the Middle Class
There have been areas where we have worked hard and achieved
common ground with our Republican colleagues, but sadly, this
budget is not one of them. This plan is a Republican betrayal of
the middle class. It does not support hardworking Americans, it
undermines them. Instead of investing in working families, House
Republicans have crafted a plan that takes from working Ameri-
cans to give to their billionaire donors.
This budget rips healthcare away from millions while handing
out $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, the overwhelming majority of which
go to billionaires and wealthy corporations. It slashes at least $230
billion from food assistance programs, at a time when grocery
prices remain at record highs. It proposes at least $880 billion in
cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. About 20 million
Americans rely on the ACA, and more than 72 million people rely
on Medicaid. That includes children, seniors and individuals with
disabilities.
Worse yet, these cuts are proposed so Republicans can give bil-
lionaires an even bigger tax cut, that they don’t need, and the
hardworking people in this country can’t afford that. Donald
Trump promised to lower costs but has obviously broken that
promise. But he is keeping another promise: Donald Trump and
Republicans are keeping their word when it comes to billionaires.
As he said to his billionaire donors gathered at Mar-a-Lago, ‘‘you’re
rich as hell, we’re going to give you tax cuts.’’ This Republican plan
makes good on that Trump promise at Mar-a-Lago.
The hypocrisy here is staggering. When there’s a Democrat in the
White House, our friends on the other side of the aisle are con-
stantly bemoaning the size of the national debt. But when Repub-
licans control the House, the Senate and the White House, where
is their debt reduction plan? It’s certainly not here. In fact, they
increase the national debt by four trillion dollars.
We will not stand by on this side of the aisle as Republicans un-
dermine working Americans. Democrats will fight back. We’re in
the minority, but we’re not going to give up. We will do everything
we can to educate the American people on what is in this budget
and why it is so bad for them and their families. We will not stand
by while Republicans undermine working families to put billion-
aires first.
Democrats offered more than 30 amendments to protect working
families, seniors, children and people with disabilities, but Repub-

licans opposed every single one. We offered amendments to stop
Republicans from making working Americans foot the bill for yet
another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. We offered amend-
ments rejecting cuts to Medicaid, lowering drug prices, and pro-
tecting the Affordable Care Act. We offered amendments to safe-
guard veterans, defend education, and lower costs on food and en-
ergy. We offered amendments to fight climate change and protect
federal agencies and workers. We gave Republicans the chance to
commit to protecting Social Security and Medicare. We fought for
child care, affordable insulin, school lunch, and Meals on Wheels.
We sought to preserve the important work at the Department of
Education, the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment, the National Institutes of Health, and the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau. Our amendments committed to shielding
taxpayers and their data. But Republicans refused all of our
amendments.
We reject this Republican rip off, and the Republican betrayal of
the middle class of this country.

(5), (8), (9), or (10) of section 2001(b) and such recommendations do
not, in total, achieve at least $2,000,000,000,000 in net deficit re-

ommendations receiving an allocation adjustment under this sec-
tion shall not be considered in violation of the budgetary levels es-

TITLE IV—POLICY STATEMENTS
SEC. 4001. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
(1) The rate of economic growth has a significant impact on
budget deficits. When the rate of gross domestic product (GDP)
increases, projected revenue grows with it and deficits decline.
Conversely, slower GDP growth can lead to lagging revenues
and mounting deficits.
(2) Federal policies affect the economy’s potential to grow
and impact economic performance, influencing budgetary out-
comes. Consequently, fiscally responsible policies that improve
the economy’s long-term growth prospects help reduce the size
of budget deficits over a given period.
(3) The free market, where individuals pursue their own self-
interests, has been responsible for greater advancements in
quality of life and generation of wealth than any other form of
economic system. Federal policies designed to grow the econ-
omy should thus allow market forces to operate unhindered
rather than pick ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers’’.
(b) POLICY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.—It is the policy of this con-
current resolution to pursue policies that embrace the free market
and promote economic growth policies that—
(1) reduce Federal spending;
(2) expand American energy production;
(3) lower taxes that discourage work, savings, and invest-
ment;
(4) deregulate the economy and enact reforms to diminish
bureaucratic red tape; and
(5) eliminate barriers to work so more Americans enter (or
reenter) the job market.
SEC. 4002. POLICY STATEMENT ON MANDATORY SPENDING REDUC-
TION.
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
(1) The United States faces a significant debt crisis, with the
national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, or 123 percent
of GDP.
(2) Since 2019, mandatory spending has increased by 59 per-
cent.
(3) This debt poses a significant risk to the country’s long-
term fiscal sustainability, with implications for future genera-
tions.
(4) Mandatory spending currently accounts for over 70 per-
cent of the entire Federal budget.

(5) The deficit for fiscal year 2025 is projected to be $1.9 tril-
lion, or 6.2 percent of GDP.
(6) This fiscal year, net interest will total $952 billion, or 3.2
percent of GDP.
(b) POLICY ON MANDATORY SPENDING REDUCTION.—It is the goal
of this concurrent resolution to reduce mandatory spending by $2
trillion over the budget window. If the combined deficit reduction
provided by authorizing committees is below this target, it is the
policy of the Committee on the Budget of the House that the in-
struction provided to the Committee on Ways and Means of the
House should be reduced by a commensurate amount to offset the
difference.
SEC. 4003. POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION.
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
(1) Regulations throughout the Federal Government have
been a major issue for decades, continuously growing while
negatively impacting the nation’s economic and fiscal standing.
(2) Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses,
strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market
conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on
taxpayers.
(3) Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory agencies
has increased exponentially since 1960. The total number of
pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has increased
from 22,877 pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today. When com-
pared to 1950, the CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 1950,
making the size of the CFR today 95% larger than it was in

Section 127:
1950.
(b) POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION.—It is
the policy of this concurrent resolution—
(1) that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the
burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;
(2) that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will re-
duce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and in-
crease economic prosperity through deregulation;
(3) to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but to
also reassert the role of Congress; and
(4) to enact legislation through reconciliation that strength-
ens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits future bu-
reaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, such as
the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny
(REINS) Act.
TITLE V—OTHER MATTERS
SEC. 5001. ENFORCEMENT FILING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES.
In the House of Representatives, if a concurrent resolution on the
budget for fiscal year 2025 is adopted without the appointment of
a committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two

House of Representatives amounts for the discretionary adminis-
trative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the
United States Postal Service.
(b) SPECIAL RULE.—In the House of Representatives, for purposes
of enforcing section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974
(2 U.S.C. 633(f)), estimates of the level of total new budget author-
ity and total outlays provided by a measure shall include any dis-
cretionary amounts described in subsection (a).
SEC. 5003. APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS,
AGGREGATES, AND OTHER BUDGETARY LEVELS.
(a) APPLICATION.—Any adjustments of allocations, aggregates,
and other budgetary levels made pursuant to this concurrent reso-
lution shall—
(1) apply while that measure is under consideration;
(2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and
(3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as prac-
ticable.
(b) EFFECT OF CHANGED ALLOCATIONS, AGGREGATES, AND OTHER

etary levels contained in this concurrent resolution.

sistent with such other rules; and
(2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either

INTRODUCTION
Our Nation has reached a breaking point with large and growing
Federal deficits. The gross national debt currently exceeds the
World War II high of 116 percent and is increasingly driven by
higher interest costs. Interest spending more than doubled under
President Biden and currently exceeds spending on national de-
fense. This is a disastrous result of his reckless spending spree,
which ballooned the debt, triggered rampant inflation, and in-
creased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. It’s a per-
ilous path for a nation to spend more to finance its past than to
secure its future. If interest costs continue to spiral out of control,
it will undermine economic stability and global trust in the dollar.
To realize the benefits of pro-growth policies such as tax reform
and regulatory relief, we must root out wasteful, fraudulent, and
unnecessary spending and restore the fiscal health of our country.
True fiscal discipline is the only path forward.
Reconciliation will pave the way to address our country’s immi-
nent national security threats by bolstering our national defense
and securing our southern border. Additionally, we must return to
the pro-growth policies of Trump 1.0, which will launch an era of
unparalleled strength and prosperity. To ensure long-term eco-
nomic strength, we must unleash American innovation, investment,
and job creation. A strong, competitive economy is built on fiscal
discipline and policies that promote entrepreneurship and economic
freedom. By prioritizing growth and responsible spending, we can
restore prosperity and secure a brighter future for our children and
grandchildren.

THE ECONOMY AND ECONOMIC
ASSUMPTIONS
President Biden’s Reckless Spending and Failed Economic
Policies
During President Biden’s time in office, Democrats pursued a
radical agenda and vast expansion of the Federal Government.
Under the guise of COVID relief, Democrats’ unbridled spending
and President Biden’s failed economic policies lit the fuse on an in-
flationary firestorm that resulted in soaring interest rates, a fragile
economy, and a Nation on the precipice of an irreparable debt cri-
sis.
President Biden’s ‘‘Inflation Reduction Act’’ (IRA) tax-and-spend
monstrosity imposed massive tax hikes on job creators, strangled
domestic oil and gas production, unleashed an army of Internal
Revenue Service agents on working families and small businesses,
expanded Obamacare subsidies for wealthy Americans, and handed
out hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy tax breaks.
He enacted policies that paid people more to stay home than to
return to their jobs and waived work requirements for able-bodied
adults—creating a labor shortage and trapping a whole new gen-
eration of Americans in poverty and government dependence.
He unleashed an unprecedented barrage of regulations and exec-
utive actions, adding a record $1.8 trillion in new regulatory costs
on the economy. To put this into perspective, this is over 31⁄
2
times
the regulatory costs added under President Obama ($494 billion)
during his first term in office.1
In addition, President Biden launched a whole-of-government at-
tack on American energy—the lifeblood of our economy, a corner-
stone of our national security, and the blessing of affordable elec-
tricity and gas for families across the country.
All told, his policies resulted in a cost-of-living crisis as prices
have skyrocketed by over 20 percent and real earnings declined by
3.6 percent, the equivalent of more than $8,000 in lost real income
per worker.
Despite numerous opportunities to recognize this somber eco-
nomic reality and reverse course, President Biden repeatedly dou-
bled down on his increased spending and failed economic policies—
forcing Americans to further tighten their belts.
It is within the context of this economic crisis, and the plethora
of other crises of the past four years, that the American people re-

elected President Trump in a landslide victory—resoundingly re-
jecting the policies of the Biden Administration.
The Economic Outlook
While the economic outlook is trending up for Americans, cur-
rently available forecasts inherently assume continuation of failed
Biden-era policies and as such project modest economic outcomes
throughout the decade. The most recent President’s budget, pub-
lished under President Biden, expects average real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 2.1 percent, compared to expected growth
of 1.8 and 2.0 percent by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
and Blue Chip, respectively.
Expectations for inflation and 10-year Treasury yields are rough-
ly identical across forecasters at about 2.2 and 3.8 percent, respec-
tively. A somewhat more noticeable difference exists in projected
short-term rates where CBO projects average 3-month yields of 3.2
percent while the Biden Administration and Blue Chip projected
just 3.0 percent. Yet, a larger difference between forecasters exists
in unemployment projections.
On average, CBO projects an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent
over the decade compared to projections from the Administration
and Blue Chip of 3.8 and 4.1 percent, respectively.
This budget resolution breaks from the status quo of sluggish
growth by supporting fiscal and economic policies that restrain
spending, cut taxes, and reignite the economy.
Economic Assumptions of the Budget Resolution
Economic growth is essential to reining in our deficits and reduc-
ing our Nation’s indebtedness. Growth generates more revenue for
our country, reduces spending by lifting American families out of
poverty and off of government dependence, and allows people to
keep more of their hard-earned money.
To achieve faster economic growth, this budget resolution com-
bines spending restraint with pro-growth policies including:
• Eliminating the regulatory state
• Locking in tax cuts, unlocking opportunities for all
• Restoring the dignity of work
• Unleashing American energy dominance
As a result of these policies, the Committee on the Budget esti-
mates that economic growth will average 2.6 percent over ten
years—generating a substantial $2.6 trillion in deficit reduction.

MACROECONOMIC FEEDBACK EFFECTS
OF PRO-GROWTH POLICIES
Economic growth is one of the major determinants of revenue
and spending levels—and therefore the size of budget deficits over
a given period. For instance, a higher rate of gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) growth can lead to lower projected spending if it trans-
lates into reduced burdens on government safety net programs. It
can also generate higher revenue due to increases in taxable in-
comes. Naturally, such a pattern would cause a reduction in Fed-
eral deficits and debt relative to current law projections. Con-
versely, lower rates of growth can cause the opposite outcomes:
higher rates of spending increases and slower revenue growth.
Federal policies themselves can affect the economy’s potential to
grow, generating positive feedback into budgetary outcomes. Con-
sequently, fiscally responsible policies that improve the economy’s
long-term growth prospects can help reduce the size of budget defi-
cits over a given period.
As noted in the previous section, this budget resolution is based
on an economic forecast that incorporates all of the pro-growth poli-
cies advanced in this budget resolution, including: regulatory re-
form; expanding domestic energy production; building on the suc-
cess of Republican tax reform; eliminating disincentives to work;
and lower spending.
These initiatives are all a departure from the policies embedded
in current law. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
is obligated to produce an economic forecast that assumes an in-
definite extension of current law, including the explosion of deficit
and debt levels over the next decade. This is partly why CBO is
forecasting average real GDP growth of just 1.8 percent over the
next ten years, well below the long-term growth trend of 3.1 per-
cent in the United States.
The Committee on the Budget estimates that under the pro-
growth policies in the fiscal year 2025 budget resolution, real eco-
nomic growth of 2.6 percent can be achieved over the budget win-
dow.

FUNCTION 550: MEDICAID AND OTHER
HEALTH
Function Summary
Function 550 includes all discretionary health programs, the
health insurance marketplace, and Medicaid. This function is bro-
ken into three subfunctions: health care services, health research
and training, and consumer and occupational health and safety.
Health care services comprise the vast majority of Function 550
spending. This covers most direct health care service programs run
by the Federal Government, with the exception of Medicare and
veterans’ health care. The primary component of Function 550 in
terms of spending levels is Medicaid, but this function also includes
the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, Federal employees’
health benefits, spending related to the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act, most programs run by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the Indian Health Service, and oth-
ers. Most of this spending is mandatory in nature.
Health research and training includes activities such as National
Institutes of Health research and some CDC activities. Consumer
and occupational health and safety includes funding for the Food
and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and oth-
ers. Most spending for health research and training and consumer
and occupational health and safety is discretionary in nature.
The center of all health care policy assumed in this budget reso-
lution is the patient. Particularly on the mandatory spending side,
this requires placing the emphasis on real Americans’ health needs.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
In fiscal year 2025, the budget resolution calls for $945.1 billion
in budget authority and $961.2 billion in outlays. Of that total, dis-
cretionary spending totals $90.5 billion in budget authority and
$99.4 billion in outlays, and mandatory spending totals $854.6 bil-
lion in budget authority and $861.8 billion in outlays. The 10-year
totals for budget authority and outlays are $11.3 trillion and $11.2
trillion, respectively.

FUNCTION 570: MEDICARE
Function Summary
Function 570 solely consists of the Medicare health insurance
program. Medicare provides comprehensive health care coverage
for over 65 million individuals who are age 65 or older, who have
a disability that prevents them from working, or who have end
stage renal disease. Medicare’s budget is almost entirely manda-
tory spending, which consists of payments to health care service
providers and private insurers. Medicare’s discretionary budget
funds the administration of the Medicare program through the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other agencies.
Medicare program spending appears in Function 570 of the budg-
et. The function reflects the Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance
Program, Part B Supplementary Medical Insurance Program, Part
C Medicare Advantage Program, and Part D Prescription Drug
Benefit, as well as premiums paid by qualified aged and disabled
beneficiaries. The various parts of the program are financed in dif-
ferent ways.
Part A benefits are financed primarily by a payroll tax, the reve-
nues from which are credited to the Hospital Insurance Trust
Fund. For Part B, premiums paid by beneficiaries cover about one
quarter of outlays, and the Treasury General Fund covers the rest.
Payments to private insurance plans under Part C are financed by
a share of funds from Parts A and B.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
In fiscal year 2025, the budget resolution calls for $950.9 billion
in budget authority and $950.6 billion in outlays. Of that total, dis-
cretionary spending totals $8.4 billion in budget authority and $8.4
billion in outlays, and mandatory spending totals $942.5 billion in
budget authority and $942.2 billion in outlays. The 10-year totals
for budget authority and outlays are $12.8 trillion and $12.8 tril-
lion, respectively.

FUNCTION 650: SOCIAL SECURITY
Function Summary
Function 650 consists of the Social Security program, including
Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) benefits and Disability In-
surance (DI) benefits. Social Security is the largest program in
terms of dollars in the Federal Government’s budget and is almost
entirely mandatory spending.
DI provides income support for almost nine million persons with
disabilities and their families who have not yet reached retirement
age.2 Similar to OASI, DI is funded primarily through payroll tax
revenues.
OASI provides retirement benefits to more than 58 million older
Americans or their surviving spouses and children.3 Benefits for
current recipients are funded primarily through payroll taxes paid
by current workers, and the size of the benefit is based on the
beneficiary’s earning history. The Congressional Budget Office
projects the OASI Trust Fund will be insolvent in 2033.4 The Social
Security Trustees project the OASI Trust Fund will be depleted in
2033, at which time the Fund will only be able to cover 79 percent
of its scheduled benefits.5
The authorizing committee of jurisdiction for Function 650 is the
Committee on Ways and Means. Discretionary funding is provided
by the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
Social Security contains both on-budget and off-budget spend-
ing—the latter consisting of benefit payments for the OASI and DI
programs. In fiscal year 2025, on-budget spending totals $67.3 bil-
lion in budget authority and $67.3 billion in outlays. The 10-year
on-budget totals for budget authority and outlays are $1.0 trillion
and $1.0 trillion, respectively.
For off-budget spending, the budget resolution calls for $1.5 tril-
lion in budget authority and $1.5 trillion in outlays for fiscal year

FUNCTION 900: NET INTEREST
Function Summary
As the Federal Government runs chronic deficits and adds to its
debt, it continues running up interest costs. These payments pro-
vide no benefits and finance no government service or operations.
They are simply excess costs resulting from a history of spending
beyond the government’s means. According to the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO), if government programs are not reformed, net
interest payments are projected to increase from $881 billion in fis-
cal year 2024 to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2034.6 In fiscal year
2024, interest on the debt became the government’s third largest
budget line item, following only Social Security and Medicare.
These costs are reflected in Function 900, which presents the in-
terest paid for the Federal Government’s borrowing minus the in-
terest received by the Federal Government from trust fund invest-
ments and loans to the public. It is a mandatory payment, in the
truest sense of the word, with no policy options and no discre-
tionary components.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
The budget resolution calls for $959.9 billion in mandatory
spending for net interest payments in fiscal year 2025. Over ten
years, interest payments are expected to total $13.1 trillion.
On-budget mandatory spending—or net interest payments unre-
lated to Social Security—totals $1.0 trillion in fiscal year 2025 and
$13.6 trillion over ten years. The on-budget figure is larger than
the Function 900 total because the former is offset by off-budget in-
terest payments to the Social Security Trust Fund. These off-budg-
et payments are presented as negative numbers, as they reflect
money coming into, rather than flowing out of, the U.S. Treasury.
Off-budget mandatory spending is ¥$67.8 billion in fiscal year
2025 and ¥$464.2 billion over ten years.

FUNCTION 920: ALLOWANCES AND
FUNCTION 990: ACROSS-THE-BOARD
ADJUSTMENT
Function Summary
The Allowances and Across-the-Board Adjustment categories rep-
resent placeholders for certain budgetary impacts that the Congres-
sional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to assign to a specific budget
function. In the case of this budget resolution, there are two pre-
sented as Function 920 and 990 in the summary tables. The par-
ticulars of the categories are described below.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
FUNCTION 920
The CBO baseline does not include any projected amounts for
Function 920. Therefore, the budget resolution includes a total of
$0 for budget authority and outlays.
FUNCTION 990
The CBO baseline for Function 990 includes spending of $42 mil-
lion in budget authority and $0 in outlays over ten years. The
budget resolution recommends no changes in this function.

FUNCTION 930: GOVERNMENT–WIDE
SAVINGS
Function Summary
A number of policies assumed in the budget resolution cut across
multiple agencies or functional categories and have government-
wide effects. These are reflected in Function 930. For ease of un-
derstanding, the budget employs this function, Government-Wide
Savings, to describe these assumptions.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
In fiscal year 2025, the budget resolution calls for ¥$120 billion
in budget authority and ¥$120 billion in outlays. Mandatory
spending comprises the entire total in fiscal year 2025 for both
budget authority and outlays. The 10-year totals for budget author-
ity and outlays are ¥$3.7 trillion and ¥$3.0 trillion, respectively.

FUNCTION 950: UNDISTRIBUTED
OFFSETTING RECEIPTS
Function Summary
Offsetting receipts to the Treasury are recorded in this function
as negative budget authority and outlays. These receipts are either
intra-budgetary (a payment from one Federal agency to another,
such as agency payments to the retirement trust funds) or propri-
etary (a payment from the public for some kind of business trans-
action with the Federal Government). The main types of receipts
presented are the payments Federal agencies make to employee re-
tirement and health care funds; payments made by companies for
the right to explore and produce oil and gas on the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf; and payments by those who bid for the right to buy
or use public property or resources, such as the electromagnetic
spectrum. The function also contains an off-budget component that
reflects the Federal Government’s share of Social Security contribu-
tions for Federal employees.
Summary of Committee-Reported Resolution
The budget resolution calls for $127.6 billion in budget authority
and $127.6 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2025. The 10-year totals
for budget authority and outlays are $1.5 trillion and $1.5 trillion,
respectively.

REVENUE AND TAX REFORM
Summary of Revenue Projections
For the purpose of the budget resolution, revenues encompass all
collected tax monies, fees and fines, and customs duties. The budg-
et resolution assumes $4.5 trillion in lower revenues than projected
by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The budget resolution
assumes $4.7 trillion in revenues in fiscal year 2025. The 10-year
total projection for revenues is $60.2 trillion.
If combined reconciliation recommendations from committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit do not achieve at least $2 trillion in
net deficit reduction, then the instruction to the Committee on
Ways and Means would be reduced by a commensurate amount. If
combined reconciliation recommendations from committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit achieve more than $2 trillion in net
deficit reduction, then the instruction to the Committee on Ways
and Means would be increased by a commensurate amount.
This budget resolution provides sufficient room for extension of
expired and expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
2017 (TCJA) and other improvements to the tax code.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The TCJA made sweeping changes to the way tax law impacts
Americans.7 The goal was to advance a bold, pro-growth overhaul
of the Nation’s tax code for the first time in over three decades. In
reality, the TCJA accomplished that and much more, leading to
more jobs, higher productivity, bigger paychecks for American fami-
lies, and a stronger economy.
On the individual income side, the 2017 tax reform lowered indi-
vidual taxes and doubled the standard deduction from $6,500 and
$13,000 to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married cou-
ples, respectively. These two changes enable Americans to keep
more of their hard-earned paychecks. For example, a typical Amer-
ican family earning the median income saw a tax cut of $2,059.8
This is more than $2,000 in the pockets of Americans—money that
eases the strain of inflation on daily home budgeting.
On the business side, the TCJA lowered the corporate tax rate
to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. This was vital to ensure
American headquartered employers could remain internationally
competitive. It enabled businesses to grow and expand by allowing

them to write off immediately the full cost of new equipment. The
TJCA eliminated the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and
modernized the international tax structure. Taken together, these
and other corporate tax reforms have already and will continue to
provide wide-spread relief for job creators, helping expand oppor-
tunity and the American economy in the process.
After the TCJA, American workers enjoyed the fastest wage
growth in a decade. This spread to Americans across the income
distribution, with lower-wage workers experiencing 50 percent
higher wage growth than high-income workers.9 Higher wages lead
to a rapid growth in household income. In just the two years after
enactment of the tax cuts, real median household income rose by
over $5,000.10 In total, TCJA’s pro-growth policies helped con-
tribute to 3.0 percent growth in 2018 and 2.6 percent growth in
2019—well above CBO’s pre-TCJA projections of 2.2 percent and
1.7 percent, respectively.
Advancing Pro-Growth Tax Reform
The Committee on Ways and Means has jurisdiction on revenue
measures.
While the TCJA has proven very successful, several of the law’s
most important provisions are not permanent policy. Much of the
tax relief for families is set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2025.
Vital provisions that removed tax disincentives for business invest-
ment have already expired or are phasing out, including expensing
for capital expenditures (also known as bonus depreciation), ex-
pensing for research and development costs, and deductions for in-
terest expenses.
This budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions allow-
ing the Committee on Ways and Means to work to extend tax cuts
for families and businesses.

THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET: A BRIEF
SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE
PRESIDENT’S FISCAL YEAR 2025 BUDGET REQUEST11
Spending. President Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget would spend
$86.6 trillion, or 24.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) (16
percent above the 50-year average), over ten years. This is the
highest sustained level of spending in American history. Federal
spending would exceed the pre-COVID peacetime record, as a per-
centage of GDP, in every year of the budget. However, defense
spending would fall to the lowest level as a percentage of GDP
since the attack on Pearl Harbor. Annual spending is equivalent to
$66,000 per household.
Deficits. President Biden’s budget proposes deficits of $16.3 tril-
lion, or 4.6 percent of GDP (24 percent above the 50-year average),
over ten years. This is the highest sustained level in American his-
tory. Annual deficits never fall back to pre-COVID levels.
Taxes. President Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget proposes $70.3
trillion, or 19.7 percent of GDP (14 percent above the 50-year aver-
age), over ten years. This is the highest sustained level in Amer-
ican history. By 2031, Federal taxes would be more than a fifth of
GDP, a level previously only reached during the height of World
War II.
Interest Payments on the Debt. President Biden’s fiscal year 2025
budget proposes to spend $12.2 trillion (3.4 percent of GDP) for in-
terest payments on the debt, over the next ten years. This is $2.5
trillion more than spending on national defense over the same pe-
riod. By 2034, interest payments will be more than quadruple such
spending before President Biden took office.

SECTION-BY-SECTION DESCRIPTION
The Fiscal Year 2025 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget es-
tablishes an overall budgetary framework. As required under the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Budget Act), this concurrent res-
olution includes aggregate levels of new budget authority, outlays,
revenues, the amount by which revenues should be changed, the
surplus or deficit, new budget authority and outlays for each major
functional category, debt held by the public, and debt subject to the
statutory limit. This concurrent resolution also sets appropriate
budgetary levels for fiscal years 2026 through 2034.
This concurrent resolution provides reconciliation instructions to
11 authorizing committees in the House of Representatives. This
budget resolution follows the convention of not reconciling Senate
committees and assumes that instructions to Senate authorizing
committees will be incorporated in any final budget agreement. It
is envisioned that the reconciliation process will be used to reduce
mandatory spending by at least $1.5 trillion over ten years in addi-
tion to providing for tax reform, border security, and defense
spending. It also instructs the Committee on Ways and Means to
increase the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion. This concurrent res-
olution also includes rulemaking provisions necessary to enforce
the budget resolution, procedures for adjusting the budget resolu-
tion, and certain policy assumptions underlying the budget resolu-
tion.
Section 1. Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025
Subsection (a) establishes the budget for fiscal year 2025 and
each of the nine ensuing fiscal years, 2026 through 2034, at the
levels that appear subsequently in the resolution, replacing all
prior concurrent resolutions on the budget. Section 301(a) of the
Budget Act requires the budget resolution to establish budgetary
levels for the fiscal year for which such resolution is adopted and
for at least each of the four ensuing fiscal years.
Subsection (b) sets out the table of contents of the budget resolu-
tion.
TITLE I—RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND AMOUNTS
Section 1001. Recommended Levels and Amounts
Section 1001, as required by section 301 of the Budget Act, estab-
lishes the recommended levels for revenues, the amount by which
revenues should be changed, total new budget authority, total out-
lays, surpluses or deficits, debt subject to the statutory limit, and
debt held by the public.

While the revenue level operates as a floor against which all rev-
enue legislation is measured, the recommended levels of new budg-
et authority and outlays serve as a ceiling for spending legislation.
The surplus or deficit levels include only on-budget outlays and
revenue.
Most outlays and receipts related to the Social Security program
and United States Postal Service are not included because both ac-
counts are statutorily off-budget.
Debt subject to the limit reflects the gross Federal debt, but ex-
cludes debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank or by non-Treas-
ury agencies. Debt held by the public is the amount of debt issued
and held by entities or individuals other than the U.S. Government
and includes Treasury debt held by the Federal Reserve system.
Section 1002. Major Functional Categories
Section 1002, as required by section 301(a) of the Budget Act, es-
tablishes the budgetary levels for each major functional category
for fiscal year 2025 and for fiscal years 2026 through 2034.
These major functional categories include:
050 National Defense
150 International Affairs
250 General Science, Space, and Technology
270 Energy
300 Natural Resources and Environment
350 Agriculture
370 Commerce and Housing Credit
400 Transportation
450 Community and Regional Development
500 Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services
550 Health
570 Medicare
600 Income Security
650 Social Security
700 Veterans Benefits and Services
750 Administration of Justice
800 General Government
900 Net Interest
920 Allowances
930 Government-Wide Savings
950 Undistributed Offsetting Receipts
990 Across-the-Board Adjustment
TITLE II—RECONCILIATION AND RELATED MATTERS
Section 2001. Reconciliation in the House of Representatives
Section 2001 sets forth reconciliation instructions to 11 author-
izing committees in the House.
Subsection (a) specifies a deadline of March 27, 2025, for the in-
structed authorizing committees, pursuant to section 310 of the
Budget Act, to submit changes in laws within their jurisdictions
achieving specified amounts of savings or spending to the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the House.

structure.
Committee on Ways and Means .............. increase the deficit by no more than $4.5
trillion
Reconciliation instructions to reduce the deficit act as a floor on
the required amount of savings for each committee receiving this
type of instruction is required to achieve. These targets are for the
total of the 10-fiscal-year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit act as a ceiling
on the amount of spending that each committee receiving this type
of instruction can spend. These targets are for the total of the 10-
fiscal-year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Subsection (c) instructs the Committee on Ways and Means to
submit changes in laws within its jurisdiction that increase the
statutory debt limit by $4 trillion for the period of fiscal years 2025
through 2034.
A central tenant of the budget reconciliation process is that the
authorizing committees determine their own policies as long as
they meet their reconciliation targets. Therefore, the authorizing
committees can meet the reconciled amounts with any combination
of policies within their jurisdiction that achieve the required
amount of deficit reduction or increase in the deficit, as applicable.
All reconciled committees are required to mark up legislation
that meets their reconciliation target and transmit the legislation
to the Committee on the Budget rather than reporting the legisla-
tion to the House.
Other than transmitting their legislation to the Committee on
the Budget, the authorizing committees are expected to follow reg-
ular order in complying with the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives and Committee rules regarding markup procedures and re-
porting requirements.
The Committee on the Budget will then combine all the submis-
sions and report the bill to the House. Under section 310(b) of the
Budget Act, the Committee on the Budget must report the author-
izing committee’s submissions without substantive revision.

TITLE III—RESERVE FUND
Section 3001. Reserve Fund for Reconciliation Legislation
Subsection (a) permits the Chair of the House Committee on the
Budget to adjust the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate
levels in the budget resolution for reconciliation legislation consid-
ered pursuant to section 2001 by the necessary amounts to accom-
modate the budgetary effects of the legislation if the budgetary ef-
fects of the legislation comply with the reconciliation instructions
under this concurrent resolution.
Subsection (b) stipulates that for purposes of this section compli-
ance with the reconciliation instructions under this concurrent res-
olution shall be determined by the Chair of the House Committee
on the Budget.
Section 3002. Adjustment for Spending Cuts of At Least $2.5 Tril-
lion
Section 3002 motivates the 11 authorizing committees instructed
to reduce the deficit under title II of this concurrent resolution to
achieve $2 trillion in total deficit reduction over the period of fiscal
years 2025 through 2034.
Subsection (a) stipulates that if $2 trillion in total deficit reduc-
tion over the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 is not
achieved by the 11 authorizing committees instructed to reduce the
deficit under title II of this concurrent resolution then the Chair of
the House Committee on the Budget is required to reduce the rec-
onciliation instruction for the Committee on Ways and Means
under section 2001(b)(11) of this concurrent resolution, the alloca-
tions to the Committee on Ways and Means, the aggregate levels
of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, and other appropriate
levels in the budget resolution by an amount that is equal to the
difference between $2 trillion and the total dollar amount of the
reconciliation recommendations submitted by the committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit.
Subsection (b) stipulates that if at least $2 trillion in total deficit
reduction over the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 is
achieved by the 11 authorizing committees instructed to reduce the
deficit under title II of this concurrent resolution then the Chair of
the House Committee on the Budget is required to increase the rec-
onciliation instruction for the Committee on Ways and Means
under section 2001(b)(11) of this concurrent resolution, the alloca-
tions to the Committee on Ways and Means, the aggregate levels
of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, and other appropriate
levels in the budget resolution by an amount that is equal to the
difference between $2 trillion and the total dollar amount of the
reconciliation recommendations submitted by the committees in-
structed to reduce the deficit.
Subsection (c) stipulates that no adjustment under section 3002
may be made unless the Chair of the House Committee on the
Budget, using cost estimates provided by the Congressional Budget
Office and Joint Committee on Taxation (as applicable), certifies in
writing that the applicable reconciliation recommendations either:
(1) do not achieve net deficit reduction of at least $2 trillion over
the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 pursuant to subsection

(a); or (2) achieve net deficit reduction of at least $2 trillion over
the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034 pursuant to subsection
(b).
Subsection (d) states that the dollar amount resulting from any
adjustment made under section 3002 to the reconciliation instruc-
tions for the Committee on Ways and Means under subsection
2001(b)(11) shall be substituted for $4.5 trillion and shall be
deemed to be the reconciliation instructions for the Committee on
Ways and Means. Subsection (d) also states that any recommenda-
tions on changes in laws within the jurisdiction of the Committee
shall be consistent with the goals of this concurrent resolution, in-
cluding spending reduction, tax policy changes, reforms, or other
measures deemed appropriate by the Chair of the House Com-
mittee on the Budget.
Subsection (e) states that any reconciliation instructions receiv-
ing an adjustment under section 3002 of this concurrent resolution
shall not be considered in violation of the budgetary levels estab-
lished by this concurrent resolution.
TITLE IV—POLICY STATEMENTS
Section 4001. Policy Statement on Economic Growth
Subsection (a) sets out findings.
Subsection (b) states it is the policy of this concurrent resolution
to pursue policies that embrace the free market and promote eco-
nomic growth policies that reduce Federal spending; expand Amer-
ican energy production; lower taxes that discourage work, savings,
and investment; deregulate the economy and enact reforms to di-
minish bureaucratic red tape; and eliminate barriers to work so
more Americans enter (or reenter) the job market.
Section 4002. Policy Statement on Mandatory Spending Reduction
Subsection (a) sets out findings.
Subsection (b) states it is the goal of this concurrent resolution
to reduce mandatory spending by $2 trillion over the budget win-
dow and if the combined deficit reduction provided by the author-
izing committees through the reconciliation process is below this
target then it is the policy of the House Committee on the Budget
that the reconciliation instruction provided to the Committee on
Ways and Means should be reduced by a commensurate amount to
offset the difference.
Section 4003. Policy Statement on Government Deregulation
Subsection (a) sets out findings.
Subsection (b) states it is the policy of this concurrent resolution:
that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the burdens of
overregulation throughout the Federal Government; that Congress
is ready to promote initiatives that will reduce government bu-
reaucracy, enhance Federalism, and increase economic prosperity
through deregulation; and to enact legislation through the rec-
onciliation process that strengthens Congress, scales back Federal
regulations, limits future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes eco-
nomic growth such as the Regulations from the Executive in Need
of Scrutiny (REINS) Act.

TITLE V—OTHER MATTERS
Section 5001. Enforcement Filing in the House of Representatives
Section 5001 requires, if the Fiscal Year 2025 Concurrent Resolu-
tion on the Budget is agreed to by the House of Representatives
and the Senate without the appointment of a committee of con-
ference, the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget to submit
for printing in the Congressional Record a statement that includes
an allocation for the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year
2025 consistent with the budget resolution and allocations for all
authorizing committees, consistent with the budget resolution, for
fiscal year 2025 and for the period of fiscal years 2025 through
2034.
Section 5002. Budgetary Treatment of Administrative Expenses in
the House of Representatives
Subsection (a) provides that the administrative expenses of the
Social Security Administration and the United States Postal Serv-
ice are reflected in the allocation to the Committee on Appropria-
tions even though both are technically off-budget. This language is
necessary to ensure the Committee on Appropriations retains con-
trol over administrative expenses for these agencies through the
annual appropriations process. This budgetary treatment is based
on the long-term practice of the House and Senate Committees on
the Budget.
Subsection (b) requires administrative expenses to be included in
the cost estimates for the relevant appropriation measure, which
are used to determine if a measure exceeds the budget resolution’s
spending limits.
Section 5003. Application and Effect of Changes in Allocations, Ag-
gregates, and Other Budgetary Levels
Subsection (a) specifies the procedure for adjusting the levels es-
tablished by the budget resolution under the reserve fund and
other special procedures in this concurrent resolution. It provides
that the adjustments apply while the legislation is under consider-
ation and take effect upon enactment of the legislation. The Chair
of the House Committee on the Budget must submit any adjust-
ments to the budget resolution for printing in the Congressional
Record.
Subsection (b) clarifies that the adjusted levels in the budget res-
olution are fully enforceable under the Budget Act and other budg-
et rules.
Subsection (c) stipulates that the Chair of the House Committee
on the Budget is the ultimate arbiter of the cost estimates for legis-
lation used to enforce the budget resolution and budget rules.
Subsection (d) clarifies that legislation for which an adjustment
to the budget resolution is made, such as those in the reserve fund
in title III, is not subject to the point of order set forth in clause
10 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House Representatives, com-
monly referred to as the House Cut-As-You-Go rule.

Section 5004. Adjustments to Reflect Changes in Concepts and Defi-
nitions in the House of Representatives
Section 5004 authorizes the Chair of the House Committee on
the Budget to adjust the appropriate budgetary levels of this con-
current resolution for any change in budgetary concepts and defini-
tions in accordance with section 251(b)(1) of the Balanced Budget
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
Section 5005. Adjustment for Changes in the Baseline
Section 5005 authorizes the Chair of the House Committee on
the Budget to adjust the applicable budgetary levels in this concur-
rent resolution to reflect changes from the Congressional Budget
Office’s updates to its baseline for fiscal years 2025 to 2034.
Section 5006. Exercise of Rulemaking Powers
Section 5006 affirms the adoption of this concurrent resolution is
an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate and that the House of Representatives and
the Senate have the constitutional right to change these rules.

RECONCILIATION
Section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C.
641) (Budget Act) sets out a special procedure that allows a concur-
rent resolution on the budget to direct one or more authorizing
committees to produce legislation that changes direct spending,
revenue, or the debt limit to bring these levels into compliance with
budget resolution policies. Reconciliation instructions must be in-
cluded in a concurrent resolution on the budget adopted by both
the House of Representatives and the Senate to be valid.
In general, reconciliation instructions include the amount of
budgetary change to be achieved; the time period over which such
budgetary change should be measured; and a deadline for the au-
thorizing committees to report legislation. When more than one au-
thorizing committee receives reconciliation instructions, each com-
mittee considers a bill to comply with these instructions as it would
any other bill, but the legislative text and other materials are sub-
mitted to the Committee on the Budget instead of being reported
to the House of Representatives. The Committee on the Budget
then incorporates all submissions together, without any sub-
stantive revision, into a single bill and reports it to the House of
Representatives. If only one authorizing committee receives rec-
onciliation instructions, then that committee’s bill is reported di-
rectly to the House of Representatives and is not submitted to the
Committee on the Budget.
In the House of Representatives, the Committee on Rules reports
a special rule governing the consideration of a reconciliation bill.
Typically, the rule will allow for 2 or 3 hours of general debate
equally divided. The Committee on the Budget determines whether
an authorizing committee is in compliance with its reconciliation
instructions. Under section 310 of the Budget Act, authorizing com-
mittees must comply with reconciliation instructions. If an author-
izing committee does not comply with its instructions, the Com-
mittee on Rules may make in order amendments that achieve the
required budgetary changes pursuant to section 310(d)(5) of the
Budget Act.
A reconciliation bill is a privileged measure in the Senate. Dis-
tinct from most Senate bills, debate is limited to 20 hours and only
requires a simple majority to pass (51 votes) rather than the 60
votes otherwise required for cloture. In the Senate, the ‘‘Byrd Rule’’
(section 313 of the Budget Act) limits the content of a reconciliation
bill. The Byrd Rule prohibits the consideration of extraneous provi-
sions in a reconciliation bill. If a provision is found to violate the
Byrd Rule, it is removed from the bill or conference report unless
60 Senators vote to waive it.

This Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025,
as reported by the Committee on the Budget, provides for such rec-
onciliation legislation. It includes reconciliation instructions to 11
authorizing committees in the House of Representatives. The rec-
onciliation instructions included in the Concurrent Resolution on
the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025 create a process to reduce manda-
tory spending by at least $1.5 trillion over ten years. The reconcili-
ation instructions also provide for tax reform, border security, and
defense spending. The Committee on Ways and Means is also in-
structed to increase the debt limit by $4 trillion. Each authorizing
committee must submit legislative text and associated material to
the Committee on the Budget by March 27, 2025.
For a detailed description of the reconciliation instructions in-
cluded in this concurrent resolution on the budget, see title II of
the Section-by-Section Description.

THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
PROCESS
The budget resolution’s spending levels are implemented through
allocations to the Committee on Appropriations and authorizing
committees.
As required under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act
of 1974 (Budget Act), the budget resolution’s discretionary spending
levels are allocated to the Committee on Appropriations of each
House of Congress and the budget resolution’s direct spending lev-
els are allocated to each authorizing committee in the House of
Representatives and the Senate. These allocations are included in
the report accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget
and are enforced through points of order (see the section of this re-
port titled: ‘‘Enforcing Budgetary Levels’’).
Section 302 of the Budget Act requires the budget resolution to
provide allocations of budget authority for the first fiscal year and
at least the four ensuing fiscal years (except for the Committee on
Appropriations, which receives an allocation only for the budget
year). This report provides allocations of budget authority and out-
lays for the Committee on Appropriations for the budget year (fis-
cal year 2025) and allocations of budget authority and outlays for
authorizing committees for the budget year (fiscal year 2025) and
the 10-year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Committee on Appropriations—302(a) and 302(b) Allocations
302(a) Allocation. The Committee on Appropriations receives a
lump sum of discretionary budget authority and corresponding out-
lays. It is included in the report accompanying a concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget for the fiscal year for which the budget resolu-
tion is adopted. This allocation operates as a ceiling on the amount
of discretionary budget authority that can be appropriated for that
fiscal year. This budget resolution provides a 302(a) allocation to
the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2025.
302(b) Allocations. Once a 302(a) allocation is provided, the Com-
mittee on Appropriations is then required, in full committee, to di-
vide this allocation among its 12 subcommittees. The amount each
subcommittee receives constitutes its suballocation under section
302(b) of the Budget Act. Each subcommittee’s regular appropria-
tions bill is capped at the level of its 302(b) suballocation and the
bill is subject to a point of order if it exceeds this amount. Under
section 302(c) of the Budget Act, once the Committee on Appropria-
tions receives its 302(a) allocation appropriations bills may not be
considered on the floor of the House of Representatives until the
(87)

88
Committee on Appropriations provides 302(b) suballocations to its
subcommittees.
Authorizing Committees—302(a) Allocations
The report accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget
allocates to each authorizing committee an amount of new budget
authority and corresponding outlays required to accommodate the
direct spending (i.e., mandatory spending) within each authorizing
committee’s jurisdiction. If the budget resolution assumes increases
in direct spending for new or expanded programs with no offsetting
reductions in direct spending, additional budget authority may be
allocated to authorizing committees. Conversely, the allocation may
reflect negative budget authority (relative to the projected current
baseline) if the budget resolution assumes the enactment of legisla-
tion reducing direct spending.
Because the spending authority for these direct spending pro-
grams is multi-year or permanent, the allocations to the author-
izing committees cover both the budget year and the entire period
of the budget resolution. This budget resolution provides alloca-
tions for authorizing committees for fiscal year 2025 and for the 10-
year period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Each authorizing committee is provided a single allocation of new
budget authority reflective of the fiscal effects of expected policy ac-
tion relative to current law. These committees are not required to
file 302(b) suballocations. Bills first effective in fiscal year 2025 are
measured against the level for that year included in the fiscal year
2025 budget resolution and the 10-year period of fiscal years 2025
through 2034.

ENFORCING BUDGETARY LEVELS
The congressional budget process includes various mechanisms to
enforce the budget resolution, including provisions of the budget
resolution, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Budget Act), and
the Rules and Separate Orders of the House of Representatives.
The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget
The budget resolution establishes overall limits on spending and
revenue. The report accompanying the budget resolution contains
allocations to congressional committees that are binding on Con-
gress when it considers subsequent spending and tax legislation.
Legislation breaching the levels set forth in the budget resolution
is subject to points of order on the floor of the House of Representa-
tives. The budget resolution is established pursuant to the Budget
Act, which includes various requirements regarding its content and
enforcement. In addition to setting levels of spending, revenue,
deficits, and debt, the budget resolution may also include special
procedures to execute and enforce congressional budgetary deci-
sions.
The levels established in the budget resolution are not self-en-
forcing. Members must raise a point of order against legislation
that breaches the budget resolution’s allocations and aggregate lev-
els. If a point of order is sustained, then the House of Representa-
tives is precluded from further consideration of the measure. Some
of the points of order in the Budget Act and budget-related provi-
sions in the Rules of the House of Representatives are listed below.
Budget Act
Section 302(f). Section 302(f) of the Budget Act prohibits the con-
sideration of legislation that exceeds a committee’s allocation of
budget authority. For authorizing committees, this section applies
to the first fiscal year and the period of fiscal years covered by the
budget resolution. For appropriations bills, however, it applies only
to the first fiscal year.
Section 303. Section 303 prohibits the consideration of spending
and revenue legislation before the House of Representatives has
passed a budget resolution for a particular fiscal year. Legislation
that changes revenue or increases budget authority in a fiscal year
for which a budget resolution has not been agreed to violates sec-
tion 303(a). Section 303(a) does not apply to budget authority and
revenue provisions first effective in a year following the first fiscal
year to which a budget resolution applies or to appropriations bills
after May 15.

94
Section 311. Section 311 prohibits the consideration of legislation
that would exceed the budget resolution’s overall limits on budget
authority and outlays or cause revenue levels to fall below the rev-
enue floor established by the budget resolution. If legislation
causes the aggregate spending levels of budget authority or outlays
to be exceeded in the first fiscal year of the budget resolution, then
the legislation violates section 311. Legislation also violates section
311 if it causes revenue to be lower than the revenue floor in the
first fiscal year or the period of fiscal years covered by the budget
resolution. Section 311 does not apply to legislation that provides
budget authority but does not exceed a committee’s 302(a) alloca-
tion.
Section 314(f). Section 314(f) prohibits the consideration of legis-
lation that causes the statutory spending limits established in sec-
tion 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 to be exceeded.
Budget-Related Provisions Under the Rules of the House of
Representatives
Rule XIII, Clause 8. This clause requires, to the extent prac-
ticable, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation to incorporate the macroeconomic effects of
major legislation into official cost estimates.
Rule XXI, Clause 10. This clause prohibits the consideration of
legislation that increases net direct spending over two time periods:
(1) the current year, the budget year, and the four fiscal years fol-
lowing that budget year; or (2) the current year, the budget year,
and the nine fiscal years following that budget year. Any increase
in net direct spending in either of these time periods must be offset
by a corresponding reduction in net direct spending. If an amend-
ment offered to a measure increases direct spending in either of
these time periods, then the amendment must also reduce direct
spending by at least the same amount. This rule is commonly re-
ferred to as Cut-As-You-Go.
Rule XXIX, Clause 4. This clause specifies that the Chair of the
Committee on the Budget is responsible for providing authoritative
guidance regarding the budgetary impact of a legislative propo-
sition, including levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct
spending, new entitlement authority, and revenues.
Section 3, Separate Orders, House Resolution 5 (119th Congress).
House Resolution 5 adopted the rules from the 118th Congress,
with amendments to the standing rules, as the Rules of the House
of Representatives for the 119th Congress and included additional
provisions related to the budget process.
Section 3(c)(1) requires CBO, to the extent practicable, to prepare
an estimate of whether a measure reported by a committee (other
than the Committee on Appropriations), or any amendment or con-
ference report, would cause a net increase in direct spending in ex-
cess of $2.5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal-year peri-
ods beginning with the first fiscal year occurring ten fiscal years
after the current fiscal year. It also establishes a point of order
against consideration of any bill or joint resolution reported by a
committee, or any amendment or conference report, that causes a
net increase in direct spending in excess of $2.5 billion in any of

the four consecutive 10-fiscal-year periods described above. For
purposes of section 3(c)(1), the levels of any net increase in direct
spending shall be determined on the basis of estimates provided by
the Chair of the Committee on the Budget.
Section 3(c)(3) requires CBO, to the extent practicable, to provide
an estimate of the inflationary impacts of any legislation that
shows changes in direct spending causing a gross budgetary effect
in any fiscal year over a 10-year period equal to or greater than
0.25 percent of the projected gross domestic product (GDP) (meas-
ured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) for
the current fiscal year. The Chair of the Committee on the Budget
may also request such an estimate.
Section 3(e)(4) requires CBO, to the extent practicable, for any
estimate of legislation that impacts the Federal Hospital Insurance
Trust Fund or the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
Trust Funds (OASDI) that in any fiscal year over a 10-year period
causes a gross budgetary effect equal to or greater than 0.25 per-
cent of projected GDP (measured by the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers) for the current fiscal year to display: (1) the

OTHER MATTERS UNDER THE RULES
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Committee on the Budget Oversight Findings and
Recommendations
Clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives requires each committee report to contain oversight findings
and recommendations pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X. The
Committee on the Budget has no findings to report at this time.
New Budget Authority, Entitlement Authority, and Tax
Expenditures
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives provides that committee reports must contain the statement
required by section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
This report does not contain such a statement because, as a concur-
rent resolution setting forth a blueprint for the congressional budg-
et, the budget resolution does not provide new budget authority,
new entitlement authority, or changes revenues.
General Performance Goals and Objectives
Clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives requires each committee report on a legislative measure to
contain a statement of general performance goals and objectives,
including outcome-related goals and objectives, for which the meas-
ure authorizes funding. The Committee on the Budget has no such
goals and objectives to report at this time.
Views of Committee Members
Clause 2(l) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires each committee to afford members of the committee
two days to file minority, additional, dissenting, or supplemental
views on reported legislative measures, and to include the views in
the report accompanying such legislation. The following views were
submitted:

MINORITY VIEWS
FY 2025 Republican Economic Plan to Betray
the Middle Class
There have been areas where we have worked hard and achieved
common ground with our Republican colleagues, but sadly, this
budget is not one of them. This plan is a Republican betrayal of
the middle class. It does not support hardworking Americans, it
undermines them. Instead of investing in working families, House
Republicans have crafted a plan that takes from working Ameri-
cans to give to their billionaire donors.
This budget rips healthcare away from millions while handing
out $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, the overwhelming majority of which
go to billionaires and wealthy corporations. It slashes at least $230
billion from food assistance programs, at a time when grocery
prices remain at record highs. It proposes at least $880 billion in
cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. About 20 million
Americans rely on the ACA, and more than 72 million people rely
on Medicaid. That includes children, seniors and individuals with
disabilities.
Worse yet, these cuts are proposed so Republicans can give bil-
lionaires an even bigger tax cut, that they don’t need, and the
hardworking people in this country can’t afford that. Donald
Trump promised to lower costs but has obviously broken that
promise. But he is keeping another promise: Donald Trump and
Republicans are keeping their word when it comes to billionaires.
As he said to his billionaire donors gathered at Mar-a-Lago, ‘‘you’re
rich as hell, we’re going to give you tax cuts.’’ This Republican plan
makes good on that Trump promise at Mar-a-Lago.
The hypocrisy here is staggering. When there’s a Democrat in the
White House, our friends on the other side of the aisle are con-
stantly bemoaning the size of the national debt. But when Repub-
licans control the House, the Senate and the White House, where
is their debt reduction plan? It’s certainly not here. In fact, they
increase the national debt by four trillion dollars.
We will not stand by on this side of the aisle as Republicans un-
dermine working Americans. Democrats will fight back. We’re in
the minority, but we’re not going to give up. We will do everything
we can to educate the American people on what is in this budget
and why it is so bad for them and their families. We will not stand
by while Republicans undermine working families to put billion-
aires first.
Democrats offered more than 30 amendments to protect working
families, seniors, children and people with disabilities, but Repub-

licans opposed every single one. We offered amendments to stop
Republicans from making working Americans foot the bill for yet
another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. We offered amend-
ments rejecting cuts to Medicaid, lowering drug prices, and pro-
tecting the Affordable Care Act. We offered amendments to safe-
guard veterans, defend education, and lower costs on food and en-
ergy. We offered amendments to fight climate change and protect
federal agencies and workers. We gave Republicans the chance to
commit to protecting Social Security and Medicare. We fought for
child care, affordable insulin, school lunch, and Meals on Wheels.
We sought to preserve the important work at the Department of
Education, the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment, the National Institutes of Health, and the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau. Our amendments committed to shielding
taxpayers and their data. But Republicans refused all of our
amendments.
We reject this Republican rip off, and the Republican betrayal of
the middle class of this country.

TITLE IV—POLICY STATEMENTS
SEC. 4001. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
(1) The rate of economic growth has a significant impact on
budget deficits. When the rate of gross domestic product (GDP)
increases, projected revenue grows with it and deficits decline.
Conversely, slower GDP growth can lead to lagging revenues
and mounting deficits.
(2) Federal policies affect the economy’s potential to grow
and impact economic performance, influencing budgetary out-
comes. Consequently, fiscally responsible policies that improve
the economy’s long-term growth prospects help reduce the size
of budget deficits over a given period.
(3) The free market, where individuals pursue their own self-
interests, has been responsible for greater advancements in
quality of life and generation of wealth than any other form of
economic system. Federal policies designed to grow the econ-
omy should thus allow market forces to operate unhindered
rather than pick ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers’’.
(b) POLICY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.—It is the policy of this con-
current resolution to pursue policies that embrace the free market
and promote economic growth policies that—
(1) reduce Federal spending;
(2) expand American energy production;
(3) lower taxes that discourage work, savings, and invest-
ment;
(4) deregulate the economy and enact reforms to diminish
bureaucratic red tape; and
(5) eliminate barriers to work so more Americans enter (or
reenter) the job market.
SEC. 4002. POLICY STATEMENT ON MANDATORY SPENDING REDUC-
TION.
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
(1) The United States faces a significant debt crisis, with the
national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, or 123 percent
of GDP.
(2) Since 2019, mandatory spending has increased by 59 per-
cent.
(3) This debt poses a significant risk to the country’s long-
term fiscal sustainability, with implications for future genera-
tions.
(4) Mandatory spending currently accounts for over 70 per-
cent of the entire Federal budget.

(5) The deficit for fiscal year 2025 is projected to be $1.9 tril-
lion, or 6.2 percent of GDP.
(6) This fiscal year, net interest will total $952 billion, or 3.2
percent of GDP.
(b) POLICY ON MANDATORY SPENDING REDUCTION.—It is the goal
of this concurrent resolution to reduce mandatory spending by $2
trillion over the budget window. If the combined deficit reduction
provided by authorizing committees is below this target, it is the
policy of the Committee on the Budget of the House that the in-
struction provided to the Committee on Ways and Means of the
House should be reduced by a commensurate amount to offset the
difference.
SEC. 4003. POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION.
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
(1) Regulations throughout the Federal Government have
been a major issue for decades, continuously growing while
negatively impacting the nation’s economic and fiscal standing.
(2) Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses,
strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market
conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on
taxpayers.
(3) Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory agencies
has increased exponentially since 1960. The total number of
pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has increased
from 22,877 pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today. When com-
pared to 1950, the CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 1950,
making the size of the CFR today 95% larger than it was in
1950.
(b) POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION.—It is
the policy of this concurrent resolution—
(1) that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the
burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;
(2) that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will re-
duce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and in-
crease economic prosperity through deregulation;
(3) to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but to
also reassert the role of Congress; and
(4) to enact legislation through reconciliation that strength-
ens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits future bu-
reaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, such as
the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny
(REINS) Act.
