Thomas H. Kean (R–NJ), Ro Khanna (D–CA), and Kathy Castor
(D–FL) on January 31, 2025. It requires the Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) to publish a list on its website of entities
holding Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authoriza-
tions, licenses, or grants of authority and that have ties to foreign
adversaries.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Foreign adversaries of the United States pose a significant threat
to American communications networks. These adversary govern-
ments, and the untrusted vendors affiliated with them, could use
their presence in U.S. communications networks to ‘‘provide [an]
intelligence advantage’’ and to ‘‘harm American national security
and the privacy of Americans.’’1
Congress has taken steps to address this threat. In 2020, Con-
gress enacted the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks
Act to remove communications equipment and services from
untrusted vendors, such as Huawei and ZTE, from U.S. commu-
nications networks.2 The following year, Congress passed the Se-
cure Equipment Act to prohibit the FCC from authorizing commu-
nications equipment from untrusted vendors.3
Removing untrusted communications equipment and services
from U.S. communications networks is an important first step, but
adversaries and their affiliates also can be present in these net-
works in other ways. Their direct and indirect holding of licenses,
authorizations, and other authorities granted by the FCC, such as
spectrum licenses and cable landing licenses, allow these entities
to legally access and use American communications networks.4
Given the threat, transparency on whether an entity with ties to
a foreign adversary holds licenses, authorizations, or other authori-
ties granted by the FCC would assist the public, particularly the
communications industry, in assessing potential security risks as-
sociated with partnerships or transactions involving those entities.
Moreover, this transparency will allow other government stake-
holders to better identify national security threats posed by these
entities, which can be used to further strengthen communications
networks in the United States.
COMMITTEE ACTION
On January 11, 2024, the Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology held a hearing entitled, ‘‘Safeguarding Americans’ Com-

• Tobin Richardson, President and CEO, Connectivity
Standards Alliance;
• Clete Johnson, Senior Fellow, Center for Strategic and
International Studies; and

ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section would designate that the short title may be cited as
the ‘‘Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency Act.’’
Section 2. List of entities holding FCC authorizations, licenses, or
other grants of authority and having certain foreign ownership
Subsection (a) would direct the FCC to publish, within 120 days
of enactment, a list of entities that hold a license issued by the
Commission pursuant to:
• Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47
U.S.C. 309(j)); or
• The Act of May 27, 1921 (47 U.S.C. 34 et seq., commonly
known as the ‘‘Cable Landing Licensing Act’’) and Executive
Order 10530 (3 U.S.C. 301 note, relating to the performance of
certain functions vested in or subject to the approval of the
President);
and where:
• A covered entity holds an equity or voting interest in the
entity that must be reported to the Commission under its own-
ership rules; or
• An appropriate national security agency has determined
that a covered entity exerts control over the entity, regardless
of whether such covered entity holds an equity or voting inter-
est that must be reported to the FCC under its ownership
rules.
A covered entity is defined as the government of a covered coun-
try, which is defined as China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia; an
entity organized under the laws of a covered country; and a sub-
sidiary or affiliate of an entity organized under the laws of a cov-
ered country, regardless of where the subsidiary or affiliate is orga-
nized.
Subsection (b) would direct the FCC to, within 18 months of en-
actment, issue rules to identify entities holding any authorization,
license, or other grant of authority issued by the Commission (other
than those described in subsection (a)) and where a covered entity
holds an equity or voting interest in the entities that is required
to be reported to the Commission under its ownership rules. It is
the Committee’s intent that these rules should not be duplicative
of other reporting obligations and that the Commission should seek
to minimize the burden imposed on entities subject to these rules.
Not later than one year after these rules are issued, the Commis-
sion would be required to add the relevant entities to the list re-
quired under subsection (a).

the entities added by the process set forth subsection (b).
