PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3657, the ‘‘Hydropower Licensing Transparency Act’’, was
introduced by Representative Schrier (D–WA) on May 29, 2025.
The legislation would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission to report periodically to Congress on the status of licensing
and relicensing applications for hydropower dams.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Hydropower is one of the world’s oldest energy sources and con-
tinues to play an important role for our nation’s energy supply, pro-
viding power to approximately 30 million homes and businesses
across the United States.1 Additionally, hydropower accounts for 40
percent of the nation’s black start capacity for grid recovery fol-
lowing a major disruption.2

Hydropower regulation, the oldest area of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) jurisdiction, first began with the
Federal Power Commission’s regulation of non-federal hydroelectric
generation in 1920. In 1977, Congress passed the Department of
Energy (DOE) Organization Act, creating the FERC within the
newly formed DOE to take over duties previously administered by
the Federal Power Commission.3 This included the regulation of
the construction and operation of non-federal hydropower projects.
Pursuant to Part I of the Federal Power Act,4 the FERC regu-
lates over 1,600 non-federal hydropower projects at over 2,500
dams, representing about 57 gigawatts of hydropower capacity. In
total, federal and non-federal hydropower capacity makes up ap-
proximately six percent of overall U.S. electric generation.5
The permitting of hydropower projects is essential to ensure
projects comply with statutory requirements and address stake-
holder priorities. Non-federal hydropower projects must be licensed
by the FERC if they are located on a navigable waterway, occupy
federal land, use surplus water or water power from a federal dam,
or are located on non-navigable waters which Congress has juris-
diction under the Commerce Clause, involve post-1955 construc-
tion, and affect interstate or foreign commerce.6
For non-federal hydropower projects, the FERC serves as the
lead agency for documentation required under the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act (NEPA). Over time, the regulatory structure
has changed to include multiple permits and requirements by sev-
eral bodies including, the FERC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers, land management agencies, resource agencies, and tribes.7
This regulatory morass has resulted in lengthy, complex, and
opaque timelines.
FERC-issued hydropower licenses may be valid for a period of 30
to 50 years.8 However, 40 years is now the default license length
for most projects under the Commission’s jurisdiction.9 The average
permitting length of an original license process spans from 5 to 7
years, and the average relicensing process takes 7 to 10 years.10
The average age of a hydropower facility in the United States is
approximately 60 years old.11 Therefore, hundreds of projects, rep-
resenting at least 16 gigawatts of power, will be required to go
through the FERC’s relicensing process in the next ten years. In
fact, the FERC itself estimates that by 2034, over 400 projects, ac-
counting for approximately 40 percent of the Commission’s cur-
rently licensed projects and approximately 15 percent of currently
licensed capacity, will begin the pre-filing stages of the relicensing

process.12 Additionally, as energy demand is projected to grow sub-
stantially over the next decade, new projects will go through the
original licensing process to bring new power generating dams on-
line.
H.R. 3657, introduced by Representative Kim Schrier (D–WA)
and Representative Russ Fulcher (R–ID), would require an annual
report from the FERC to Congress detailing the status of projects
that have filed a notice of intent to go through the licensing and
relicensing process. This legislation would better inform Congress
regarding the status of applications, while highlighting obstacles to
the efficient permitting and ultimate deployment of non-federal hy-
dropower projects.
