SECURING SEMICONDUCTOR SUPPLY CHAINS ACT
MAY6, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 97]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 97) to require SelectUSA to coordi-
nate with State-level economic development organizations to in-
crease foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related manufac-
turing and production, having considered the same, reports favor-
ably thereon without amendment and recommends that the bill
does pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
This bill would direct the SelectUSA program to coordinate with
State-level economic development organizations to develop rec-
ommendations that increase foreign direct investment in semicon-
ductor-related manufacturing, production, and supply chains in the
United States.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Semiconductors—also referred to as integrated circuits or chips—
are essential components of numerous goods and services, such as
artificial intelligence, cars, smartphones, computers, aviation, wire-
less communication, defense systems, and more. A worldwide short-
age of semiconductors was driven by the COVID–19 pandemic,
which exposed vulnerabilities in U.S. supply chains to acquire and
produce these critical chips that support our economy and national
security.

In 2011, the SelectUSA program was established at the Depart-
ment of Commerce. SelectUSA is designed to increase job-creating
business investments in the United States. It encourages foreign
businesses, including American businesses located abroad, to invest
in the domestic economy. SelectUSA also provides market research
and counseling services, and coordinates with State-level economic
development organizations.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 97 would do the following:
• Direct SelectUSA to coordinate with State-level economic de-
velopment organizations regarding Federal efforts to increase
foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related manufac-
turing and production.
• Report to Congress on strategies to increase foreign direct in-
vestment in domestic semiconductor-related manufacturing
and production.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 97 was introduced on January 15, 2025, by Senator Peters (for
himself and Senators Blackburn and Scott (FL)), and was referred
to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the
Senate. On March 12, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive
Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 97 reported favorably without
amendment.
H.R. 2480, a related House bill, was introduced on March 31,
2025, by Representative Landsman (for himself and Representative
Bentz) and was referred to the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce in the House of Representatives. On April 8, 2025, the
House Committee on Energy and Commerce ordered H.R. 2480 to
be reported, and that bill passed the House, by voice vote, under
suspension of the rules on April 28, 2025.
118th Congress
S. 229, the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2023,
was introduced on February 2, 2023, by Senator Peters (for himself
and Senators Scott (FL) and Blackburn) and was referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate. Senator Tester was later added as a cosponsor. On May 10,
2023, the Committee met in Executive Session and, by voice vote,
ordered S. 229 be reported favorably without amendment. On De-
cember 13, 2023, S. 229 passed the Senate without amendment by
unanimous consent.
H.R. 752, the House companion to S. 229, was introduced on Feb-
ruary 2, 2023, by Representative Eshoo (for herself and Represent-
ative Pence) and was referred to the Committee on Energy and
Commerce of the House of Representatives. On March 9, 2023, the
House Committee on Energy and Commerce ordered that H.R. 752
be reported, and that bill passed the House, by voice vote, under
suspension of the rules on July 25, 2023.

Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 97 would direct the Department of Commerce, through its
SelectUSA program, to solicit comments from state economic devel-
opment organizations about how to support foreign direct invest-
ment in semiconductor production. The bill also would require the
department to report to the Congress on strategies that SelectUSA
could implement to increase such investment.
Using information from the department, CBO expects SelectUSA
would need two employees and six contractors for about two years
at an average cost of $210,000 each to carry out the comment solic-
itation process and complete the required report. On that basis,
CBO estimates that implementing S. 97 would cost $4 million over
the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be subject to the
availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Margot Berman. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.

ate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
Representatives.
This report would include a review of the comments received by
SelectUSA and a description of activities to increase foreign direct
investment in semiconducting-related manufacturing and produc-
tion. It would also assess strategies that SelectUSA may implement
to increase accompanying investments in U.S. semiconductor sup-
ply chains.

Section 10:
Section 6. No additional funds.
This section would specify that no additional funds are author-
ized to be appropriated for the purpose of carrying out this Act, and
that SelectUSA can only carry out this Act using amounts other-
wise available.
