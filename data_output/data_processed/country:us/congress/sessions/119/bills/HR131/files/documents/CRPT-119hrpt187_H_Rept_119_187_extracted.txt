PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 131 is to make certain modifications to the
repayment for the Arkansas Valley Conduit in the State of Colo-
rado.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed the Fryingpan-Ar-
kansas Project Act (P.L. 87–590) into law.1 This legislation author-
ized the construction of the Fryingpan-Arkansas project in Colo-
rado ‘‘for the purposes of supplying water for irrigation, municipal,
domestic, and industrial uses, generating and transmitting hydro-
electric power and energy, and controlling floods.’’2 The authorized
infrastructure included the Arkansas Valley Conduit (AVC), a se-
ries of pipelines that would provide roughly 7,500 acre-feet of water
per year, serving as many as 50,000 people.3
According to the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), ‘‘the AVC
was not constructed with the original project, primarily because
AVC beneficiaries were unable to repay all construction costs as re-
quired in the original authorizing legislation.’’4 The Omnibus Pub-
lic Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111–11) amended the
project’s cost share to provide 100 percent federal construction fi-
nancing, and 35 percent nonfederal repayment over a 50-year pe-
riod, starting after project completion.5 Additionally, the economic
challenges faced across the country in recent years due to inflation
have caused the total cost of this project to nearly double from
$640 million to $1.3 billion.6 H.R. 131, as amended, addresses
these challenges by cutting in half the interest payments for the
nonfederal costs and increasing the repayment period from 50
years to 75 years.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 131 was introduced on January 3, 2025, by Representative
Lauren Boebert (R–CO). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources. On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural
Resources met to consider the bill. Representative Lauren Boebert
(R–CO) offered an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute des-
ignated Boebert_024 ANS. The Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That for the pur-
poses of supplying water for irrigation, municipal, domestic, and in-
dustrial uses, generating and transmitting hydroelectric power and
energy, and controlling floods, and for other useful and beneficial
purposes incidental thereto, including recreation and the conserva-

the objectives of the project. Such modifications or additions as may
be required in connection therewith shall not, however, extend to
or contemplate the so-called Gunnison-Arkansas project; and noth-
ing in this Act shall constitute a commitment, real or implied, to
exportations of water from the Colorado River system in Colorado
beyond those required for projects heretofore or herein authorized.
In constructing operating, and maintaining the Fryingpan-Arkan-
sas project the Secretary shall be governed by the Federal reclama-
tion laws (Act of June 17, 1902; 32 Stat. 388, and Acts amendatory
thereof or supplementary thereto).

and prepare a report on the feasibility of a replacement reservoir
at or near the Ashcroft site on Castle Creek, a tributary of the
Roaring Fork River above its confluence with the Fryingpan River
with a capacity of approximately five thousand acre-feet, but con-
struction thereof shall not be commenced unless said report, which
shall be submitted to the President and the Congress, dem-
onstrates the feasibility of said reservoir and is approved by the
Congress. The Secretary shall expedite completion of his planning
report on the Basalt project, Colorado, as a participating project
under the Act of April 11, 1956 (70 Stat. 105), and said report shall
have the priority status of the reports to which reference is made
in section 2 of said Act.
(c) No part of the single purpose municipal and industrial water
supply works involved in the Fryingpan-Arkansas project shall be
constructed by the Secretary in the absence of evidence satisfactory
to him that it would be infeasible for the communities involved to
construct the works themselves, singly or jointly. In the event it is
determined that these works, or any of them, are to be constructed
by the Secretary, a contract providing, among other things, for pay-
ment of the actual cost thereof, øor in the case of the Arkansas Val-
ley Conduit, payment in an amount equal to 35 percent of the cost
of the conduit that is comprised of revenue generated by payments
pursuant to a repayment contract and revenue that may be derived
from contracts for the use of Fryingpan-Arkansas project excess ca-
pacity or exchange contracts using Fryingpan-Arkansas project fa-
cilities,¿ with interest as hereinafter provided, as rapidly as is con-
sistent with the contracting parties’ ability to pay, but in any
event, within fifty years from the time the works are first available
for the delivery of water, and for assumption by the contracting
parties of the care, operation, maintenance, and replacement of the
works shall be a condition precedent to construction thereof.
(d) ARKANSAS VALLEY CONDUIT.—
(1) REPAYMENT CONTRACT.—To provide domestic water sup-
plies to communities and households that do not have reliable
access to domestic water supplies, the contract for the Arkansas
Valley Conduit shall provide for payment in an amount equal
to 35 percent of the cost of the conduit, notwithstanding the rec-
lamation laws or any other provision of this Act. The contract
payments shall consist of—

dustrial uses, generating and transmitting hydroelectric power and
energy, and controlling floods, and for other useful and beneficial

the objectives of the project. Such modifications or additions as may
be required in connection therewith shall not, however, extend to

ing in this Act shall constitute a commitment, real or implied, to
exportations of water from the Colorado River system in Colorado
beyond those required for projects heretofore or herein authorized.
In constructing operating, and maintaining the Fryingpan-Arkan-
sas project the Secretary shall be governed by the Federal reclama-
tion laws (Act of June 17, 1902; 32 Stat. 388, and Acts amendatory

and prepare a report on the feasibility of a replacement reservoir
at or near the Ashcroft site on Castle Creek, a tributary of the
Roaring Fork River above its confluence with the Fryingpan River
with a capacity of approximately five thousand acre-feet, but con-
struction thereof shall not be commenced unless said report, which
shall be submitted to the President and the Congress, dem-
onstrates the feasibility of said reservoir and is approved by the
Congress. The Secretary shall expedite completion of his planning
report on the Basalt project, Colorado, as a participating project
under the Act of April 11, 1956 (70 Stat. 105), and said report shall
have the priority status of the reports to which reference is made
in section 2 of said Act.
(c) No part of the single purpose municipal and industrial water
supply works involved in the Fryingpan-Arkansas project shall be
constructed by the Secretary in the absence of evidence satisfactory
to him that it would be infeasible for the communities involved to

determined that these works, or any of them, are to be constructed
by the Secretary, a contract providing, among other things, for pay-
ment of the actual cost thereof, øor in the case of the Arkansas Val-
ley Conduit, payment in an amount equal to 35 percent of the cost

from contracts for the use of Fryingpan-Arkansas project excess ca-
pacity or exchange contracts using Fryingpan-Arkansas project fa-
cilities,¿ with interest as hereinafter provided, as rapidly as is con-
sistent with the contracting parties’ ability to pay, but in any
event, within fifty years from the time the works are first available
for the delivery of water, and for assumption by the contracting
parties of the care, operation, maintenance, and replacement of the
works shall be a condition precedent to construction thereof.

plies to communities and households that do not have reliable

lamation laws or any other provision of this Act. The contract
