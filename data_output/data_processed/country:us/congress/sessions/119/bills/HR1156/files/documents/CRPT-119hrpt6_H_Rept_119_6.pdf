SEC. 3. BUDGET OFFSET.
Out of the unobligated balances of amounts made available by section 2118(a) of
title II of division A of Public Law 116-136, as added by section 9032 of Public Law

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of
this Act.
I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 1156, the ‘‘Pandemic Unemployment Fraud En-
forcement Act,’’ as ordered reported by the Committee on Ways and
Means on February 12, 2025, establishes a 10-year statute of limi-
tations for criminal prosecution and civil enforcement actions re-
lated to fraudulent unemployment claims funded by federal pan-
demic unemployment programs created in the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116–136). These pro-
grams include Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), Federal
Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Mixed Earner
Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), and Pandemic Emergency
Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). The bill doubles the statute
of limitations, which expires on March 27, 2025, from five to 10
years, allowing federal law enforcement to continue prosecuting
criminals and recover billions in taxpayer dollars lost to fraud dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. There is a need for Congress to act
before March 27, 2025, to ensure prosecution of ongoing cases; oth-
erwise, criminal liability cannot be reimposed after a statute of lim-
itations period has lapsed.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
In response to the COVID–19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020, Con-
gress passed the CARES Act, creating several new temporary, fed-
erally-funded unemployment insurance (UI) programs to provide
expanded unemployment benefits to jobless workers. The American
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 (P.L. 117–2) extended these pro-
grams through September 6, 2021. Temporary programs included:
• PUA: Provided benefits to unemployed gig workers, free-
lancers, and other self-employed individuals not covered by
regular state UI programs.
• FPUC: Provided an additional $600/week from March 2020
through July 31, 2020, for UI claimants; then $300/week from
January 2021 through Sept. 4, 2021.
• MEUC: Provided benefits to ‘‘mixed-earner’’ unemployed
workers with a combination of self-employment and W–2 earn-
ings.
• PEUC: Provided an extra 13 weeks of benefits after state
benefits ended. State benefits typically cover 26 weeks.
In a period of less than two years, federal spending on unemploy-
ment benefits through these temporary programs totaled $675 bil-
lion.1 One reason for this enormous spend was the generous addi-
tional federal $600 per week (subsequently lowered to $300 per

Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act Funding to States through May 31, 2024, https://

week) FPUC benefits—on top of an average state benefit of ap-
proximately $380 per week. This lucrative benefit structure, com-
bined with weak state systems (that failed to have even the most
basic level of identity verification) and federal policy that allowed
self-certification for PUA benefits, provided an easy target for
fraudsters, prisoners, gangs, and international criminal organiza-
tions, leading to an estimated $100–$135 billion in stolen unem-
ployment benefits.2 Five years after passage of the CARES Act, the
most recent data from the Department of Labor (DOL) shows only
$5 billion of this theft, or roughly four percent, has been recov-
ered.3
H.R. 1156 is a must-pass bill. Once the March 27, 2025, deadline
passes, Congress cannot retroactively reimpose criminal liability
after a limitations period has lapsed. The ‘‘ex post facto’’ clause in
the Constitution prohibits retroactive application of criminal laws
that could punish someone for an act that was not considered a
crime when it was committed. Law enforcement agencies rely on
existing statutes under the False Claims Act (criminal statutes)
and Administrative Claims Act (civil forfeiture), including charges
related to mail fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money
laundering, and conspiracy, to prosecute pandemic UI fraud cases.
These laws generally have a five-year statute of limitations. With-
out extension, law enforcement will be unable to file new charges
or pursue charges in cases still under review.
H.R. 1156 is responsive to law enforcement agencies and is wide-
ly supported by state workforce agencies. The Pandemic Response
Accountability Committee (PRAC), Department of Justice (DOJ),
Department of Labor Inspector General (DOL-OIG), and GAO have
all called for extending the statute of limitations to allow more
time for prosecutions.4 In addition, the National Association of
State Workforce Agencies, a non-partisan association of workforce
agencies in all states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories
has endorsed H.R. 1156.5 Congress has already acted to extend the
statute of limitations for fraud in the COVID-era Paycheck Protec-
tion Program (PPP) and Economic Injury and Disaster Loans
(EIDL) program.6 In 2022, with bi-partisan support, President
Biden signed H.R. 7334, ‘‘COVID–19 EIDL Fraud Statute of Limi-
tations Act of 2022,’’ and H.R. 7352, ‘‘PPP and Bank Fraud En-
forcement Harmonization Act of 2022,’’ into law, which extended
the statute of limitations from five to 10 years. H.R. 1156 does the
same for CARES Act UI programs.

eral CARES Act programs, led by DOJ, Department of Homeland
Security, Department of Treasury, United States Postal Inspection
Service, DOL-OIG, and Small Business Administration—Office of

Inspector General, have resulted in significant civil and criminal
forfeitures and restitution orders. According to a DOJ memo pro-
vided to Senator James Lankford (R–OK) in response to a request
for technical assistance:
‘‘As of the end of 2024, forfeitures in COVID-fraud linked
civil administrative, civil judicial, and criminal judicial
forfeiture cases resulted in the seizure of over $1.77 billion
in assets, the final forfeiture of over $1.53 billion in assets,
and the return of at least $642 million in forfeited assets
to victimized federal, state, and private entities, with more
victim recoveries being regularly processed. . . The govern-
ment also obtained significant restitution orders on behalf
of government and private victims. Enforcement efforts as
of the end of 2024 resulted in the issuance of over $1.1 bil-
lion in total restitution orders in matters connected to
COVID–19 fraud.’’7
As recently as January, law enforcement agencies continue to
prosecute cases and show recoveries. Based on information pro-
vided to the COVID Fraud Enforcement Task Force, U.S. Attor-
ney’s Offices have charged over 600 criminal UI fraud cases with
approximate associated losses of over $300 million.8 The DOL-OIG,
has charged more than 2,000 individuals, resulting in over 1,400
convictions, more than 36,000 months of incarceration, and the
identification of more than $47 billion in potential fraud.9 These in-
vestigations have included fraud perpetrated by foreign crime rings
including Nigerians, Canadians, and Romanians. In addition, law
enforcement agencies report a large number of outstanding cases:
• As of January 28, 2025, the U.S. Attorneys’ Case Manage-
ment System shows 1,648 open, uncharged criminal matters
identified with the COVID–19 Fraud national initiative code.
This does not include any criminal matters that are exclusively
handled by the Criminal, Tax, or other Main Justice division,
open criminal investigations at the agency level that have not
yet been presented/accepted at a U.S. Attorney’s Office, or open
uncharged civil cases.10
• According to DOL-OIG, the agency has approximately
157,000 open UI fraud complaints. In an email to Committee
staff, the agency stated, ‘‘Without an extension of the statute
of limitations and additional resources, the OIG will be unable
to review the vast majority of the 157,000 open UI fraud com-
plaints. We have almost 1,000 open UI fraud investigative
matters assigned to our field offices.’’11
Some of the same professional fraudsters that committed fraud
during the pandemic continue to target UI and other government
programs, including emergency disaster unemployment assistance.

for Stealing Billions in Unemployment Benefits from American
Workers,’’ one witness stated that it was incredibility frustrating
for him to see ‘‘the same groups doing the same thing . . . they
use the money for horrible things, child trafficking. They use it for
drugs in our communities, they use it for terrorism . . . I’d like to
tell you that things are better today, but just watching what’s
going on in California, seeing what happened in North Carolina,
same groups, same playbook, stealing at scale.’’12
During the markup of H.R. 1156, all Democrats on the Com-
mittee voted against the bill and rejected significant efforts on the
part of the Majority to compromise and introduce a bi- partisan bill
prior to the markup. Unfortunately, this is a theme going back to
the 117th Congress, when Ways and Means Democrats walked
away from their oversight responsibilities and ignored repeated
calls for hearings to investigate UI fraud when they were in control
of Congress and the White House. Committee Democrats gave a
number of reasons for opposing H.R. 1156, some of which were not
substantively related to the bill itself and none of which were seri-
ously defensible.
Specifically, Committee Democrats criticized the rescission of $5
million in funding provided to DOL for fraud prevention and pro-
gram integrity in Section 2118 of the CARES Act. According to
DOL, approximately $30 million remains unobligated from the $1
billion in funding (post rescission made in the bipartisan Fiscal Re-
sponsibility Act of 2023 (P.L. 118–5)).13 Extending the statute of
limitations is associated with some additional costs to states re-
lated to recordkeeping and administration. The CARES Act cur-
rently includes uncapped funding for any costs to states for admin-
istration of the federal CARES Act programs,14 including costs of
recordkeeping and appeals necessary for prosecutions. DOL has the
authority to fully reimburse states for these costs without any addi-
tional action from Congress. The Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) estimates approximately $5 million over the next five years
will be spent through this mechanism. To comply with House rules,
Section 3 of the bill offsets the CBO score by rescinding $5 million
in unobligated, prior-year appropriations provided by Section 2118.
Committee Democrats argued rescinding $5 million from these
CARES Act funds is disingenuous since those funds were provided
to DOL to prevent fraud in the UI program and falsely claimed
those funds were already dedicated to identity verification projects
and would result in less funding for states. Under the Biden Ad-
ministration, the majority of these funds were spent by DOL on
‘‘equity grants’’ ($260 million) and Tiger teams ($200 million). H.R.
1156 uses $5 million of that same pot of money (which DOL con-
firmed has in fact not been obligated) for extending the statute of
limitations on pandemic UI fraud. This is arguably a much more
justifiable use of funds as it is paying for a policy that provides law
enforcement agencies with additional time to prosecute fraud and
recoup taxpayer dollars.
Quibbling over $5 million in funding also comes across as short-
sighted. Due to scorekeeping rules, CBO does not score savings as-

sociated with additional recoupment of federal funds as a result of
extending the statute of limitations. According to GAO, $100–$135
billion in pandemic unemployment benefits were lost to fraud and
DOL reports show only $5 billion has been recovered. If law en-
forcement is able to recover even one percent more as a result of
H.R. 1156 extending the statute of limitations to 10 years—that
would yield at the low end $1 billion for American taxpayers.
That’s a 20,000-percent return on an investment of $5 million. Cur-
rently, DOJ has 1,648 open COVID–19 cases. Committee Demo-
crats should be more concerned about what American taxpayers
will lose if the statute of limitations is not extended, not to mention
the number of criminals that will go unpunished and remain at
large to continue their attacks to de-fraud federal programs.
Finally, Committee Democrats, argued that extending the time
available for prosecuting fraud would lead to ‘‘surprise bills,’’ har-
assment and the targeting of otherwise innocent Americans (in-
cluding the elderly or a ‘‘struggling parent’’) who may have gotten
an overpayment or received funds through administrative error or
no fault of their own. Law enforcement officials are concentrating
on prosecuting individuals who fraudulently and intentionally ob-
tained large amounts of government funds, including prisoners, on-
line scammers, international crime rings and gangs, not individuals
who made honest mistakes applying for unemployment.
An even cursory review of press releases from DOJ investigations
shows the agencies are prosecuting complex cases involving crimi-
nals with malicious intent to de-fraud the government (see Attach-
ment A). This includes a litany of cases involving international
crime rings using sophisticated fraud schemes, many of them
sourced in Nigeria and Romania. Many cases involved instances
where funds were used to purchase weapons, drugs, and involved
child sex trafficking.15 These cases have implications for stopping
future fraud and associated criminal activity. In September of
2023, Maryland U.S. Attorney Erek Barron during an interview
said that his office’s prosecutions of COVID–19-related fraud had
been responsible for a 20% reduction in the homicide rate in Balti-
more.16
Law enforcement is also prosecuting cases aimed at disrupting
large-scale international criminal networks that have created na-
tional security concerns by demonstrating links to hostile nation
states. For example, a Pennsylvania man and two others recently
pled guilty to obtaining $59 million in public benefits, including un-
employment, and laundering the proceeds to China. Cases like this
are deeply concerning and confirm fears regarding the attacks on
our institutions by hostile nations.17 These networks continue to
target federal programs and divert funds away from those who
need them.
H.R. 1156 extends the statute of limitations for cases exclusive
to fraud with criminal intent, not innocent Americans. Further-
more, the CARES Act already explicitly provides states with broad

authority to waive non-fraudulent UI overpayments. For example,
the CARES Act allows state workforce agencies to waive overpay-
ments when the overpayment is through ‘‘no-fault of the claimant’’
and/or repayment would be ‘‘against equity and good conscience.’’
All of these provide protections against the scaremongering Com-
mittee Democrats have engaged in to justify opposition to this bill.
H.R. 1156 is a common-sense, straightforward bill. The ‘‘Pan-
demic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act,’’ doubles the statute
of limitations to allow law enforcement to fully prosecute criminals,
secure justice for the American families who were harmed, and re-
coup the hundreds of billions in stolen taxpayer dollars.
C. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
BACKGROUND
H.R. 1156 was introduced on February 10, 2025, and was re-
ferred to the Committee on Ways and Means.
COMMITTEE HEARINGS
The Committee held the following hearing:
On February 6, 2025, the Committee on Ways and Means Sub-
committee on Work and Welfare held a hearing titled ‘‘Time’s Run-
ning Out: Prosecuting Fraudsters for Stealing Billions in Unem-
ployment Benefits from American Workers.’’ The purpose of the
hearing was to investigate the need to extend the statute of limita-
tions for CARES Act-related UI fraud and how fraudsters, inter-
national crime rings, and hostile nation states continue to target
the UI program.
COMMITTEE ACTION
The Committee on Ways and Means marked up H.R. 1156, ‘‘Pan-
demic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act,’’ on February 12,
2025, and ordered the bill, as amended, favorably reported (with a
quorum being present).
D. DESIGNATED HEARING
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII, the following hearing was
used to develop and consider H.R. 1156: ‘‘Time’s Running Out:
Prosecuting Fraudsters for Stealing Billions in Unemployment
Benefits from American Workers,’’ hearing held on February 6,
2025.
II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
REASONS FOR CHANGE
Section 1. The Committee believes the title accurately reflects
the content of the bill.
Section 2. The Committee believes extending the statute of limi-
tations for criminal prosecution and civil enforcement actions in
pandemic unemployment programs from five to 10 years will give
law enforcement officials the tools to hold fraudsters accountable
and recover billions in taxpayer dollars.
Section 3. The Committee believes the budget offset will provide
the resources necessary to reimburse any additional costs states

The bill would:
• Extend the statute of limitations for federal criminal fraud
charges related to unemployment compensation
• Rescind funding for program integrity activities by state
unemployment insurance agencies
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Increasing states’ administrative costs that would be reim-
bursed by the Department of Labor
• Rescinding funds for program integrity activities
Bill summary: H.R. 1156 would extend the statute of limitations
from 5 to 10 years for federal criminal prosecution and civil en-
forcement actions for fraud related to the temporary unemployment
programs enacted during the coronavirus pandemic. Under current
law, the statute of limitations for those offenses will begin to expire
in March 2025. Currently, states refer unemployment insurance
claims involving allegations of fraud to the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral (OIG) at the Department of Labor (DOL) for further investiga-
tion. That office reviews cases and refers findings to the Depart-
ment of Justice (DOJ) or other entities for criminal or civil prosecu-
tion.
The bill also would rescind direct appropriations provided for
program integrity activities in the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effect of H.R.
1156 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 500 (education training, employment, and social
services), 600 (income security), and 750 (administration of justice).

Basis of estimate: CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted in
March 2025. Estimated outlays are based on historical patterns for
existing and similar activities.
Direct spending and revenues: CBO estimates that enacting H.R.
1156 would increase net direct spending and revenues by less than
$500,000 over the 2025–2035 period (see Table 2).

Extend the statute of limitations: Upon the enactment of H.R.
1156, CBO expects that DOL would provide additional funding to
states to continue their referrals of cases to DOL and provide infor-
mation about those cases to the department’s OIG and federal law
enforcement agencies. Under current law, DOL has permanent au-
thority to fund whatever amounts are necessary for those activities
for pandemic-related programs. Using information from DOL, CBO
estimates that under the bill the department would provide $5 mil-
lion in additional funding to states, increasing direct spending by
the same amount over the 2025–2035 period.
By extending the period for which DOJ could pursue prosecu-
tions, CBO expects that H.R. 1156 would increase the collections
of penalties and the recovery of additional benefits paid fraudu-
lently in 2025 and subsequent years. That change would not affect
state laws or rules governing the recovery of overpayments. Based
on an analysis of data for similar offenses from the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, CBO estimates that the increase in penalty collections
would be insignificant. Criminal and civil fines are recorded in the
budget as revenues; criminal fines are deposited into the Crime
Victims Fund and spent without further appropriation. Thus, CBO
estimates that enacting H.R. 1156 would increase revenues and the
associated direct spending from penalty collections by less than
$500,000 over the 2025–2035 period. Additionally, using informa-
tion from DOL and DOJ, CBO estimates that any additional recov-
eries of overpaid benefits, which are recorded as reductions in di-
rect spending, would be insignificant. The extent to which any ad-
ditional recoveries would happen is highly uncertain.
Rescind funding for program integrity activities: The bill would
rescind $5 million in mandatory funding provided in the American
Rescue Plan Act to state unemployment insurance agencies for pro-
gram integrity activities, which are undertaken to ensure that ben-
efits are paid correctly. Using information from DOL, CBO esti-
mates that the rescission would decrease direct spending by $5 mil-
lion over the 2025–2035 period.
Spending Subject to appropriation: CBO assumes that if the stat-
ute of limitations were extended, more potential fraud cases would
be referred to the OIG, and that office would continue to inves-
tigate cases it might otherwise have dropped. Using information
from the Department of Labor, CBO estimates that the OIG would
require an additional $5 million over the 2025–2030 period to han-
dle those referrals and cases. Assuming appropriation of the esti-
mated amounts, CBO estimates that outlays for those activities
would total $5 million over the same period (see Table 1).
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates
that enacting the bill would increase direct spending by less than
$500,000 over the 2025–2035 period and increase revenues by less
than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period (see
Table 3).

Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting H.R. 1156 would not significantly increase net
direct spending in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods be-
ginning in 2036.
CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1156 would not significantly
increase on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year
periods beginning in 2036.

tor mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Jeremy Crimm (Depart-
ment of Justice), Meredith Decker (Department of Labor); Man-
dates: Erich Dvorak.
Estimate reviewed by: Elizabeth Cove Delisle, Chief, Income Se-
curity Cost Estimates Unit; Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance,
Housing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; Christina Hawley An-
thony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

RULES OF THE HOUSE
A. COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee made findings and rec-
ommendations that are reflected in this report.
B. STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the bill does
not authorize funding, so no statement of general performance
goals and objectives is required.

mined that the bill does not impose a Federal intergovernmental
mandate on State, local, or tribal governments.

LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the bill, and states that the provisions of the bill do not
contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited
tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

E. TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
Pursuant to clause 3(h)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation
has determined that a complexity analysis is not required under

have ‘‘widespread applicability’’ to individuals or small businesses,
within the meaning of the rule.
F. DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision
of the bill establishes or reauthorizes: (1) a program of the Federal
Government known to be duplicative of another Federal program;
(2) a program included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139; or (3) a program related to a program identified in
the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, published
pursuant to the Federal Program Information Act (Pub. L. No. 95–
220, as amended by Pub. L. No. 98–169).

age weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will
be payable during the period of the agreement (determined dis-
regarding any Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation
or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation) will be less

tled to receive under this section for each calendar month,
reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount
by which the Secretary finds that his estimates for any
prior calendar month were greater or less than the
amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such
estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical,
sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the
Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.

by reason of such amendments until such individual has
exhausted all rights to such extended benefits.
(6) NONREDUCTION RULE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—An agreement under this section shall
not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State
upon a determination by the Secretary that the method
governing the computation of regular compensation under
the State law of that State has been modified in a manner
such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit enti-
tlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular
compensation which will be payable during the period of
the agreement will be less than the number of weeks, or
the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly
benefit amount of regular compensation which would oth-
erwise have been payable during such period under the
State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.
(B) MAXIMUM BENEFIT ENTITLEMENT.—In subparagraph
(A), the term ‘‘maximum benefit entitlement’’ means the
amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to
an individual with respect to the individual’s benefit year.
(7) ACTIVELY SEEKING WORK.—

poses of paragraph (2)(D), the term ‘‘actively seeking work’’
means, with respect to any individual, that such indi-
vidual—
(i) is registered for employment services in such a
manner and to such extent as prescribed by the State
agency;
(ii) has engaged in an active search for employment
that is appropriate in light of the employment avail-
able in the labor market, the individual’s skills and ca-
pabilities, and includes a number of employer contacts
that is consistent with the standards communicated to
the individual by the State;
(iii) has maintained a record of such work search,
including employers contacted, method of contact, and
date contacted; and
(iv) when requested, has provided such work search
record to the State agency.
(B) FLEXIBILITY.—Notwithstanding the requirements
under subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(D), a State
shall provide flexibility in meeting such requirements in
case of individuals unable to search for work because of
COVID-19, including because of illness, quarantine, or
movement restriction.
(8) SPECIAL RULE FOR EXTENDED COMPENSATION.—At the op-
tion of a State, for any weeks of unemployment beginning after
the date of the enactment of this paragraph and before Sep-
tember 6, 2021, an individual’s eligibility period (as described
in section 203(c) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment
Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)) shall, for pur-

pensation under the State law of such State, be considered to

(A) after the date as of which such individual exhausts
all rights to pandemic emergency unemployment com-
pensation; and
(B) during an extended benefit period that began on or
before the date described in subparagraph (A).
(b) PANDEMIC EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AC-
COUNT.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Any agreement under this section shall
provide that the State will establish, for each eligible indi-
vidual who files an application for pandemic emergency unem-
ployment compensation, an pandemic emergency unemploy-
ment compensation account with respect to such individual’s
benefit year.
(2) AMOUNT IN ACCOUNT.—The amount established in an ac-
count under subsection (a) shall be equal to 53 times the indi-
vidual’s average weekly benefit amount, which includes the
amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation
under section 2104, for the benefit year.
(3) WEEKLY BENEFIT AMOUNT.—For purposes of this sub-
section, an individual’s weekly benefit amount for any week is
the amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ al-
lowances) under the State law payable to such individual for
such week for total unemployment plus the amount of Federal
Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 2104.
(4) COORDINATION OF PANDEMIC EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT
COMPENSATION WITH REGULAR COMPENSATION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If—
(i) an individual has been determined to be entitled
to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation
with respect to a benefit year;
(ii) that benefit year has expired;
(iii) that individual has remaining entitlement to
pandemic emergency unemployment compensation
with respect to that benefit year; and
(iv) that individual would qualify for a new benefit
year in which the weekly benefit amount of regular
compensation is at least $25 less than the individual’s
weekly benefit amount in the benefit year referred to
in clause (i),
then the State shall determine eligibility for compensation
as provided in subparagraph (B).
(B) DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY.—For individuals de-
scribed in subparagraph (A), the State shall determine
whether the individual is to be paid pandemic emergency
unemployment compensation or regular compensation for a
week of unemployment using one of the following methods:
(i) The State shall, if permitted by State law, estab-
lish a new benefit year, but defer the payment of reg-
ular compensation with respect to that new benefit
year until exhaustion of all pandemic emergency un-
employment compensation payable with respect to the
benefit year referred to in subparagraph (A)(i).

(ii) The State shall, if permitted by State law, defer
the establishment of a new benefit year (which uses
all the wages and employment which would have been
used to establish a benefit year but for the application
of this subparagraph), until exhaustion of all pan-
demic emergency unemployment compensation pay-
able with respect to the benefit year referred to in sub-
paragraph (A)(i).
(iii) The State shall pay, if permitted by State law—
(I) regular compensation equal to the weekly

pensation equal to the difference between that
weekly benefit amount and the weekly benefit
amount for the expired benefit year.
(iv) The State shall determine rights to pandemic
emergency unemployment compensation without re-
gard to any rights to regular compensation if the indi-
vidual elects to not file a claim for regular compensa-
tion under the new benefit year.

ment under this section in respect of such compensation.
(3) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT.—Sums payable to any State
by reason of such State having an agreement under this sec-
tion shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reim-
bursement (as may be determined by the Secretary), in such
amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled
to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced
or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the
Secretary finds that the Secretary’s estimates for any prior cal-
endar month were greater or less than the amounts which
should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be
made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other meth-
od as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agen-
cy of the State involved.

VII. DISSENTING VIEWS
Ways and Means Democrats strongly support bringing to justice
the criminals who stole from our unemployment system during the
pandemic. We have consistently supported Department of Labor In-
spector General Larry Turner as he and his team secured 1,400
convictions and over a billion dollars in court-ordered restitution.
Two years ago, we offered to work with our Republican col-
leagues to extend the statute of limitations at IG Turner’s request.
They instead chose to rush to the House floor with legislation that
experts said would not correctly extend the statute of limitations
but did cut $2 billion from the Department of Labor’s fraud-fight-
ing budget and pressure states to investigate and prosecute inno-
cent workers. At that markup, Ways and Means Republicans re-
jected amendments to protect Social Security recipients, farmers,
and parents from this senseless harassment.
We also opposed Republican cuts to the Office of the Inspector
General (OIG) budget that forced it to lay off staff and slow its
work, which increased the number of cases at risk of not being
completed before they reached the statute of limitations.
Less than two weeks before H.R. 1156 was introduced and con-
sidered in Committee, President Trump fired IG Turner, along with
16 other Senate-confirmed agency Inspectors General. Inspectors
General are primary prosecutors of fraud and instruments of agen-
cy accountability to the American people. Just before our markup,
the President fired yet another agency watchdog for daring to criti-
cize Administration actions. The silence from our colleagues about
the firing of IG Turner, a respected public official that House Re-
publicans were publicly praising just a few weeks before his firing,
has been deafening.
This bill would give the OIG five additional years to file charges
for alleged fraud in the pandemic UI programs, whether the
charges are against a criminal mastermind who used stolen Social
Security numbers to steal millions of dollars or a struggling parent
who was accidentally overpaid by an overworked state UI system.
IG Turner had laid out and was following a clear plan to go after
real fraud and criminal rings, not innocent people. His firing, and
that of 17 other Senate-confirmed watchdogs, coupled with the
flood of career prosecutors quitting rather than obeying illegal or-
ders by the Trump Administration, makes us unsure how the au-
thority would be used.
In addition to the risk of illegal prosecution and harassment, this
bill would cut a small but important source of anti-fraud funding
at the Department of Labor. Although the funding is technically
‘‘unobligated,’’ the Department has been using it to cover costs as-
sociated with providing free identity verification tools to states and
also providing other technical assistance to states to prevent fraud

and ensure timely access to benefits. Cutting that funding might
mean it would run out, increasing fraud in the future.
At our markup, Reps. Chu and DelBene tried to offer an amend-
ment to extend the statute of limitations for six months and then
provide the extension to 10 years once the President reinstated IG
Turner or followed the law to replace him with a Senate-confirmed
successor who could be trusted to use additional prosecution power
fairly. Republicans refused to allow the amendment to be consid-
ered.
We regret that we are unable to support H.R. 1156. However, we
are open to Republicans who decide to join us in fighting fraud and
protecting American workers.

DISSENTING VIEWS
We held a markup last Congress where this committee looked at
unemployment insurance fraud. I offered an amendment then
which would have extended that statute of limitations for those
who committed unemployment insurance fraud during the pan-
demic.
Larry Turner, the respected Inspector General of the Department
of Labor, who was wrongfully terminated by this administration,
made a compelling case to us that it would take his investigators
and prosecutors time to investigate and build strong legal cases for
some of the worst fraud of the pandemic—sophisticated criminal
rings that used stolen identity and bank account information to
steal millions, or even billions of taxpayer dollars.
IG Turner and his team also delivered on their promises. They
focused on bringing the worst criminals to justice, and have se-
cured 1,400 convictions and over a billion dollars in court-ordered
restitution. I’d like to enter the COVID–19 Fraud Enforcement
Task Force report into the record. I later withdrew that amend-
ment upon agreement with Chairman Smith that we would work
together to address this issue.
Throughout the last two years, Republicans and Democrats came
to an agreement: extend the statute of limitations, that’s it. It even
made it into the Unemployment Insurance Integrity and Accessi-
bility Act, a bipartisan bill negotiated by Crapo-Wyden.
However, while this bill extends the statute of limitations, it re-
scinds critical funding we provided in the American Rescue Plan
that the Department of Labor has been using on an ongoing basis
to fund, among other things, free state access to two critical iden-
tify verification tools—login.gov and in-person identity verification
at the Post Office. These tools are used by the Department of Labor
and states to confirm identity and prevent fraud. So, while we are
extending the time period for which law enforcement can prosecute
those who committed fraud, we are taking away funding to prevent
future fraud.
I am disappointed that yet another bipartisan agreement has
been walked back by my Republican colleagues.
I cannot support legislation that solves one problem but creates
another. I urge my colleague to vote no unless changed.
MIKE THOMPSON.
