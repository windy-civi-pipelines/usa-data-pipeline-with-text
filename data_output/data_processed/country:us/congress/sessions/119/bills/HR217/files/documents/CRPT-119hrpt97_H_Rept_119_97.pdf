authorize a pilot program and clarify the original intent of the pro-
gram to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accept
donations of real property from non-federal partners for the con-
struction, improvement, or renovation of VA medical facilities. The
bill changes current law to denote that eligible projects may in-
clude minor construction and non-recurring maintenance, in addi-
tion to major construction projects. These changes are intended to
expand participation in the CHIP IN program and accelerate the
delivery of modernized VA infrastructure for veterans across the
country.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Communities Helping Invest
through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of
2025’’ or the ‘‘CHIP IN for Veterans Act of 2025.’’
Section 2: Expanding and Extending a Pilot Program on Acceptance
by the Department of Veterans Affairs of Donated Facilities and
Related Improvements
The CHIP IN for Veterans Act was originally enacted to allow
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accept donations of real
property—such as land, facility construction, or improvements—
from non-federal partners. The intent was to expedite delivery of
medical facilities by leveraging philanthropic and private sector re-
sources to support VA’s mission. However, implementation of the
program has been limited to just two projects since 2017.
The Committee acknowledges the importance of maintaining fed-
eral control and oversight of VA construction projects. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported that only
two of the five authorized CHIP IN projects have moved forward.
According to GAO, stakeholder participation has been constrained
in part by VA’s narrow interpretation that CHIP IN may only be
used for major construction projects (projects over $30 million).
This interpretation has discouraged potential partners from pur-
suing projects considered ‘minor construction’ or ‘non-recurring
maintenance,’ even when such projects would provide meaningful
infrastructure improvements for veterans.
One example of a successful project under this program is the
Omaha VA Ambulatory Care Center. It was the first project com-
pleted under the CHIP IN pilot program. The partnership delivered
the Omaha project ahead of schedule and nearly $40 million under
VA’s projected budget. This project demonstrated that public-pri-
vate partnerships can enhance VA’s construction process when im-
plemented with flexibility and transparency. The facility is a na-
tional model for how non-federal investment can supplement VA’s
investment while reducing the cost for the federal government.
To ensure this program can benefit more communities nation-
wide, H.R. 217, as amended, would reauthorize the CHIP IN pilot
program for five years and make clear VA can enter partnerships
for minor construction and non-recurring maintenance, in addition
to major construction projects. These updates would broaden the
use of the program, particularly for facilities that may not require

An amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 217 of-
fered by Representative Tom Barrett of Michigan was adopted
by voice vote. The amendment in the nature of a substitute
would reauthorize the pilot program for five years and clarify
that VA may enter into partnerships for minor construction

tion.
A motion by Ranking Member Takano to report H.R. 217, as
amended, favorably to the House of Representatives was agreed to
by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
In compliance with clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, no recorded votes were taken on amend-
ments or in connection with ordering H.R. 217, as amended, re-
ported to the House.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 217, as amended, are to extend and clarify VA’s
authority to enter into agreements with philanthropic groups for
VA major construction, minor construction, and non-recurring
maintenance projects for another five years.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 217, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate on H.R. 217,
as amended, prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget
Office.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 217,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant
to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

H.R. 217 would expand and extend a program that authorizes
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accept donations of real
property and improvements from nonfederal entities. Under the
bill, VA also would be authorized to accept donations of minor con-
struction and nonrecurring maintenance projects to support the de-
velopment and upkeep of VA medical facilities. Because those in-
kind donations are property rather than monetary contributions,
they are not reflected in the federal budget. Additionally, the bill
would extend the program, which expires in December 2026, by
five years.
VA is authorized to accept real property donations and in-kind
support through other authorities, including enhanced-use leases,
which have sometimes resulted in implicit or explicit commitments
to make future payments. Those arrangements, when they rely on
future appropriations, constitute contract authority and are classi-
fied as direct spending.
The authority for the program includes restrictions that may pre-
vent VA from making such commitments. Based on VA’s implemen-
tation of the program to date, CBO expects the department is un-
likely to enter arrangements that would create future obligations
or result in significant costs. Thus, CBO estimates that enacting
this bill would increase direct spending by an insignificant amount.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Noah Callahan. The
estimate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Di-
rector of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Con-
trol Act (as amended by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandate

ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act would be created by H.R. 217, as
amended.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H.R. 217, as amended, does not relate
to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public serv-
ices or accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of
the Congressional Accountability Act.
STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
217, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Fed-
eral Government known to be duplicative of another Federal pro-
gram, a program that was included in any report from the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of
Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identified
in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short title
This section would establish the short title as the ‘‘Communities
Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for
Veterans Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘CHIP IN for Veterans Act of 2025.’’
Section 2: Expanding and extending a pilot program on acceptance
by the Department of Veterans Affairs of donated facilities and
related improvements
Section 2(a) would clarify that VA may enter into partnerships
with philanthropic organizations for minor construction and non-re-
curring maintenance projects, in addition to major construction
identified on VA’s Strategic Capital Investment Planning Process
Project List.
Section 2(b) would extend the CHIP IN pilot program for five
years by striking ‘‘December 16, 2026’’ and inserting ‘‘December 16,
2031.’’
