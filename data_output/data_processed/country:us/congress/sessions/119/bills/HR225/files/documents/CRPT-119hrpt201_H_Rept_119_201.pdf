SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY.
Not later than October 1 of each year, the Inspector General of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development shall appear before the Committee on Financial
Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs of the Senate and present testimony on the Office of Inspector
General’s—
(1) efforts to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse;
(2) ability to conduct and supervise audits, investigations, and reviews;
(3) actions to identify opportunities for the programs of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to progress and succeed;
(4) recommendations to improve overall efficiency and public accountability of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development;
(5) assessment of the extent to which the Department of Housing and Urban
Development has resources sufficient to carry out its statutory mission; and
(6) ongoing activities regarding any such additional work, as appropriate.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 225, the HUD Transparency Act of 2025, was introduced on
January 7, 2025, by Representative Monica De La Cruz (TX–15).
H.R. 225 would require the Inspector General of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development to testify before Congress
annually.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Although the heads of several Federal agencies that fall under
the jurisdiction of the Committee, including Treasury, the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System, are required by various stat-
utes to testify before the Committee, no such similar requirement
exists for the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). This limits the Committee’s opportunities to perform over-
sight of a Department that employed over 9,000 full time employ-
ees and had an annual enacted gross discretionary budget author-
ity of more than $77 billion in 2024.
Lacking a formal oversight requirement for the agency, the Com-
mittee relies heavily on the work of the HUD Office of Inspector
General (IG) and its mission to ‘‘promote economy, efficiency, and
effectiveness in the administration of HUD programs.’’ However,
prior to the IG’s appearance in 2023, the Committee had gone five
years since it had last heard testimony from the IG regarding the
ongoing activities of HUD. That is the rationale behind H.R. 225,
the HUD Transparency Act of 2025, which would, for the first time,
require the IG to testify annually before the House Committee on
Financial Services and Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs (Committees).

On June 21, 2023, the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance
of the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 225 is to enhance the Commit-
tee’s oversight responsibility and effectiveness by requiring annual
testimony before the Committee from the HUD Inspector General.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 225. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT

Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Establishes the short title of the bill as the ‘‘HUD Transparency
Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Congressional testimony
Requires the HUD IG to testify annually prior to October 1 be-
fore the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs regarding the
IG’s efforts: to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse; to con-
duct and supervise audits; to identify opportunities for HUD pro-
grams to succeed; to improve overall efficiency and public account-
ability; to assess if HUD has resources sufficient to carry out its
statutory mission; and, to provide updates on the IG’s ongoing ac-
tivities as appropriate.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 225 does not repeal or amend any section of a statute.
Therefore, the Office of Legislative Counsel did not prepare the re-
port required under clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
