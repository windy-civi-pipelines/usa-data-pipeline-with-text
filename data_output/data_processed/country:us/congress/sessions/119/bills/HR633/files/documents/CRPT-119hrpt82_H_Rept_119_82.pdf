PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 633, the Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immo-
bilizing Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks Act, or
the TAKE IT DOWN Act, was introduced by Representative Sala-
zar on January 22, 2025, and referred to the Committee on Energy
and Commerce. H.R. 633 criminalizes the publication of non-con-
sensual intimate images (NCII) or the threat to publish NCII in
interstate commerce. NCII is defined to include realistic, computer-
generated pornographic images and videos that depict identifiable,
real people. The bill permits the good faith disclosure of NCII, such
as disclosure to law enforcement or for medical treatment. The bill
requires covered platforms to establish and implement a notice and
takedown process within one year of enactment. The takedown
process requires covered platforms to remove NCII, and known cop-
ies of such NCII, within forty-eight hours upon receiving a valid re-
moval request notice from an identifiable individual. The bill pro-
vides that a failure to reasonably comply with the notice and take
down obligations under the Act shall be treated as a violation of
a rule defining an unfair or a deceptive act or practice under Sec-
tion 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41
et seq.).
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Artificial intelligence (AI) has drastically changed how people
interact with computer services. For instance, the availability, and
advancement, of AI, and other computer-generated technologies,
has improved the way Americans can complete mundane tasks,
compile and access information,1 and assist collaboration between
humans in work environments.2 It also promises to assist law en-
forcement fight against different types of fraud and abuse.3 How-
ever, the growth and advancement of AI, while benefitting many
different avenues of society, can also be used by bad actors to cre-
ate and distribution of NCII of adults and minors, resulting in sig-
nificant harm to Americans.
Before the rapid advancement of AI, especially generative AI,
NCII depicted real images or videos of actual people.4 But the rise
of the new technology is exposing a hole in protections for Ameri-
cans, especially children. Bad actors can use AI to create a digital
forgery of NCII which involves manipulating real pictures easily
obtained from online to falsely depict and expose an individual in
intimate situations or in sexually graphic manners.5 Although such
digital forgery NCII is not authentic, it harms the real people de-

picted, including psychological harm such as humiliation, public
shaming, and depression, as well as physical harm such as self-
harm and suicide.6 The possibility that these images can continue
to be spread—possibly in perpetuity if allowed to remain online—
compounds the traumatic impact of those harmed by these images.
NCII, including deepfake NCII, is also used by predators to com-
mit sextortion, which involves soliciting and encouraging individ-
uals to record or photograph themselves engaged in sexual acts or
scenarios. In some cases, the predator may not already have a re-
vealing picture or video recording, and at the first point of contact
they will threaten an individual as if they did have sexually reveal-
ing information to obtain more sexually explicit images or record-
ings.7 Once a predator has recordings or images they will exploit
or blackmail the victim for money or additional favors by threat-
ening to publicly release any of the recordings or photographs of
the victim.8
NCII, real or AI generated, has contributed life long lasting
harms to Americans throughout the United States, but particularly
our children. Furthermore, there are few remedies victims may uti-
lize to protect themselves. On March 26, 2025, the Committee on
Energy and Commerce held a hearing which highlighted the lack
of legal remedies available to law enforcement to pursue predators
and culprits taking advantage of children.9 The hearing also dem-
onstrated how difficult it is for victims to remove any real or AI
generated NCII from online platforms.10
To protect Americans, including our most vulnerable popu-
lation—children—it is imperative Congress legislate to provide law
enforcement with new authorities to address the growing crisis of
NCII. Congress must also provide Americans with additional tools
to request that NCII be taken down from online platforms by re-
quiring notice and take down obligations for entities where NCII
is found. H.R. 633 clarifies that the creation and publication of
NCII in interstate commerce, or the threat to publish NCII, is a
criminal offense in the United States and requires online platforms
institute a notice and takedown process enforced by the Federal
Trade Commission.

APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 designates that the short title may be cited as the
‘‘Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilizing Techno-
logical Deepfakes on Websites and Networks Act’’ or the ‘‘TAKE IT
DOWN Act.’’
Section 2. Criminal prohibition on intentional disclosure of non-
consensual intimate visual depictions
Section 2 amends the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.
223) to create a new Federal crime for the intentional disclosure of
nonconsensual intimate visual depictions. Subsection (a)(2) estab-
lishes a new Federal criminal provision that makes it unlawful for
a person to use an interactive computer service to knowingly pub-
lish or threaten to publish an intimate visual depiction of an identi-
fiable individual and includes penalties. The bill provides two dif-
ferent offenses under subsection (2)(A) and (2)(B) depending on
whether the identifiable individual within an intimate visual depic-
tion is of an adult or minor.
Subsection (a)(3) establishes a criminal provision that makes it
unlawful for a person to use an interactive computer service to
knowingly publish a digital forgery of an identifiable individual.
The bill provides two different offenses under 3(A) and 3(B) de-
pending on whether the identifiable individual within an intimate
visual depiction is of an adult or a minor. Subsection 3(C) clarifies
subsections (A) and (B) do not apply to any law enforcement inves-
tigations, or disclosures made in good faith to law enforcement, in
legal proceedings, as part of a medical diagnosis, to seek support
with respect to receipt.

Section 2 provides for further exceptions and penalties, including
for intentional threats to commit an offense under this Section
against adults and minors.
Section 3. Notice and removal of nonconsensual intimate visual de-
pictions
Section 3 requires covered platforms to establish and implement
a notice and takedown process within one year of the enactment of
this Act in accordance with the requirements outlined in this Sec-
tion. Subsection (a)(1)(A) establishes the overall requirements for
the covered platform to implement the notice and takedown proc-
ess, including a process for an identifiable individual to notify the
platform of an intimate visual depiction that has been published on
the covered platform and the ability to submit a request to remove
the intimate visual depiction.
Subsection (a)(3) requires a covered platform, ‘‘upon receiving a
valid removal request’’ to use the process described in paragraph
(1)(A)(ii) ‘‘not later than 48 hours’’ after receiving such request—(1)
remove the intimate visual depiction; and (2) make reasonable ef-
forts to identify and remove any known identical copies of such de-
piction. Subsection (a)(4) provides a limitation on liability to enable
covered platforms to comply with the notice and takedown process
without incurring liability for good faith disabling of access to, or
removal of, material claimed to be a nonconsensual intimate visual
depiction.
Subsection (b)(1) provides that a failure to reasonably comply
with the notice and take down obligations under subsection (a)
shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or a de-
ceptive act or practice under Section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act.
Section 4. Definitions
Section 4 provides definitions that apply to the entirety of this
Act.
The terms ‘‘consent’’, ‘‘digital forgery’’, ‘‘identifiable individual’’,
‘‘intimate visual depiction’’, and ‘‘minor’’ have the meaning given
such terms in section 223(h) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47
U.S.C. 223), as added by section 2.
This section defines the term ‘‘covered platform’’ as a website, on-
line service, online application, or mobile application: (i) that serves
the public and (I) that primarily provides a forum for user-gen-
erated content, including messages, videos, images, games, and
audio files; or (II) for which it is in the regular course of trade or
business of the website, online service, online application, or mobile
application to publish, curate, host, or make available content of
nonconsensual intimate visual depictions.
The term ‘‘covered platform’’ does not include: (i) broadband
internet access service providers (as described in section 8.1(b) of
title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or successor regulation), (ii)
electronic mail, (iii) except for those covered platforms that publish
or make available in the regular course of business nonconsensual
intimate visual depictions, an online service, application, or website
that consists primarily of content that is not user generated but is
preselected by the provider of such; and for which any chat, com-

ment, or interactive functionality is incidental to, directly related
to, or dependent on providing content.
Section 5. Severability

ment made by the Act is determined to be unenforceable or invalid,
all remaining provisions and amendments shall not be affected.

(6) The Attorney General may bring a suit in the appropriate dis-
trict court of the United States to enjoin any act or practice which
violates paragraph (1) or (2). An injunction may be granted in ac-
cordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(c)(1) A common carrier within the District of Columbia or within
any State, or in interstate or foreign commerce, shall not, to the
extent technically feasible, provide access to a communication spec-

control, including transmission, downloading, intermediate
storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not
include the creation of the content of the communication.
(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection
shall not be applicable to a person who is a conspirator with
an entity actively involved in the creation or knowing distribu-
tion of communications that violate this section, or who know-

MINORITY VIEWS
In H.R. 633, the TAKE IT DOWN Act, Congress entrusts the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with delivering on a promise to
provide recourse to those victimized by bad actors who have ex-
ploited advancing technology including generative AI that can de-
pict vulnerable individuals in sexually explicit situations that never
occurred, and ubiquitous online social media that allows images to
be distributed to an entire contact list at the push of a button, de-
stroying reputations and lives in the process.
When Congress created the FTC, it recognized the need for a
government entity that could protect Americans faced with enor-
mous and powerful corporations focused solely on pursuit of profit.
Congress recognized that a dynamic marketplace with constant ad-
vances in business practices and technology required the develop-
ment of specialized expertise, and that to have trust and legitimacy
in the eyes of consumers, markets, and the courts, such an agency
would require independence and ideological balance, ensuring a
fair hearing, transparency, and accountability.
This is why Congress specifically constructed the FTC as a multi-
member Commission led by Commissioners representing more than
one political party, with terms that extended longer than those of
Representatives, Senators, or Presidents. To avoid political pres-
sure from a presidential administration, the FTC Act is clear that
once appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, no
Commissioner can be dismissed without due cause, explicitly speci-
fied as ‘‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’’
For more than a century, the FTC has lived up to its statutory
obligation as an independent agency protecting competition and
consumers. Recognizing the FTC’s good work, Congress has given
it additional statutory authority over a wide range of consumer
protection areas.
It is, therefore, unconscionable that in hearings and markup re-
garding H.R. 633 and the online dangers allowed to proliferate by
Big Tech, where the role for the FTC to responsibly monitor and
bring accountability to rogue corporations could not be more appar-
ent or urgent, the majority abandoned its duty to defend the Com-
mission and its leaders against clear ideological animus.
Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who President Trump
has illegally attempted to fire without cause, was called as a wit-
ness in the March 26, 2025, hearing entitled ‘‘The World Wild Web:
Examining Harms Online,’’ where she forcefully argued for the
FTC’s important duty to act on the very harms under discussion
in an independent and transparent manner. Commissioner Slaugh-
ter recounted how in her long service to the Commission, the agen-
cy had vigorously pursued this mission across Presidential admin-
istrations with all the authorities granted by Congress. Commis-
sioner Slaughter’s testimony strongly made the case that Congress
(18)

would be right to entrust an independent FTC, and its Commis-
sioners, with once again protecting vulnerable Americans and that
they would continue to do so through their full statutory terms re-
gardless of what political party might be in power at the time.
Despite this, the majority insisted in its hearing announcements
and at the hearing itself on referring to Ms. Slaughter as a
‘‘former’’ Commissioner, inexplicably attempting to legitimize the
unlawful actions of a President pursuing a nakedly political agenda
by claiming the ability to fire independent FTC commissioners at
a whim, directly contravening established law and precedent.
At the April 8, 2025 Committee markup of H.R. 633, Representa-
tive Soto introduced an amendment to allow the Committee mem-
bers to vote to address this clear law violation and reaffirm their
Constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government by condi-
tioning the effective date of H.R. 633 on the recognition that the
President’s unlawful attempt to fire Commissioner Slaughter and
her Colleague Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya without cause was con-
trary to law and that these Commissioners were entitled to con-
tinue to serve out their terms, ensuring transparency and legit-
imacy for the agency tasked with enforcing the critical notice and
takedown provisions of the bill.
The minority also introduced several amendments to make H.R.
633 stronger, clearer, and to address areas of the bill where insuffi-
cient consideration was given to the possibility of loopholes and un-
intended consequences that might threaten the good the bill aims
to do for victims. The majority made clear, however, that it was un-
willing to consider amendments to H.R. 633 because it intended to
adopt the exact same version of the Take it Down Act that has al-
ready moved through the Senate.
The goals of H.R. 633 are laudable, but rather than rushing this
bill through the Committee the majority should have taken more
care to clarify and strengthen the bill and to defend the statutory
independence of the agency that it intends to enforce the notice and
takedown provisions of this Act, to ensure that the FTC can do its
work without fear or favor.
