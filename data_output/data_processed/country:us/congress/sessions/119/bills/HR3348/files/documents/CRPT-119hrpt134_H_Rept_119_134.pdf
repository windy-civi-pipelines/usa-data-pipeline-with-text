Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this paragraph and

‘‘(A) review the list of certifications, designations, and credentials des-
ignated as qualifying natural persons for accredited investor status pursu-
ant to Rule 501(a)(10) (17 CFR 230.501(a)(10));
‘‘(B) add such certifications, designations, and credentials to such list as

nancial sophistication, knowledge, and experience in financial matters of an
individual to the certifications, designations, and credentials included on

‘‘(C) adjust or modify such list as the Commission determines necessary

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3348, the Accredited Investor Definition Review Act, was in-
troduced on May 13, 2025, by Representative Bill Huizenga (MI–
04). H.R. 3348 requires the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) to review the list of certifications, designations, and creden-
tials for individuals to qualify as an accredited investor and add
additional certifications, designations, and credentials that the SEC
determines are substantially similar. The bill requires the SEC to
repeat this process every five years after the initial assessment.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Under current law, accredited investors are defined as people or
entities with sufficient financial sophistication and resources to
sustain the risk of loss.1 H.R. 3348 expands the definition to in-
117 C.F.R. §270.

clude all individuals who demonstrate they have a sufficient under-
standing of the offering and the risks involved. This bill will ensure
that investments in high-growth private companies are not re-
served for only the elite, wealthy investors who currently qualify
as accredited investors.

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3348 is empower sophisticated-
but-not-wealthy investors to qualify as accredited investors by re-
quiring the SEC to review the list of certifications, designations,
and credentials for individuals to qualify as an accredited investor
and add additional certifications, designations, and credentials that
the SEC determines are substantially similar.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3348. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 3348 as the ‘‘Accredited Investor Definition
Review Act.’’
Section 2. Definition of accredited investor
This section amends the definition of an accredited investor to in-
clude individuals who have certifications, designations, or creden-
tials as the SEC determines necessary or appropriate.
Section 3. Periodic review of certifications, designations, and cre-
dentials
This section amends Dodd-Frank to require the SEC to review
the list of certifications, designations, and credentials to qualify as
an accredited investor within 18 months and every five years there-
after. This section also directs the SEC to add such certificates,
designations, and credentials to the list that the SEC determines
are substantially similar to the ones included on the list at the
time of review and to adjust the list if the SEC deems it necessary
in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

TITLE IV—REGULATION OF ADVISERS
TO HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHERS
* * * * * * *
SEC. 413. ADJUSTING THE ACCREDITED INVESTOR STANDARD.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall adjust any net worth
standard for an accredited investor, as set forth in the rules of the
Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, so that the indi-
vidual net worth of any natural person, or joint net worth with the
spouse of that person, at the time of purchase, is more than
$1,000,000 (as such amount is adjusted periodically by rule of the
Commission), excluding the value of the primary residence of such
natural person, except that during the 4-year period that begins on
the date of enactment of this Act, any net worth standard shall be
$1,000,000, excluding the value of the primary residence of such
natural person.
(b) REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT.—
(1) INITIAL REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT.—
(A) INITIAL REVIEW.—The Commission may undertake a
review of the definition of the term ‘‘accredited investor’’,
as such term applies to natural persons, to determine
whether the requirements of the definition, excluding the
requirement relating to the net worth standard described
in subsection (a), should be adjusted or modified for the
protection of investors, in the public interest, and in light
of the economy.
(B) ADJUSTMENT OR MODIFICATION.—Upon completion of
a review under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, by
notice and comment rulemaking, make such adjustments
to the definition of the term ‘‘accredited investor’’, exclud-
ing adjusting or modifying the requirement relating to the
net worth standard described in subsection (a), as such
term applies to natural persons, as the Commission may
deem appropriate for the protection of investors, in the
public interest, and in light of the economy.
(2) SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS AND ADJUSTMENT.—
(A) SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS.—Not earlier than 4 years
after the date of enactment of this Act, and not less fre-
quently than once every 4 years thereafter, the Commis-
sion shall undertake a review of the definition, in its en-
tirety, of the term ‘‘accredited investor’’, as defined in sec-
tion 230.215 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or
any successor thereto, as such term applies to natural per-
sons, to determine whether the requirements of the defini-
tion should be adjusted or modified for the protection of in-
vestors, in the public interest, and in light of the economy.
(B) ADJUSTMENT OR MODIFICATION.—Upon completion of
a review under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, by
notice and comment rulemaking, make such adjustments
to the definition of the term ‘‘accredited investor’’, as de-
fined in section 230.215 of title 17, Code of Federal Regula-
tions, or any successor thereto, as such term applies to
natural persons, as the Commission may deem appropriate

for the protection of investors, in the public interest, and
in light of the economy.
(3) PERIODIC REVIEW OF CERTIFICATIONS, DESIGNATIONS, AND
CREDENTIALS.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the
enactment of this paragraph and not less frequently than once
every 5 years thereafter, the Commission shall—
(A) review the list of certifications, designations, and cre-
dentials designated as qualifying natural persons for ac-
credited investor status pursuant to Rule 501(a)(10) (17
CFR 230.501(a)(10));
(B) add such certifications, designations, and credentials
to such list as the Commission determines are substantially
similar in measuring the financial sophistication, knowl-
edge, and experience in financial matters of an individual
to the certifications, designations, and credentials included
on such list at the time of such review; and
(C) adjust or modify such list as the Commission deter-
mines necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill gives the SEC broad discretion to expand the accredited
investor definition as it sees fit. It further requires the SEC to re-
view the list of certifications and credentials for individuals to
qualify as an accredited investor and add additional certifications
and credentials to such list which the SEC determines are substan-
tially similar to existing ones on a periodic basis.
Democrats no longer support this bill—which would give the SEC
broad discretion to amend the accredited investor definition—due
to the current SEC’s de-prioritization of investor protection and re-
duced independence from the current presidential administration.
Democrats were willing to accept this bill at the May 2025 markup
had Republicans accepted a Democratic-sponsored revision that
would limit the SEC’s discretion to change the definition; however,
this revision was not accepted by the Chairman. While a prior
version of this bill was agreed to by a recorded vote of 41–2 in
markup in the 118th Congress, Democrats voted against this bill
at the May 2025 markup as they believe the current SEC is no
longer sufficiently independent and could unilaterally weaken the
accredited investor definition.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3348.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
