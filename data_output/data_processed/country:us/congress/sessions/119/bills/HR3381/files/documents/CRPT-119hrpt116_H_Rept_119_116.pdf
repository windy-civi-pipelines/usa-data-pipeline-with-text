PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3381, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, was introduced
on May 14, 2025, by Representative Ann Wagner (MO–02). H.R.
3381 codifies Rule 163B under the Securities Act of 1933 by allow-
ing an issuer to communicate with potential investors to determine
interest in a securities offering, either before or after the filing of
a registration statement (i.e. ‘‘test the waters’’). The bill also allows
issuers to submit a confidential draft registration statement to the
SEC for review prior to public filing. The bill updates the public fil-
ing condition to allow any issuer conducting an initial public offer-
ing to file its registration statement publicly 10 days before the ef-
fective date of the registration statement.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
During its initial public offering (IPO), an emerging growth com-
pany (EGC) is permitted to begin SEC registration on a confiden-
tial basis if the EGC publicly files its previously confidential reg-
istration statement at least 15 days before conducting a road

show—or 15 days before the date of effectiveness if not conducting
a road show. This provision is intended to facilitate public review
of the registration statement between the first public filing and the
IPO. However, experience has shown that 10 days is more than
ample time for that purpose. Moreover, the application of the cur-
rent requirement can sometimes be unclear based on uncertainty
surrounding the definition of a road show. As such, H.R. 3381 en-
hances efficiency and provides greater certainty by reducing the
minimum time between the first public filing and pricing and refer-
ring to the date of effectiveness rather than the date of a road
show, which is sometimes unclear. The bill also facilitates capital
formation and conforms practices for EGCs and non-EGCs, which
maintains consistency in the registration process.
H.R. 3381 encourages more companies to go public and provide
better information to investors by expanding popular provisions of
the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act to ensure that all
companies—rather than just EGCs—may submit confidential draft
registration statements to the SEC and are allowed to ‘‘test the
waters.’’

FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section cites H.R. 3381 as the ‘‘Encouraging Public Offerings
Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Expanding testing the waters
This section amends the Securities Act of 1933 to allow any
issuer to communicate with potential investors to determine inter-
est in a securities offering, either before or after the filing of a reg-
istration statement (i.e. test the waters). This section also allows
the SEC to promulgate rules regarding written or oral communica-
tions by an issuer other than an emerging growth company as the
SEC determines appropriate. However, prior to such rulemaking
the SEC must submit to Congress a report containing a list of find-
ings supporting the basis of the rulemaking.
Section 3. Confidential review of draft registration statements
This section allows issuers to submit confidential draft registra-
tion statements with respect to an initial public offering, initial
registration of a security of the issuer under Section 12(b) of the
Exchange Act of 1934, or follow-on offerings to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) for review prior to public filing.
In such instances, this section also requires the issuer to file its
registration statement publicly 10 days before the effective date of
the registration statement when conducting an IPO, 10 days before
listing on an exchange for an initial registration of a security under
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and 48 hours before the effective
date of the registration statement for a follow-on offering. This sec-
tion also allows the SEC to promulgate rules regarding confidential
submissions by an issuer other than an emerging growth company
as the SEC determines appropriate. However, prior to such rule-
making the SEC must submit to Congress a report containing a list
of findings supporting the basis of the rulemaking.

REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES AND SIGNING OF REGISTRATION

SEC. 6. (a) Any security may be registered with the Commission

registration statement in triplicate, at least one of which shall be
signed by each issuer, its principal executive officer or officers, its
principal financial officer, its comptroller or principal accounting of-
ficer, and the majority of its board of directors or persons per-

persons performing similar functions, by the majority of the per-

in case the issuer is a foreign or Territorial person by its duly au-
thorized representative in the United States; except that when
such registration statement relates to a security issued by a foreign
government, or political subdivision thereof, it need be signed only

sumed to have been so written by authority of the person whose
signature is so affixed and the burden of proof, in the event such
authority shall be denied, shall be upon the party denying the

tion statements filed with the Commission during such fis-
cal year as determined by the Commission, after consulta-
tion with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office
of Management and Budget, using the methodology re-
quired for projections pursuant to section 257 of the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

istration statement shall not be deemed to have taken place unless

tified bank check or cash for the amount of the fee required under
subsection (b).
(d) The information contained in or filed with any registration
statement shall be made available to the public under such regula-
tions as the Commission may prescribe, and copies thereof, photo-

tions statement or the end of the 1-year period beginning on
the date the company ceases to be an emerging growth com-

lations, subject to public notice and comment, to impose
such other terms, conditions, or requirements on the sub-
mission of draft registration statements described under
this subsection by an issuer other than an emerging growth

scribed under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall sub-

sidered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such sec-
