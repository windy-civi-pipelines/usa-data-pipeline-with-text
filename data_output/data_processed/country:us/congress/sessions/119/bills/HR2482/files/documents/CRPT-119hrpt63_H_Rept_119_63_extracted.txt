Robert E. Latta (R–OH) and Doris Matsui (D–CA). The bill would
authorize $57,000,000 in appropriations for the National Tele-
communications and Information Administration (NTIA) for Fiscal
Year 2025 (FY25) and $57,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26).
The bill would elevate the Administrator of NTIA from the Assist-
ant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to
the Under Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Infor-
mation. Additionally, the bill would codify and provide direction to
two offices within NTIA. Finally, the bill would repeal outdated
and unnecessary statutory reporting requirements while consoli-
dating and streamlining redundant reports required by law.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Committee on Energy and Commerce has prioritized the re-
authorization of federal agencies under its jurisdiction in the 119th
Congress, and the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration has not been reauthorized since 1992.
Since the last reauthorization of NTIA, the mission of the agency
has changed significantly, and the appropriations provided to the
agency have tripled. Accordingly, H.R. 2482 would authorize appro-
priations to the NTIA for FY25 and FY26, elevate the head of
NTIA from an Assistant Secretary of Commerce to Under Secretary
of Commerce, authorize NTIA’s Office of Spectrum Management
and Office of International Affairs, and otherwise provide greater
Congressional oversight of the NTIA.
COMMITTEE ACTION
On May 23, 2023, the Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology held a hearing entitled, ‘‘Oversight and Reauthorization
of the National Telecommunications and Information Administra-
tion,’’ on a discussion draft substantially similar to H.R. 2482. The
Subcommittee received testimony from:
• Alan Davidson, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Com-
munications and Information and Administrator, National
Telecommunications and Information Administration.
On July 12, 2023, the Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology met in an open markup session and forwarded the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information Administration Reau-
thorization Act,1 without amendment, to the full Committee by a
voice vote.
On July 27, 2023, the full Committee on Energy and Commerce
met in an open markup session and ordered H.R. 4510, as amend-
ed, favorably reported to the House by a record vote of 48 yeas and
0 nays.
On April 8, 2025, the full Committee on Energy and Commerce
met in an open markup session and ordered H.R. 2482, as amend-
ed, favorably reported to the House by a voice vote.

trum, including spectrum management techniques to promote
increased shared use of the spectrum that does not cause
harmful interference as a means of increasing commercial ac-
cess.
SEC. 113. IDENTIFICATION OF REALLOCABLE FREQUENCIES.
(a) IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.—The Secretary shall, within 18
months after the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 and within 6 months after the date of
enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, prepare and submit
to the President and the Congress a report identifying and recom-
mending for reallocation bands of frequencies—
(1) that are allocated on a primary basis for Federal Govern-
ment use;
(2) that are not required for the present or identifiable future
needs of the Federal Government;
(3) that can feasibly be made available, as of the date of sub-
mission of the report or at any time during the next 15 years,
for use under the 1934 Act (other than for Federal Government
stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act);
(4) the transfer of which (from Federal Government use) will
not result in costs to the Federal Government, or losses of serv-
ices or benefits to the public, that are excessive in relation to
the benefits to the public that may be provided by non-Federal
licensees; and
(5) that are most likely to have the greatest potential for pro-
ductive uses and public benefits under the 1934 Act if allocated
for non-Federal use.
(b) MINIMUM AMOUNT OF SPECTRUM RECOMMENDED.—
(1) INITIAL REALLOCATION REPORT.—In accordance with the
provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for
reallocation in the initial report required by subsection (a), for
use other than by Federal Government stations under section
305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that
in the aggregate span not less than 200 megahertz, that are
located below 5 gigahertz, and that meet the criteria specified
in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a). Such bands of
frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3
gigahertz, that span in the aggregate not less than 100 mega-
hertz.
(2) MIXED USES PERMITTED TO BE COUNTED.—Bands of fre-
quencies which a report of the Secretary under subsection (a)
or (d)(1) recommends be partially retained for use by Federal
Government stations, but which are also recommended to be
reallocated to be made available under the 1934 Act for use by
non-Federal stations, may be counted toward the minimum

spectrum required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection,
except that—
(A) the bands of frequencies counted under this para-
graph may not count toward more than one-half of the
minimums required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this sub-

Section 13:
section;
(B) a band of frequencies may not be counted under this
paragraph unless the assignments of the band to Federal
Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47
U.S.C. 305) are limited by geographic area, by time, or by
other means so as to guarantee that the potential use to
be made by such Federal Government stations is substan-
tially less (as measured by geographic area, time, or other-
wise) than the potential use to be made by non-Federal
stations; and
(C) the operational sharing permitted under this para-
graph shall be subject to the interference regulations pre-
scribed by the Commission pursuant to section 305(a) of
the 1934 Act and to coordination procedures that the Com-
mission and the Secretary shall jointly establish and im-
plement to ensure against harmful interference.
(3) SECOND REALLOCATION REPORT.—In accordance with the
provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for
reallocation in the second report required by subsection (a), for
use other than by Federal Government stations under section
305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), a band or bands of fre-
quencies that—
(A) in the aggregate span not less than 12 megahertz;
(B) are located below 3 gigahertz; and
(C) meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through
(5) of subsection (a).
(c) CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION.—
(1) NEEDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.—In determining
whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in
subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall—
(A) consider whether the band of frequencies is used to
provide a communications service that is or could be avail-
able from a commercial provider or other vendor;
(B) seek to promote—
(i) the maximum practicable reliance on commer-
cially available substitutes;
(ii) the sharing of frequencies (as permitted under
subsection (b)(2));
(iii) the development and use of new communica-
tions technologies; and
(iv) the use of nonradiating communications systems
where practicable; and
(C) seek to avoid—
(i) serious degradation of Federal Government serv-
ices and operations;

(2) FEASIBILITY OF USE.—In determining whether a fre-
quency band meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(3),
the Secretary shall—
(A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the
Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C.
303) within 15 years;
(B) assume reasonable rates of scientific progress and
growth of demand for telecommunications services;
(C) seek to include frequencies which can be used to
stimulate the development of new technologies; and
(D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to rees-
tablish services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.
(3) ANALYSIS OF BENEFITS.—In determining whether a band
of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(5),
the Secretary shall consider—
(A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available
that is capable of utilizing the band;
(B) the proximity of frequencies that are already as-
signed for commercial or other non-Federal use;
(C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users
could share the frequency with amateur radio licensees;
and
(D) the activities of foreign governments in making fre-
quencies available for experimentation or commercial as-
signments in order to support their domestic manufactur-
ers of equipment.
(4) POWER AGENCY FREQUENCIES.—
(A) APPLICABILITY OF CRITERIA.—The criteria specified
by subsection (a) shall be deemed not to be met for any
purpose under this part with regard to any frequency as-
signment to, or any frequency assignment used by, a Fed-
eral power agency for the purpose of withdrawing that as-
signment.
(B) MIXED USE ELIGIBILITY.—The frequencies assigned to
any Federal power agency may only be eligible for mixed
use under subsection (b)(2) in geographically separate
areas, but in those cases where a frequency is to be shared
by an affected Federal power agency and a non-Federal
user, such use by the non-Federal user shall not cause
harmful interference to the affected Federal power agency
or adversely affect the reliability of its power system.
(C) DEFINITION.—As used in this paragraph, the term
‘‘Federal power agency’’ means the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority, the Bonneville Power Administration, the Western
Area Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Ad-
ministration, the Southeastern Power Administration, or
the Alaska Power Administration.
(5) LIMITATION ON REALLOCATION.—None of the frequencies
recommended for reallocation in the reports required by this
subsection shall have been recommended, prior to the date of
enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,
for reallocation to non-Federal use by international agreement.

(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this section and sec-
tion 118, the term ‘‘relocation or sharing costs’’ means the
costs incurred by a Federal entity in connection with the
auction of spectrum frequencies or the sharing of spectrum
frequencies (including the auction or a planned auction of
the rights to use spectrum frequencies on a shared basis
with such entity) in order to achieve comparable capability
of systems as before the relocation or sharing arrange-
ment. Such term includes, with respect to relocation or
sharing, as the case may be—
(i) the costs of any modification or replacement of
equipment, spares, associated ancillary equipment,
software, facilities, operating manuals, training, or
compliance with regulations that are attributable to
relocation or sharing;
(ii) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software,
site acquisition, and construction, as well as any legiti-
mate and prudent transaction expense, including
term-limited Federal civil servant and contractor staff
necessary to carry out the relocation or sharing activi-
ties of a Federal entity, and reasonable additional
costs incurred by the Federal entity that are attrib-
utable to relocation or sharing, including increased re-
curring costs associated with the replacement of facili-
ties;
(iii) the costs of research, engineering studies, eco-
nomic analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred
in connection with—
(I) calculating the estimated relocation or shar-
ing costs that are provided to the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (4)(A);
(II) determining the technical or operational fea-
sibility of relocation to 1 or more potential reloca-
tion bands; or
(III) planning for or managing a relocation or
sharing arrangement (including spectrum coordi-
nation with auction winners);
(iv) the one-time costs of any modification of equip-
ment reasonably necessary—
(I) to accommodate non-Federal use of shared
frequencies; or
(II) in the case of eligible frequencies reallocated
for exclusive non-Federal use and assigned
through a system of competitive bidding under

Section 14:
section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934
(47 U.S.C. 309(j)) but with respect to which a Fed-
eral entity retains primary allocation or protected
status for a period of time after the completion of
the competitive bidding process, to accommodate
shared Federal and non-Federal use of such fre-
quencies for such period; and
(v) the costs associated with the accelerated replace-
ment of systems and equipment if the acceleration is
necessary to ensure the timely relocation of systems to

a new frequency assignment or the timely accommoda-
tion of sharing of Federal frequencies.
(B) COMPARABLE CAPABILITY OF SYSTEMS.—For purposes
of subparagraph (A), comparable capability of systems—
(i) may be achieved by relocating a Federal Govern-
ment station to a new frequency assignment, by relo-
cating a Federal Government station to a different ge-
ographic location, by modifying Federal Government
equipment to mitigate interference or use less spec-
trum, in terms of bandwidth, geography, or time, and
thereby permitting spectrum sharing (including shar-
ing among relocated Federal entities and incumbents
to make spectrum available for non-Federal use) or re-
location, or by utilizing an alternative technology; and
(ii) includes the acquisition of state-of-the-art re-
placement systems intended to meet comparable oper-
ational scope, which may include incidental increases
in functionality.
(4) NOTICE TO COMMISSION OF ESTIMATED RELOCATION OR
SHARING COSTS.—
(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18
months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligi-
ble frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months
prior to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA,
on behalf of the Federal entities and after review by the
Office of Management and Budget, shall notify the Com-

‘‘security testing’’ means accessing a computer, computer sys-
tem, or computer network, solely for the purpose of good faith
testing, investigating, or correcting, a security flaw or vulner-
ability, with the authorization of the owner or operator of such
computer, computer system, or computer network.
(2) PERMISSIBLE ACTS OF SECURITY TESTING.—Notwith-
standing the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a viola-
tion of that subsection for a person to engage in an act of secu-
rity testing, if such act does not constitute infringement under
this title or a violation of applicable law other than this sec-
tion, including section 1030 of title 18 and those provisions of
title 18 amended by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of

Section 25:
1986.

ment shall not apply until there are 1,000 Beta format
analog video cassette recorders sold in the United
States in any one calendar year after the date of the
enactment of this chapter;
(iv) 8mm format analog video cassette recorder that
is not an analog video cassette camcorder, unless such
recorder conforms to the automatic gain control copy
control technology, except that this requirement shall
not apply until there are 20,000 such recorders sold in
the United States in any one calendar year after the
date of the enactment of this chapter; or
(v) analog video cassette recorder that records using
an NTSC format video input and that is not otherwise
covered under clauses (i) through (iv), unless such de-
vice conforms to the automatic gain control copy con-
trol technology.

ter, no person shall manufacture, import, offer to the pub-
lic, provide or otherwise traffic in—
(i) any VHS format analog video cassette recorder or
any 8mm format analog video cassette recorder if the
design of the model of such recorder has been modified
after such date of enactment so that a model of re-
corder that previously conformed to the automatic
gain control copy control technology no longer con-
forms to such technology; or
(ii) any VHS format analog video cassette recorder,
or any 8mm format analog video cassette recorder that
is not an 8mm analog video cassette camcorder, if the
design of the model of such recorder has been modified
after such date of enactment so that a model of re-
corder that previously conformed to the four-line
colorstripe copy control technology no longer conforms
to such technology.
Manufacturers that have not previously manufactured or
sold a VHS format analog video cassette recorder, or an
8mm format analog cassette recorder, shall be required to
conform to the four-line colorstripe copy control technology
in the initial model of any such recorder manufactured
after the date of the enactment of this chapter, and there-
after to continue conforming to the four-line colorstripe
copy control technology. For purposes of this subpara-
graph, an analog video cassette recorder ‘‘conforms to’’ the
four-line colorstripe copy control technology if it records a
signal that, when played back by the playback function of
that recorder in the normal viewing mode, exhibits, on a
reference display device, a display containing distracting
visible lines through portions of the viewable picture.

has achieved comparable capability of systems, the NTIA shall
terminate or limit the entity’s authorization and notify the
Commission that the entity’s relocation has been completed or
sharing arrangement has been implemented. The NTIA shall
also terminate such entity’s authorization if the NTIA deter-

Robert E. Latta (R–OH) and Doris Matsui (D–CA). The bill would
authorize $57,000,000 in appropriations for the National Tele-
communications and Information Administration (NTIA) for Fiscal
Year 2025 (FY25) and $57,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26).
The bill would elevate the Administrator of NTIA from the Assist-
ant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to
the Under Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Infor-
mation. Additionally, the bill would codify and provide direction to
two offices within NTIA. Finally, the bill would repeal outdated
and unnecessary statutory reporting requirements while consoli-
dating and streamlining redundant reports required by law.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Committee on Energy and Commerce has prioritized the re-
authorization of federal agencies under its jurisdiction in the 119th
Congress, and the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration has not been reauthorized since 1992.
Since the last reauthorization of NTIA, the mission of the agency

cess.
SEC. 113. IDENTIFICATION OF REALLOCABLE FREQUENCIES.
(a) IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.—The Secretary shall, within 18
months after the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 and within 6 months after the date of
enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, prepare and submit
to the President and the Congress a report identifying and recom-
mending for reallocation bands of frequencies—
(1) that are allocated on a primary basis for Federal Govern-
ment use;
(2) that are not required for the present or identifiable future
needs of the Federal Government;
(3) that can feasibly be made available, as of the date of sub-
mission of the report or at any time during the next 15 years,
for use under the 1934 Act (other than for Federal Government
stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act);
(4) the transfer of which (from Federal Government use) will
not result in costs to the Federal Government, or losses of serv-
ices or benefits to the public, that are excessive in relation to
the benefits to the public that may be provided by non-Federal
licensees; and
(5) that are most likely to have the greatest potential for pro-
ductive uses and public benefits under the 1934 Act if allocated
for non-Federal use.
(b) MINIMUM AMOUNT OF SPECTRUM RECOMMENDED.—
(1) INITIAL REALLOCATION REPORT.—In accordance with the
provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for
reallocation in the initial report required by subsection (a), for
use other than by Federal Government stations under section
305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that
in the aggregate span not less than 200 megahertz, that are
located below 5 gigahertz, and that meet the criteria specified
in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a). Such bands of
frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3
gigahertz, that span in the aggregate not less than 100 mega-
hertz.
(2) MIXED USES PERMITTED TO BE COUNTED.—Bands of fre-
quencies which a report of the Secretary under subsection (a)
or (d)(1) recommends be partially retained for use by Federal
Government stations, but which are also recommended to be
reallocated to be made available under the 1934 Act for use by
non-Federal stations, may be counted toward the minimum

spectrum required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection,
except that—
(A) the bands of frequencies counted under this para-
graph may not count toward more than one-half of the
minimums required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this sub-
section;
(B) a band of frequencies may not be counted under this
paragraph unless the assignments of the band to Federal
Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47
U.S.C. 305) are limited by geographic area, by time, or by
other means so as to guarantee that the potential use to
be made by such Federal Government stations is substan-
tially less (as measured by geographic area, time, or other-
wise) than the potential use to be made by non-Federal
stations; and
(C) the operational sharing permitted under this para-
graph shall be subject to the interference regulations pre-
scribed by the Commission pursuant to section 305(a) of
the 1934 Act and to coordination procedures that the Com-
mission and the Secretary shall jointly establish and im-
plement to ensure against harmful interference.
(3) SECOND REALLOCATION REPORT.—In accordance with the
provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for
reallocation in the second report required by subsection (a), for
use other than by Federal Government stations under section
305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), a band or bands of fre-
quencies that—
(A) in the aggregate span not less than 12 megahertz;
(B) are located below 3 gigahertz; and
(C) meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through
(5) of subsection (a).
(c) CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION.—
(1) NEEDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.—In determining
whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in
subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall—
(A) consider whether the band of frequencies is used to
provide a communications service that is or could be avail-
able from a commercial provider or other vendor;
(B) seek to promote—

(2) FEASIBILITY OF USE.—In determining whether a fre-
quency band meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(3),
the Secretary shall—
(A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the
Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C.
303) within 15 years;
(B) assume reasonable rates of scientific progress and
growth of demand for telecommunications services;
(C) seek to include frequencies which can be used to
stimulate the development of new technologies; and
(D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to rees-
tablish services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.
(3) ANALYSIS OF BENEFITS.—In determining whether a band
of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(5),
the Secretary shall consider—
(A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available
that is capable of utilizing the band;
(B) the proximity of frequencies that are already as-
signed for commercial or other non-Federal use;
(C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users
could share the frequency with amateur radio licensees;
and
(D) the activities of foreign governments in making fre-
quencies available for experimentation or commercial as-
signments in order to support their domestic manufactur-
ers of equipment.
(4) POWER AGENCY FREQUENCIES.—
(A) APPLICABILITY OF CRITERIA.—The criteria specified
by subsection (a) shall be deemed not to be met for any
purpose under this part with regard to any frequency as-
signment to, or any frequency assignment used by, a Fed-
eral power agency for the purpose of withdrawing that as-
signment.
(B) MIXED USE ELIGIBILITY.—The frequencies assigned to
any Federal power agency may only be eligible for mixed
use under subsection (b)(2) in geographically separate
areas, but in those cases where a frequency is to be shared
by an affected Federal power agency and a non-Federal
user, such use by the non-Federal user shall not cause
harmful interference to the affected Federal power agency
or adversely affect the reliability of its power system.
(C) DEFINITION.—As used in this paragraph, the term
‘‘Federal power agency’’ means the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority, the Bonneville Power Administration, the Western
Area Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Ad-
ministration, the Southeastern Power Administration, or
the Alaska Power Administration.
(5) LIMITATION ON REALLOCATION.—None of the frequencies
recommended for reallocation in the reports required by this
subsection shall have been recommended, prior to the date of
enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,
for reallocation to non-Federal use by international agreement.

(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this section and sec-
tion 118, the term ‘‘relocation or sharing costs’’ means the
costs incurred by a Federal entity in connection with the
auction of spectrum frequencies or the sharing of spectrum
frequencies (including the auction or a planned auction of
the rights to use spectrum frequencies on a shared basis
with such entity) in order to achieve comparable capability
of systems as before the relocation or sharing arrange-
ment. Such term includes, with respect to relocation or
sharing, as the case may be—
(i) the costs of any modification or replacement of
equipment, spares, associated ancillary equipment,
software, facilities, operating manuals, training, or
compliance with regulations that are attributable to
relocation or sharing;
(ii) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software,
site acquisition, and construction, as well as any legiti-
mate and prudent transaction expense, including
term-limited Federal civil servant and contractor staff
necessary to carry out the relocation or sharing activi-
ties of a Federal entity, and reasonable additional
costs incurred by the Federal entity that are attrib-
utable to relocation or sharing, including increased re-
curring costs associated with the replacement of facili-
ties;
(iii) the costs of research, engineering studies, eco-
nomic analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred
in connection with—
(I) calculating the estimated relocation or shar-
ing costs that are provided to the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (4)(A);
(II) determining the technical or operational fea-
sibility of relocation to 1 or more potential reloca-
tion bands; or
(III) planning for or managing a relocation or
sharing arrangement (including spectrum coordi-
nation with auction winners);
(iv) the one-time costs of any modification of equip-
ment reasonably necessary—
(I) to accommodate non-Federal use of shared
frequencies; or
(II) in the case of eligible frequencies reallocated
for exclusive non-Federal use and assigned
through a system of competitive bidding under
section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934
(47 U.S.C. 309(j)) but with respect to which a Fed-
eral entity retains primary allocation or protected
status for a period of time after the completion of
the competitive bidding process, to accommodate
shared Federal and non-Federal use of such fre-
quencies for such period; and
(v) the costs associated with the accelerated replace-
ment of systems and equipment if the acceleration is
necessary to ensure the timely relocation of systems to

a new frequency assignment or the timely accommoda-
tion of sharing of Federal frequencies.
(B) COMPARABLE CAPABILITY OF SYSTEMS.—For purposes
of subparagraph (A), comparable capability of systems—
(i) may be achieved by relocating a Federal Govern-
ment station to a new frequency assignment, by relo-
cating a Federal Government station to a different ge-
ographic location, by modifying Federal Government
equipment to mitigate interference or use less spec-
trum, in terms of bandwidth, geography, or time, and
thereby permitting spectrum sharing (including shar-
ing among relocated Federal entities and incumbents
to make spectrum available for non-Federal use) or re-
location, or by utilizing an alternative technology; and
(ii) includes the acquisition of state-of-the-art re-
placement systems intended to meet comparable oper-
ational scope, which may include incidental increases
in functionality.
(4) NOTICE TO COMMISSION OF ESTIMATED RELOCATION OR
SHARING COSTS.—
(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18
months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligi-
ble frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months
prior to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA,
on behalf of the Federal entities and after review by the
Office of Management and Budget, shall notify the Com-
mission of estimated relocation or sharing costs and
timelines for such relocation or sharing.
(B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA
shall provide such entity with information regarding an al-
ternative frequency assignment or assignments to which
their radiocommunications operations could be relocated
for purposes of calculating the estimated relocation or
sharing costs and timelines to be submitted to the Com-
mission pursuant to subparagraph (A).
(C) To the extent practicable and consistent with na-
tional security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the
information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the
geographic location of the Federal entities’ facilities or sys-
tems and the frequency bands used by such facilities or
systems.
(5) NOTICE TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND GAO.—The
NTIA shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of relo-
cation or sharing costs to the Commission under paragraph
(4)(A), submit to Committees on Appropriations and Energy
and Commerce of the House of Representatives for approval, to
the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate for approval, and to the
Comptroller General a copy of such estimate and the timelines
for relocation or sharing. Unless disapproved within 30 days,
the estimate shall be approved. If disapproved, the NTIA may
resubmit a revised initial estimate.
(6) IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCEDURES.—The NTIA shall take
such actions as necessary to ensure the timely relocation of
Federal entities’ spectrum-related operations from frequencies

described in paragraph (2) to frequencies or facilities of com-
parable capability and to ensure the timely implementation of
arrangements for the sharing of frequencies described in such
paragraph. Upon a finding by the NTIA that a Federal entity
has achieved comparable capability of systems, the NTIA shall
terminate or limit the entity’s authorization and notify the
Commission that the entity’s relocation has been completed or
sharing arrangement has been implemented. The NTIA shall
also terminate such entity’s authorization if the NTIA deter-
mines that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with
the timeline for relocation or sharing submitted by the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget under section
118(d)(2)(C).
(h) DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLICATION OF RELOCATION OR SHARING
TRANSITION PLANS.—
(1) DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSITION PLAN BY FEDERAL ENTITY.—
Not later than 240 days before the commencement of any auc-
tion of eligible frequencies described in subsection (g)(2), a Fed-
eral entity shall submit to the NTIA and to the Technical
Panel established by paragraph (3) a transition plan for the
implementation by such entity of the relocation or sharing ar-
rangement. The NTIA shall specify, after public input, a com-
mon format for all Federal entities to follow in preparing tran-
sition plans under this paragraph.
(2) CONTENTS OF TRANSITION PLAN.—The transition plan re-
quired by paragraph (1) shall include the following informa-
tion:
(A) The use by the Federal entity of the eligible fre-
quencies to be auctioned, current as of the date of the sub-
mission of the plan.
(B) The geographic location of the facilities or systems of
the Federal entity that use such frequencies.
(C) The frequency bands used by such facilities or sys-
tems, described by geographic location.
(D) The steps to be taken by the Federal entity to relo-
cate its spectrum use from such frequencies or to share
such frequencies, including timelines for specific geo-
graphic locations in sufficient detail to indicate when use
of such frequencies at such locations will be discontinued
by the Federal entity or shared between the Federal entity
and non-Federal users.
(E) The specific interactions between the eligible Federal
entity and the NTIA needed to implement the transition
plan.
(F) The name of the officer or employee of the Federal
entity who is responsible for the relocation or sharing ef-

(v) analog video cassette recorder that records using
an NTSC format video input and that is not otherwise
covered under clauses (i) through (iv), unless such de-
vice conforms to the automatic gain control copy con-
trol technology.
(B) Effective on the date of the enactment of this chap-
ter, no person shall manufacture, import, offer to the pub-
lic, provide or otherwise traffic in—
(i) any VHS format analog video cassette recorder or
any 8mm format analog video cassette recorder if the
design of the model of such recorder has been modified
after such date of enactment so that a model of re-
corder that previously conformed to the automatic
gain control copy control technology no longer con-
forms to such technology; or
(ii) any VHS format analog video cassette recorder,
or any 8mm format analog video cassette recorder that
is not an 8mm analog video cassette camcorder, if the
design of the model of such recorder has been modified
after such date of enactment so that a model of re-
corder that previously conformed to the four-line
colorstripe copy control technology no longer conforms
to such technology.
Manufacturers that have not previously manufactured or
sold a VHS format analog video cassette recorder, or an
8mm format analog cassette recorder, shall be required to
conform to the four-line colorstripe copy control technology
in the initial model of any such recorder manufactured
after the date of the enactment of this chapter, and there-
after to continue conforming to the four-line colorstripe
copy control technology. For purposes of this subpara-
graph, an analog video cassette recorder ‘‘conforms to’’ the
four-line colorstripe copy control technology if it records a
signal that, when played back by the playback function of
that recorder in the normal viewing mode, exhibits, on a
reference display device, a display containing distracting
visible lines through portions of the viewable picture.
