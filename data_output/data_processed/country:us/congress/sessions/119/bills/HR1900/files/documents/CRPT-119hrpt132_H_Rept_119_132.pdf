PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1900, the Bank Failure Prevention Act of 2025, was intro-
duced on March 6, 2025, by Representative Andy Barr (KY–06).
H.R. 1900 establishes uniform procedural timelines for reviewing
merger and acquisition applications submitted by depository insti-
tutions and holding companies. The bill specifically requires the
Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
to notify applicants within 30 days of submission whether their ap-
plications are complete. The bill also mandates final agency ac-
tion—approval or denial—within 90 days of the initial submission
and allows a one-time 30-day extension at the applicant’s request.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The federal merger review process currently lacks predictability
and transparency. Regulators often delay determinations by leav-
ing application records open-ended, using requests for additional
information to avoid statutory deadlines. This uncertainty impairs
strategic planning and discourages timely consolidation and capital
deployment, particularly among smaller institutions. H.R. 1900 ad-
dresses this by creating standardized timeframes and codifying
what constitutes a ‘‘complete’’ application. Agencies must either
confirm completeness or request additional information within 30
days of receiving an application. Upon the applicant’s response, the
application is presumed complete unless regulators identify mate-
rial deficiencies within another 30-day window. Regardless of com-
pleteness status, the bill mandates final agency action within 90
days of initial filing, with a single 30-day extension available only
at the applicant’s request. Additionally, agencies may not consider
third-party reports or opinions when determining application com-
pleteness. This approach encourages accountability while pre-
serving regulators’ discretion to deny any application that fails to
meet safety, soundness, or competition standards.

banks, bank holding companies, and savings and loans holding
companies undergo the same timely reviews, regardless of their in-
stitutional structure and preventing a federal banking agency from
holding up a merger at the insured depository institution level
after it has already been approved at the holding company level,
offered by Representative Barr. The amendment was adopted by
voice vote, a quorum being present.

of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once

Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a

cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.

terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section provides the short title is the ‘‘Bank Failure Preven-
tion Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Complete record on an application
This section requires the relevant banking agencies to determine
whether the record on an initial application is complete within 30
days of receipt. For more complex applications, the agency may ex-
tend this deadline by an additional 30 days. Once the applicant
submits any requested additional information, the record is deemed
complete unless the agency issues a detailed notice within 30 days
identifying any material deficiencies.
The section prohibits agencies from relying on third-party infor-
mation to determine application completeness. It further requires
the agency to grant or deny the application within 90 days of the
initial submission regardless of whether the record is deemed com-
plete. If the agency fails to act within this 90-day period, the appli-
cation is automatically deemed granted.
Additionally, the agency may extend the 90-day deadline once, at
the request of the applicant, but not for more than 30 days beyond
the original 90-day period.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,

pany to become a bank holding company; (2) for any action to be
taken that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of a bank holding
company; (3) for any bank holding company to acquire direct or in-
direct ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if,
after such acquisition, such company will directly or indirectly own
or control more than 5 per centum of the voting shares of such
bank; (4) for any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof, other
than a bank, to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a
bank; or (5) for any bank holding company to merge or consolidate
with any other bank holding company. Notwithstanding the fore-
going this prohibition shall not apply to (A) shares acquired by a
bank, (i) in good faith in a fiduciary capacity, except where such
shares are held under a trust that constitutes a company as de-
fined in section 2(b) and except as provided in paragraphs (2) and
(3) of section 2(g), or (ii) in the regular course of securing or col-
lecting a debt previously contracted in good faith, but any shares
acquired after the date of enactment of this Act in securing or col-
lecting any such previously contracted debt shall be disposed of
within a period of two years from the date on which they were ac-
quired; (B) additional shares acquired by a bank holding company
in a bank in which such bank holding company owned or controlled
a majority of the voting shares prior to such acquisition; or (C) the
acquisition, by a company, of control of a bank in a reorganization
in which a person or group of persons exchanges their shares of the
bank for shares of a newly formed bank holding company and re-
ceives after the reorganization substantially the same proportional
share interest in the holding company as they held in the bank ex-
cept for changes in shareholders’ interests resulting from the exer-
cise of dissenting shareholders’ rights under State or Federal law
if—
(i) immediately following the acquisition—
(I) the bank holding company meets the capital
and other financial standards prescribed by the
Board by regulation for such a bank holding com-
pany; and
(II) the bank is adequately capitalized (as de-
fined in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Act);
(ii) the holding company does not engage in any ac-
tivities other than those of managing and controlling
banks as a result of the reorganization;
(iii) the company provides 30 days prior notice to the
Board and the Board does not object to such trans-
action during such 30-day period; and
(iv) the holding company will not acquire control of
any additional bank as a result of the reorganization.
The Board is authorized upon application by a bank to extend,
from time to time for not more than one year at a time, the two-
year period referred to above for disposing of any shares acquired
by a bank in the regular course of securing or collecting a debt pre-
viously contracted in good faith, if, in the Board’s judgment, such
an extension would not be detrimental to the public interest, but
no such extension shall in the aggregate exceed three years. For
the purpose of the preceding sentence, bank shares acquired after
the date of enactment of the Bank Holding Company Act Amend-

ments of 1970 shall not be deemed to have been acquired in good
faith in a fiduciary capacity if the acquiring bank or company has
sole discretionary authority to exercise voting rights with respect
thereto, but in such instances acquisitions may be made without
prior approval of the Board if the Board, upon application filed
within ninety days after the shares are acquired, approves reten-
tion or, if retention is disapproved, the acquiring bank disposes of
the shares or its sole discretionary voting rights within two years
after issuance of the order of disapproval.
(b)(1) NOTICE AND HEARING REQUIREMENTS.—øUpon receiving¿
(A) IN GENERAL.—Upon receiving from a company any appli-
cation for approval under this section, the Board shall give no-
tice to the Comptroller of the Currency, if the applicant com-
pany or any bank the voting shares or assets of which are
sought to be ørequired¿ acquired is a national banking associa-
tion, or to the appropriate supervisory authority of the inter-
ested State, if the applicant company or any bank the voting
shares or assets of which are sought to be acquired is a State
bank, in order to provide for the submission of the views and
recommendations of the Comptroller of the Currency or the
State supervisory authority, as the case may be. The views and
recommendations shall be submitted within thirty calendar
days of the date on which notice is given, or within ten cal-
endar days of such date if the Board advises the Comptroller
of the Currency or the State supervisory authority that an
emergency exists requiring expeditious action. If the thirty-day
notice period applies and if the Comptroller of the Currency or
the State supervisory authority so notified by the Board dis-
approves the application in writing within this period, the
Board shall forthwith give written notice of that fact to the ap-
plicant. Within three days after giving such notice to the appli-
cant, the Board shall notify in writing the applicant and the
disapproving authority of the date for commencement of a
hearing by it on such application. Any such hearing shall be
commenced not less than ten nor more than thirty days after
the Board has given written notice to the applicant of the ac-
tion of the disapproving authority. The length of any such
hearing shall be determined by the Board, but it shall afford
all interested parties a reasonable opportunity to testify at
such hearing. At the conclusion thereof, the Board shall, by
order, grant or deny the application on the basis of the record
made at such hearing. øIn the event of the failure of the Board
to act on any application for approval under this section within
the ninety-one-day period which begins on the date of submis-
sion to the Board of the complete record on that application,
the application shall be deemed to have been granted.¿ Not-
withstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the
Board finds that it must act immediately on any application for
approval under this section in order to prevent the probable
failure of a bank or bank holding company involved in a pro-
posed acquisition, merger, or consolidation transaction, the
Board may dispense with the notice requirements of this sub-
section, and if notice is given, the Board may request that the
views and recommendations of the Comptroller of the Currency
or the State supervisory authority, as the case may be, be sub-

mitted immediately in any form or by any means acceptable to
the Board. If the Board has found pursuant to this subsection
either that an emergency exists requiring expeditious action or
that it must act immediately to prevent probable failure, the
Board may grant or deny any such application without a hear-
ing not withstanding any recommended disapproval by the ap-
propriate supervisory authority.

State chartering authority that a bank is in danger of closing, the
Board may dispense with the notice and hearing requirements of
paragraph (1) with respect to any application received by the Board
relating to the acquisition of such bank, the bank holding company
which controls such bank, or any other affiliated bank.
(c) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION BY BOARD.—
(1) COMPETITIVE FACTORS.—The Board shall not approve—
(A) any acquisition or merger or consolidation under this sec-
tion which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in
furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or
to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part
of the United States, or
(B) any other proposed acquisition or merger or consolidation
under this section whose effect in any section of the country
may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create
a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in re-
straint or trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects
of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the pub-
lic interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting
the convenience and needs of the community to be served.
(2) BANKING AND COMMUNITY FACTORS.—In every case, the
Board shall take into consideration the financial and manage-
rial resources and future prospects of the company or compa-
nies and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs
of the community to be served.
(3) SUPERVISORY FACTORS.—The Board shall disapprove any
application under this section by any company if—
(A) the company fails to provide the Board with ade-
quate assurances that the company will make available to
the Board such information on the operations or activities
of the company, and any affiliate of the company, as the
Board determines to be appropriate to determine and en-
force compliance with this Act; or
(B) in the case of an application involving a foreign
bank, the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive su-
pervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the ap-
propriate authorities in the bank’s home country.
(4) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN BANK STOCK LOANS.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, the Board shall not follow
any practice or policy in the consideration of any application
for the formation of a one-bank holding company if following
such practice or policy would result in the rejection of such ap-
plication solely because the transaction to form such one-bank
holding company involves a bank stock loan which is for a pe-
riod of not more than twenty-five years. The previous sentence
shall not be construed to prohibit the Board from rejecting any
application solely because the other financial arrangements are
considered unsatisfactory. The Board shall consider trans-
actions involving bank stock loans for the formation of a one-
bank holding company having a maturity of twelve years or
more on a case by case basis and no such transaction shall be
approved if the Board believes the safety or soundness of the
bank may be jeopardized.
(5) MANAGERIAL RESOURCES.—Consideration of the manage-
rial resources of a company or bank under paragraph (2) shall

include consideration of the competence, experience, and integ-
rity of the officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the
company or bank.
(6) MONEY LAUNDERING.—In every case, the Board shall take
into consideration the effectiveness of the company or compa-
nies in combatting money laundering activities, including in
overseas branches.
(7) FINANCIAL STABILITY.—In every case, the Board shall
take into consideration the extent to which a proposed acquisi-
tion, merger, or consolidation would result in greater or more
concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking
or financial system.
(d) INTERSTATE BANKING.—
(1) APPROVALS AUTHORIZED.—
(A) ACQUISITION OF BANKS.—The Board may approve an
application under this section by a bank holding company
that is well capitalized and well managed to acquire con-
trol of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of,
a bank located in a State other than the home State of
such bank holding company, without regard to whether
such transaction is prohibited under the law of any State.
(B) PRESERVATION OF STATE AGE LAWS.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subparagraph (A),
the Board may not approve an application pursuant to
such subparagraph that would have the effect of per-
mitting an out-of-State bank holding company to ac-
quire a bank in a host State that has not been in ex-
istence for the minimum period of time, if any, speci-
fied in the statutory law of the host State.
(ii) SPECIAL RULE FOR STATE AGE LAWS SPECIFYING A
PERIOD OF MORE THAN 5 YEARS.—Notwithstanding
clause (i), the Board may approve, pursuant to sub-
paragraph (A), the acquisition of a bank that has been
in existence for at least 5 years without regard to any
longer minimum period of time specified in a statutory
law of the host State.
(C) SHELL BANKS.—For purposes of this subsection, a
bank that has been chartered solely for the purpose of, and
does not open for business prior to, acquiring control of, or
acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of, an exist-
ing bank shall be deemed to have been in existence for the
same period of time as the bank to be acquired.
(D) EFFECT ON STATE CONTINGENCY LAWS.—No provision
of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the appli-
cability of a State law that makes an acquisition of a bank
contingent upon a requirement to hold a portion of such
bank’s assets available for call by a State-sponsored hous-
ing entity established pursuant to State law, if—
(i) the State law does not have the effect of discrimi-
nating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank
holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or
bank holding companies;
(ii) that State law was in effect as of the date of en-
actment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and
Branching Efficiency Act of 1994;

stitution in the home State of any bank to be acquired
or in any host State in which any such bank main-
tains a branch; and
(ii) the applicant (including all insured depository
institutions which are affiliates of the applicant), upon
consummation of the acquisition, would control 30 per-
cent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured

sion of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the
authority of any State to limit, by statute, regulation, or
order, the percentage of the total amount of deposits of in-
sured depository institutions in the State which may be
held or controlled by any bank or bank holding company
(including all insured depository institutions which are af-
filiates of the bank or bank holding company) to the extent
the application of such limitation does not discriminate
against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding com-
panies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.
(D) EXCEPTIONS TO SUBPARAGRAPH (B).—The Board may
approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) with-
out regard to the applicability of subparagraph (B) with re-
spect to any State if—

pany (including all insured depository institutions
which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding com-
pany) to control a greater percentage of total deposits

of all insured depository institutions in the State than
the percentage permitted under subparagraph (B); or
(ii) the acquisition is approved by the appropriate

fect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-
of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of
such banks or holding companies.

ance with applicable State community reinvestment laws.

in part) of a going concern, any activity described in para-
graph (2)(F)(i) of this subsection without the prior approval
of the Board.
(B) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—In considering any ap-
plication under subparagraph (A) by any savings and loan
holding company or any subsidiary of any such company
which is not a savings association, the Board shall con-
sider—
(i) whether the performance of the activity described
in such application by the company or the subsidiary
can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the
public (such as greater convenience, increased com-
petition, or gains in efficiency) that outweigh possible
adverse effects of such activity (such as undue con-
centration of resources, decreased or unfair competi-
tion, conflicts of interest, or unsound financial prac-
tices);
(ii) the managerial resources of the companies in-
volved; and
(iii) the adequacy of the financial resources, includ-
ing capital, of the companies involved.
(C) DIRECTOR MAY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NEW AND
ONGOING ACTIVITIES.—In prescribing any regulation or con-
sidering any application under this paragraph, the Board
may differentiate between activities commenced de novo
and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in
part, of a going concern.
(D) APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL BY ORDER.—The approval
or disapproval of any application under this paragraph by
the Board shall be made in an order issued by the Board
containing the reasons for such approval or disapproval.
(5) GRACE PERIOD TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE.—If any savings
association referred to in paragraph (3) fails to maintain the
status of such association as a qualified thrift lender, the
Board may allow, for good cause shown, any company that con-
trols such association (or any subsidiary of such company
which is not a savings association) up to 3 years to comply
with the limitations contained in paragraph (1)(C).
(6) SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN COMPANIES AF-
FECTED BY 1987 AMENDMENTS.—
(A) EXCEPTION TO 2-YEAR GRACE PERIOD FOR ACHIEVING

ciation) which would otherwise be prohibited under para-
graph (1)(C) shall terminate with respect to such activities
of such company or subsidiary upon the occurrence (after
August 10, 1987) of any of the following:
(i) The savings and loan holding company acquires
control of a bank or an additional savings association
(other than a savings association acquired pursuant to
section 13(c) or 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act or section 406(f) or 408(m) of the National Housing

ance Act or section 408(m) of the National Housing
Act.
(v) Any savings association subsidiary of the savings
and loan holding company permits any overdraft (in-
cluding an intraday overdraft), or incurs any such

sult of an inadvertent computer or accounting error
that is beyond the control of both the savings associa-
tion subsidiary and the affiliate.
(D) ORDER TO TERMINATE SUBPARAGRAPH (B) ACTIVITY.—
Any activity described in subparagraph (B) may also be

flicts of interest or unsound practices or is in the public in-
terest.

withstanding any other provision of this section, any savings
and loan holding company organized under the laws of a for-

ciation), only in activities that are permitted—

application pending before the Office on or before that
date, and that—
(i) meets and continues to meet the requirements of
paragraph (3); and
(ii) continues to control not fewer than 1 savings as-
sociation that it controlled on May 4, 1999, or that it
acquired pursuant to an application pending before

ing, directly or indirectly, control of the savings and
loan holding company or any savings association that

issue interpretations, regulations, or orders that the Board
determines necessary to administer and carry out the pur-
pose and prevent evasions of this paragraph, including a

Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply with respect to
any trust that becomes a savings and loan holding com-
pany with respect to a savings association, if—

ship interests in the trust are continuously owned, di-
rectly or indirectly, by or for the benefit of members
of the same family, or their spouses, who are lineal de-
scendants of common ancestors who controlled, di-

acquisition or retention of, more than 5 percent of the
voting shares of any company not a subsidiary which

tivities specified in subsection (c)(2). This clause shall
not apply to shares of a savings association or of a
savings and loan holding company—
(I) held as a bona fide fiduciary (whether with
or without the sole discretion to vote such shares);
(II) held temporarily pursuant to an under-
writing commitment in the normal course of an
underwriting business;
(III) held in an account solely for trading pur-
poses;

(V) acquired in securing or collecting a debt pre-
viously contracted in good faith, during the 2-year
period beginning on the date of such acquisition or
for such additional time (not exceeding 3 years) as
the Board may permit if the Board determines
that such an extension will not be detrimental to
the public interest;
(VI) acquired under section 408(m) of the Na-
tional Housing Act or section 13(k) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act;
(VII) held by any insurance company, as defined
in section 2(a)(17) of the Investment Company Act

issuance if such purchase is approved by the
Board under subsection (q)(1)(D);
except that the aggregate amount of shares held under
this clause (other than under subclauses (I), (II), (III),
(IV), and (VI)) may not exceed 15 percent of all out-
standing shares or of the voting power of a savings as-
sociation or savings and loan holding company; or
(iv) to acquire the control of an uninsured institu-
tion, or to retain for more than one year after Feb-
ruary 14, 1968, or from the date on which such control

tional period not exceeding 3 years, if the Board finds

except that such approval shall not be required in connec-
tion with the control of a savings association, (i) acquired
by devise under the terms of a will creating a trust which
is excluded from the definition of ‘‘savings and loan hold-
ing company’’ under subsection (a) of this section, (ii) ac-
quired in connection with a reorganization in which a per-
son or group of persons, having had control of a savings
association for more than 3 years, vests control of that as-
sociation in a newly formed holding company subject to the
control of the same person or group of persons, or (iii) ac-
quired by a bank holding company that is registered
under, and subject to, the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, or any company controlled by such bank holding
company. The Board shall approve an acquisition of a sav-
ings association under this subparagraph unless the Board
finds the financial and managerial resources and future
prospects of the company and association involved to be
such that the acquisition would be detrimental to the asso-
ciation or the insurance risk of the Deposit Insurance
Fund, and shall render a decision within 90 days after
submission to the Board of the complete record on the ap-
plication.
Consideration of the managerial resources of a company or sav-
ings association under subparagraph (B) shall include consider-
ation of the competence, experience, and integrity of the offi-
cers, directors, and principal shareholders of the company or
association.
(2) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—The Board shall not ap-
prove any acquisition under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii), or of
more than one savings association under subparagraph (B) of
paragraph (1) of this subsection, any acquisition of stock in
connection with a qualified stock issuance, any acquisition
under paragraph (4)(A), or any transaction under section 13(k)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, except in accordance
with this paragraph. In every case, the Board shall take into
consideration the financial and managerial resources and fu-
ture prospects of the company and association involved, the ef-
fect of the acquisition on the association, the insurance risk to
the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the convenience and needs of
the community to be servedø, and shall render a decision with-
in 90 days after submission to the Board of the complete record
on the application¿. Consideration of the managerial resources
of a company or savings association shall include consideration
of the competence, experience, and integrity of the officers, di-
rectors, and principal shareholders of the company or associa-
tion. Before approving any such acquisition, except a trans-
action under section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, the Board shall request from the Attorney General and
consider any report rendered within 30 days on the competitive
factors involved. The Board shall not approve any proposed ac-
quisition—
(A) which would result in a monopoly, or which would be
in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monop-
olize or to attempt to monopolize the savings and loan
business in any part of the United States,

(B) the effect of which in any section of the country may
be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a
monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in re-
straint of trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive ef-
fects of the proposed acquisition are clearly outweighed in
the public interest by the probable effect of the acquisition
in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to
be served,
(C) if the company fails to provide adequate assurances
to the Board that the company will make available to the
Board such information on the operations or activities of
the company, and any affiliate of the company, as the
Board determines to be appropriate to determine and en-
force compliance with this Act,
(D) in the case of an application involving a foreign
bank, if the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive
supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the
appropriate authorities in the bank’s home country, or
(E) in the case of an application by a savings and loan
holding company to acquire an insured depository institu-
tion, if—
(i) the home State of the insured depository institu-
tion is a State other than the home State of the sav-
ings and loan holding company;
(ii) the applicant (including all insured depository
institutions which are affiliates of the applicant) con-
trols, or upon consummation of the transaction would
control, more than 10 percent of the total amount of
deposits of insured depository institutions in the
United States; and
(iii) the acquisition does not involve an insured de-
pository institution in default or in danger of default,
or with respect to which the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation provides assistance under section 13
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1823).
(3) INTERSTATE ACQUISITIONS.—No acquisition shall be ap-
proved by the Board under this subsection which will result in
the formation by any company, through one or more subsidi-
aries or through one or more transactions, of a multiple sav-
ings and loan holding company controlling savings associations
in more than one State, unless—
(A) such company, or a savings association subsidiary of
such company, is authorized to acquire control of a savings
association subsidiary, or to operate a home or branch of-
fice, in the additional State or States pursuant to section
13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;
(B) such company controls a savings association sub-
sidiary which operated a home or branch office in the addi-
tional State or States as of March 5, 1987; or
(C) the statutes of the State in which the savings asso-
ciation to be acquired is located permit a savings associa-
tion chartered by such State to be acquired by a savings
association chartered by the State where the acquiring
savings association or savings and loan holding company is
located or by a holding company that controls such a State

written approval of the Board.

controlled by such individual shall be subject to the activi-
ties limitations contained in subsection (c) to the same ex-
tent such limitations apply to multiple savings and loan
holding companies, unless all or all but 1 of the savings as-
sociations (including any institution deemed to be a sav-
ings association under subsection (l) of this section) con-
trolled directly or indirectly by such individual was ac-
quired pursuant to an acquisition described in subclause
(I) or (II) of subsection (c)(3)(B)(i).

ESTS.—This subsection and subsection (c)(2) of this section do

quired the control of a savings association or of a savings and
loan holding company pursuant to a pledge or hypothecation to
secure a loan, or in connection with the liquidation of a loan,
made in the ordinary course of business. It shall be unlawful
for any such company to retain such control for more than one
year after February 14, 1968, or from the date on which such
control was acquired, whichever is later, except that the Board
may upon application by such company extend such one-year
period from year to year, for an additional period not exceeding
3 years, if the Board finds such extension is warranted and
would not be detrimental to the public interest.
(6) SHARES HELD BY INSURANCE AFFILIATES.—Shares de-
scribed in clause (iii)(VII) of paragraph (1)(A) shall not be ex-
cluded for purposes of clause (iii) of such paragraph if—
(A) all shares held under such clause (iii)(VII) by all in-
surance company affiliates of such savings association or
savings and loan holding company in the aggregate exceed
5 percent of all outstanding shares or of the voting power
of the savings association or savings and loan holding com-
pany; or

acquiring, exercising, or transferring control of the savings
association or savings and loan holding company.

Board received the response, provides the applicant a
detailed notice describing the deficiencies.
(D) TREATMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION.—In deter-

riod described under subparagraph (A), such application
shall be deemed to have been granted.
(C) TOLLING OF PERIOD.—The Board may at any time ex-
tend the deadline described under subparagraph (A) at the
request of the applicant, but may not extend the deadline

(iii) with respect to a Federal savings association,
the State in which the home office (as defined by the
regulations of the Board of the Office of Thrift Super-
vision, or, on and after the transfer date, the Comp-
troller of the Currency) of the Federal savings associa-
tion is located; and

pany, the State in which the amount of total deposits
of all insured depository institution subsidiaries of
such company was the greatest on the date on which
the company became a savings and loan holding com-
pany.
(f) DECLARATION OF DIVIDEND.—Every subsidiary savings asso-
ciation of a savings and loan holding company shall give the Board
not less than 30 days’ advance notice of the proposed declaration
by its directors of any dividend on its guaranty, permanent, or
other nonwithdrawable stock. Such notice period shall commence to
run from the date of receipt of such notice by the Board. Any such
dividend declared within such period, or without the giving of such
notice to the Board, shall be invalid and shall confer no rights or
benefits upon the holder of any such stock.
(g) ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Board is authorized to issue such regu-
lations and orders, including regulations and orders relating to
capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies,
as the Board deems necessary or appropriate to enable the
Board to administer and carry out the purposes of this section,
and to require compliance therewith and prevent evasions
thereof. In establishing capital regulations pursuant to this
subsection, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall seek
to make such requirements countercyclical so that the amount
of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in
times of economic expansion and decreases in times of eco-
nomic contraction, consistent with the safety and soundness of
the company.
(2) INVESTIGATIONS.—The Board may make such investiga-
tions as the Board deems necessary or appropriate to deter-
mine whether the provisions of this section, and regulations
and orders thereunder, are being and have been complied with
by savings and loan holding companies and subsidiaries and
affiliates thereof. For the purpose of any investigation under
this section, the Board may administer oaths and affirmations,
issue subpenas, take evidence, and require the production of
any books, papers, correspondence, memorandums, or other
records which may be relevant or material to the inquiry. The
attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records
may be required from any place in any State. The Board may
apply to the United States district court for the judicial district
(or the United States court in any territory) in which any wit-
ness or company subpenaed resides or carries on business, for
enforcement of any subpena issued pursuant to this paragraph,
and such courts shall have jurisdiction and power to order and
require compliance.
(3) PROCEEDINGS.—(A) In any proceeding under subsection
(a)(2)(D) or under paragraph (5) of this subsection, the Board

may administer oaths and affirmations, take or cause to be
taken depositions, and issue subpenas. The Board may make
regulations with respect to any such proceedings. The attend-
ance of witnesses and the production of documents provided for
in this paragraph may be required from any place in any State
or in any territory at any designated place where such pro-
ceeding is being conducted. Any party to such proceedings may
apply to the United States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia, or the United States district court for the judicial dis-
trict or the United States court in any territory in which such
proceeding is being conducted, or where the witness resides or
carries on business, for enforcement of any subpena issued pur-
suant to this paragraph, and such courts shall have jurisdic-
tion and power to order and require compliance therewith. Wit-
nesses subpenaed under this section shall be paid the same
fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the district courts
of the United States.
(B) Any hearing provided for in subsection (a)(2)(D) or under
paragraph (5) of this section shall be held in the Federal judi-
cial district or in the territory in which the principal office of
the association or other company is located unless the party af-
forded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be con-
ducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title
5, United States Code.
(4) INJUNCTIONS.—Whenever it appears to the Board that
any person is engaged or has engaged or is about to engage in
any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a viola-
tion of the provisions of this section or of any regulation or
order thereunder, the Board may bring an action in the proper
United States district court, or the United States court of any
territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States, to enjoin such acts or practices, to enforce compliance
with this section or any regulation or order, or to require the
divestiture of any acquisition in violation of this section, or for
any combination of the foregoing, and such courts shall have
jurisdiction of such actions. Upon a proper showing an injunc-
tion, decree, restraining order, order of divestiture, or other ap-
propriate order shall be granted without bond.
(5) CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.—(A) Notwithstanding any
other provision of this section, the Board may, whenever the
Board has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by
a savings and loan holding company of any activity or of own-
ership or control of any of its noninsured subsidiaries con-
stitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or sta-
bility of a savings and loan holding company’s subsidiary sav-
ings association and is inconsistent with the sound operation
of a savings association or with the purposes of this section or
section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, order the sav-
ings and loan holding company or any of its subsidiaries, after
due notice and opportunity for hearing, to terminate such ac-
tivities or to terminate (within 120 days or such longer period
as the Board directs in unusual circumstances) its ownership
or control of any such noninsured subsidiary either by sale or
by distribution of the shares of the subsidiary to the share-
holders of the savings and loan holding company. Such dis-

(B) The Board may in the discretion of the Board apply to
the United States district court within the jurisdiction of which
the principal office of the company is located, for the enforce-
ment of any effective and outstanding order issued under this
section, and such court shall have jurisdiction and power to
order and require compliance therewith. Except as provided in

minate, or set aside any such notice or order.

(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and
(7), any savings association is a qualified thrift lender if—
(A) the savings association qualifies as a domestic build-
ing and loan association, as such term is defined in section
7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(B)(i) the savings association’s qualified thrift invest-
ments equal or exceed 65 percent of the savings associa-
tion’s portfolio assets; and
(ii) the savings association’s qualified thrift investments
continue to equal or exceed 65 percent of the savings asso-
ciation’s portfolio assets on a monthly average basis in 9
out of every 12 months.
(2) EXCEPTIONS GRANTED BY DIRECTOR.—Notwithstanding
paragraph (1), the appropriate Federal banking agency may
grant such temporary and limited exceptions from the min-
imum actual thrift investment percentage requirement con-
tained in such paragraph as the appropriate Federal banking
agency deems necessary if—
(A) the appropriate Federal banking agency determines
that extraordinary circumstances exist, such as when the
effects of high interest rates reduce mortgage demand to
such a degree that an insufficient opportunity exists for a
savings association to meet such investment requirements;
or
(B) the appropriate Federal banking agency determines
that—
(i) the grant of any such exception will significantly
facilitate an acquisition under section 13(c) or 13(k) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;
(ii) the acquired association will comply with the
transition requirements of paragraph (7)(B), as if the
date of the exemption were the starting date for the
transition period described in that paragraph; and
(iii) the appropriate Federal banking agency deter-
mines that the exemption will not have an undue ad-
verse effect on competing savings associations in the
relevant market and will further the purposes of this
subsection.
(3) FAILURE TO BECOME AND REMAIN A QUALIFIED THRIFT
LENDER.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—A savings association that fails to be-
come or remain a qualified thrift lender shall immediately

tion at which a national bank located in the sav-
ings association’s home State may not establish a

which the savings association’s total deposits were
largest on the date on which the savings associa-
tion should have become or ceased to be a quali-
fied thrift lender.

of the Currency and the Board by the savings
association not later than 30 days before the

ciation that fails to become or remain a qualified

5(d) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (12 U.S.C.
1464(d)).
(ii) ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS EFFECTIVE AFTER 3
YEARS.—Beginning 3 years after the date on which a
savings association should have become a qualified
thrift lender, or the date on which the savings associa-
tion ceases to be a qualified thrift lender, as applica-
ble, the savings association shall not retain any in-
vestment (including an investment in any subsidiary)
or engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity, unless
that investment or activity—
(I) would be permissible for the savings associa-
tion if it were a national bank; and
(II) is permissible for the savings association as
a savings association.
(C) HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION.—Any company that
controls a savings association that is subject to any provi-
sion of subparagraph (B) shall, within one year after the
date on which the savings association should have become
or ceases to be a qualified thrift lender, register as and be
deemed to be a bank holding company subject to all of the
provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, sec-
tion 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and other
statutes applicable to bank holding companies, in the same

bank, as those terms are defined in the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956.
(D) REQUALIFICATION.—A savings association that
should have become or ceases to be a qualified thrift lend-
er shall not be subject to subparagraph (B) or (C) if the
savings association becomes a qualified thrift lender by
meeting the qualified thrift lender requirement in para-
graph (1) on a monthly average basis in 9 out of the pre-
ceding 12 months and remains a qualified thrift lender. If
the savings association (or any savings association that ac-
quired all or substantially all of its assets from that sav-
ings association) at any time thereafter ceases to be a
qualified thrift lender, it shall immediately be subject to
all provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) as if all the pe-
riods described in subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C) had ex-
pired.
(E) EXEMPTION FOR SPECIALIZED SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS
SERVING CERTAIN MILITARY PERSONNEL.—Subparagraph (A)

ciation that was chartered before October 15, 1982, as
a savings bank or a cooperative bank under State law.

mitting any insured depository institution to engage in any
conversion transaction prohibited under section 5(d) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

lowing definitions shall apply:

capital of the undercapitalized savings association at or
above the minimum level required by the Board or any
other Federal agency having jurisdiction.
(B) OTHER CONDITIONS.—Notwithstanding subsection
(a)(4), the Board may impose such conditions on any ap-

(2) No insured depository institution shall merge or consolidate
with any other insured depository institution or, either directly or
indirectly, acquire the assets of, or assume liability to pay any de-
posits made in, any other insured depository institution except

(A) the Comptroller of the Currency if the acquiring, assum-
ing, or resulting bank is to be a national bank or a Federal
savings association;

the acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is to be a State

(C) the Corporation if the acquiring, assuming, or resulting
bank is to be a State nonmember insured bank or a State sav-
ings association.
(3) Notice of any proposed transaction for which approval is re-
quired under paragraph (1) or (2) (referred to hereafter in this sub-
section as a ‘‘merger transaction’’) shall, unless the responsible
agency finds that it must act immediately in order to prevent the
probable default of one of the banks or savings associations in-
volved, be published—
(A) prior to the granting of approval of such transaction,
(B) in a form approved by the responsible agency,
(C) at appropriate intervals during a period at least as long
as the period allowed for furnishing reports under paragraph
(4) of this subsection, and
(D) in a newspaper of general circulation in the community
or communities where the main offices of the banks or savings
associations involved are located, or, if there is no such news-
paper in any such community, then in the newspaper of gen-
eral circulation published nearest thereto.
(4) REPORTS ON COMPETITIVE FACTORS.—
(A) REQUEST FOR REPORT.—In the interests of uniform
standards and subject to subparagraph (B), before acting
on any application for approval of a merger transaction,
the responsible agency shall—
(i) request a report on the competitive factors in-
volved from the Attorney General of the United
States; and
(ii) provide a copy of the request to the Corporation
(when the Corporation is not the responsible agency).
(B) FURNISHING OF REPORT.—The report requested under
subparagraph (A) shall be furnished by the Attorney Gen-
eral to the responsible agency—
(i) not later than 30 calendar days after the date on
which the Attorney General received the request; or

if the requesting agency advises the Attorney General
that an emergency exists requiring expeditious action.
(C) EXCEPTIONS.—A responsible agency may not be re-
quired to request a report under subparagraph (A) if—
(i) the responsible agency finds that it must act im-

of the insured depository institutions involved in the
merger transaction; or

(ii) the merger transaction involves solely an insured
depository institution and 1 or more of the affiliates of
such depository institution.
(5) The responsible agency shall not approve—
(A) any proposed merger transaction which would result in
a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combina-
tion or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize
the business of banking in any part of the United States, or
(B) any other proposed merger transaction whose effect in
any section of the country may be substantially to lessen com-
petition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other
manner would be in restraint of trade, unless it finds that the
anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly
outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the
transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the com-
munity to be served.
In every case, the responsible agency shall take into consideration
the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the
existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of
the community to be served, and the risk to the stability of the
United States banking or financial system.
(6) The responsible agency shall immediately notify the Attorney
General of any approval by it pursuant to this subsection of a pro-
posed merger transaction. If the agency has found that it must act
immediately to prevent the probable failure of one of the insured
depository institutions involved, or if the proposed merger trans-
action is solely between an insured depository institution and 1 or
more of its affiliates, and the report on the competitive factors has
been dispensed with, the transaction may be consummated imme-
diately upon approval by the agency. If the agency has advised the
Attorney General under paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of the existence of an
emergency requiring expeditious action and has requested a report
on the competitive factors within 10 days, the transaction may not
be consummated before the fifth calendar day after the date of ap-
proval by the agency. In all other cases, the transaction may not
be consummated before the thirtieth calendar day after the date of
approval by the agency or, if the agency has not received any ad-
verse comment from the Attorney General of the United States re-
lating to competitive factors, such shorter period of time as may be
prescribed by the agency with the concurrence of the Attorney Gen-
eral, but in no event less than 15 calendar days after the date of
approval.
(7)(A) Any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of
a merger transaction shall be commenced prior to the earliest time
under paragraph (6) at which a merger transaction approved under
paragraph (5) might be consummated. The commencement of such
an action shall stay the effectiveness of the agency’s approval un-
less the court shall otherwise specifically order. In any such action,
the court shall review de novo the issues presented.
(B) In any judicial proceeding attacking a merger transaction ap-
proved under paragraph (5) on the ground that the merger trans-
action alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust
laws other than section 2 of the Act of July 2, 1890 (section 2 of
the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. 2), the standards applied by

the court shall be identical with those that the banking agencies
are directed to apply under paragraph (5).
(C) Upon the consummation of a merger transaction in compli-
ance with this subsection and after the termination of any anti-
trust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this
paragraph, or upon the termination of such period if no such litiga-
tion is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be
attacked in any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and
of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than sec-
tion 2 of the Act of July 2, 1890 (section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust
Act, 15 U.S.C. 2), but nothing in this subsection shall exempt any
bank or savings association resulting from a merger transaction
from complying with the antitrust laws after the consummation of
such transaction.
(D) In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out
of a merger transaction approved by a Federal supervisory agency
pursuant to this subsection, such agency, and any State banking
supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the State involved,
may appear as a party of its own motion and as of right, and be
represented by its counsel.
(8) For the purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘antitrust laws’’
means the Act of July 2, 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15
U.S.C. 1–7), the Act of October 15, 1914 (the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.
12–27), and any other Acts in pari materia.
(9) Each of the responsible agencies shall include in its annual
report to the Congress a description of each merger transaction ap-
proved by it during the period covered by the report, along with—
(A) the name and total resources of each bank or savings as-
sociation involved;
(B) whether a report was submitted by the Attorney General
under paragraph (4), and, if so, a summary by the Attorney
General of the substance of such report; and
(C) a statement by the responsible agency of the basis for its
approval.
(10) Until June 30, 1976, the responsible agency shall not grant
any approval required by law which has the practical effect of per-
mitting a conversion from the mutual to the stock form of organiza-
tion, including approval of any application pending on the date of
enactment of this subsection, except that this sentence shall not be
deemed to limit now or hereafter the authority of the responsible
agency to grant approvals in cases where the responsible agency
finds that it must act in order to maintain the safety, soundness,
and stability of an insured depository institution. The responsible
agency may by rule, regulation, or otherwise and under such civil
penalties (which shall be cumulative to any other remedies) as it
may prescribe take whatever action it deems necessary or appro-
priate to implement or enforce this subsection.
(11) MONEY LAUNDERING.—In every case, the responsible
agency, shall take into consideration the effectiveness of any
insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger
transaction in combatting money laundering activities, includ-
ing in overseas branches.
(12) The provisions of this subsection do not apply to any merger
transaction involving a foreign bank if no party to the transaction
is principally engaged in business in the United States.

(13)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the responsible
agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger
transaction if the resulting insured depository institution (includ-
ing all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the re-
sulting insured depository institution), upon consummation of the
transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total
amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United
States.
(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an interstate merger
transaction that involves 1 or more insured depository institutions
in default or in danger of default, or with respect to which the Cor-
poration provides assistance under section 13.

association is chartered; and
(III) with respect to a Federal savings association, the
State in which the home office (as defined by the regula-
tions of the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, or,
on and after the transfer date, the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency) of the Federal savings association is located.
(14) COMPLETE RECORD ON AN APPLICATION.—
(A) NOTICE TO APPLICANT.—Not later than 30 days after the
date on which the responsible agency receives a merger applica-
tion for approval under this subsection, the responsible agency
shall transmit to the applicant a letter that either—
(i) confirms the record on the application is complete; or
(ii) details all additional information that is required for
the record on that application to be complete.
(B) EXTENSION OF NOTICE.—Notwithstanding subparagraph
(A), the responsible agency may, if an application is unusually
complex, extend the 30-day period described under subpara-
graph (A) for an additional 30 days.
(C) RECEIPT OF RESPONSE; DEEMING OF COMPLETE RECORD.—
Upon receipt of a response from an applicant to a notice re-
questing additional information described under subparagraph
(A)(ii), the record on the application shall be deemed complete
unless the responsible agency—
(i) determines that the applicant’s response was materi-
ally deficient; and
(ii) not later than 30 days after the date on which the re-
sponsible agency received the response, provides the appli-
cant a detailed notice describing the deficiencies.
(D) TREATMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION.—In deter-
mining whether the record on an application is complete, the re-
sponsible agency may take into account only information pro-
vided by the applicant, and may not base the determination of
completeness on any information (including reports, views, or
recommendations) provided by third parties.

member bank may not acquire, establish, or operate a
branch in any State other than the bank’s home State (as

tion 13(f), 13(k), or 44.
(B) RETENTION OF BRANCHES.—In the case of a State

ARIES.—
(1) PROCEDURES.—When an insured savings association es-

association elects to conduct any new activity through a sub-
sidiary that the insured savings association controls, the in-
sured savings association—
(A) shall notify the Corporation or the Comptroller of the
Currency, as appropriate, not less than 30 days prior to
the establishment, or acquisition, of any such subsidiary,
and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of
any such activity, and in either case shall provide at that
time such information as each such agency may, by regula-
tion, require; and
(B) shall conduct the activities of the subsidiary in ac-
cordance with regulations of the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency and orders of the Corporation and the Comptroller
of the Currency.
(2) ENFORCEMENT POWERS.—With respect to any subsidiary
of an insured savings association:
(A) the Corporation and the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency, as appropriate, shall each have, with respect to such
subsidiary, the respective powers that each has with re-
spect to the insured savings association pursuant to this
section or section 8; and
(B) the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency,
as appropriate, may determine, after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, that the continuation by the insured
savings association of its ownership or control of, or its re-
lationship to, the subsidiary—
(i) constitutes a serious risk to the safety, sound-
ness, or stability of the insured savings association, or
(ii) is inconsistent with sound banking principles or
with the purposes of this Act.
Upon making any such determination, the Corporation or
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as appro-
priate, shall have authority to order the insured savings
association to divest itself of control of the subsidiary. The
Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appro-
priate, may take any other corrective measures with re-
spect to the subsidiary, including the authority to require
the subsidiary to terminate the activities or operations
posing such risks, as the Corporation or the Comptroller of
the Currency, respectively, may deem appropriate.
(3) ACTIVITIES INCOMPATIBLE WITH DEPOSIT INSURANCE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Corporation may determine by
regulation or order that any specific activity poses a seri-
ous threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Prior to adopt-
ing any such regulation, the Corporation shall, in the case
of a Federal savings association, consult with the Comp-
troller of the Currency and shall provide appropriate State
supervisors the opportunity to comment thereon, and the
Corporation shall specifically take such comments into con-

sideration. Any such regulation shall be issued in accord-
ance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code. If the
Board of Directors makes such a determination with re-
spect to an activity, the Corporation shall have authority
to order that no savings association may engage in the ac-
tivity directly.
(B) AUTHORITY OF COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY.—
This section does not limit the authority of the Comptroller
of the Currency to issue regulations to promote safety and
soundness, or to enforce compliance as to Federal savings
associations with other applicable laws.
(C) ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY OF FDIC TO PREVENT SERIOUS
RISKS TO INSURANCE FUND.—Notwithstanding subpara-
graph (A), the Corporation may prescribe and enforce such
regulations and issue such orders as the Corporation de-
termines to be necessary to prevent actions or practices of
savings associations that pose a serious threat to the De-
posit Insurance Fund.
(4) ‘‘SUBSIDIARY’’ DEFINED.—As used in this subsection, the
term ‘‘subsidiary’’ does not include an insured depository insti-
tution.

sets from an institution that was chartered prior to Octo-
ber 15, 1982, as a savings bank under State law.

agency shall allow any insured depository institution to include an
unidentifiable intangible asset in its calculation of compliance with
the appropriate capital standard, if such unidentifiable intangible
asset was acquired after April 12, 1989, except to the extent per-
mitted under section 5(t) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act.
(o) REAL ESTATE LENDING.—
(1) UNIFORM REGULATIONS.—Not more than 9 months after
the date of enactment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-
poration Improvement Act of 1991, each appropriate Federal
banking agency shall adopt uniform regulations prescribing
standards for extensions of credit that are—
(A) secured by liens on interests in real estate; or
(B) made for the purpose of financing the construction of
a building or other improvements to real estate.
(2) STANDARDS.—
(A) CRITERIA.—In prescribing standards under para-

soundness of the institutions.
(3) LOAN EVALUATION STANDARD.—No appropriate Federal
banking agency shall adversely evaluate an investment or a
loan made by an insured depository institution, or consider
such a loan to be nonperforming, solely because the loan is
made to or the investment is in commercial, residential, or in-
dustrial property, unless such investment or loan may affect
the institution’s safety and soundness.
(4) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The regulations adopted under para-
graph (1) shall become effective not later than 15 months after
the date of enactment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-
poration Improvement Act of 1991. Such regulations shall con-
tinue in effect except as uniformly amended by the appropriate
Federal banking agencies, acting in concert.
(p) PERIODIC REVIEW OF CAPITAL STANDARDS.—Each appropriate
Federal banking agency shall, in consultation with the other Fed-
eral banking agencies, biennially review its capital standards for
insured depository institutions to determine whether those stand-
ards require sufficient capital to facilitate prompt corrective action
to prevent or minimize loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund, con-
sistent with section 38.
(q) SOVEREIGN RISK.—Section 25C of the Federal Reserve Act
shall apply to every nonmember insured bank in the same manner

(1) IN GENERAL.—Any bank subsidiary of a bank holding
company may receive deposits, renew time deposits, close
loans, service loans, and receive payments on loans and other
obligations as an agent for a depository institution affiliate.
(2) BANK ACTING AS AGENT IS NOT A BRANCH.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, a bank acting as an agent

savings association which was an affiliate of a bank on July 1,

year period beginning on the date on which such ar-
rangement is consummated or on such earlier date as
the Secretary deems appropriate: Provided, That the
Secretary may extend this period for not more than 1
year at a time if the Secretary determines that such

tution will not use the trade name or service mark
‘‘Sallie Mae’’ in connection with any product or service
it offers if the appropriate Federal banking agency for
such depository institution determines that—
(I) the depository institution is the only institu-

stitution having an unfair competitive advantage
over other depository institutions.

arrangement is consummated. The term ‘‘investment
portfolio’’ shall mean all investments shown on the

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would modify the bank merger review process and force
the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to ei-
ther approve or deny a merger application within 90 days of receiv-
ing an initial application, even if the application is not complete
and the merging parties have not provided all the information reg-
ulators request to adequately assess the merger application. Addi-
tionally, the bill would limit regulators’ ability to consider feedback
from affected stakeholders on proposed mergers. These reforms will
bring less scrutiny, not more, to a rubber-stamping process that
has wiped out community banks and significantly increased the
market share the largest banks have.
Experts have argued that the bank merger review process has
been too lax and has amounted to a rubber-stamping process, re-
sulting in banking deserts and too-big-to manage banks that have
compliance challenges, consumer harm, or higher prices for finan-
cial products and services.1 These concerns came into focus in the
context of the merger of Capital One and Discover to form the 6th
largest commercial bank and the largest credit card loan company.2
Ranking Member Waters and others have raised concerns,3 but the
Trump Administration recently approved the merger.4
Experts cite to overwhelming approval rates for mergers; for ex-
ample, the Fed indicated that between 2006 and 2017, it approved
3,316 merger applications, and while other applications were with-
drawn, the agency formally denied zero applications during that
time.5 Even when accounting for withdrawn applications, the ap-
proval rate has been extremely high; in 2021 and 2022, the Fed ap-
proved roughly 97% and 94% of merger applications, respectively,
even when factoring in withdrawn applications.6 The last time
bank regulators denied a merger application was 2003.7
In an attempt to address these concerns, former President Biden
issued an Executive Order encouraging regulators to promote mar-

ket competition, including directing the Department of Justice
(DOJ) to consult with Federal banking regulators to review and
strengthen their bank merger review policies.8 Ranking Member
Waters and Committee Democrats called on regulators to take
prompt action to strengthen merger review procedures,9 for exam-
ple, by holding public hearings with large bank mergers to ensure
affected workers, consumers, and small business owners have
ample opportunity to express their views. While the FDIC, OCC,
and Department of Justice under the Biden Administration made
some reforms to strengthen their bank merger reviews last year
(the Fed never did), Trump’s regulators have begun to roll back
many of these merger review reforms.10
This bill was previously included in H.R. 8337 (118th), Bank Re-
silience and Regulatory Improvement Act, which passed FSC last
year by a 24–22 partisan vote, though it was never considered by
the full House. When this was considered last Congress, some con-
sumer groups warned, ‘‘The bank merger review process is sup-
posed to protect Americans against the dangers of bank consolida-
tion and bank mergers that are not in the interest of customers or
for which managerial resources are lacking . . . We oppose the bill
as it would dangerously require the agencies to decide on merger
applications even when the application is not complete and/or the
merging parties have not provided all the information regulators
request to adequately assess the merger application. Regulators
have a consistent pattern of waving mergers through without suffi-
cient scrutiny—creating an increasingly consolidated market that
makes banking more expensive for consumers and increases sys-
temic risk. Merger scrutiny needs to become more robust, not less
so, as this bill would require.’’11
A number of consumer and community groups oppose the bill, in-
cluding Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Center for Respon-
sible Lending (CRL), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), Insti-
tute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Consumer Law
Center, on behalf of its low-income clients (NCLC), National Com-
munity Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC), New Economy Project,
Public Citizen, Rise Economy, and 20/20 Vision.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 1900.

MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
