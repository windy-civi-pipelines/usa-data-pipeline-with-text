OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF THE BILL
The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Re-
lated Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for a wide array
of Federal programs, mostly in the Departments of Transportation
[DOT] and Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. Programs in
the DOT support road, transit, rail, pipeline, maritime, and avia-
tion infrastructure development, as well as safety, oversight, and
enforcement across the various modes. Resources for HUD support
economic development, affordable housing production, and housing
assistance for those most in need, including the elderly, individuals
with disabilities, and people experiencing homelessness. The bill
also provides funding for the Federal Housing Administration
[FHA] and the Government National Mortgage Association [Ginnie
Mae] to continue their traditional roles of providing access to af-
fordable homeownership in the United States.
The bill, as reported, provides the proper balance of funding for
transportation, housing, and community development programs
and activities. It is consistent with the subcommittee’s allocation
for fiscal year 2026. All accounts in the bill have been closely exam-
ined and funding is provided to carry out the programs and activi-
ties of the DOT, HUD, and related agencies. Details on each of the
accounts and the Committee’s justifications for the funding levels
are included in this report.
PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY
During fiscal year 2026, for the purposes of the Balanced Budget
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as
amended, with respect to appropriations contained in the accom-
panying bill, the terms ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ [PPA] shall
mean any item for which a dollar amount is contained in appro-
priations acts (including joint resolutions providing continuing ap-
propriations), accompanying reports or explanatory statements of
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, or accom-
panying conference reports and joint explanatory statements of the
committee of conference. This definition shall apply to all programs
for which new budget (obligational) authority is provided, as well
as to discretionary grants and discretionary grant allocations made
through either bill, report, or joint explanatory statement language.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The Committee includes provisions in section 405 establishing
the authority by which funding available to the agencies in this
act, division J of Public Law 117–58, or previous appropriations
acts may be reprogrammed for other purposes. These provisions
specifically require the advanced notification and approval of the
(4)
5
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of any proposal
to reprogram funds that:
—creates a new program;
—eliminates a PPA;
—increases funds or personnel for any PPA for which funds have
been denied or restricted by the Congress;
—proposes to redirect funds that were directed in such reports
or explanatory statements for a specific activity to a different
purpose;
—augments an existing PPA in excess of $5,000,000 or 10 per-
cent, whichever is less;
—reduces an existing PPA by $5,000,000 or 10 percent, which-
ever is less; or
—creates, reorganizes, or restructures a branch, division, office,
bureau, board, commission, agency, administration, or depart-
ment different from the congressional budget justifications or
most recent organizational charts submitted to the Committees
on Appropriations or the report accompanying this act, which-
ever is more detailed. This direction applies to both the bill
and accompanying reports or joint explanatory statements.
The Committee retains the requirement that each agency submit
an operating plan to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 60 days after enactment of this act to es-
tablish the baseline for application of reprogramming and transfer
authorities provided in this act. Specifically, each agency should
provide a table for each appropriation with columns displaying the
prior year enacted level; budget request; adjustments made by Con-
gress; adjustments for rescissions, if appropriate; and the fiscal
year enacted level. The table shall delineate the appropriation and
prior year enacted level both by object class and by PPA, as de-
tailed in this act, accompanying reports or joint explanatory state-
ments, or in the budget appendix for the respective appropriations,
whichever is more detailed, and shall apply to all items for which
a dollar amount is specified and to all programs for which new
budget (obligational) authority is provided, as well as to discre-
tionary grants and discretionary grant allocations. In addition, the
operating plan shall include an organizational chart with the num-
ber of full-time personnel onboard as of the end of the most recent
pay period for each office as approved by this act or a report or
joint explanatory statement accompanying this act that provides
the same level for detail provided in the congressional budget jus-
tification or most recent organizational charts submitted to the
Committees on Appropriations, with an exception. The operating
plan must also identify items of special congressional interest.
The Committee expects the agencies and bureaus to submit re-
programming requests in a timely manner and to provide a thor-
ough explanation of the proposed reallocations, including a detailed
justification of increases and reductions and the specific impact the
proposed changes will have on the budget request for the following
fiscal year. Except in emergency situations, reprogramming re-
quests should be submitted no later than June 30.
The Committee expects each agency to manage its programs and
activities within the amounts appropriated by Congress. The Com-
mittee reminds agencies that reprogramming requests should be
6
submitted only in the case of an unforeseeable emergency or a situ-
ation that could not have been anticipated when formulating the
budget request for the current fiscal year. Further, the Committee
notes that when a Department or agency submits a reprogramming
or transfer request to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations and does not receive identical responses from the House
and Senate, it is the responsibility of the Department to reconcile
the House and Senate differences before proceeding, and if rec-
onciliation is not possible, to consider the request to reprogram
funds not approved.
The Committee would also like to clarify that these sections
apply to the working capital fund [WCF] for the DOT, and that no
funds may be obligated from such funds to augment programs,
projects or activities for which appropriations have been specifically
rejected by the Congress, or to increase funds or personnel for any
PPA above the amounts appropriated by this act or a report or
joint explanatory statement accompanying this act.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS
Budget justifications are the primary tool used by the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations to evaluate the resource re-
quirements and fiscal needs of agencies. Timely receipt of such
budget justifications is integral to the Committee’s ability to
produce an effective and efficient annual appropriations bill, as is
the prompt and comprehensive briefing of Committee staff on the
details of the President’s budget request. The Committee is aware
that the format and presentation of budget materials is largely left
to the agency within presentation objectives set forth by the Office
of Management and Budget [OMB]. The Committee expects all of
the budget justifications to provide the data needed to make appro-
priate and meaningful funding decisions. Section 424 of this act
outlines the information that agencies are required to include in
the congressional budget justification for fiscal year 2027. Among
other items, agencies shall use or provide a comparison to the ac-
count and sub-account structure provided under this act or a report
or joint explanatory statement accompanying this act; provide all
available budgetary resources from contract authority, mandatory
budget authority, advance appropriations, and discretionary au-
thority, including disaster and emergency-designated funding; pro-
vide detailed information on all programs, including detailed dis-
cussion of proposed new initiatives or changes to the agency’s fi-
nancial plan; and provide detailed tables and organizational charts
that delineate funding for salaries and expenses and the number
of full-time equivalent [FTE] and full-time positions [FTP] as well
as justifications for all funding and staffing changes, reorganiza-
tions, and restructurings at the same level of detail provided to
support the fiscal year 2025 budget justifications and amounts pro-
vided for salaries and expenses by the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act [IIJA] and any other supplemental or emergency-des-
ignated funding shall be presented separately. This shall include
all salaries and expenses funding and FTE/FTP provided by admin-
istrative takedowns from any and all budgetary resources. Advance
appropriations from division J of the IIJA includes takedowns for
administrative expenses, and amounts that are made available for
7
programmatic activities should not be used to exceed the adminis-
trative limitation specified in division J of the IIJA. FTEs funded
by division J are expected to be managed as a separate and distinct
resource and shall not be included or represented as an adjustment
to base in the annual discretionary budget request for salaries and
expenses.
The Committee is aware that the analytical materials required
for review by the Committee are unique to each agency in this act.
Therefore, the Committee expects that each agency will coordinate
with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in ad-
vance on its planned presentation for its budget justification mate-
rials in support of the fiscal year 2027 budget request.
TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENT
The Committee remains interested in increasing transparency
and accountability of Federal grant spending. The Departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education are directed by
the Stevens Amendment, section 505 of title V, division H of Public
Law 115–141, to require grantees to include the total cost of the
project, the percentage of Federal funds in the project or program,
and identify all of the sources of funding for the total project or
program in all public documents announcing the grant award. The
Committee directs agencies to collect data on what information
Federal grant recipients currently include in the public documents
announcing the grant award to determine whether recipients of
funding in this act could comply with the Stevens Amendment
without unreasonable burden. The Committee expresses apprecia-
tion for the Department that has submitted the report and again
reminds the remaining Department to provide the report required
in fiscal year 2020 on the feasibility of complying with the Stevens
Amendment.
FEDERAL TRUST AND TREATY RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee reminds agencies funded by this act of their obli-
gation to uphold the Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to
Tribes and Federal obligations to the Native Hawaiian community.
This includes upholding treaty and reserved rights, and any other
rights and obligations under Federal law; supporting self-deter-
mination efforts by Native communities; and conducting early and
robust government-to-government consultation with Tribes, and
meaningful outreach and engagement with Native Hawaiians.
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Committee directs the DOT and HUD to provide the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations with quarterly written
notifications on the status of pending reports required by this and
prior appropriations acts. The agencies are reminded that these re-
ports are important to the Committee’s ability to carry out its over-
sight responsibilities, and each agency is expected to comply with
specified deadlines.
8
AUDIT STANDARDS
The Committee is concerned about Federal agencies executing
contracts with certain independent financial auditing and audit re-
mediation firms that have been penalized for poor auditing prac-
tices. The Committee believes that all firms contracting with de-
partments and agencies funded in this act, particularly for finan-
cial auditing and accounting services, should have qualified profes-
sionals and ethics, and integrity controls in place to ensure they
are in compliance with Federal accounting and procurement stand-
ards. For all contract actions (including awards, renewals, and
amendments), Departments and agencies funded in this act shall
require any accounting firm providing financial auditing or audit
remediation services to provide a statement setting forth the de-
tails of any disciplinary proceedings occurring within 1 year of the
projected performance period related to noncompliance with rules
or laws applying to audit services.
FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH
The Committee urges the DOT and HUD to affirmatively deter-
mine and make available on a publicly accessible website a jus-
tification that federally funded research grants or agreements pro-
mote the progress of science in the United States or will advance
a national security or economic interest.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM ALIGNMENT
The Committee remains steadfast in its commitment to reducing
duplicative inspections addressing the statutory, regulatory, and
procedural barriers that add time and cost to affordable housing
projects that are developed with multiple Federal funding sources.
The Committee commends HUD for issuing several rules recently
to improve alignment across Federal affordable housing programs
and reduce administrative burdens on grantees. The actions taken
by HUD to update the community development block grant [CDBG]
and HOME investment partnerships [HOME] programs regula-
tions, as well as to implement the Housing Opportunity Through
Modernization Act of 2016 [HOTMA] will streamline and simplify
coordination. However, the Committee notes continued challenges
within HUD to align and streamline efforts across other Federal
agencies. The Committee directs HUD, in coordination with the In-
ternal Revenue Service [IRS] and other Federal agencies, to take
steps, within existing authorities, to streamline and better coordi-
nate Federal affordable housing development incentives and pro-
grams with the goals of simplifying the work necessary for devel-
opers to build the capital stack for affordable housing and redevel-
opment projects and minimizing the need for duplicative inspec-
tions. The Committee directs HUD, in coordination with the IRS
and other agencies, to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations no later than 180 days after enactment of this
act on policy recommendations to address statutory barriers and to
identify additional authorities necessary to further this goal.

FOREIGN MALIGN INFLUENCE MITIGATION
For more than a decade, adversaries of the United States—pri-
marily Russia, China, and Iran—have utilized foreign malign influ-
ence [FMI] to conduct influence operations against the Nation to
create divisiveness and fracture communities. Per the Department
of Homeland Security [DHS], FMI refers to the deliberate and cov-
ert actions, such as disinformation campaigns and propaganda,
used by foreign governments, organizations, or individuals to ma-
nipulate, disrupt, or undermine that political, social, or economic
stability of another country. FMI aims to create their own nar-
rative to shape public opinion, destabilize democratic processes,
sow discord, and advance the interests of the foreign actor. These
influence operations generally target politically charged issues, but
the Committee is concerned that our adversaries are exploiting
U.S. transportation incidents, infrastructure, and companies in an
effort to instill a fear of travel and to undermine the economy with
an adversarial narrative. To gain a better understanding, scope,
and impact of these nefarious efforts, the Committee directs the
DOT to coordinate efforts with the Office of the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence [ODNI] Foreign Malign Influence Center and
the National Center for Narrative Intelligence [NCNI] to produce
a public report on state backed influence operations on U.S. trans-
portation infrastructure and transportation companies.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Section 2:
Section 3 of the Department of Transportation Act of October 15,
1966 (Public Law 89–670), provides for the establishment of the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Transportation [OST]. OST is comprised of
the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary immediate and support of-
fices; the Office of the General Counsel; the Office of the Under
Secretary of Transportation for Policy, including the offices of the
Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, the As-
sistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, and the Assistant Sec-
retary for Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy; five As-
sistant Secretarial offices for Budget and Programs, Governmental
Affairs, Research and Technology, and Administration; and the Of-
fices of Public Affairs and Public Engagement, the Executive Secre-
tariat, Intelligence, Security and Emergency Response, the Chief
Information Officer, and Tribal Government Affairs. OST also in-
cludes the Department’s Office of Civil Rights and the Depart-
ment’s working capital fund.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $191,295,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 185,965,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation finances the costs of policy development and
central supervisory and coordinating functions necessary for the
overall planning and direction of the Department. It covers the im-
mediate secretarial offices as well as those of the assistant secre-
taries and the general counsel.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $185,965,000 for the salaries and
expenses of OST, including $70,000 for reception and representa-
tion expenses. The recommendation is $5,330,000 less than the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee recommendation authorizes the Secretary to
transfer up to 4 percent of the funds among the purposes funded
in the Office of the Secretary. The bill also continues language that
permits up to $2,500,000 of fees to be credited to the Office of the
Secretary for salaries and expenses. The Committee recommenda-
tion supports the realignment of individual office WCF expenses
being streamlined into one shared services account, as well as the
(10)
11
realignment of information technology development, modernization,
and enhancement [IT DME] efforts.
The following table summarizes the Committee’s recommenda-
tion in comparison to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

World Cup, Olympic, and Paralympic Events.—The Committee
recognizes that the mobility needs of competitors, supporting staff,
and spectators place high demands on the transportation and infra-
structure systems in U.S. cities hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup
and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic events. These include providing
safe and reliable event-specific mass transportation operations
across aviation, road, rail, and transit systems for attendees, resi-
dents, and visitors to the United States. The Committee directs the
Department to expedite technical assistance and to exercise flexi-
bilities in providing Federal resources, funding, approvals, and
waivers in a timely manner to the host cities, States, local govern-
ments, regional or metropolitan agencies, transit agencies, airport
and public authorities, and associated entities to enable adequate
preparation for the events.
The DHS designating the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games
as a national special security event commits all Federal agencies
to provide full cooperation and support to ensure the safety of all
participants. Because significant resources will need to be dedi-
cated to the planning, design, and implementation of transit infra-
structure over the next 3 years, the Secretary shall report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the full scope
of the DOT’s obligations, including the nature of its coordination
with other Federal agencies and departments, as well as represent-
atives of the relevant State and local transportation entities in-
volved in the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The report
shall also include the host locations’ projected resource needs for
fiscal year 2027 through fiscal year 2029, including specific account
details for each fiscal year.
12
IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Secretary of Transportation provides leadership and has the
primary responsibility to provide overall planning, direction, and
control of the Department.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $3,764,000 for the Immediate Office
of the Secretary, which is $6,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. The Committee directs the Department to abide by
both the will and intent of Congress in all funding and policy deci-
sions, and to consult with the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations prior to issuing all notices of funding opportunities
[NOFOs].
IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SECRETARY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Deputy Secretary has the primary responsibility of assisting
the Secretary in the overall planning and direction of the Depart-
ment.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,348,000 for the Immediate Office
of the Deputy Secretary, which is $22,000 less than the fiscal year
2025 enacted level.
OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of the General Counsel provides legal services to the
Office of the Secretary, including the conduct of aviation regulatory
proceedings, and coordinates and reviews the legal work in the
chief counsels’ offices of the operating administrations. The General
Counsel is the chief legal officer of the Department and the final
authority on all legal questions.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $27,780,000 for the Office of the
General Counsel, which is $4,492,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Of the amount provided, not less than $8,000,000 is
to continue the Department’s efforts to address aviation consumer
complaints and related consumer aviation activities as well as im-
plement aviation consumer protection laws through the Office of
Aviation Consumer Protection within the Office of the General
Counsel.
Aviation Consumer Complaints.—The number of air travel serv-
ice complaints surged to an unprecedented level of 102,561 in 2020
versus 15,332 in 2019, an increase of 569 percent. Since that time,
complaints have de-escalated, but remain unacceptably high at a
rate of 86,240 in 2022, 96,853 in 2023, and 97,906 in 2024. There-
fore, the Committee directs the Department to report to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations an annual summary of
13
air travel consumer complaints from the preceding year accounting
for flight delays; mishandled baggage, wheelchairs, and scooters;
over sales; airlines reports of the loss, injury, or death of animals
during transportation; customer reports to the Transportation Se-
curity Administration; and other consumer complaints. Further,
the bill requires the Secretary to report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the implementation of all sec-
tions under title V of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 not
later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR POLICY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Under Secretary for Policy is the chief policy officer of the
Department and is responsible for the analysis, development, and
review of policies and plans for domestic and international trans-
portation matters. The office administers the economic regulatory
functions regarding the airline industry and is responsible for
international aviation programs, the essential air service program,
airline fitness licensing, acquisitions, international route awards,
computerized reservation systems, and special investigations. With-
in this office, the IIJA also created an Office of Multimodal Freight
Infrastructure and Policy [MFIP] to oversee certain multimodal
freight grant programs, carry out the National multimodal freight
policy, and facilitate the movement of freight across and within dif-
ferent modes of transportation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $20,222,000 for the Office of the
Under Secretary for Policy, which is $158,000 more than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. Of the amount provided, $1,970,000 is for
the MFIP and $2,000,000 is for the freight logistics optimization
works [FLOW] program.
Competitive Grants.—The Committee strongly believes in the im-
portance of Federal competitive grant programs that provide fund-
ing above Federal formula programs and allow both State and local
transportation agencies to build and maintain infrastructure that
would otherwise not receive Federal funding. While reaching a
grant agreement between the Department and a grant recipient
can be a time-consuming and burdensome process, the grant agree-
ment is critical to ensuring grantees meet all Federal requirements
and make prudent use of taxpayer funding. The Committee appre-
ciates the Department’s progress in approving over 1,900 competi-
tive grant awards for obligation since January 2025, but remains
concerned that the on-going review of previously awarded competi-
tive grants is slowing down transportation projects in every State
and leading to unnecessary delays and cost increases. The Com-
mittee directs the DOT to expeditiously complete its reviews to
minimize impacts on grantees. Further, the Committee directs the
Department to continue helping at-risk grantees and in particular
grantees whose funds have an obligation deadline of September 30,

Section 3:
2026. The Committee directs the Department to prioritize staffing
increases in the relevant division, regional, or field offices that can
help improve the timeliness of reaching grant agreements, espe-
14
cially given the significant losses in staffing the Department has
recently experienced. In order to bring greater transparency to this
process, the Committee directs the Department to provide the sta-
tus of all awarded but not obligated competitive grant and commu-
nity project funding/congressionally directed spending projects. The
Department shall provide a list of all such awards by program, fis-
cal year, and grantee, and include the name of the project, the
state of the project location, the original amount of the award when
announced, and the amount obligated to date. The Department
shall provide the data to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations not later than 120 days after the enactment of this act
and biannually after the first submission of such data.
FLOW Program.—The Committee continues to support the De-
partment’s efforts to improve supply chain resiliency through the
FLOW program, and industry-supported data-sharing network, and
is pleased with the progress the FLOW program has made in im-
proving the transparency of the supply chain. The Committee en-
courages the DOT to consider integrating commercially available
artificial intelligence and machine learning tools into the FLOW
program. Further, the Committee directs the Department to coordi-
nate with the DHS Supply Chain Resiliency Center [SCRC] to im-
prove forecasting and scenario planning for various supply chain
disruptions, including staffing at U.S. ports.
Cargo Theft Prevention.—The Committee recognizes the substan-
tial increase in cargo theft that has affected the transportation sup-
ply chain over the last few years. The Committee directs the De-
partment to coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Investigations
[FBI], the Department of Justice, the DHS SCRC, and relevant
stakeholders, including professional policing organizations, to pro-
vide a report on cargo theft trends in the transportation supply
chain, along with a strategy to combat cargo theft, to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations not later than 120 days
after enactment of this act.
Department Policies.—The Department’s current statement of
international air transportation policy was last updated in 1995
and is now almost 30 years old. The Committee once again directs
the Department to brief the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations on the status of this policy document not later than
120 days after enactment of this act.
Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything Safety Technology.—The Com-
mittee commends the Department’s commitment to reducing deaths
and serious injuries on our Nation’s roadways. The Department’s
October 2023 draft report Saving Lives with Connectivity: A Plan
to Accelerate V2X Deployment calls cellular vehicle-to-everything
[C–V2X] technologies a ‘‘powerful tool for achieving its ambitious,
long-term goal’’ of eliminating roadway fatalities. C–V2X enables
vehicles to communicate with each other, with other road users
such as pedestrians and cyclists, and with roadside infrastructure.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to find ways to
incentivize and accelerate the deployment of cellular C–V2X tech-
nologies through coordinated actions across modal agencies, includ-
ing incorporation into the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration’s [NHTSA’s] new car assessment program [NCAP] and
through program guidance, NOFOs for discretionary grant pro-
15
grams, and national roadway safety strategy implementation. Fur-
ther, the Committee directs the Department to update and publish
its draft report Saving Lives with Connectivity: A Plan to Accelerate
V2X Deployment.
Communications Services for Limited English Proficient Commu-
nities.—The Committee directs the Department to continue improv-
ing multi-lingual communications, which should include mediums
such as television and radio, to reach limited English proficient
[LEP] communities. However, to improve implementation, the
Committee encourages the DOT to review its communication prac-
tices and create uniform applications across all modes, as appro-
priate, in order to strengthen communication including through
digital, television, and radio advertising. The Committee further di-
rects agencies at the DOT that engage in educational outreach
campaigns to report to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations on their annual advertising budgets not later than 90
days after enactment of this act.
Digital Twin Technologies.—The Committee understands the po-
tential that digital infrastructure technologies, including software
and related services, have in modernizing our Nation’s existing and
future infrastructure. These technologies have the potential to re-
duce project costs, accelerate project delivery, and build more inno-
vative, resilient, and efficient infrastructure, including bridges and
other surface transportation assets. As such, the Committee directs
the Department to include digital infrastructure technologies in
NOFOs in an effort to leverage Federal resources to the maximum
extent possible and to bring the U.S. into the next generation of
bridge design, construction, operations, and maintenance. The
Committee also directs the Department to ensure non-Federal
stakeholders are informed of the eligibility of technology in the de-
livery of federally funded projects.
Transportation Workforce Outreach Program.—The Committee
strongly supports initiatives to encourage awareness of career op-
portunities in the transportation sector. The Committee directs the
Department to implement the transportation workforce outreach
program as authorized in section 25020 of the IIJA. Further, the
Committee directs the Department to utilize program funds to sup-
port the development, production, and use of broadcast, digital, and
print media advertising and outreach efforts as part of a public
awareness campaign.
Foreign Control of Helicopter Operators.—The Committee expects
the Department to address allegations of U.S. carriers under actual
foreign control that are operating between two U.S. points for com-
pensation without satisfying 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(15) and to take en-
forcement or other action as appropriate on such carriers found to
be operating in violation of existing law.
Battery Powered Mobility Devices.—The Committee notes the
rapid rise of battery powered mobility devices in the United States,
and the limitations of current battery options due to long charge
times and limited life cycles. As such, the Department is encour-
aged to support the development of hybrid supercapacitor-lithium-
ion battery modules to improve the performance and accessibility
of battery powered mobility devices.

$16,335,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to continue to improve the represen-
tation of administrative costs for the office and directs the Depart-
ment to include details relating to staffing levels across activities
in future budget justifications. The following table provides funding
levels for activities within this account, and includes programmatic
and staffing related to such activities.
Recommendation
Highly automated systems safety center of excellence .................................................................................. $4,000,000
PNT technologies and GPS backup.................................................................................................................. 3,000,000
Advanced research projects agency-infrastructure [ARPA–I] initiative .......................................................... 9,000,000
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing [PNT] Technologies and
Global Positioning System [GPS] Backup.—The Committee rec-
ommendation provides $3,000,000 to support this initiative estab-
lished by Congress in 2022 that allows for the wide adoption of
multiple technologies that provide the necessary GPS backup and
complementary PNT technologies as identified in 2021 in the Com-
plementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstration Re-
port (DOT–VNTSC–20–07). The Department is directed to use the
funds provided in this and prior year appropriations acts to enable
the deployment of commercial solutions that provide permanent
complementary PNT services. The Committee also encourages the
Department to use enhanced contracting authority, such as: cooper-
ative agreements, cooperative research, and development agree-
ments, or small business innovation research [SBIR] to deploy such
services rapidly.
20
ARPA–I.—The recommendation includes $9,000,000 to support
ARPA–I as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 119, and the open research
initiative as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 5506. The funding will ad-
vance and deploy technology products that have the potential to
transform transportation systems and the way they are used. The
Committee is aware of the significant number of bridges across the
country in need of repair or replacement and the high costs associ-
ated with traditional bridge construction and maintenance tech-
niques and materials. Therefore, of the amount provided for
ARPA–I, $6,000,000 is to support ARPA–I’s work to advance and
deploy composite material technology for short- and medium-span
bridge construction in order to reduce costs and improve bridge life-
spans.
Ferry Decarbonization Data.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to collect additional data in conjunction with the national
census of ferry operators [NCFO] to better understand the condi-
tion of the existing domestic ferry fleet, including the baseline
emissions, engine model year, segment layover duration, and exist-
ing electric utility infrastructure at terminal. Additionally, the De-
partment shall obtain information on whether the respondent has
specified published emissions reductions goals, what those specific
emissions reductions goals are, and whether each organization
maintains a long-range fleet capitalization plan. Responses to the
NCFO shall be mandatory.
Infrastructure Durability.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of ensuring long-lasting transportation improvements that
are capable of withstanding extreme events, natural disasters, and
other potential impacts to ensure durability, efficiency, and cost ef-
fectiveness. The DOT has published research showing the advances
in the science of concrete materials and specifically the enhanced
durability benefits and exceptional performance of ultra-high-per-
formance concrete [UHPC]. The Committee directs the Department
to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
on the use of UHPC in Federal infrastructure projects and how the
use of such materials are expected to improve the overall lifespan
of federally funded infrastructure projects.
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $345,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 250,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This program provides grants and credit assistance to State and
local governments, Tribes, transit agencies, ports, or a collaboration
of such entities for capital investments in surface transportation in-
frastructure that will have a significant impact on the Nation, a
metropolitan area, or a region. Eligible projects include highways
and bridges, public transportation, freight and passenger rail, and
port infrastructure. The Department awards grants on a competi-
tive basis; however, the Department must ensure an equitable geo-
graphic distribution of funds and an appropriate balance in ad-
21
dressing the needs of urban and rural communities, including Trib-
al areas.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $250,000,000 for grants and credit
assistance as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 6702, which is
$95,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The national infrastructure investments program, known again
as the BUILD program, has become integral to improving safety
and mobility in communities throughout the country for more than
a decade. The outcome-oriented selection criteria that includes
state of good repair, economic competitiveness, quality of life, envi-
ronmental sustainability, safety, innovation, and partnership, nur-
tures stronger applications and results in successful multimodal
projects. Given the importance of infrastructure reuse projects for
transportation, economic development, emissions reduction, and
recreation, the Committee encourages the Department to consider
supporting infrastructure reuse projects.
Geographic Distribution.—The Committee continues to believe
that our Federal infrastructure programs must benefit commu-
nities across the country. The Committee continues to require the
Secretary to award grants and credit assistance in a manner that
ensures an equitable geographic distribution of funds and an ap-
propriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural com-
munities, including Tribal areas.
Mega Grants.—The Committee recognizes that inland ports are
an important element in the international supply chain, increasing
intermodal capacity and efficiencies in the movement of global com-
merce from ships to major transportation networks for distribution.
Benefits include reduced congestion at marine terminals and on the
Nation’s highways, lower costs of moving cargo, environmental and
safety benefits, economic development in underserved or rural
areas, as well as consolidation of import/export centers. Within the
advance appropriations for this program, the Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to consider mega grant applications that include
the development of coastal and inland ports that provide supply
chain improvements and reduce supply chain disruption and to
continue to support major infrastructure projects that are too com-
plex or costly for traditional funding sources while likely gener-
ating significant national or regional benefits.
Further, the Committee notes that the mega grant program was
designed to be a multi-modal transportation program, including to
support transit projects. Specifically, 49 U.S.C. 6701(d)(1)(E) makes
transit projects eligible that are ‘‘part of’’ eligible highway or
bridge, freight intermodal or rail, highway-rail grade crossing, or
intercity passenger rail projects. Within the advance appropriations
for this program, the Committee encourages the Secretary to con-
sider mega grant applications for transit projects that are ‘‘part of’’
otherwise eligible projects under the program.
NATIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND INNOVATIVE FINANCE
BUREAU

Transit Oriented Development.—Maximizing a community’s ac-
cess to DOT financing for transit oriented development has the po-
tential to make affordable and mixed-income housing projects co-lo-
cate near rail and transit infrastructure possible due to the pro-
gram’s favorable lending rates compared to the private market. The
Committee supports the efforts of the Departments in this act to
leverage HUD expertise in housing development financing to
streamline the application process for loans under the DOT’s
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act [TIFIA]
credit program and the RRIF program. To that end, the DOT and
HUD shall establish a task force to examine ways to leverage exist-
ing underwriting procedures and proformas that are familiar to
housing developers for use in the TIFIA and RRIF application proc-
ess, to explore opportunities to layer Federal financing to meet the
investment grade rating requirement of TIFIA, to address timing
challenges for projects with multiple financing sources, and to min-
imize the need for duplicative credit reviews. The Committee di-
rects the task force to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on its priority objectives, assessment of adminis-
trative and statutory barriers, and planned action items and mile-
stones not later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
RURAL AND TRIBAL INFRASTRUCTURE ADVANCEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $25,000,000

research, and development activities needed to assist the Secretary
in the formulation of national transportation policies. The program
is carried out primarily through contracts with other Federal agen-
cies, educational institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and
private firms.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $34,259,000 for transportation plan-
ning, research, and development, which is $13,333,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Within this funding level, the
Committee recommendation includes $9,647,000 to accommodate
congressionally directed spending [CDS] for eligible projects. The
Committee directs the Office of the Secretary to provide funding for
those projects listed in the table at the end of this report in the
corresponding amounts.
Flight 5342.—In light of the traffic accident of American Eagle
Flight 5342 with an U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter, the Com-
mittee remains fully committed to ensuring no such accident occurs
again. As such, the Committee recommendation includes
$2,000,000 for the DOT to commission the National Academies of
Science within 30 days of enactment of this act to conduct an inde-
pendent review of airspace design, civil-military coordination, and
operational safety in the National Capital Region, with particular
focus on airspace activities at Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport [DCA]. The review shall be conducted by an independent
panel of experts in aviation safety, airspace operations, and civil-
25
military coordination. Panel members shall be selected by the Na-
tional Academies of Science, in consultation with the National
Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations, and other relevant authorizing commit-
tees. Panel members shall include representatives from academia,
former regulators currently unaffiliated with the Federal Aviation
Administration [FAA] or the Department of Defense [DoD], rel-
evant industry partners, stakeholders, unions, and nationally rec-
ognized safety institutions. The panel shall be formed within 90
days of enactment of this act. The review shall assess: (1) historical
and ongoing risks associated with DCA airspace design and usage,
including historical incidents relevant to current protocols; (2) the
adequacy of coordination protocols between the FAA, DoD, and
other entities involved in or affected by airspace coordination; (3)
patterns of near-miss incidents involving military aircraft; and (4)
structural, cultural, or procedural barriers to risk identification and
accountability. The DOT and the FAA shall: (1) not chair, direct,
or control the panel’s work; (2) allocate sufficient resources to en-
sure timely completion of the review; and (3) provide full coopera-
tion, including access to non-classified data, documentation, and
personnel. The DOT and FAA shall fully cooperate with the Na-
tional Academies of Science and respond to all requests for data,
including by coordinating with the DoD to provide their data. The
National Academies of Science shall issue a summary of findings
and recommendations as determined by the panel not later than
180 days after enactment of this act. The findings and rec-
ommendations shall convey key conclusions without redacting non-
sensitive procedural information, and shall be submitted to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and published
online not later than 180 days after enactment of this act. The full
report of the panel shall be submitted to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than 210 days after enact-
ment of this act. The DOT and the FAA shall respond publicly in
writing to the recommendations of the panel within 90 days of pub-
lication of the final report.
Human Trafficking.—Globally, millions of people are subject to
human trafficking and forced labor. The vast majority of inter-
national human trafficking journeys cross through official border
control points such as airports and land borders. Educating and
empowering travelers and transportation employees of the indica-
tors of this abuse of human rights is a valuable prevention mecha-
nism that can enhance community-coordinated responses and sup-
port informed interventions. The Committee supports the DOT’s
‘‘Combating Human Trafficking in the Transportation Sector
Awareness Training’’ and directs the Department to encourage rel-
evant stakeholders, including airports, transit hubs, and recipients
of financial assistance from the Department, to implement com-
prehensive policies to combat human trafficking and support sur-
vivors based on guidance and recommendations from DOT’s Advi-
sory Committee on Human Trafficking.

WORKING CAPITAL FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $522,165,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 650,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The WCF provides technical and administrative services to the
Department’s operating administrations and other Federal entities.
The services are centrally performed in the interest of economy and
efficiency, are funded through negotiated agreements with the De-
partment’s operating administrations and other Federal customers,
and are billed on a fee-for-service basis to the maximum extent
possible.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation of $650,000,000 on ac-
tivities financed through the WCF, which is $127,835,000 more
than the limit enacted for fiscal year 2025. As in past years, the
bill specifies that the limitation on the WCF shall apply only to the
Department and not to services provided for other entities. The
Committee directs services to be provided on a competitive basis to
the maximum extent possible.
Consolidation Efforts.—The Committee appreciates the Depart-
ment’s efforts to identify opportunities to derive efficiencies in oper-
ations across the Department and its modal administrations. While
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have pre-
viously prohibited the Department from expanding activities within
the WCF to include non-commodity IT, the Committee recognizes
the potential for economies of scale and efficiencies that could be
gained by the Department by expanding the WCF’s existing work
on commodity IT to non-commodity IT activities. However, the
Committee remains concerned with the lack of a clearly defined
plan for the consolidation of non-commodity IT activities. The bill
specifies how the Department may proceed with the consolidation
of non-commodity IT activities and requires the Secretary to pro-
vide a plan to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
describing the non-commodity IT consolidation not less than 30
days prior to using the authorities provided within the bill. Such
plan shall include details on the IT programs and systems being
consolidated, the modal administrations participating in such con-
solidation, impacts on staffing within the OST and any partici-
pating modal administration, the expected costs and benefits to the
OST and any participating modal administrations from such con-
solidation, and the expected timeline for such consolidation.
SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS UTILIZATION AND OUTREACH

27
firms in securing contracts and subcontracts for transportation-re-
lated projects that involve Federal spending. Separate funding is
provided for these activities since this program provides grants and
contract assistance that serve Department-wide goals and not just
OST purposes.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $5,330,000 for the Office of Small
and Disadvantaged Business Utilization and Outreach, which is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee directs
the office to provide a briefing to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations on certification requirements for the dis-
advantaged business enterprise determinations regarding Tribal
entities.
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program.—The Committee
recognizes the critical role that the Department’s Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise [DBE] program has played in the success of
women- and minority-owned businesses since its inception in 1983.
The Committee directs the Department to carefully consider the
impact of any proposed changes to the program on the success of
women- and minority-owned firms and on economic development in
the transportation sector.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides funding for the essential air service
[EAS] program, which was created to continue air service to com-
munities that had received federally mandated air service prior to
deregulation of commercial aviation in 1978. The program cur-
rently provides subsidies to air carriers serving small communities
that meet certain criteria.
The FAA collects user fees that cover the air traffic control serv-
ices the agency provides to aircraft that neither take off from, nor
land in, the United States. These fees are commonly referred to as
‘‘overflight fees’’ and the receipts from the fees are used to help fi-
nance the EAS program.

FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for the safe
movement of civil aviation and the evolution of a national system
of airports. The Federal Government’s regulatory role in civil avia-
tion began with the creation of an Aeronautics Branch within the
Department of Commerce pursuant to the Air Commerce Act of
1926 (Public Law 69–254). This act instructed the agency to foster
air commerce; designate and establish airways; establish, operate,
and maintain aids to navigation; arrange for research and develop-
ment to improve such aids; issue airworthiness certificates for air-
craft and major aircraft components; and investigate civil aviation
accidents. In the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 (Public Law 75–
706), these activities were transferred to a new, independent agen-
cy named the Civil Aeronautics Authority. Congress streamlined
regulatory oversight in 1957 with the creation of two separate
agencies, the Federal Aviation Agency and the Civil Aeronautics
Board. When the DOT began its operations in 1967, the Federal
Aviation Agency was renamed the FAA and became one of several
modal administrations within DOT. The Civil Aeronautics Board
was later phased out with enactment of the Airline Deregulation
Act of 1978 (Public Law 95–504), and ceased to exist in 1984. Re-
sponsibility for the investigation of civil aviation accidents was
given to the National Transportation Safety Board in 1967. FAA’s
mission expanded in 1995 with the transfer of the Office of Com-
mercial Space Transportation from the Office of the Secretary, and
decreased in December 2001 with the transfer of civil aviation se-
curity activities to the Transportation Security Administration.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The total recommended funding level for the FAA for fiscal year
2026 amounts to $22,427,551,000, including new budget authority
and a limitation on the obligation of contract authority. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the Committee’s recommendations and

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides funds for the operation, mainte-
nance, communications, and logistical support of the air traffic con-
trol and air navigation systems. It also covers administrative and
managerial costs for the FAA’s regulatory, international, commer-
cial space, medical, research, engineering, and development pro-
grams, as well as policy oversight and agency management func-
tions. The operations appropriation includes the following major ac-
tivities:
—the Air Traffic Organization [ATO], which operates, on a 24-
hour daily basis, the National air traffic system, including the
establishment and maintenance of a national system of aids to
navigation, the development and distribution of aeronautical
charts and the administration of acquisition, and research and
development programs;
—the regulation and certification activities, including establish-
ment and surveillance of civil air regulations to ensure safety
and development of standards, rules and regulations governing
the physical fitness of airmen, as well as the administration of
an aviation medical research program;
—the Office of Commercial Space Transportation; and
—headquarters and support offices.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total of $13,818,183,000 for FAA
operations. This funding level is $335,400,000 more than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. As in past years, the FAA is directed to
report immediately to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations in the event resources are insufficient to operate a safe
and effective air traffic control system. The following table summa-
rizes the Committee’s recommendation in comparison to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level:

Funding Level.—The Committee provides $13,818,183,000 for
FAA operations, which is $335,400,000 above the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. This increase consists of $217,220,000 in adjustment
to base increases and the following discretionary adjustments:
—$97,253,000 for the controller hiring and training surge, with
a goal of hiring 2,500 new controllers in fiscal year 2026;
—$9,744,000 for air carrier surveillance and production over-
sight, to be prioritized for the FAA’s enhanced oversight of
Boeing;
31
—$35,000,000 for cybersecurity efforts; and
—$23,817,000 in funding reductions due to staffing decreases
(except for air traffic organization and aviation safety).
Staffing.—The Committee recommendation includes
$9,700,420,000 for the FAA’s personnel expenses. According to the
FAA, over 2,000 employees have accepted the DRP and will leave
the agency in the next few months. The Committee directs the FAA
to provide a complete list of positions that will not be filled due to
the employee accepting the DRP within 30 days of enactment of
this act. The Committee expects the FAA to accumulate hundreds
of millions of dollars in savings from the DRP, and directs the FAA
to provide a report on how such funds will be used.
Air Traffic Controller Hiring.—The Committee supports the
FAA’s efforts to hire 2,500 new air traffic controllers in fiscal year

Section 20:
2026. The FAA shall expand training at the FAA Training Acad-
emy at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center [MMAC] and sup-
plement these efforts by expanding air traffic controller training
through the air-traffic collegiate training initiative [AT–CTI] pro-
gram. The Committee directs the FAA to provide quarterly staffing
updates, including hiring and separations, by program office for all
positions funded by this and any other act, and to provide on a
quarterly basis: (1) the status of hiring new controllers; (2) actual
staffing levels, including hiring and separation levels, at all air
traffic control [ATC] facilities; and (3) flight delays at each ATC fa-
cility by category.
AT–CTI.—The FAA should ensure that all air traffic controller
trainees from the AT–CTI and enhanced-CTI programs are taught
according to the same rigorous and uniform standards, and the
FAA should closely monitor these programs and provide sufficient
oversight for each school. The Committee directs the FAA provide
within 270 days of enactment of this act a report on: (1) FAA hiring
and separation numbers for AT–CTI and E–CTI graduates; (2) the
total number of AT–CTI and E–CTI program graduates and the
proportion that seek employment as certified professional control-
lers [CPCs] within one calendar year of program completion; and
(3) a comparison of training performance, separation rates and at-
tainment of necessary qualifications between AT–CTI and E–CTI
graduates and the FAA-academy trained CPCs. For each hiring
pool opened in fiscal year 2026, the report shall contain the total
number of applicants, for AT–CTI, E–CTI, and the FAA academy,
who have: (1) applied for the position of air traffic controller; (2)
been issued a tentative offer letter for the position of air traffic con-
troller; (3) been issued a firm offer letter for the position of air traf-
fic controller; and (4) been hired for the position of air traffic con-
troller.
Designee Training.—The Committee directs the FAA to provide
a $9,000,000 increase for the Office of Aviation Safety [AVS] to im-
prove the training of designees, potential designees, and FAA em-
ployees assigned to provide oversight of designees authorized under
14 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 183. These funds should
also be used to increase the number of designees authorized under
14 CFR Parts 183.23, 183.25, 183.29, and 183.33, but only to the
extent that such designees will improve aviation safety. AVS may
select appropriate third-party providers, including educational in-
32
stitutions, to provide this training. This funding may facilitate the
effective use of designees to support the certification of new and
novel aircraft designs and other certificate activities, to the extent
permissible under current law.
Organization Chart.—The Committee directs the FAA to include
a more detailed organization chart as an exhibit to section one of
the President’s budget justification that provides not less than two
levels of offices below the Office of the Administrator and Deputy
Administrator for the Air Traffic Organization and the Office of the
Assistant Administrator for Aviation Safety.
NextGen Advisory Committee.—The FAA is directed to reinstate
the NextGen Advisory Committee, or a successor advisory com-
mittee or other forum through which aviation stakeholders convene
and help provide independent advice and recommendations to the
FAA and respond to specific taskings received directly from the
FAA.
Congested Airspace.—The Committee urges the FAA to increase
the use of performance based navigation instrument flight proce-
dures in congested airspace in order to enhance safety and oper-
ational efficiency through more precise and predictable aircraft
routing. The Committee directs the FAA to assess the impact of
limiting aircraft to those equipped with certain NextGen avionics
at times based on operational efficiency without leading to air serv-
ice loss to small communities or any reduction in safety. In assess-
ing potential loss of air carrier service, the FAA shall examine the
current equipage at congested airports and work with stakeholders
to assess realistic timelines for air carriers to equip all aircraft
with certain NextGen avionics. The FAA shall brief the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act on this assessment.
Medical Certifications and Clearances.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $100,063,000, an increase of $3,000,000
above the budget request, for the Office of Aerospace Medicine to
increase staffing and to modernize its information management
system in order to reduce processing times and improve decision-
making for medical certification and clearances. The FAA is di-
rected to increase staffing for additional staff psychiatrists, legal
instrument examiners, and program analysts who can help expe-
dite and reduce the existing backlogs for pilot and air traffic con-
troller medical certification, including special issuance or special
consideration, and medication approvals. The FAA should also use
the additional funding to modernize its information management
system by developing a template electronic submission platform to
reduce errors and omissions in information submitted to the FAA
by aviation medical examiners. The FAA should also publish prac-
tical medical certification/clearance guidance for applicants and en-
sure that information and documentation made available to avia-
tion stakeholders is correct and consistent. The FAA should strive
to achieve fair and reasonable time limits on certification decisions
of all classes of medical applications. Finally, the FAA is directed
to provide a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this act to the
House and Senate Committee on Appropriations on: (1) implemen-
tation of recommendations from the mental health and aviation
medical clearances rulemaking committee; and (2) the findings and
33
recommendations from the aviation workforce mental health task
group established in section 411 of the FAA Reauthorization of

Section 21:
2024.
Air Traffic Control Privatization.—The United States has the
largest, safest, most efficient, and most complex air traffic control
system in the world, and the FAA should remain a global leader
with a singular and unified mission of safety. To that end, the
Committee does not support any efforts to transfer the FAA’s air
traffic functions to a not-for-profit, independent, private corpora-
tion. The Committee is aware that if the Nation’s air traffic control
system had been privatized during the COVID–19 pandemic, simi-
lar to other air navigation service providers in Canada and the Eu-
ropean Union, the United States would have faced severe funding
shortfalls. These shortfalls would have likely led to controller lay-
offs and greater risks to flight safety, and a slower recovery after
the end of the pandemic, thus leading to more flight delays and
price increases for consumers.
Contract Towers.—The Committee recommendation provides not
less than $279,200,000 for the contract tower program, including
the cost-share for contract towers. The Committee directs the FAA
to continue to operate all contract towers currently in the program,
including the contract tower cost-share program, as well as to expe-
ditiously add qualified eligible airports. The Committee directs the
FAA to expedite the applications for cost-benefit ratio studies upon
receipt of all applications to the contract tower program and to
take into account all relevant operations activities, including mili-
tary and commercial operations, as permissible under current law.
The Committee recommendation also includes $8,000,000 for the
pilot program to convert high activity air traffic control towers op-
erating under the contract tower program to FAA staffed visual
flight rules towers, as authorized under section 625 of the FAA Re-
authorization Act of 2024. The Committee directs the FAA to com-
mence this program within 180 days of enactment of this act and
to prioritize contract towers as required under section 625(a)(2) of
such act.
Safety Management System [SMS] Rulemaking.—The Committee
continues to support the FAA’s efforts to implement the final SMS
rulemaking issued on April 26, 2024. However, the Committee is
also aware that the FAA needs to further increase the use of SMS,
such as by adding part 145 repair stations and to meet other Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization requirements under Annex 19.
The FAA should also consider including other approval holders in
SMS, such as supplemental type certificate holders, parts manufac-
turer approval holders, and technical standard order holders. How-
ever, no change to the current SMS shall in any way reduce the
overall safety of the national airspace system [NAS].
Radar Approach Control.—The Committee is aware that radar
approach control enhances aviation safety and efficiency for regu-
larly scheduled commercial airline service. The FAA should utilize
existing budget authorities, if excess funding is available, to pro-
vide radar to all air traffic control towers with significant adverse
terrain and seasonal winter weather conditions.
FAA Public Hearing.—The Committee notes that the proposal to
modify the Condor 1 and Condor 2 military operating areas has
34
been withdrawn. However, the Committee remains concerned with
any potential proposals to modify these military operating areas
and encourages the FAA to work with its partner agencies by hold-
ing a public hearing with representatives from the relevant Federal
agencies in western Maine if any such proposal is issued. The Com-
mittee recognizes that the Air National Guard, as the lead agency
under the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] (Public Law
91–190) process, has previously sought to meet the minimum legal
requirements for public participation and comment in past pro-
posals. Should any similar proposal be issued, the Committee di-
rects the FAA to report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations prior to the issuance of a record of decision regard-
ing any modification of the Condor 1 and Condor 2 military oper-
ations areas that includes a summary of any public meetings and
hearings and a list of the comments, questions, and responses pre-
sented at these meetings and hearings.
Special Use Airspace.—The Committee directs the FAA to con-
tinue its efforts to improve airspace sharing with the DoD for spe-
cial use.
Next Generation Radio Altimeters.—The Committee continues to
support the FAA’s ongoing work at the MMAC, in partnership with
aviation manufacturers, to accelerate testing, certification, and im-
plementation of new radio altimeter capabilities consistent with the
next generation avionics standards. The Committee directs the
FAA to provide an updated report on the roadmap and timeline for
development, testing, and certification to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of the enactment of
this act.
Unmanned Aircraft Systems [UAS] Test Sites.—The Committee
recommendation includes $6,000,000 for providing matching funds
to commercial entities that contract with an FAA-designated UAS
test range to demonstrate or validate technologies that the FAA
considers essential to the safe integration of UAS into the NAS.
The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 allows the FAA to select up
to two additional locations as UAS test sites through a criteria-
based selection process. Prior to selecting these two additional loca-
tions, the FAA shall brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the criteria that will be used to select these ad-
ditional test site locations, including references to criteria used to
select the previous test sites, whether those criteria will be re-
tained, and if not, why they were replaced. The Committee further
expects the FAA to ensure that any new test site selected possesses
a level of expertise and capacity to safely operate UAS equivalent
to the existing test sites.
Know Before You Fly.—The Committee supports FAA’s ‘‘Know
Before You Fly’’ public-private partnership to improve the safety of
UAS operations.
UAS Beyond Visual Line of Sight [BVLOS] Rulemaking.—The
FAA should meet all requirements in the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2024 for the BVLOS rulemaking, including the required timeline
for the proposed and final rule. The FAA should continue to keep
UAS stakeholders informed of a realistic BVLOS rulemaking
timeline, including the challenges associated with this rulemaking,
35
and any differences between the proposed rulemaking and the
BVLOS aviation rulemaking committee’s recommendations.
UAS Environmental Reviews.—The expanded use of small UAS
across the country requires the FAA to conduct environmental re-
views, and the FAA has made progress toward broader, area-wide
environmental reviews for UAS operations. The Committee directs
the FAA to continue to streamline area- or region-wide environ-
mental reviews, and brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on its progress within 90 days of enactment of this
act.
Military UAS Integration.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes up to $1,000,000 to support collaborative efforts with the
DoD to safely integrate military UAS into the NAS.
Protecting Domestic Manufacturing From Unauthorized Drone
Use.—The Committee is concerned about the use of drones to spy
on and facilitate theft at automotive manufacturing plants. The
Committee directs the FAA to report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this
act on any challenges associated with including major manufac-
turing plants and domestic automotive manufacturing sites as crit-
ical infrastructure under section 2209 of the FAA Extension, Safe-
ty, and Security Act of 2016.
UAS and Advanced Air Mobility Integration.—The Committee is
mindful that the proliferation of UAS deployments around the
country will require careful coordination with advanced air mobil-
ity [AAM] aircraft as new AAM entrants are certified and begin to
operate in the NAS. As such, the Committee supports the FAA’s ef-
forts to work with public and private stakeholders that are actively
testing and advancing the operation of UAS and AAM aircraft as
a tool to connect small communities to improve the delivery of
goods and services. The FAA should work with State partners with
broad expertise in aviation manufacturing, research, and innova-
tion to demonstrate the application of these air traffic management
technologies, to the extent such partnerships benefit the FAA’s mis-
sion. The FAA should also engage with local communities, includ-
ing those not represented at airport roundtables, on how AAM will
integrate into the NAS and local communities.
Aircraft Certification.—The Committee recommendation includes
not less than $379,223,000 for the aircraft certification service
[AIR]. The additional 32 positions included in the budget request
shall be prioritized to address the FAA’s increased oversight of Boe-
ing and other aviation manufacturers.
Alaska Air Flight 1282.—The NTSB’s final report on the Alaska
Air flight 1282 accident principally highlighted the manufacturer’s
failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight of its
manufacturing personnel, particularly for the parts removal proc-
ess. In addition, the NTSB determined that the FAA had ineffec-
tive compliance and audits over the manufacturer, including failure
to identify and address repetitive and systemic nonconformance
issues. As the FAA continues its increased oversight over the man-
ufacturer, the FAA is directed to also address all NTSB rec-
ommendations to both the FAA and the manufacturer, and to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment of this act on a timeframe for implementing
36
the NTSB recommendations. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes sufficient resources for efforts to improve record systems for
managers and inspectors overseeing production approval holders
and to convene a third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive re-
view of the manufacturer’s commercial airplanes’ safety culture.
Aircraft Certification Modernization and International Competi-
tiveness.—The Committee provides sufficient resources to ensure
technical expertise and workforce training is made available to
strengthen safety and production oversight. The aircraft certifi-
cation process can, at times, be plagued by antiquated procedures
and delayed due to the need to transfer thousands of physical docu-
ments between the FAA and manufacturers. Manufacturers have
also highlighted the lack of harmonization between the FAA’s regu-
latory requirements and those of international regulatory bodies.
Such competitive distortion may not have any corresponding safety
benefits. The Committee believes investing in the digitization and
modernization of the aircraft certification process, while ensuring a
safety-focused and level international playing field, will serve to ad-
vance the FAA’s safety mission while enhancing U.S. industry’s
competitiveness. The Committee expects the FAA to expedite im-
plementation of sections 310, 311, 313, 358, and 359 of the FAA
Reauthorization Act of 2024 and requests a briefing from the FAA
on its implementation plans within 30 days of the enactment of
this act.
New Aircraft Technologies to Improve Safety.—Multiple redun-
dant sensors can provide accurate and consistent data to aircraft,
and validating aircraft and environmental data that feeds these
systems will be increasingly critical as automation increases in
flight control systems. Within 180 days of enactment of this act,
the FAA shall provide the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations a report analyzing the safety benefit of employing a re-
dundant technology sensing requirement for safety critical air data
systems, including but not limited to primary ice detectors for part
23 and part 25 aircraft, as well as part 27 and part 29 rotorcraft.
Aviation Safety-Enhancing Technology.—The Committee sup-
ports the use of new aviation technologies to improve aviation safe-
ty. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 will help the FAA to bet-
ter oversee and improve its cross-agency efforts to integrate such
technologies. These efforts should include coordination within FAA
offices to the extent such efforts can demonstrably improve safety.
Parts Manufacturer Approval [PMA].—The FAA should adhere to
its regulations and remain objective in the assessment of critical
technology and applications for PMA parts. The FAA must balance
the requirement to not disclose PMA applications to competitors
while ensuring that any third-party input is fact-based and justi-
fied by operational data and technical merit, with documented ra-
tionale for such input. The Committee directs the FAA to brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, no later than 90
days after enactment of this act, on any significant changes to the
PMA process, submit the report required from the instructions for
continue airworthiness aviation rulemaking committee, as author-
ized under section 349 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.
Whistleblower Reports.—Currently, the FAA only releases the
final report for a whistleblower complaint or information that has
37
been substantiated by the FAA through a Freedom of Information
Act [FOIA] request. The Committee acknowledges the importance
of protecting any sensitive non-public information in these reports,
but is concerned that the FAA has, in some instances, taken
months to provide these reports to the brave whistleblowers who
identified aviation safety concerns. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the FAA to increase staffing in relevant offices to ensure
FOIA requests can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.
Veterans’ Pilot Training.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $3,000,000 for the pilot program to provide veterans with
pilot training services, as authorized under section 418 of the FAA
Reauthorization Act of 2024. This program is an important tool to
increasing the number of commercial pilots. The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of building upon existing agreements between
the FAA and flight training schools to continue providing training
and education to veterans to become commercial airline pilots, and
directs that any remaining funds previously appropriated for the
program remain available for use in fiscal year 2026. The Com-
mittee recommends that the FAA assess best practices and ways
to improve pilot training to veterans as it implements this pro-
gram.
Aviation Manufacturing.—The Committee acknowledges the con-
tributions of manufacturing and maintenance to U.S. competitive-
ness and exports. For the general aviation sector, this supports
1,300,000 jobs and $339,000,000,000 in economic output annually
to the U.S. economy. Collectively, aviation is the second largest
manufacturing export sector and the largest positive trade balance
of any manufacturing sector resulting in a net positive export trade
balance of $104,000,000,000, with exports of $124,000,000,000 and
imports of $20,000,000,000 in 2024. The Committee encourages the
DOT and the FAA to support efforts that sustain this leadership
through workforce investment, certification improvements, and ex-
pansion of a trade policy that has supported U.S. dominance.
Office of Commercial Space Transportation [AST].—The Com-
mittee recommendation includes $41,546,000 for AST and expects
AST to accelerate the pace of hiring in fiscal year 2026 in order to
keep up with the pace of licensing applications, as well as the tran-
sition to part 450 regulations in March 2026. The Committee is
aware that despite AST evaluating license applications on average
within 118 days, well within the statutory mandated deadline, li-
cense applicants continue to face delays in the pre-application proc-
ess. However, the licensing process has become increasingly
strained due to delays in resolving substantive disagreement about
how to comply with part 450 regulations between AST staff and
certain applicants. Therefore, the Committee directs AST to imple-
ment a technical escalation process through which disputes can be
adjudicated. This process, which may be requested by the license
applicant when the applicant receives a notification from AST that
a technical methodology or application element is insufficient,
should ensure a consistent standard of review between all license
applications, provide equal opportunity for licensing material that
may represent new or innovative solutions, and ensure that indi-
vidual AST licensing staff can access additional resources for crit-
ical decisions. The process must include the license applicant, re-
38
quire adjudications to be made within 15 days, and require that ra-
tionale be documented and shared with the applicant. The appli-
cant shall have three opportunities for adjudications for a new li-
cense application. The Committee directs the FAA to brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status and
utilization of this process within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Airspace Integration.—The Committee directs the FAA to include
updates to tools and systems used to integrate space launch and
reentry operations into the NAS, including capabilities to provide
real-time hazard area generation and project live telemetry data
onto air traffic controller scopes, in efforts to modernize the United
States’ air traffic control system. While these efforts would provide
limited benefits to the users of the NAS in comparison to other
technology efforts, they will help optimize airspace management
around space launch and reentry operations, mitigate the impact of
such operations on other users of the NAS, and provide greater in-
formation and operational readiness to air traffic controllers ac-
tively managing the airspace. The FAA is directed to include the
FAA ATO office that handles space operations integration in all
discussions on the planning, development, and implementation of
air traffic control modernization efforts to ensure that the full inte-
gration of space launch and reentry operations remains a possi-
bility.
Tower Services.—The FAA is directed to: (1) identify airports
that are currently served by FAA towers with nonradar approach
and departure control; and (2) develop an implementation plan,
which takes into account budgetary and flight volume consider-
ations, to provide an airport identified under section (1), if appro-
priate, with approach control radar.
Direct Aircraft-to-Aircraft Communications.—The Committee re-
mains concerned about the expected potential exponential growth
in the NAS of UAS creating significant traffic and congestion and
increasing the risk of collisions. The Committee believes that, in
addition to UAS traffic management services, fast, reliable, and se-
cure communications between drones are also needed to ensure
safe flights and to prevent collisions. Direct aircraft-to-aircraft com-
munications enable drones to detect and avoid each other without
the need for terrestrial or satellite connectivity and can play a crit-
ical role in ensuring that safety-critical communications are always
available. Therefore, the Committee expects the FAA to consider
and study the use of well-established wireless communications
standards for direct aircraft-to-aircraft communications, including
those proposed by the radio technical commission for aeronautics,
3rd generation partnership project, and Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, to ensure safe drone operations in the NAS.
The Committee directs the FAA to report its findings to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Mobile Clearances.—The Committee is aware the FAA has spon-
sored research and conducted trials to advance a safe and secure
mobile platform for delivering clearances to pilots with the aim of
reducing controller workload and enabling fuel savings. As author-
ized under section 614 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, the
FAA shall establish a pilot program for mobile clearances for gen-
39
eral aviation and part 135 air carriers at five airports or heliports
which do not have towered data link services to test and set secu-
rity, safety, and operational requirements and expects the FAA to
report its progress on this program to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this act.
Epinephrine Autoinjectors on Airplanes.—Consistent with section
368 in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, the FAA should take
such action as necessary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding first aid and emergency medical kit equipment and train-
ing required for flight crewmembers. The FAA should take into
consideration the feasibility and costs associated with requiring
adult and child epinephrine autoinjectors on airplanes. As part of
its work on the rulemaking, the FAA should take into consideration
the feasibility of requiring passenger airlines to systematically re-
port to the FAA about the type and number of incidences of med-
ical emergencies in the air and the use of onboard emergency med-
ical kits, as well as how the FAA should maintain a database of
this information.
New York City Helicopter Noise Report.—The New York metro-
politan area has one of the highest rates of helicopter use in the
world, and helicopter-related noise complaints have gone up dra-
matically in the last 5 years. Not later than 180 days after the date
of enactment of this act, the Government Accountability Office
[GAO] shall initiate a study regarding the impact of helicopter op-
erations over New York City including, but not limited to: (1) the
impact of helicopter noise on human health, businesses, and non-
profit organizations; (2) common flight paths; (3) trends in heli-
copter usage; (4) types of helicopter operations occurring over New
York City; and (5) efforts by the State of New York and local gov-
ernment authorities to mitigate the impact of helicopter noise.
Flight Diversions.—The Committee directs the Secretary to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on: (1)
the number of flight diversions by regularly scheduled passenger
airlines in the most recent year for which the FAA has such data
compared to the previous three calendar years; (2) the location to
which such flights were diverted; (3) the reason for such diversions;
and (4) the airlines’ obligations under current laws and regulations
to support its passengers during a flight diversion.
Airspace Modernization Roadmap Work.—The FAA can achieve
significant efficiencies in air traffic by modernizing outdated design
and procedures. For example, modernization of the 30-year old Ha-
waii airspace design would lead to faster interisland flights, fewer
flight delays and cancellations, and more reliable air service. The
Committee directs the FAA to complete the Hawaiian islands air-
space modernization project and to brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this
act on the status and timelines for completion of this project.
Human Intervention Motivation Study [HIMS] and Flight Attend-
ant Drug and Alcohol Program [FADAP].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes not less than $1,000,000 for HIMS and
FADAP, which are important for mitigating drug and alcohol abuse
through a peer identification and intervention program. The FAA
shall continue to prioritize these programs.
40
Bessie Coleman Women in Aviation Advisory Committee.—In rec-
ognition of the lack of recruitment and retention of women in key
aviation fields, the Committee directs the FAA to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the implemen-
tation of the Bessie Coleman Women in Aviation Advisory Com-
mittee, as authorized under section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization
Act of 2024, including the timeline for appointing board members
and holding board meetings.
High Speed Testing with Hypersonic Aircraft.—Consistent with
the requirements of section 1009 of the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2024, the Committee directs the FAA, in consultation with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to establish a
high-speed testing corridors for development and airworthiness
testing and demonstration flights for manufacturers and operators
of high-speed aircraft within 1 year of enactment of this act.
Crew Complements.—The presence of a minimum of two well
trained, qualified pilots in commercial aircraft is another example
of safety through redundancy. Funding made available in this act
shall not support reductions in flight deck crew in commercial oper-
ations as provided under 14 CFR Part 121. This direction is not in-
tended to limit the FAA’s research and development activities re-
lated to unmanned aerial vehicles.
Office of Spectrum Engineering.—The Committee recommenda-
tion includes $14,000,000 for the Office of Spectrum Engineering,
which provides funding for five additional staff. The Committee is
aware that pending legislation could significantly increase the
number of covered facilities or assets where DoD could deploy
counter-UAS systems. As such, the FAA should increase staffing in
this office in order to be able to expeditiously provide the required
consultation prior to DoD’s deployment of counter-UAS systems.
Illegal Charter Enforcement.—The Committee remains concerned
about uncertified air charters—also referred to as illegal charters—
conducting commercial flights in violation of 14 CFR parts 119 and

Section 22:
135. The Committee strongly encourages the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration to continue to pursue enforcement action against ille-
gal charters, consult with the Department of Justice as appropriate
in such cases, and to maintain a single public-facing portal for re-
porting suspected illegal-charter activity, so that rogue operators
can be identified and removed without hindering legal, compliant
Part 135 air carriers.
Coordination.—The Committee notes that the FAA and the Coast
Guard have been in discussion regarding the regulation of Wing-
in-ground-effect craft. The FAA shall continue to coordinate with
its Coast Guard counterparts to develop and execute a memo-
randum of understanding governing the specific roles, authorities,
delineations of responsibilities, resources, and commitments of the
FAA and the Coast Guard, respectively, pertaining to wing-in-
ground-effect craft. The FAA shall brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on its progress within 90 days of the
enactment of this act.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The facilities and equipment appropriation provides funding for
modernizing and improving air traffic control and airway facilities,
equipment, and systems. The appropriation also finances major
capital investments required by other agency programs, experi-
mental research and development facilities, and other improve-
ments to enhance the safety and capacity of the NAS. The program
aims to keep pace with the increasing demands of aeronautical ac-
tivity and remain in accordance with the FAA comprehensive 5-
year capital investment plan.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,000,000,000
for the facilities and equipment account of the FAA. The rec-
ommended level is $823,750,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. The Committee expects the FAA to make sound invest-
ment decisions and report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on any major cost overruns or delays. The Com-
mittee continues to direct the FAA to notify the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 3 business days of the joint
resources council making any final investment decisions, estab-
lishing a baseline for previously approved projects, or making ac-
quisition program baseline changes that alter program perform-
ance, cost or schedule baseline.

UAS.—The Committee recommendation includes $16,000,000 for
this program to enable the FAA to complete the development and
44
standardization of the airborne collision avoidance system [ACAS]
program, to support UAS, small UAS, and rotorcraft operations.
The ACAS program may provide a safety-enhancing replacement
for the existing traffic alert and collision avoidance system [TCAS
II] to support NextGen operations.
Airport Non-Cooperative Surveillance Radar [ANSR] Program.—
The Committee directs the FAA to report on the status of the
ANSR program, including long-term funding needs for the pro-
gram; a cost-benefit analysis of the most effective solutions to pro-
vide ongoing ANSR services, including a comparison of a
sustainment approach versus a replacement approach; an analysis
of how the FAA intends to provide commercial service airports with
necessary equipment; an update on the radar divestiture program;
and the projected lifecycle support needs of the existing inventory
of non-cooperative airport surveillance radar models 8, 9, and 11.
Offshore Automation.—The Committee recommendation includes
$48,300,000 for offshore automation. The FAA should keep the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations up to date on this
critical project and ensure that the project incorporate the needs of
the FAA service operations centers, including equipage, cabinetry
and consoles, and improved floor-space design.
Commercial Space Integration.—The Committee recommendation
includes $1,000,000 for commercial space integration activities.
This includes funding to operationalize the space operations portal
and for the investment analysis in preparation for the final invest-
ment decision for a program to enable space data to be displayed
on existing automation systems. The FAA should continue its work
on the development, acquisition, and deployment of technologies
and capabilities, including automation where appropriate, to aid in
space launch and reentry integration into the NAS and to enable
near real-time dynamic rerouting of commercial aircraft during and
following commercial space launch and reentry operations. The
FAA is directed to brief the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations no later than 180 days after the enactment of this act
on its efforts, including potential challenges it may face, to inte-
grate space launch and reentry tracking data into air traffic con-
troller displays.
Remote Towers.—The Committee is aware of the growing need
from small and rural communities to improve safety and modernize
the air traffic control capabilities of their airports in a timely man-
ner. The Committee supports the FAA’s work on remote towers as
a potential solution to address this need. The Committee provides
no less than $3,000,000 for the remote towers program. The Com-
mittee directs the FAA to provide a briefing to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations no later than 30 days after en-
actment of this act on the status of the system design approval and
timeframe for approval.
Future Flight Services Program.—The Committee remains sup-
portive of the Department’s efforts to offer enhanced capabilities to,
as well as improve the safety of, general aviation pilots in Alaska.
The current legacy automation service reached end-of-life in 2024
and is no longer cost-efficient to sustain. Following completion of
its plan and investment analysis, the FAA shall make a final in-
45
vestment decision to replace this legacy automation service within
1 year of enactment of this act.
Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative.—The Committee
recommendation includes $25,000,000 to implement the Don Young
Alaska aviation safety initiative [DYAASI], which includes
$20,000,000 from this budget line item [BLI], $3,500,000 from the
ADS–B NAS-wide implementation BLI, and $1,500,000 from the
weather camera program BLI. The Committee notes the persistent
lack of certified weather reporting capability in the FAA Alaska re-
gion and directs the FAA to provide the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations with a plan for the visual weather observa-
tion program within 90 days of enactment of this act.
Terminal Flight Data Manager [TFDM].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $47,300,000 and directs the FAA to report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the fea-
sibility, challenges, and benefits of expanding the number of air-
ports on the TFDM waterfall, consistent with section 619(e) of the
FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.
FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure.—The Committee appre-
ciates the FAA’s efforts to address recent challenges with tele-
communications systems in the New York City area airports to pre-
vent any future outages of critical data for air traffic controllers.
The Committee directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate
Committee on Appropriations on the status of all FAA tele-
communications infrastructure and the FAA’s efforts to accelerate
the transition from time division multiplexing to modern internet
protocol-based communications within 120 days of enactment of
this act.
Terminal and En Route Surveillance Portfolio.—The DoD and the
FAA operate networks of airport surveillance radar that monitor
the airspace for cooperative and non-cooperative aircraft and
weather conditions for commercial flights. The FAA should con-
tinue its efforts to upgrade these radars to extend their life and
avoid costly replacements.
Landing and Lighting Portfolio.—The Committee is aware that
many aging instrument landing systems [ILS] were installed in the
1970’s and 1980’s and their age presents a significant threat to
maintaining NAS capacity and safety. The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for ILS within this heading.
Light Emitting Diode [LED] Medium Intensity Approach Lighting
System [MALSR] Lamps.—The Committee appreciates the FAA’s
focus on expediting the transition to LED lamps for MALSR with
runway alignment indicator lights installations which will provide
significant benefits in safety, reliability, and cost savings. The
Committee directs the FAA to prioritize the acquisition and instal-
lation of commercial off-the-shelf LED lamps that have already
been FAA-approved for MALSR LED transitions by the spectrum
engineering services group at the MMAC and successfully installed
at more than 20 airports across the United States.
Military Operations Areas.—The Committee finds that radar and
future NextGen systems capable of controlling airspace down to
500 feet above ground level enhances aviation safety in military op-
erations areas that overlay public use airports. The Committee rec-
ommends that the FAA utilize existing resources to promptly pro-
46
vide radar or NextGen capability in areas with more than 5,000 op-
erations per year.
Spectrum Coordination.—The Committee directs the FAA to co-
ordinate with the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] on
the impact of spectrum utilization on aviation safety and aircraft
operations. Specifically, the FAA is directed to establish, with the
FCC, a permanent interagency working group to consult on poten-
tial spectrum impacts on aviation safety systems, including radio
altimeters and other critical avionics. Any FAA-identified risks to
aviation safety resulting from changes in spectrum use shall be
communicated to the FCC and be addressed expeditiously. The
FAA shall provide a report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this act detail-
ing the coordination process with the FCC, including any findings
or recommendations resulting from their joint assessment of spec-
trum-related aviation safety concerns.
Facility Replacement and Radar Modernization.—The FAA cur-
rently owns 370 facilities and 618 radars, most of which are dec-
ades old and well beyond their useful life, requiring expensive re-
pairs and short-term fixes to avoid gaps in air traffic services. As
the FAA continues to replace aging air traffic control towers, the
Committee directs the FAA to be mindful of the consideration of
aging towers referenced in section 608 of the FAA Reauthorization
Act of 2024 in the development of this proposal and in the facilities
and equipment spend plans.
Federal Aviation Administration—Department of Defense
Deconfliction Coordination.—The Committee supports FAA’s joint
efforts with DoD to ensure coordination and management of com-
mercial and military flight operations, including in special use air-
space, with an emphasis on deconfliction. As the FAA moves to
modernize our Nation’s air traffic control systems, the Committee
encourages the deployment and testing of software capabilities that
provide real-time, dynamic status-sharing and management to opti-
mize the use of the National airspace system for all stakeholders,
including for use with FAA Contract Towers. In doing so, the Com-
mittee encourages the FAA to utilize off-the-shelf capabilities to ex-
pedite the deployment of new technologies. The Committee further
directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations within 120 days of enactment of this act on its coordi-
nation with DoD for such real-time dynamic scheduling.
Airborne Situational Awareness Technology.—The Committee is
aware that many FAA contract towers operate without radar dis-
play capabilities, which may limit air traffic controller’s situation
awareness. The Committee further understands that the FAA is in
the process of reviewing the use of Airborne Position Reference
Tools [APRT] to supplement non-FAA operated control towers vis-
ual operations and radio communications with pilots. The Com-
mittee encourages the FAA to expeditiously conduct the review of
these technologies to enhance aviation safety at contract tower air-
ports and further encourages the FAA, through its ongoing review
of the AIP handbook, to consider allowing non-Federal entities to
acquire these technologies using both discretionary and entitlement
grant funding.

Advanced Materials/Structural Safety.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes a total of $4,500,000 for advanced materials/
structural safety, and an additional $11,500,000 shall be for ad-
vanced materials/structural safety work at the center of excellence
[COE] for joint advanced materials and structures [JAMS]. Of the
amounts provided in both BLIs, the Committee recommendation
provides $6,000,000 to advance the use of these new additive mate-
rials (both metallic and non-metallic based additive processes) in
the commercial aviation industry and for the FAA to work with the
advanced composites institute and private partners to evaluate
resin-infused materials and processes for airworthiness certification
and $4,000,000 to advance the use of fiber reinforced composite ma-
terials in the commercial aviation industry through JAMS.
The Committee recognizes the importance of advanced manufac-
turing for aerospace. The FAA should conduct research, in partner-
ship with the commercial sector, to address gaps in knowledge for
the use of large-scale metal wire arc additive manufacturing in
aerospace, including to manufacture aerospace products such as
aircraft and other aerospace vehicles. The focus of the research
should be: (1) process development for the creation of additive man-
ufacturing design and manufacturing standards for aerospace vehi-
cles; (2) improving certification efficiency of additively manufac-
tured aviation products; (3) evaluating long-term material and
structural behavior and associated maintenance, including support
for fatigue life determination, structural changes related to fatigue,
thermal, corrosive environments, and expected maintenance of such
material to include recommended repair techniques; and (4) uti-
lizing commercial partners to mature and certify large-scale metal
wire arc additive manufacturing and advanced materials capabili-
ties, including the development and qualification of new material
chemistries, optimized for large-scale metal wire arc additive man-
ufacturing, to be used in the manufacture of aerospace vehicles.
UAS Research.—The Committee recommendation includes
$7,500,000 for UAS research and an additional $14,000,000 for the
UAS COE. Of the amounts for the UAS COE, $2,000,000 is for
transportation disaster preparedness and response, in partnership
with institutions that have demonstrated experience in damage as-
sessment, collaboration with State transportation agencies, and ap-
plied UAS field testing; and $2,000,000 is to continue efforts with
the safety standards of UAS for development and validation of cer-
tification standards for such systems. The UAS COE research may
include cyber security, agricultural applications, and BVLOS.
Environment and Energy.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $12,500,000 for environment and energy, and an additional
$8,500,000 for environment and energy for the aviation sustain-
ability center [ASCENT] COE for research focused on sustainable
aviation fuels [SAFs].
NextGen-Environmental Research-Aircraft Technologies and
Fuels.—The Committee recommendation includes $5,000,000 for
NextGen Environmental Research-Aircraft Technologies and Fuels,
an additional $27,000,000 for the ASCENT COE on SAFs and avia-
tion noise, and an additional $40,000,000 for the continuous lower
energy, emissions, and noise [CLEEN] program. The Committee
continues to direct the FAA to prioritize research related to SAFs,
49
certification of SAFs, and challenges associated with the SAF sup-
ply chain. The Office of Environment and Energy and the Office of
Airports should work together to identify SAF-related projects at
airports that can be funded from airport improvement program
grants. The FAA should also support hydrogen and fuel-cell related
technologies that could reduce the noise and emissions footprint in
future aircraft.
Within the CLEEN program, the FAA may use any unused funds
to work with commercial supersonic aircraft manufacturers that
will help mature clean and quiet technologies for conventional non-
supersonic aircraft manufacturers.
Aviation Grant Management.—The Committee recommendation
includes $30,000,000 for the aviation workforce development pro-
grams as authorized by section 625 of the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2018, as amended by the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.
The Committee encourages the FAA, to prioritize applicants for
the aviation workforce development programs that provide an as-
surance to either use grant funds to: (1) encourage the participa-
tion of populations that are underrepresented in the aviation in-
dustry, including women, minorities, and individuals in economi-
cally disadvantaged communities and rural communities; or (2)
strengthen aviation programs at a minority-serving institution, a
public institution of higher education, or a public postsecondary vo-
cational institution, including such institutions in rural commu-
nities.
Aircraft Accessibility Research.—Persons with reduced mobility
have been disproportionately impacted by challenges associated
with air travel due to limited cabin space and relevant accommo-
dating technologies. The Department continues to receive numer-
ous consumer complaints related to commonly mishandled and/or
damaged equipment in aircraft cargo handling. The Committee
supports the FAA and the aviation industry’s efforts to develop,
test, and certify aviation accessibility technologies, including solu-
tions for passengers to travel onboard aircraft using power wheel-
chairs in cabins, accessible lavatories and other boarding and cabin
technologies that would enable greater mobility and ease of travel.
PFAS–Free Aviation Fire Suppression Technologies.—The Com-
mittee encourages the FAA to conduct research and development
activities, including partnerships with the DoD and U.S. industry,
to identify, develop, and test technologies that will provide an alter-
native to fire protection systems with hydrofluorocarbons and halon
technologies that are critical to the safety of flight systems in use
across civil, commercial and military aircraft today.
Electric Aircraft.—The FAA should identify and prioritize tech-
nical assistance, research, workforce development, and funding op-
portunities to support aircraft operators transitioning to electric
aircraft. The FAA should also coordinate with outside stakeholders
to identify opportunities to advance electrification of current and
future aircraft.
Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing [eVTOL] Aircraft.—The
Committee directs the FAA to conduct research, development, and
testing of eVTOL vehicles and AAM systems to ensure that these
emerging technologies are integrated into the NAS in a safe man-
ner. The Committee encourages the FAA to collaborate with inde-
50
pendent testing and research facilities to help improve the safe cer-
tification and deployment of eVTOL vehicles and other AAM sys-
tems. The FAA should encourage collaboration with independent
testing centers and private-sector partners to: conduct comprehen-
sive testing of eVTOL vehicles for safety, reliability, airworthiness,
and operational performance; assess the integration of eVTOL vehi-
cles into urban and rural airspace in coordination with local trans-
portation agencies, air traffic controllers, and airport authorities;
develop and test safety protocols, air traffic management systems,
and cyber security measures specific to eVTOL vehicles and AAM
networks; and create a framework for certification and regulatory
approval of eVTOL vehicles and related infrastructure to support
commercial deployment.
GRANTS-IN-AID FOR AIRPORTS
(LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
(AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Funding for grants-in-aid for airports pays for capital improve-
ments at the Nation’s airports, including those investments that
emphasize capacity development, safety improvements, and secu-
rity needs. Other priority areas for funding under this program in-
clude improvements to runway safety areas that do not conform to
FAA standards, investments that are designed to reduce runway
incursions, and aircraft noise compatibility planning and programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations and a liq-
uidating cash appropriation of $4,000,000,000 for grants-in-aid for
airports for fiscal year 2026. This is equal to the enacted level for
fiscal year 2025.
Administrative Expenses.—The Committee recommends not more
than $160,000,000 to cover administrative expenses. This funding
level is $3,768,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. In-
creased staffing should be used to support the FAA’s work to help
airports develop plans to mitigate the impact of climate change on
airport infrastructure.
Airport Cooperative Research.—The Committee recommends not
less than $15,000,000 for the airport cooperative research program.
This funding level is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Airport Technology.—The Committee recommends not less than
$41,827,000 for airport technology research. This funding level is
$26,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of this
amount, $6,000,000 is for the airfield pavement technology pro-
gram authorized under section 744 of Public Law 115–254, of
which $3,000,000 is for concrete pavement research and $3,000,000
is for asphalt pavement research.
51
Small Community Air Service Development Program.—The Com-
mittee recommends $15,000,000. This funding level is $5,000,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Cost Share.—The bill includes a provision that allows small air-
ports to continue contributing 5 percent of the total cost for unfin-
ished phased projects that were underway prior to the passage of
the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–
095).
Zero-Emission Vehicle [ZEV] and Voluntary Airport Low Emis-
sions [VALE] Programs.—The Committee directs the FAA to pro-
vide not less than $50,000,000 for ZEV and VALE eligible projects.
The Committee expects the FAA to actively engage with airport
sponsors at major hubs to identify projects suitable for the VALE
program, such as energy efficiency, energy resiliency, and renew-
able energy projects that would help prevent power disruptions or
outages.
Sound Insulation.—The Committee is aware that certain sound
insulation projects installed prior to 2002 caused physical damage
to the residence or the materials used for such insulation have de-
teriorated, broken, or are otherwise no longer functional. As such,
the Committee directs the FAA to consider residences that were
mitigated prior to 2002 with sound insulation as ‘‘unmitigated’’,
and any new sound insulation shall be considered a one-time miti-
gation, subject to current requirements for determining eligibility
for sound insulation, if an airport can verify that: (1) the residences
continue to fall within the latest day-night average sound level
[DNL] 65 decibel [dB] contour; (2) the residential structure is expe-
riencing an average interior noise level of DNL 45 dB or higher;
(3) any previously installed sound insulation for which prior Fed-
eral financial assistance or passenger facility charges resulted in
structural deterioration that was not caused by any actions attrib-
uted to the owner or occupant of the residence, nor by the failure
of a property owner to repair or maintain a residential building;
and (4) the applicant and the property owner demonstrate having
made good faith effort to exhaust any amounts available through
warranties, insurance coverage, and legal remedies for the sound
insulation treatment previously installed on the eligible residence.
The FAA has previously determined other sound insulation treat-
ments to be considered as ‘‘unmitigated’’ and should provide the
same flexibility to these treatments. The FAA should also continue
to require applicants and property owners to conform to currently
published FAA standards that would achieve a measurable reduc-
tion in interior noise levels.
Airport Growth.—Airport modernization and growth projects rely
on a combination of Federal, State, and local funds, as well as air-
line funds, in some instances. For airports experiencing growth in
traffic, this requires long-term cooperation and partnerships be-
tween these government and private sector entities. The Secretary
and the FAA should help coordinate these partnerships between
airports and airlines, to the extent permissible under current law,
to ensure funding commitments are met and that they adequately
capitalize on prior or ongoing Federal investments at the airport.
Long-Term Trends in Aviation.—Certain long-term trends in so-
ciety, such as extreme weather, electrification, automation, and de-
52
mographic changes of the workforce, may have significant impacts
on airports and their funding needs. The Committee directs the
GAO to conduct a study on these and other major trends that could
impact airports and their funding needs over the long-term, and
how the U.S. commercial aviation industry and the FAA can adapt
to them.
Boarding Bridges.—The Committee supports section 711 of the
FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, that prohibits Federal funding
from going towards the procurement of passenger boarding bridges
from Chinese State-owned, controlled, or subsidized companies that
seek to threaten the United States’ economy and national security.
Reimbursable Agreements.—The Committee is aware of chal-
lenges facing the administration of the State block grant program
for certain airports, and the reimbursable agreement [RA] associ-
ated with them. The RA process can be burdensome and costly for
some States and their airports. The Committee directs the FAA to
work with stakeholders who participate in a block grant program,
and all relevant FAA offices, to modify the current process in order
to reduce any additional costs and delays being imposed on States
and airports. Specifically, the FAA must work with stakeholders to
identify and address the root cause of these challenges, which may
include: (1) disclosing the upfront cost for each item required to
perform their duties on a project; (2) providing a commitment on
when work will be completed; and (3) once the duties are com-
pleted, requiring the FAA to provide a line-item receipt of their
costs and reimbursing the paying entity for any costs that are less
than what was pre-paid within 120 days.

[FHWA] is, in partnership with State and local governments, to
foster the development of a safe, efficient, and effective highway
and intermodal system nationwide.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
Under the Committee recommendations, a total program level of
$63,932,530,821 is provided for the activities of the FHWA in fiscal
year 2026. The recommendation is $1,538,860,276 more than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $61,314,170,545
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 62,657,105,821
55
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal-aid highway program provides financial support to
States and localities for the development, construction, and repair
of highways and bridges through grants. This program is financed
from the Highway Trust Fund, and most of the funds are distrib-
uted through apportionments and allocations to States. Title 23 of
the United States Code and other supporting legislation provide
authority for the various activities of the FHWA. Funding is pro-
vided by contract authority, with program levels established by an-
nual limitations on obligations set forth in appropriations acts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends limiting fiscal year 2026 obligations
for the Federal-aid highway program to $62,657,105,821, which is
$1,342,935,276 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Staffing.—The Committee is aware of the significant reduction in
the agency’s workforce, resulting in part from employees choosing
to take the DRP offer. The Committee also understands that some
division offices have lost up to 50 percent of their staff. The Com-
mittee is concerned about the impact of these dramatic staffing re-
ductions on the Department’s ability to build our Nation’s high-
ways, bridges, and other infrastructure projects. As such, the Com-
mittee directs the FHWA to provide a report on the number of posi-
tions lost through the DRP within each office included in the con-
gressional budget justification as well as each State division office.
The report shall include an analysis of the impact of these staffing
reductions on the agency’s ability to implement the Federal-aid
highway program and all other statutory responsibilities.
Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure.—When the FHWA
stopped all further obligations from the National Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure [NEVI] formula program, it also rescinded the pro-
gram guidance from June 11, 2024. At the same time, the FHWA
committed to ‘‘have updated draft NEVI Formula Guidance pub-
lished for public comment in the spring of 2025.’’ As of July 2025,
no such guidance has been published for public comment. The
Committee directs the Secretary to issue new guidance for the
NEVI formula program. The Secretary may also consider releasing
funding under the previous guidance while the FHWA works to up-
date the guidance. The Committee also encourages the FHWA to
update guidance to adopt technology-neutral charger deployment
requirements.
Bridge Investment Program.—The demand for Bridge Investment
Program funding has demonstrated the need for a dedicated fund-
ing source for improving the condition of large and important
bridges across the country. The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to implement this program to rebuild bridges in significant
states of disrepair.
Reducing Wildlife-Vehicle Collisions.—The Committee encour-
ages the FHWA to work with States to reduce wildlife-vehicle colli-
sions through quick implementation of the wildlife crossings pilot
program and through the highway safety improvement program
and eligibilities under 23 U.S.C. 148(a)(4)(B)(xvii). The Committee
56
directs the FHWA to provide technical assistance related to the im-
plementation of 23 U.S.C. 148(a)(4)(B)(xvii), as needed.
Asphalt Research.—The Committee directs the FHWA to evalu-
ate research initiatives eligible under the FHWA’s highway re-
search and development program focusing on the properties of puri-
fied bituminous coal waste as a source of high quality carbon to be
used as an additive for asphalt road building, and provide a report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of enactment of this act outlining the FHWA’s action plan to
evaluate such research. The Committee also encourages the FHWA
to use public-private partnerships to advance its research on the
use of purified carbon-rich materials as environmentally beneficial
additives for road building material.
Safety.—The Committee remains concerned by the staggering
number of pedestrian fatalities each year involving vehicles, and is
aware that an increasing number of municipalities are developing
plans to significantly reduce these incidents. The Committee di-
rects the FHWA to continue developing resources and providing
technical assistance to help State and local governments facilitate
the implementation of their vision zero plans and strategies to re-
duce pedestrian fatalities and injuries consistent with the direc-
tives in House Report 117–402 and Senate Report 118–70. Pro-
grams such as the safe streets and roads for all grant program sup-
port projects that improve road safety for pedestrians, bicyclists,
and other vulnerable road users, and the Secretary should imple-
ment this program. The FHWA should also use existing funds to
fund the bollard installation pilot program, as authorized under

Section 41:
section 11502 of the IIJA.
Truck Parking.—The Committee is aware of the lack of safe
truck parking on our Nation’s highways, which creates a hazard for
truck drivers, reduces safety for all road users, and hinders recruit-
ment. The Committee commends the Department for identifying
existing sources of funding in the IIJA that States can use to ad-
dress the nationwide truck parking shortage and for working with
private sector stakeholders, State DOTs, and metropolitan plan-
ning organizations to fund requests for discretionary grant funding
to increase the availability of safe truck parking. The Committee
directs the Department to continue these efforts and to continue to
use existing discretionary grant programs to fund truck parking
projects, where eligible and appropriate.
Permeable Pavements.—The Committee continues to encourage
the Secretary to accelerate deployment of permeable pavements, in-
cluding permeable pavers, to achieve flood mitigation, pollutant re-
duction, stormwater runoff reduction, and resilience in new road
construction and retrofitting existing roads and other facilities. The
Secretary is also encouraged to support the use of permeable pave-
ments and permeable pavers in Federal lands highway projects.
Roadside Safety.—The Committee is concerned with the signifi-
cant number of fatalities caused by high-speed roadway departure
crashes and notes that guardrail end terminals remain a critical
safeguard for reducing such incidents. The current testing standard
for guardrail end terminals in the manual for assessing safety
hardware [MASH], under which the FHWA requires devices to be
tested in order to be Federal-aid eligible, utilizes a maximum speed

of 62 miles-per-hour and relies on research that was conducted
more than 40 years ago. According to the MASH, ‘‘after a system
has been proven to meet the recommended impact performance
guidelines, the evaluation should switch to an in-service evaluation
of the feature’s field performance. It is recommended that in-serv-
ice performance evaluations be conducted when new safety features
are placed in service,’’ and ‘‘experience has shown that as new de-
signs are developed, current test procedures may not properly
evaluate critical conditions for these designs.’’ Given the significant
changes to vehicle fleets, highway speed limits, other changes to
the operating environment, and the development of more advanced
devices, the Committee strongly encourages the FHWA to engage
with the American Association of State Highway and Transpor-
tation Officials to pursue updates to the testing standard that bet-
ter reflect current real-world conditions. The Committee directs the
FHWA to, within 180 days of enactment of this act, provide a re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the
design of a potential pilot program to help facilitate State-led in-
service performance evaluations of guardrail end terminals with
documented effectiveness beyond the scope of MASH compliance.
This report should include consideration of the number of partici-
pants, minimum funding amount needed for a successful pilot, and
any other program requirements necessary to ensure its effective-
ness.
National Culvert Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant
Program.—The Committee appreciates the Department clarifying
in its recent NOFO for the culvert aquatic organisms passage
[AOP] program that recipients and sub-recipients may request al-
ternative funding arrangements, as permissible under 2 CFR Part

Section 42:
200. However, the NOFO does not provide any details on what
these alternative funding arrangements are or what information
recipients are required to submit to be approved for them. The
Committee is aware that AOP applicants face challenges with a
grant program that provides funding on a reimbursable basis. The
Committee directs the Department to proactively provide informa-
tion on alternative funding arrangements, including what written
procedures and financial management systems applicants are re-
quired to maintain and demonstrate in order to meet the fund con-
trol and accountability requirements under 2 CFR Part 200. The
Committee also directs the Department to provide information with
regard to the authority it has to provide cash on a working capital
advance basis. The Department should provide information
through webinars, trainings, technical assistance, and any means
necessary to bring this information to the large number of potential
applicants for this grant program. The Department should use suc-
cessful examples of such arrangements from the first round of
awardees. The Department should make available to potential ap-
plicants, upon request, relevant staff with sufficient budgetary and
legal expertise in these alternative funding arrangements, and re-
spond to questions from potential applicants on these matters with-
in 15 days of such request. The Committee also urges the Depart-
ment to further clarify to potential applicants how grant recipients
can partner with implementation entities, such as non-profit orga-
58
nizations, through the use of a contract or other agreement, to de-
liver a project.
The most recent NOFO also requires applicants to identify de-
sign standards that will be used for fish passage improvements,
but does not specifically identify any such design standards. The
Committee expects the Department to work with the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], and other Federal
agencies, to develop a minimum design standard that includes min-
imum fish passage requirements, hydraulic design methodology
that incorporates the impact of climate change on hydrology, and
minimum project design life and sizing standards that are climate
resilient. The Department shall brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations on these efforts within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Further, the Committee directs the FHWA to make grant awards
for the fiscal year 2023 NOFO within 60 days of enactment of this
act, and to issue the fiscal year 2024 NOFO for this program not
later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
Salmon Mitigation.—The Committee provided $5,000,000 in fis-
cal year 2023 to establish a cooperative series of agreements with
universities, Federal agencies, the National Academy of Sciences,
transportation agencies, or nonprofit organizations to examine the
impacts of culverts, roads, and bridges on threatened or endan-
gered salmon populations. The Committee notes that the FHWA
has not published a solicitation for these funds. The Committee di-
rects the FHWA to publish a solicitation for these funds within 90
days of enactment of this act and award funds within 180 days of
enactment on this act.
Update and Expand 14th Amendment Highway Report.—Section
1927 of Public Law 109–59 required a report describing the steps
and estimated funding to designate and construct a route for the
14th Amendment Highway, which comprises much of the I–14
route. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide an update
to this report and to include a comprehensive feasibility analysis
of the I–14 corridor, with an emphasis on its potential to serve as
a bypass to Atlanta and other major cities; enhance connectivity to
key military installations, ports, energy production areas, and
other economic centers; utilize established modeling systems, in-
cluding the highway economic requirements system, travel demand
models, and regional economic development models; analyze envi-
ronmental and economic impacts, safety improvements, and na-
tional security benefits; and produce actionable recommendations
for inclusion in statewide and metropolitan plans and transpor-
tation improvement programs.
I–69 Corridor Development in West Tennessee.—The Committee
encourages the FHWA to continue working with the Tennessee De-
partment of Transportation and local stakeholders to advance the
completion of I–69 through Tennessee, a critical component of high
priority corridor 18. With I–69 now providing continuous interstate
connectivity from the Canadian border to the Kentucky state line,
completing segments seven through nine is essential to closing a
major gap in the national corridor. The Committee supports contin-
ued coordination and investment to complete this nationally signifi-
cant corridor.
59
U.S. 50 Blue Mesa Bridge.—The Committee is aware that the
U.S. 50 Blue Mesa Bridge in Colorado is in need a repair due to
a crack found in the steel and is currently shut down to all traffic.
The Committee encourages the Department to work with the state
to identify potential sources of funding for repairing this bridge.
Computer Vision in Roadway Maintenance.—The Department es-
tablishes minimum standards for traffic control devices that en-
hance safety and reliability throughout our Nation’s roadway infra-
structure. The Committee recognizes the safety and operational
benefits of computer vision, a specialized field of artificial intel-
ligence, in assisting infrastructure owners and operators to assess
roadway conditions and damage to roadway assets, such as missing
signage, pavement damage, and other infrastructure concerns,
without requiring human inspectors to enter dangerous or inacces-
sible areas. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes the critical im-
portance of maintaining pavement marking and retroreflectivity for
roadway safety. As such, the Committee believes it is important to
ensure that non-Federal stakeholders are informed of the eligibility
of computer vision technologies for inspecting roadways and traffic
control devices and directs the Department to provide sufficient no-
tice to relevant non-Federal stakeholders.
Emerging Vehicle Technology Safety.—The Committee is con-
cerned by the results of recent testing of the compatibility of road-
side safety hardware with electric vehicles. With an increasing
number of electric vehicles on the roadways and the emergence of
other technologies including hydrogen and autonomous vehicles,
the Committee believes that continued research and testing is es-
sential to ensure the safe integration of emerging vehicle tech-
nologies on our Nation’s roadways. Such efforts should prioritize
the testing of current, and development and testing of new, road-
side safety hardware. The FHWA is encouraged to collaborate with
State DOTs and institutions of higher education that have experi-
ence with and are currently conducting research and testing on
roadside safety hardware for emerging vehicle technologies, as well
as participants in transportation pooled fund studies examining
these issues.
Emergency Relief Manual.—The Committee remains dis-
appointed that the FHWA has yet to meet the statutory deadlines
for updating the Emergency Relief program manual (section 11519
of Public Law 117–58) and directs the FHWA to provide an update
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the sta-
tus of implementation on a quarterly basis instead of the current
monthly requirement.
Anti-Competitive Bidding.—The Department’s Office of Inspector
General has found nearly $1,200,000,000 in estimated higher costs
associated with undetected collusive bidding on Federal highway
projects in six randomly-selected eastern States over 8 years. These
cost increases represent a nearly 7 percent increase in project costs
due to anti-competitive bidding practices, primarily driven by com-
plementary bidding amongst bidding firms. If extrapolated to all
Federal-aid highways program funding, there could be over
$21,000,000,000 in highway funds lost to fraud, rather than spent
on highway construction. The Committee directs the FHWA to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, with-
60
in 180 days of enactment of this act, on steps taken to implement
the Inspector General’s recommendations to amend FHWA guid-
ance to recommend State DOTs: (1) conduct frequent, regular, sys-
tematic reviews of procurements made over multiple years using
specific statistics to identify anti-competitive bidding patterns; and
(2) to the extent practical, reduce reliance on historical data when
developing engineer’s estimates, instead moving to methods FHWA
has found to be more reliable, including cost-based estimation.
Stormwater Management.—The Committee is concerned with the
impact of emerging contaminants on the environment, such as the
compound N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine
[6PPD] and its transformant, 6PPD-quinone. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $8,000,000 for the FHWA to work with
State DOTs and other relevant State agencies to build or imple-
ment, operate, and maintain low-cost and rapidly deployable
stormwater management technologies and techniques to reduce the
impacts of 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone on salmon-bearing streams.
The results of this research shall be used by the FHWA to inform
its stormwater policies and guidance publications. This research
shall be conducted in coordination with Federal, State, and Tribal
agencies engaged in relevant research, along with academia. This
research shall be conducted in locations that: (1) have resident
salmonid populations that have documented acute toxicity effects to
the stormwater contaminant, 6PPD-quinone, and where harmful
stormwater contaminants may bioaccumulate in endangered south-
ern resident killer whales through their salmon prey; (2) provide a
variety of land uses for optimizing technologies to specific transpor-
tation scenarios; (3) are available for near-term installation; and (4)
provide opportunities for long-term monitoring.
In conducting this research, the FHWA is directed to collaborate
and consult with NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service
[NMFS] to ensure that NMFS will be able to directly corroborate
the findings and endorse treatment alternatives with proven effec-
tiveness. The intent of this collaboration shall be to ensure that de-
monstrably effective treatment alternatives identified through this
research can help expedite NMFS consultations to the extent that
stormwater quality is a consideration for determination.
Unobligated Balances.—The Committee directs the FHWA to
submit a list of all unobligated balances of contract authority and
budget authority as of September 30, 2025, to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations by January 1, 2026, and provide
an annual update with each year’s President’s budget request. The
list of unobligated balances shall include the account name, pro-
gram name, Treasury account symbol, amounts remaining avail-
able for obligation, date of most recent obligation, and any other in-
formation that will help the Committees determine the status of all
unobligated balances. For allocated program unobligated balances
that remain available for obligation, the FHWA shall determine
whether the funds are likely to be obligated in the near term. For
each formula program unobligated balances that remain available
for obligations, the FHWA shall provide a state-by-state distribu-
tion list.

LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION
HIGHWAY TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $62,053,170,545
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 63,396,105,821
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal-aid highway program is funded through contract au-
thority paid out of the Highway Trust Fund. Most forms of budget
authority provide the authority to enter into obligations and then
to liquidate those obligations. Put another way, it allows a Federal
agency to commit to spending money on specified activities and
then to actually spend that money. In contrast, contract authority
provides only the authority to enter into obligations, but not the
authority to liquidate those obligations. The authority to liquidate
obligations, to actually spend the money committed with contract
authority, must be provided separately. The authority to liquidate
obligations under the Federal-aid highway program is provided
under this heading. This liquidating authority allows the FHWA to
follow through on commitments already allowed under current law;
it does not provide the authority to enter into new commitments for
Federal spending.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a liquidating cash appropriation of
$63,396,105,821. The recommended level is $1,342,935,276 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This level of liquidating au-
thority is necessary to pay outstanding obligations from various
highway accounts pursuant to this and prior appropriations acts.
HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $340,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,136,425,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Committee provides funding for highway infrastructure pro-
grams [HIP] to improve highway safety and efficiency for all Amer-
icans through general fund investments in addition to levels au-
thorized in the IIJA (Public Law 117–58).
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $1,136,425,000 in fund-
ing from the general fund for highway infrastructure programs,
which is $795,925,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Of the total amount provided, $581,225,000 is for CDS, and the
Committee directs the FHWA to provide funding for the projects
listed in the table at the end of this report in the corresponding
amounts.
National Scenic Byways Program.—The Committee directs the
FHWA to not include any preference for projects based on the total
cost of the project when awarding grants under this program. The
Committee notes that the FHWA has yet to produce a comprehen-
62
sive map of the Nation’s scenic byways and encourages the FHWA
to prioritize producing such a map, which would be a useful re-
source for both transportation planners and the traveling public. Of
the funds provided for this program, up to $1,000,000 shall be for
FHWA technical assistance activities. For the purposes of this pro-
gram, technical assistance as authorized in 23 U.S.C. 162 may in-
clude the development and dissemination of resources for use by
States and Tribes such as a program website, updated maps, and
economic research.
Reconnecting Communities.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $62,200,000 for the Reconnecting Communities Pilot pro-
gram, which is in addition to the $100,000,000 provided for this
program in division J of the IIJA and $105,000,000 provided for
this program from the Highway Trust Fund. The Committee di-
rects the Department to provide technical assistance, including
webinar and other informational sessions, to help local government
applicants whose grant funding was recently rescinded work with
State DOTs and Federal agencies to identify other sources of fund-
ing to complete these projects.

FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s [FMCSA’s]
mission is to promote safe commercial motor vehicle and motor
coach operations, as well as reduce the number and severity of acci-
dents involving those vehicles. Agency resources and activities pre-
vent and mitigate commercial motor vehicle and motor coach acci-
dents through education, regulation, enforcement, stakeholder
training, technological innovation, and improved information sys-
tems. The FMCSA is also responsible for ensuring that all commer-
cial vehicles entering the United States along its southern and
63
northern borders comply with all Federal motor carrier safety and
hazardous materials regulations. To accomplish these activities, the
FMCSA works with Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies,
the motor carrier industry, highway safety organizations, and the
public.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total level of $926,600,000 for obli-
gations from the Highway Trust Fund, which is $17,650,000 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides necessary resources to support motor car-
rier safety program activities and to maintain the agency’s admin-
istrative infrastructure. This funding supports nationwide motor
carrier safety and consumer enforcement efforts, including Federal
safety enforcement activities at the United States-Mexico border in
order to ensure that Mexican carriers entering the United States
are in compliance with FMCSA regulations. Resources are also pro-
vided to fund motor carrier regulatory development and implemen-
tation, information management, research and technology, safety
education and outreach, and the 24-hour safety and consumer tele-
phone hotline.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of
$390,000,000 for the FMCSA’s operations and programs, which is
$7,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of the
64
total limitation on obligations, $14,073,000 is for research and tech-
nology and not less than $63,098,000 is for information technology
and information management [IM].
The Committee continues to direct the FMCSA to provide a
spending plan for the amounts provided for IT and IM and to up-
date the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on mod-
ernizing its legacy systems no less than every 6 months.
Predatory Towing.—The Committee is aware that 49 U.S.C.
14501(c)(1) makes the Federal Government the sole regulator of
tow truck operators when towing a vehicle with the prior consent
or authorization of its owner or operator; however, like the States,
the FMCSA does not have explicit statutory authority to regulate
towing fees, and Federal regulations have never been promulgated
to prohibit excessive fees in these circumstances. While the vast
majority of towing and storage firms are honest and well-inten-
tioned, some bad actors have been allowed to operate in a regu-
latory gap without oversight or accountability. Predatory towing
can lead to supply chain disruptions when motor carriers are held
hostage to unethical practices in towing and recovery. The Com-
mittee directs the FMCSA to engage with local, State, and private
sector stakeholders to study current practices concerning towing
and recovery regulation and fees in order to ensure fair and equi-
table treatment of roadway safety clearance opportunities for motor
carriers.
Alternative Warning Devices for AV Trucks.—The deployment
and operation of autonomous trucks are currently inhibited by
roadway safety warning device regulations that require human de-
ployment in the event of a motor vehicle being disabled. The Com-
mittee directs the FMCSA to review existing research and informa-
tion on the safety impacts of alternative safety warning device sys-
tems or signs that can be placed on the roadway, on or around a
stopped commercial motor vehicle [CMV] without human deploy-
ment while maintaining an equivalent or greater level of safety and
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
its findings not later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
English Language Proficiency Enforcement.—The Committee
notes that 49 CFR 391.11(b)(2) requires that CMV drivers ‘‘can
read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse with
the general public, to understand highway traffic signs and signals
in the English language, to respond to official inquiries, and to
make entries on reports and records’’. On May 20, 2025, the
FMCSA issued an internal agency enforcement policy (MC–SEE–
2025–0001) reinforcing established safety regulations in accordance
with 49 CFR 391.11(b)(2), and the commercial vehicle safety alli-
ance’s North American standard out-of-service criteria was amend-
ed to make non-compliance with such section a driver out-of-serve
violation effective June 25, 2025. Section 132 of this act requires
the Secretary to update the Department’s regulations to ensure
that non-compliance with 49 CFR 391.11(b)(2) triggers an out-of-
service order. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
non-compliance and out-of-service orders pursuant to 49 CFR

Section 52:
391.11(b)(2) pre- and post-May 2025 not later than 180 days after
enactment of this act.
65
Entry-Level Driver Training [ELDT].—The ELDT regulations, es-
tablished by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century
Act, improve highway safety by setting minimum Federal training
requirements for new commercial driver’s license [CDL] applicants.
FMCSA’s training provider registry [TPR] serves as a public re-
source for future drivers to identify training providers and records
of drivers that have completed entry-level driver training. To im-
prove the utility of this public resource, the Committee directs the
FMCSA to clarify its TPR guidance for timely removal of training
providers that do not meet ELDT requirements not later than 180
days after enactment of this act. In addition, the bill requires the
Secretary to provide certain information relating to training pro-
viders on the TPR to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 90 days after enactment of this act and a
plan on how the FMCSA will conduct regular audits of the TPR not
later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
Staffing.—With the significant reduction in staffing levels in fis-
cal year 2025 as a result of employees electing to take the DRP,
the Committee is concerned about the impact of these staffing re-
ductions on the Department’s ability to fulfill the FMCSA’s mission
to ‘‘reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks
and buses’’. As such, the Committee directs the FMCSA to provide
a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
the number and job series of positions lost through the DRP within
each office included in the congressional budget justification as well
as each field office, service center, and State-level motor carrier di-
vision office. The report shall include an analysis of the impact of
these staffing reductions on the agency’s ability to implement
motor carrier safety and enforcement programs and all other statu-
tory responsibilities.
Enforcement Training and Support Grant Program.—The com-
mercial motor vehicle enforcement training and support grant pro-
gram was established in the IIJA to train non-Federal employees
who conduct CMV enforcement activities and to develop related
training materials. The NOFOs for this program have required
grantees to use non-Federal instructors who have successfully com-
pleted the FMCSA instructor development program [IDP] and
maintain all FMCSA-required instructor certifications. Such in-
structors may receive training through the FMCSA’s Federal law
enforcement training course accreditation that is different than the
training such instructors deliver through the grant program. To
better align the training received by non-Federal instructors and
provided to non-Federal employees under the grant program, the
Committee directs FMCSA to notify grantees of any updates to the
IDP and Federal law enforcement training course accreditation.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides resources for Federal grants to support
compliance, enforcement, and other programs performed by States.
Grants are also provided to States for enforcement efforts at both
the Southern and Northern borders in order to fortify points of
entry into the United States with comprehensive safety measures;
improve State CDL oversight activities to prevent unqualified driv-
ers from being issued CDLs; and support the performance registra-
tion information systems and management program, which links
State motor vehicle registration systems with carrier safety data in
order to identify unsafe commercial motor carriers.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations and au-
thority to liquidate an equal amount of contract authorization of
$536,600,000 for motor carrier safety grants, which is $10,150,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA]
was established as a separate organizational entity within the De-
partment of Transportation in March 1970 in order to administer
motor vehicle and highway safety programs. It is the successor
agency to the National Highway Safety Bureau, which was housed
within the FHWA. NHTSA is responsible for administering motor
vehicle safety, highway safety behavior, motor vehicle information,
and automobile fuel economy programs.
NHTSA’s mission is to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic
losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. To accomplish these
goals, NHTSA establishes and enforces safety performance stand-
ards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, investigates
safety defects in motor vehicles, and conducts research on driver
behavior and traffic safety. NHTSA provides grants and technical
assistance to State and local governments to enable them to con-
67
duct effective local highway safety programs. Together with State
and local partners, NHTSA works to reduce the threat of drunk,
impaired, and distracted driving, and to promote policies and de-
vices with demonstrated safety benefits, including helmets, child
safety seats, airbags, and graduated licenses. NHTSA establishes
and ensures compliance with fuel economy standards, investigates
odometer fraud, establishes and enforces vehicle anti-theft regula-
tions, and provides consumer information on a variety of motor ve-
hicle safety topics.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,124,255,000, including both
budget authority and limitations on the obligation of contract au-
thority. This funding is $135,590,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
These programs support traffic safety initiatives and related re-
search, demonstrations, technical assistance, and national leader-
ship for highway safety programs conducted by State and local gov-
ernments, the private sector, universities, research units, and var-
ious safety associations and organizations. These highway safety
programs emphasize alcohol and drug countermeasures, vehicle oc-
cupant protection, traffic law enforcement, emergency medical and
trauma care systems, traffic records and licensing, State and com-
munity traffic safety evaluations, protection of motorcycle riders,
pedestrian and bicyclist safety, pupil transportation, distracted
driving prevention, young and older driver safety, and improved ac-
cident investigation procedures.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee provides $419,600,000 for operations and re-
search, which is $8,800,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. Of the total amount recommended for Operations and Re-
search, $210,000,000 is from the general fund, and $209,600,000 is
from the Highway Trust Fund.
Rulemakings.—The Committee directs NHTSA to continue to
provide quarterly briefings on the status of all major rulemakings
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
Digital Alert Technology.—The Committee continues to support
use of digital alert technologies that can provide up-to-date infor-
mation about dynamic conditions on roads to drivers. NHTSA
should deploy this technology with local law enforcement in the
field.
Improving Recall Grant Outreach.—NHTSA’s ‘‘State Process for
Informing Consumers of Recalls’’ grant program is intended to re-
duce the number of vehicles that have not been repaired appro-
priately for a vehicle safety recall. This program has been shown
to be a cost-effective way to both improve safety and reduce the
burden on vehicle owners. The Committee directs NHTSA to exam-

ine ways to incentivize more States to apply for this grant pro-
gram.
Over-the-Air [OTA] Technology.—The Committee recognizes that
as vehicles become more automated and connected, the use of over-
the-air [OTA] software updates by manufacturers to improve vehi-
cle safety will be increasingly important and a core experience of
modern vehicle ownership. Section 24104 of the FAST Act allows
vehicle manufacturers to include notification of recalls by electronic
means in addition to notification by first class mail. The Committee
encourages NHTSA to modernize the recall process to better utilize
new technological opportunities presented by OTA software up-
dates.
Impaired Driving.—The Committee continues to support the
timely implementation of section 24220 of the IIJA, which requires
NHTSA to establish an impaired driving prevention technology
safety standard. Pursuant to the IIJA, NHTSA was required to pro-
mulgate a final rule by November 2024 or submit a report to Con-
gress explaining why the deadline could not be met. NHTSA sub-
mitted a report explaining that the agency is continuing to address
key issues in order to advance this critical rulemaking, including
alcohol-detection system readiness, test procedure development,
and countermeasure evaluation. NHTSA should continue to work
with auto manufacturers and equipment suppliers to identify any
improvements in technology that will help meet the intent of the
Congressional rulemaking requirement.
The Committee is also aware of the privacy concerns related to
this rulemaking mandate, and expects NHTSA to build privacy pro-
tections into this new standard that prevent inappropriate access
to and misuse of driver data. The success of the implementation of
any new standard will depend on public acceptance and under-
standing of the technology. Therefore, the Committee encourages
NHTSA to work with industry and other stakeholders, including
privacy experts and drunk driving victims and survivors, on coordi-
nating a public education program regarding the new safety stand-
ard.
The IIJA requires NHTSA to provide $45,000,000 from fiscal
year 2022 through 2025 for in-vehicle technology research efforts to
prevent alcohol-impaired driving. NHTSA may provide additional
resources for these efforts in fiscal year 2026 if necessary to com-
plete this research. However, NHTSA should use some of these
funds for consumer education programs designed to aid public ac-
ceptance of the technology when it becomes available in vehicles,
and should make the technology available to auto manufacturers
and suppliers by the end of this research in fiscal year 2026.
New Car Assessment Program [NCAP].—The final NCAP road-
map should adopt the most technologically advanced safety equip-
ment, including the most advanced anthropomorphic test dummies
and test procedures available in the global and domestic market-
place that can be used to physically validate the safety of occupants
within motor vehicles in an objective manner.
Drug-Impaired Driving.—The Committee remains concerned
about the rates of drug-impaired driving and supports NHTSA’s
drug-impaired driving initiative, research initiatives, and continued
education and training efforts with law enforcement and prosecu-
69
tors, such as drug recognition expert and advanced roadside im-
paired driving enforcement training. The Committee encourages
the collection of toxicology data in fatal accidents, and the develop-
ment of an objective standard to measure drug impairment and re-
lated field sobriety tests. Additionally, NHTSA is encouraged to
continue public awareness campaigns.
The Committee directs NHTSA to provide States with flexibility,
as permissible under current law, to use impaired driving counter-
measures grants for these purposes, and to issue clarifying guid-
ance on the eligible uses of highway safety program grants for
roadside drug testing devices.
Automated Vehicles [AVs].—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $13,900,000 for NHTSA’s Office of Automation Safety within
the Office of Rulemaking to support the safe deployment of AVs by
developing and setting safety standards, evaluating exemption peti-
tions, and overseeing safety demonstrations. The Committee is
aware that this office lost almost all of its staff due to recent staff-
ing actions and retirement offers such as the DRP, and highly en-
courages the Department to prioritize hiring in this office.
The Committee recommendation includes $3,500,000 for the pub-
lic-private partnership for analytics research in traffic safety
[PARTS] and its focus on real-world insights that can improve the
performance of advanced vehicle safety technologies. The Com-
mittee encourages NHTSA to include more leading-edge advanced
driver assistance systems and automated driving systems in the
program.
Tire Standards.—In 2017, in response to E.O. 13777, Enforcing
the Regulatory Reform Agenda, the Department of Transportation
issued a Federal Register notice requesting public comment on ex-
isting rules. Respondents identified tire-related regulations that
were outdated, ineffective, and unnecessary, prompting NHTSA to
issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking [ANPRM] in 2019
that sought public comment on provisions contained in the Federal
motor vehicle safety standards for tires. NHTSA has noted that
comments to the notice will inform the agency as it considers regu-
latory reform aimed at reducing the regulatory burden while main-
taining existing safety levels for motor vehicle tires. The Com-
mittee notes that NHTSA has not taken action to fulfill its direc-
tive under E.O. 13777 since the ANPRM was issued in 2019. The
Committee directs NHTSA, within 180 days of enactment of this
act, to finalize the rulemaking initiated in the ANPRM, which
would support the objectives of both E.O. 13777 and E.O. 14192,
Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation, issued in 2025.
In the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Congress
directed that a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information
program be established to educate consumers about the safety, du-
rability, and fuel efficiency of replacement tires. In the FAST Act,
Congress directed NHTSA to promulgate regulations for tire fuel
efficiency and minimum performance standards, which will be im-
portant for energy savings, dissemination of information to con-
sumers, ensuring U.S. consumers have access to the latest tire
technologies, and assuring an equal playing field for domestic tire
producers. The Committee is disappointed that NHTSA has not
completed this congressionally mandated rulemaking. In 2021, the
70
IIJA required the DOT to report to Congress on why it had not
completed these regulations. The report indicated that NHTSA was
still collecting and analyzing data, however the agency failed to
meet its own deadline to publish a proposed rule in 2024. The Com-
mittee is concerned that NHTSA is having to restart its research
program for this rulemaking in order to meet the requirements of
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act under 49 U.S.C.
30111, and directs NHTSA to provide a status update on this re-
search program. The Committee also directs NHTSA to issue a no-
tice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the timeline set
forth by the OMB’s unified agenda and regulatory plan and brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on a realistic
timeline to complete this much-delayed rulemaking.
Traffic Fatalities and Injuries on Tribal Land.—The Committee
is concerned that crash data on Tribal lands may be underreported
by NHTSA. In 2018, NHTSA issued a report showing that fatal
crashes on Native American reservations were underreported in
previous years, and proposed a new methodology to better identify
these fatal crashes using a special jurisdictional element in the fa-
tality analysis reporting system. However, it is unclear what im-
pact this new methodology has had in improving fatal crash data,
and if this new methodology has been used for non-fatal crash re-
ports in NHTSA’s crash reporting sampling system. The Committee
directs the GAO to conduct a study to assess Federal management
of crash data on Tribal lands. The study should consider: (1) the
data available on fatal and nonfatal crashes on Tribal lands, and
the extent to which American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal gov-
ernments have access to these data; (2) any actions the DOT and
the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] have taken to improve the qual-
ity and use of data about crashes on Tribal lands; (3) additional ac-
tions that the DOT, the BIA, or others could take to improve the
quality and availability of data about crashes on Tribal lands; and
(4) the extent to which the IIJA funding for the crash data program
as authorized under section 24108 of the IIJA has benefited Tribes.
The GAO should provide this report to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 1 year of the date of enactment
of this act.
Stroke Assessment Performance Measures.—Strokes are a leading
cause of death and long-term disability among adults in the United
States, but faster diagnosis and treatment greatly increase chances
of survival. The Committee applauds NHTSA and its Office of
Emergency Medical Services [EMS] for its work to develop and dis-
seminate information on assessment, treatment, and transport-des-
tination protocols within the national model EMS clinical guide-
lines as part of a comprehensive highway and traffic safety system.
The Committee encourages NHTSA to engage with the Centers for
Disease Control [CDC] and its Federal partners on the Federal
Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services [FICEMS]
to further the adoption of EMS performance measures developed by
the national EMS quality alliance, including the existing national
EMS performance measure for stroke. The Committee directs
NHTSA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions within 180 days of enactment of this act on progress made in
engaging the CDC and FICEMS. The Committee believes that
71
these efforts will improve the timeliness and quality of stroke care
nationwide and ultimately save lives.
Independent Review.—The Committee is extremely concerned by
the lack of progress in addressing roadway fatalities over the last
decade, despite significant increases in resources to NHTSA. The
Committee is particularly concerned with the delays in promul-
gating regulations and issuing reports, often mandated by Con-
gress. To address these concerns, the Committee directs NHTSA to
contract with the National Academy of Public Administration
[NAPA] within 60 days of enactment of this act to conduct a review
to determine how NHTSA can improve: (1) the timeliness of re-
sponses to Congressional directives and mandates, including
rulemakings; (2) its expertise in research and enforcement of regu-
lations; (3) its culture to be more focused on performance and out-
comes; and (4) its communications and coordination within the
agency, within the DOT, and with external stakeholders. The
[NAPA] shall submit a final report to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations no later than 1 year after the date of en-
actment of this act.
Motorcyclist Safety.—The IIJA requires the DOT to form a Mo-
torcyclist Advisory Council to advise the Secretary on improving
safety for motorcyclists, who face a disproportionate number of
roadway fatalities and injuries. The Department has selected the
members of the Council but has yet to hold its first meeting. The
Committee believes it is extremely important for the Secretary to
receive feedback from stakeholders on key policy issues to improve
motorcyclist safety and directs the Secretary to hold a meeting of
the Motorcyclist Advisory Council within 180 days of enactment of
this act.
Accessibility of Child Safety Seats.—The Committee is concerned
that NHTSA has yet to complete and publish a report examining
the accessibility of child safety seats, as required by section 24207
of the IIJA. NHTSA is directed to brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations on the results of the report within 30
days of enactment of this act.
Motorcycle Safety.—The Committee supports automotive safety
technology that can better detect motorcycles and protect motor-
cycle riders on roadways. It is important that safety innovations
consider all roadway users, especially those who are most vulner-
able to serious injury.

The Committee continues to prohibit the use of section 402 funds
for construction, rehabilitation, or remodeling costs, or for office
furnishings and fixtures for State, local, or private buildings or
structures.
Improving Sections 402 and 405 Highway Safety Grant Pro-
grams.—NHTSA’s section 402 State and community highway safe-
ty grants program and section 405 national priority safety program
provide funding for State programs to address critical traffic safety
issues. The Committee encourages NHTSA to identify possible
changes to the administration of these grant programs in order to
streamline their administration and reduce the reporting burden
on States, as permitted by law. The Committee directs NHTSA to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment on the methods that have been identified to
reduce the administrative burden on the recipients of these grant
programs. In addition, the Committee directs the GAO to conduct
a study to assess NHTSA’s management and implementation of the

Section 58:
sections 402 and 405 grant programs, and to provide a report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 1 year
of the date of enactment of this act. The study should consider: (1)
the steps NHTSA takes to review State plans and applications; (2)
the extent to which NHTSA examines States’ use of data to develop
performance plans and targets and assesses State results; (3) the
practices or programs States have implemented that have resulted
in large improvements in safety outcomes for selected national pri-
orities; and (4) whether NHTSA has identified and shared these
practices or programs with other States.

FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Railroad Administration [FRA] is responsible for
planning, developing, and administering programs to achieve safe
operating and mechanical practices in the railroad industry. The
73
FRA is also responsible for administering grants to the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation [Amtrak] and other financial as-
sistance programs to rehabilitate and improve railroad infrastruc-
ture.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Safety and Operations account provides support for FRA rail
safety activities and all other administrative and operating activi-
ties related to staff and programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recognizes the importance of taking a holistic ap-
proach to improving railroad safety and supports a comprehensive
strategy of data-driven regulatory and inspection efforts, proactive
approaches to identify and mitigate risks, and strategic capital in-
vestments in order to improve safety. The Committee recommends
$264,549,000 for Safety and Operations for fiscal year 2026, which
is $3,250,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The fol-
lowing table provides funding levels for activities within this ac-
count.

Grant and project development technical assistance, oversight.............................................. up to $500,000
Inspector Workforce.—The Committee remains concerned with
the current level of safety inspectors despite available resources.
The Committee supports the FRA increasing staffing for this crit-
ical safety workforce. As part of addressing potential hiring and re-
tention challenges, the Committee encourages the FRA to complete
its internal update to the classification standard of railroad inspec-
tors. Once complete, the FRA shall provide the Office of Personnel
and Management the suggested update for appropriate action. The
Committee also directs the FRA to continue to exercise its classi-
fication authority and review position descriptions for accuracy on
an ongoing basis.
Multi-Disciplinary Safety Audits.—The funding for FRA safety-
related personnel supports multi-disciplinary safety audit [MDSA]
teams. MDSAs were developed in response to the East Palestine in-
cident to gain a more comprehensive understanding of systemic
safety issues on a railroad by examining not only regulatory com-
pliance, but also overall safety culture and operations. The Com-
mittee commends the FRA for initiating these assessments, which
will include a thorough review of each Class I freight railroad’s
safety culture, practices, regulatory compliance, and recommend
changes that the FRA will track to completion. To date, the FRA
has completed supplemental safety assessments on three of the six
Class I freight railroads. The Committee is disappointed by reports
of other assessments being halted after processes were undermined
by potential employee coaching. The Committee encourages the
FRA to continue its due diligence in these assessments and in pub-
lishing reports detailing the agency’s findings.
Automated Track Inspection Program [ATIP].—The Committee
recommendation includes no less than $21,600,000 for ATIP to sup-
port the FRA’s contracts for advanced inspection vehicles, which
complement the FRA’s field inspectors, to validate the railroads in-
spection programs, and to advance research priorities. The FRA
shall continue to prioritize the inspection of routes transporting
passengers and hazardous materials.
System Safety and Maintenance Standards.—The Committee
urges the FRA to continue prioritizing investments in safety and
maintenance standardization across the industry, which supports
the development of technologies designed to verify the functional
performance of complex onboard and wayside electronic systems
such as, but not limited to: positive train control [PTC], automated
train control, passenger door control, train communications, com-
puter based train control, propulsion systems, power distribution,
braking systems, land mobile radio testing, train environmental
control, and railcar signs. The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of developing and deploying these technologies to address the
state of good repair backlog and urges the FRA to continue working
with industry to develop standardized performance verification,
testing, diagnostics, and repair for such systems.
75
Blocked Crossings.—The Committee urges the FRA to require
States receiving funding through the railroad safety State partici-
pation grant program to require first responders to report verified
blocked crossing incidents to the FRA blocked crossing portal. The
Committee also directs the FRA to work with railroads to collect
data on specific blocked crossing events, the causes of blocked
crossings, and share best practices for preventing and reducing the
number and duration of blocked crossing events. Consistent with
fiscal year 2024, the Committee directs the FRA to include in the
next annual public report required under section 22404(j) of the
IIJA potential solutions and best practices to improve safety, mobil-
ity, and emergency response capabilities at highway-rail crossings.
Recognizing that both railroad operational practices and local cir-
cumstances lead to the occurrence of blocked crossings, the report
will be informed by the FRA’s outreach to stakeholders, including
railroads, communities, first responders, labor, and State and local
authorities. The report should include: (1) best practices for engag-
ing the railroad with the public, labor, police, highway officials and
other stakeholders; (2) how current and future technology can be
used to identify impacted high risk or 911-critical locations; (3)
what role train length plays in blocked crossings; (4) how to miti-
gate impacts from crossing blockage; (5) how to improve mobility
for both pedestrians and motorists; (6) how to improve community
level emergency response capabilities; (7) how to identify crossing
blockage or other mobility constraints at passive crossings that are
not a part of the National PTC environment; and (8) how to incor-
porate data from the FRA crossing blockage reporting website, or
other data sources, to ensure effective emergency and response
plans.
Confidential Close Call Reporting System [C3RS].—The confiden-
tial close call reporting system program enables railroad employees
to report close calls and unsafe events without fear of retribution
from a railroad or the FRA. The Committee acknowledges the
FRA’s work to grow the program with industry, but remains con-
cerned with the low level of participation from Class I freight rail-
roads as only two of the six Class I freight railroads have joined
the pilot program. In addition, those pilot programs are time-lim-
ited and will expire in 2025. The Committee supports further en-
rollment and directs the FRA to continue to work with railroads on
ways to improve the C3RS program to expand enrollment and pro-
vide protections for railroad employees who report close calls and
unsafe events. The Committee further directs the FRA to continue
to ensure that the program contains protections for railroad em-
ployees to keep their identities confidential and that they are not
subject to discipline by their employers or the FRA for reports sub-
mitted through the program. Additionally, the FRA shall notify the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations upon the expira-
tion of the current Class I freight railroads pilot programs and if
the programs will be renewed.
Hazardous Materials Incident Mitigation.—The NTSB’s inves-
tigation of the East Palestine derailment found a need to improve
emergency response procedures for unloading damaged railroad
tank cars in the field. The Committee understands that the FRA
has initiated an update to the 2007 vent and burn reports in col-
76
laboration with rail industry hazardous material teams, the first
responder community, and other incident command stakeholders.
The Committee directs the FRA to complete this update and re-
publish the reports which shall include clear instructions to consult
the shipper when considering a vent and burn; more comprehen-
sive guidance on what products are candidates for a vent and burn,
along with what chemicals and other hazards may result from a
vent and burn; and an updated process flow chart. These reports
shall be distributed to emergency responder associations.
Staffing.—According to the DOT, the FRA will experience a sig-
nificant workforce reduction resulting from employees choosing to
take the DRP offer. The committee directs the FRA to provide a re-
port on the number and types of positions lost through the DRP
within each office included in the congressional budget justification
and identify if the position is based in headquarters or the field.
The report shall include an analysis of the impact of these staffing
reductions on the FRA’s ability to implement programs, grants, and
all statutory responsibilities.
RAILROAD RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $54,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 43,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The railroad research and development program provides sci-
entific and engineering support for the FRA’s rail safety rule-
making and enforcement efforts. The program also identifies and
develops emerging technologies for voluntary adoption by industry
and supports intercity passenger rail development by providing
technical assistance, equipment specifications, and proposal evalua-
tions.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $43,000,000 for
railroad research and development as authorized under section
22102 of the IIJA, which is $11,000,000 less than the fiscal year
2025 enacted level.
Rolling Stock Equipment and Components [RSEC] Safety, Main-
tenance, and Inspection.—The recommendation includes no less
than $5,000,000 to continue support for RSEC research in order to
evaluate, test, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
automated inspection and maintenance equipment and procedures.
The NTSB’s investigation of the East Palestine derailment found
that more FRA research is necessary to determine whether changes
to wayside bearing defect detection systems, such as lowering alert
and alarm thresholds, would result in significant safety improve-
ments and to determine which operational responses to bearing
alerts and alarms are sufficient to prevent derailments. Therefore,
as part of the funding for RSEC research, the FRA shall continue
to research the effectiveness of current bearing defect detection sys-
tems, including heat and acoustic; bearing alert and alarm thresh-
olds; the distances between wayside detectors; the installation, in-
spection, and maintenance of wayside bearing defect detectors; and
77
operational responses by railroads to bearing alerts and alarms.
The FRA shall make research on these topics publicly available.
The FRA’s research and evaluation will inform the capabilities and
limitations of existing technologies and provide railroads and regu-
lators with information on what changes could improve railroad
safety. The FRA’s research is critical for the development of any fu-
ture standards and minimum requirements for commercially avail-
able systems that could protect railroad personnel and the public.
Further, the Committee commends the DOT and the FRA for
taking steps within current authority to improve railroad safety,
such as tasking the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee [RSAC] in
2023 with considering and reviewing issues related to wayside de-
tectors. The Committee appreciates the status update provided by
the RSAC wayside detectors working group in October 2024 and
looks forward to the RSAC’s recommendations resulting from this
review. The Committee directs the FRA to continue to use the
RSAC to inform industry, Congress, and the public on additional
safety measures that should be taken, including regulatory and
statutory changes.
Short Line Safety Institute [SLSI].—The Committee remains sup-
portive of the FRA’s efforts, in partnership with short line and re-
gional railroads, to build a stronger, more sustainable safety cul-
ture in this segment of the rail industry, and includes $2,750,000
for the SLSI. These efforts include safety culture assessments and
the provision of hazardous materials emergency response training
in an effort to improve the safe transportation of crude oil and
other hazardous materials on our Nation’s rail network. Funds
shall be available for maintenance of safety trainsets and supple-
ment hazardous material safety training for railroad employees
and emergency responders, in addition to ongoing safety culture as-
sessments, training and education, outreach activities, and re-
search.
Rail Research and Development COE.—The Committee supports
the FRA’s intent to use no less than $2,500,000 of the resources
provided under this heading for the rail research and development
COE as authorized in section 22413 of the IIJA. The COE is in-
tended to advance basic and applied research, evaluation, edu-
cation, workforce development, and training efforts related to safe-
ty, project delivery, efficiency, reliability, resiliency, and sustain-
ability of urban commuter, intercity high-speed, and freight rail
transportation.
Transportation Technology Center.—The Committee includes up
to $3,000,000 for the construction, alteration, and repair of build-
ings and improvements at the Transportation Technology Center,
which is equal to fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal-state partnership for intercity passenger rail grant
program provides support for capital projects that reduce the state
of good repair backlog with respect to qualified railroad assets and
projects that expand or establish new intercity passenger rail serv-
ice, as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 24911.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $75,000,000 for the Federal-state
partnership for intercity passenger rail grant [FSP] program, which
is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This amount is in ad-
dition to the $7,200,000,000 in advance appropriations made avail-
able in the IIJA for fiscal year 2026.
Regional Rail Planning.—Of the funds provided under this head-
ing in this act and in the IIJA for fiscal year 2026, the Committee
directs the Secretary to exercise the authorities under 49 U.S.C.
24911(k) to withhold 5 percent of the total amounts made available
to carry out planning and development activities related to the cor-
ridor identification and development program authorized under 49
U.S.C. 25101.
Washington Union Station.—The Committee recommendation
provides $5,000,000 for the repair and rehabilitation of Washington
Union Station. As the owner of the station, the Federal government
has a clear role in addressing station infrastructure and system
needs. The Committee directs the FRA to provide a briefing to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this act on the structural challenges and defi-
ciencies at this Federal facility, an estimate of the scope of work
necessary to preserve this historical asset, and planned expendi-
ture of the funds provided in this act. Further, the DOT and the
FRA are directed to pursue adding designees from the Common-
wealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland to the Union Station
Redevelopment Corporation Board of Directors.

[CRISI] grants program was authorized to improve the safety, effi-
ciency, and reliability of passenger and freight rail systems. Eligi-
ble activities include a wide range of freight and passenger rail
capital, safety, technology deployment, planning, environmental
analysis, research, workforce development, and training projects as
authorized under 49 U.S.C. 22907. Eligible recipients include
States, local governments, Class II and Class III railroads, Amtrak,
and other intercity passenger rail operators, rail carriers and
equipment manufacturers that partner with an eligible public-sec-
tor applicant, the Transportation Research Board, university trans-
79
portation centers, and non-profit rail labor organizations. As au-
thorized, the program requires a minimum non-Federal share of 20
percent, that preference be given to projects with at least a 50 per-
cent non-Federal match, and that at least 25 percent of the funds
be provided to projects in rural areas.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $151,524,000 for the CRISI pro-
gram, which is $51,524,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. This amount is in addition to the $1,000,000,000 in advance
appropriations made available in the IIJA for fiscal year 2026.
Within the amounts made available in this act, the recommenda-
tion includes $51,524,000 for CDS. The Committee directs the FRA
to provide funding for those projects listed in the table at the end
of this report in the corresponding amounts and for the cor-
responding recipient. The Committee further directs that the spe-
cific funding allocated in the table at the end of this report shall
not diminish or prejudice any application or geographic region to
receive other discretionary grants or loans.
Railroad Workforce Development Program.—The Committee di-
rects that not less than $5,000,000 of the funds made available
under this heading be directed to develop and execute workforce
development, training, and apprenticeship programs.
THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,427,763,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,427,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail services in 46 States
and the District of Columbia, in addition to serving as a contractor
in various capacities for several commuter rail agencies. Congress
created Amtrak in the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Public
Law 91–518) in response to private carriers’ inability to profitably
operate intercity passenger rail service. Thereafter, Amtrak as-
sumed the common carrier obligations of the private railroads in
exchange for the right to priority access to their tracks for incre-
mental cost.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$2,427,000,000 for Amtrak, which is $763,000 less than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. The amount is in addition to the
$4,400,000,000 in advance appropriations made available in the
IIJA in fiscal year 2026, which is limited to only capital projects
to address the state of good repair backlog.
Charter Trains and Private Cars.—Amtrak is directed to once
again report on the impact of its policies to charter trains and pri-
vate trains in the fiscal year 2027 budget request, and to include
the amounts and percentages by which revenues and usage de-
clined, including separate figures for charter trains run with Am-
trak-owned and with privately-owned cars. Amtrak should also con-
tinue to update the list of eligible locations for private car moves
80
and continue to evaluate such locations going forward. Amtrak
should continue to strive to improve public outreach and offer its
stakeholders an opportunity to comment on policies that affect
services prior to finalizing any such decisions.
Amtrak Station Agents.—Amtrak is required to provide station
agents, which include either Amtrak ticket agents or caretakers, at
all Amtrak stations that had a ticket agent position eliminated in
fiscal year 2018. Amtrak is again directed to communicate and col-
laborate with local partners and take into consideration the unique
needs of each community, including impacts to local jobs, when
making decisions related to the staffing of Amtrak stations.
Food and Beverage.—The Committee urges Amtrak to provide
food and beverage services in a cost effective manner consistent
with available revenue and Federal funds. The Committee directs
Amtrak to periodically update the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on the food and beverage offerings, new initia-
tives, and operating loss, as appropriate.
Services.—The Committee is concerned with any potential
offshoring of services contracts and the potential displacement of
U.S. labor. Amtrak should take the necessary affirmative steps to
ensure the contracts for customer, professional, and IT services, in-
cluding such subsidiary services, be performed within the United
States, to the extent practicable.
Lactation Accommodations.—The Committee recognizes Amtrak’s
work to implement lactation accommodations for employees and
customers that are nursing, and encourages Amtrak to consider the
continued expansion of such accommodations on board its trains
and at its stations. Amtrak is directed to report to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of this act
with an assessment on the feasibility and demand for lactation
spaces or other accommodations on board its trains or in its sta-
tions, as well as cost estimates for the design and installation of
such spaces or accommodations and if there are low-cost alter-
natives.
Passenger Rail Feasibility Analysis.—Within 1 year after the
date of enactment of this act, Amtrak, in coordination with poten-
tial infrastructure-owning freight railroads and the FRA, shall com-
plete a feasibility study for temporarily providing expanded Am-
trak long-distance service(s) during the 2034 Salt Lake City Olym-
pics. Temporary services to be assessed include two identified from
the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study required under sec-
tion 22214 of the IIJA: Salt Lake City, Utah to Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia and Denver, Colorado to Seattle, Washington. The analysis
shall assess the requirements of instituting temporary long-dis-
tance service(s) to include any track or station improvements, pro-
jected ridership and revenue, fleet and labor assessment, capital
and operational costs, host railroad agreements, and a timeline of
initiating improvements. Additional consideration should be made
of how intercity passenger rail service may complement existing or
planned commuter passenger rail service and the potential tem-
porary impacts on Amtrak’s network service levels and perform-
ance.
Fleet Modernization.—The Committee acknowledges Amtrak has
made significant progress in the production of new, modern train
81
equipment through its work on the next-generation Acela and Airo
trainsets. The need to replace these decades-old railcars was re-
cently made evident when Amtrak had to remove 70 Horizon rail-
cars, which have been in use since 1989, from service on state-sup-
ported routes in the spring of 2025 because of corrosion and other
safety issues. The Committee expects Amtrak to remain on-sched-
ule to safely deliver the new Airo trainsets for service on state-sup-
ported routes in 2026 so old trainsets can be retired. Delivery of
the next-generation Acela trainsets for the northeast corridor
[NEC] remains equally important, but the Committee is concerned
by the persistent delays, on which the Amtrak Office of Inspector
General has also reported. The Committee directs Amtrak and the
FRA to jointly provide a briefing to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act on
the status of the next-generation Acela trainset production, compli-
ance with federally mandated safety and operational testing re-
quirements, and outstanding challenges to launch revenue service
in 2025.
NORTHEAST CORRIDOR GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD
PASSENGER CORPORATION
The Committee recommends $850,000,000 for northeast corridor
grants to Amtrak, which is in addition to the $1,200,000,000 in ad-
vance appropriations made available in the IIJA in fiscal year

Section 61:
2026. The funding level provided includes $5,000,000 for the North-
east Corridor Commission established under 49 U.S.C. 24905,
which is in addition to the $5,000,000 in advance appropriations
made available for the Northeast Corridor Commission in the IIJA
in fiscal year 2026.
NATIONAL NETWORK GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER
CORPORATION
The Committee recommends $1,577,000,000 for national network
grants to Amtrak, which is in addition to the $3,200,000,000 in ad-
vance appropriations made available in the IIJA in fiscal year

Section 62:
2026. The funding level provided includes $3,000,000 for the State-
Supported Route Committee established in the FAST Act (Public
Law 114–94), which is in addition to the $3,000,000 in advance ap-
propriations made available in the IIJA in fiscal year 2026.
National Network Services.—Amtrak’s long-distance routes pro-
vide much needed transportation access in hundreds of commu-
nities and for rural areas where mobility options are limited.
Equally important are routes that provide service to rural areas
from urban areas along the NEC. The Committee does not support
proposals that will inevitably lead to long-term or permanent serv-
ice cuts or segmentation of routes, which will result in less service
for rural communities.
Corridor Identification and Development Program [CIDP].—Pur-
suant to 49 U.S.C. 25101, the FRA established the CIDP in May
2023 to facilitate the development of intercity passenger rail cor-
ridors across the Nation. To facilitate this effort, the Committee
recommendation includes up to $66,000,000 for Amtrak to carry
out activities for corridors selected under CIDP, as authorized
under section 22101(h) of the IIJA.
82
Modernization Projects.—The Committee acknowledges Amtrak’s
budget request includes modernization initiatives it could pursue
beyond its annual operations that would further improve the rail-
road and customer experience. Of the amount provided for the na-
tional network, $5,000,000 is for the Atlanta hub initiative for a
new intercity passenger rail hub in downtown Atlanta as included
in Amtrak’s fiscal year 2026 legislative and grant request.
Midwest Rail Commission Study.—The Committee directs the
GAO to examine the establishment of a federally authorized com-
mission for the purposes of developing a long-term delivery strat-
egy for Midwest rail. The study should identify lessons learned
from the establishment of the Northeast Corridor Commission,
which coordinates capital improvements made by Amtrak and
States to the NEC rail infrastructure, that could be applied to a
Midwest Rail Commission. This study should also examine any
Federal resources, including staff and funding, necessary to estab-
lish a federally authorized commission, where such a Commission
could be housed, as well as any successful practices for identifying
projects in need of prioritization, among other information. The
GAO shall provide initial findings in a briefing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act and final findings and recommendations within 1
year of enactment of this act.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS–FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION
(INCLUDING RESCISSIONS)
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

Section 63:
Section 150 allows the FRA to transfer certain amounts made
available in this and prior acts to the financial assistance oversight
and technical assistance account to support the award, administra-
tion, project management oversight, and technical assistance of
grants administered by the FRA, with an exception.

Section 64:
Section 151 limits overtime payments to employees at Amtrak to
$35,000 per employee. However, Amtrak’s president may waive
this restriction for specific employees for safety or operational effi-
ciency reasons.

Section 65:
Section 152 prohibits the use of funds made available by this act
by Amtrak in contravention of the Worker Adjustment and Re-
training Notification Act.

Section 66:
Section 153 prohibits the use of funds provided to Amtrak to re-
duce the total number of Amtrak Police Department uniformed offi-
cers patrolling on board passenger trains or at stations, facilities,
or rights-of-way below the staffing level on May 1, 2019.

Section 67:
Section 154 permits the Union Station Redevelopment Corpora-
tion to be an eligible recipient for the FSP program.

Section 68:
Section 155 expresses the sense of Congress in support of Am-
trak’s long-distance passenger routes.

Section 69:
Section 156 rescinds certain unobligated balances.

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Transit Administration [FTA] was established as a
component of the Department of Transportation by Reorganization
Plan No. 2 of 1968, effective July 1, 1968, which transferred most
of the functions and programs under the Federal Transit Act of
1964, as amended (78 Stat. 302; 49 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The missions of
the FTA are: to help develop improved mass transportation sys-
tems and practices; to support the inclusion of public transpor-
tation in community and regional planning to support economic de-
velopment; to provide mobility for Americans who depend on tran-
sit for transportation in both metropolitan and rural areas; to
maximize the productivity and efficiency of transportation systems;
and to provide assistance to State and local governments and agen-
cies in financing such services and systems.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
Under the Committee recommendation, a total program level of
$16,890,357,000 is provided for programs administered by the FTA
in fiscal year 2026. The recommendation is $203,288,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This amount is in addition to the
$4,250,000,000 in advance appropriations in the IIJA for fiscal year

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Communities use formula grants funding for bus and railcar pur-
chases, facility repair and construction, maintenance, and where el-
igible, planning and operating expenses. The formula grants ac-
count includes funding for the following programs: transit-oriented
development; planning programs; urbanized area formula grants;
enhanced mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities; a
pilot program for enhanced mobility; formula grants for rural
areas; public transportation innovation; technical assistance and
workforce development, including a national transit institute; a bus
testing facility; the national transit database; state of good repair
grants; buses and bus facilities formula and competitive grants;
and growing States and high-density States formula grants. Set-
asides from formula funds are directed to a grant program for each
State with rail systems not regulated by the FRA to meet the re-
quirements for a State safety oversight program. The account also
provides funding to support passenger ferry services, public trans-
portation on Indian reservations, and the administrative expenses
of the FTA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends limiting obligations and the liquida-
tion of contract authorizations in the transit formula grants ac-
count in fiscal year 2026 to $14,642,000,000, which is $363,000,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Ferry Fleet Transition Plans.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to consider ferry fleet transition plans as eligible under
the planning programs in 49 U.S.C. 5305, the urbanized area for-
85
mula program (49 U.S.C. 5307), and rural area formula program
(49 U.S.C. 5311).
Bus-to-Person Collisions.—The Committee commends the FTA for
its efforts to encourage the adoption of mitigation strategies that
reduce bus-to-person collisions, including the issuance of FTA safe-
ty advisory 23–1. The Committee expects the FTA to encourage
transit agencies to adopt proven on-board technology solutions to
detect, deter, and avoid collisions through program guidance and
NOFOs, where permissible and feasible.
Bus Safety and Accessibility Research.—The FTA issued a NOFO
on November 18, 2024, for the bus safety and accessibility research
program making up to $10,000,000 in public transportation innova-
tion program funding available for research, development, dem-
onstration, and deployment activities. A strategic goal for this pro-
gram is to make ‘‘existing and new buses safer for their operators
and vulnerable road users’’ and a key focus area is ‘‘Driver Safety
Systems’’. The Committee notes that applications were due to the
FTA on January 17, 2025, and directs the FTA to make awards for
the bus safety and accessibility research program not later than 90
days after the date of enactment of this act.
Roadway Worker Protections.—The Committee is concerned
about the safety of transit employees working on or near transit
rail tracks. Proven roadway worker protection [RWP] technologies
exist that provide advanced train approach warnings and have the
potential to improve the safety and efficiency of rail operations.
The Committee encourages the FTA to promote the maximum level
of RWP safety, to the extent permissible under current law.
Updates to the FTA’s Best Practices Procurement and Lessons
Learned Manual.—The FTA is directed to update its best practices
procurement manual not later than 180 days after enactment of
this act and to the greatest extent practicable incorporate rec-
ommendations submitted to the agency by industry stakeholders
for consideration.
Staffing.—With the significant reduction in staffing levels in fis-
cal year 2025 as a result of employees electing to take the DRP,
the FTA is experiencing a 33 percent reduction to the agency’s
workforce. The Committee is aware that this will impact staffing
in regional offices. The Committee is concerned about the impact
of these staffing reductions on the Department’s ability to oversee
and support the maintenance and construction of transit infra-
structure projects. As such, the Committee directs the FTA to pro-
vide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions on the number and job series of positions lost through the
DRP within each office included in the congressional budget jus-
tification as well as each regional office. The report shall include
an analysis of the impact of these staffing reductions on the agen-
cy’s ability to implement Federal transit formula and grant pro-
grams and all other statutory responsibilities.
Employer-Sponsored Transit Benefits.—Employer-sponsored tran-
sit benefits play a role in increasing the rate of transit use. Public
Law 115–97 eliminated employer deductions for qualified transpor-
tation fringe benefits, which include mass transit benefits, van
pools, qualified parking, and other forms of commuter benefits. The
Committee directs the GAO to conduct a study to assess the preva-
86
lence and effects of employer-sponsored transit benefits, including
possible impacts the tax changes to the qualified transportation
fringe benefit has had on such programs and employee transit use.
The GAO is directed to provide a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on such study not later than 1 year
after the date of enactment of this act.
Major International Sporting Events.—The Committee is encour-
aged by the support the Secretary and administration have pro-
vided for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic and
Paralympic Games. The Committee directs the Secretary to con-
tinue to provide technical assistance as host cities and transit pro-
viders work to deliver high quality transit service for these events
of national significance. While the Committee recognizes that the
FTA issued a Dear Colleague letter on June 10, 2024 on providing
transit during major events and has advised transit providers to
work with FTA regional offices on specific issues relating to charter
service restrictions, the Committee understands that transit pro-
viders continue to have concerns with the applicability of certain
FTA requirements as such requirements do not contemplate events
of the scale and scope of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olym-
pic and Paralympic Games. For example, transit providers are con-
cerned with exceeding the FTA’s maximum spare ratio and not the
minimum number of spares as addressed in the Dear Colleague let-
ter. To support the ability of transit providers to prepare for and
deliver transit service during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028
Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary to work with transit providers to provide appropriate relief
from the spare ratio requirement and charter service restrictions,
if requested by a transit provider specifically for activities to sup-
port the preparation for and delivery of transit service during such
events. Further, the Committee directs the Secretary to convene
passenger and freight transportation stakeholders, including but
not limited to transit providers, intercity rail and bus operators,
freight railroads, ports, trucking companies, and labor, in an effort
to continue the efficient movement of goods and avoid potential
congestion during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic and
Paralympic Games.
2026 FIFA World Cup.—The Committee notes that the United
States will host 78 matches across nine States in 11 cities over 39
days during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Host cities and transit pro-
viders are preparing to move thousands of spectators to and from
matches and daily festivities surrounding the tournament. To sup-
port transit providers with increasing passenger capacity, extend-
ing service hours, employing additional personnel, and enhancing
transit security, the Committee recommendation repurposes
$78,115,871 from prior year activities for operational transpor-
tation assistance for planning and executing activities directly tied
to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.—The Committee notes
that for the two prior Olympic Games in the United States, Salt
Lake City, Utah in 2002 and Atlanta, Georgia in 1996, a program
was established under which public transit agencies throughout the
United States donated or leased buses (and in some instances pro-
vided bus operators) to the host public transportation agencies and
87
the host city Olympic committee. To build on that model and rep-
licate those successes, the Committee directs the Secretary and the
administration to assist in the implementation of a similar bus
leasing program for the cities hosting events in support of the 2028
Olympic and Paralympic Games. To that end, the Committee rec-
ommendation repurposes $68,000,000 from prior year activities to
support the planning, development, and operations of a supple-
mental bus system; regional traffic surveillance and management
systems; and identification and deployment of dedicated bus lanes
for the games route network.
TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $45,568,868
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 140,857,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Committee provides funding for transit infrastructure grants
to address targeted capital, operating, and state of good repair
needs for public transportation providers and services across Amer-
ica.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $140,857,000 in transit infrastruc-
ture grants to remain available until expended, which is
$95,288,132 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. An addi-
tional $193,905,005 is repurposed from prior year activities for a
total of $334,762,005 in budget authority. Of this total, $58,857,000
is for CDS.
Transit Vehicle Innovation Deployment Centers [TVIDC].—The
Committee supports the continued use of the FTA’s TVIDC pro-
gram to develop solutions to the challenges transit operators and
bus original equipment manufacturers face as they move to full
scale adoption of advanced transit technologies. The Committee di-
rects the FTA to prioritize research efforts focused on the dissemi-
nation of research and technologies that maximize the value of
these investments. The Committee directs the FTA to utilize the
TVIDC program to focus research on efficiency improvements and
directs the FTA to fund component testing (including the use of
FTA-appointed component testing centers), technical assistance co-
ordination, and increasing understanding and skill sets within
transit agencies in regards to planning, procuring, and deploying
advanced technologies using the TVIDC’s nation and industry-wide
coordination structure for the development and testing of new tech-
nology components and vehicles.
Cost Escalations.—The Committee recognizes that cost esca-
lations can reduce the impact of prior transit grant awards. The
Committee encourages the FTA to work with grantees when cost
adjustments or other factors impacting the completion of projects
become necessary to address.
Critical Components.—The Committee encourages the FTA to
work with OMB to utilize all available authorities to ensure critical
components of ferry vessels acquired with FTA funds are not ex-
cluded as a result of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j). Critical components include
88
items vital to relatability, safety, and performance, such as propul-
sion systems. The Committee continues to urge the Department to
continue to harmonize the regulatory regimes across modes, uti-
lizing existing authorities, to ensure Buy America provisions for
ferry construction are transparent and deliver the best vessel for
riders and the taxpayer.
Transit Safety.—The Committee notes the Department’s empha-
sis on the safety and security of public transportation. Federal
transit funding may be used by recipients for planning efforts that
address transit rider or employee safety and capital projects to im-
prove safety for transit riders and workers, such as purchasing and
installing cameras in subway cars, lighting at transit stations, and
shields for bus drivers. However, transit agencies in urbanized
areas with a population of more than 200,000 are prohibited from
using Federal transit funding for public transportation safety and
security operating assistance projects, such as staff salaries for per-
sonnel exclusively involved with security; contracts for security
services, including with police departments; and contracts or sala-
ries for crisis intervention specialists. Transit agencies in such
large urbanized areas use their non-Federal funding to support ac-
tivities and programs to improve safety and security. To bolster the
efforts of large urban area transit agencies, the Committee rec-
ommendation includes $20,000,000 for operating costs to improve
public safety, reduce crime, and increase security in transit sys-
tems.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,500,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The FTA is authorized to provide technical assistance, workforce
development programs, and training to the public transportation
industry under section 5314 of title 49, United States Code. Fund-
ing under this heading is supplemental to the funding provided
under the heading ‘‘Transit Formula Grants’’ heading as authorized
by the IIJA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $7,500,000 for technical assistance
and training, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee recognizes the need among transit providers serv-
ing small cities, rural areas, and disadvantaged communities for
technical assistance to help them take advantage of new tech-
nologies, including ride-hailing applications, autonomous shuttles,
and micro-transit innovations that are transforming how Ameri-
cans use public transportation. This funding will provide rural and
small city transit operators with hands-on technical assistance that
will facilitate the adoption of these new tools.
Cooperative Agreements.—The Committee includes $1,500,000 for
a cooperative agreement with a technical assistance center to assist
small-urban, rural, and Tribal public transit providers and plan-
ning agencies with applied innovation and capacity building that
helps these grantees and sub-recipients deploy innovative and
89
emerging technologies to maximize the efficiency of their oper-
ations. These efforts should include, but are not limited to: devel-
oping on-demand mobility options; exploring the feasibility of au-
tonomous technologies; assisting rural and small-urban areas with
changing mode-share strategies; and increasing data literacy and
effective use of data to increase operational efficiency. The Com-
mittee recommendation also includes $2,500,000 for a cooperative
agreement to a national non-profit organization with a dem-
onstrated capacity to develop and provide workforce development
and standards based training in maintenance and operations with-
in the public transportation industry.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,205,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,950,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Under the capital investment grants [CIG] program, the FTA
provides grants to fund the building of new fixed guideway systems
or extensions and improvements to existing fixed guideway sys-
tems. Eligible services include light rail, rapid rail (heavy rail),
commuter rail, and bus rapid transit. The program includes fund-
ing for four categories of eligible projects authorized under 49

Project Management Oversight [PMO] Activities.—The Committee
directs the FTA to continue to submit to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations the quarterly PMO reports for each
project with a full funding grant agreement.
Full Funding Grant Agreements [FFGAs].—Section 5309(k) of
title 49, United States Code, requires that the FTA notify the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, as well as the
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 15
days before executing a FFGA. In its notification to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations, the Committee directs the
FTA to submit the following information: (1) a copy of the proposed
FFGA; (2) the total and annual Federal appropriations required for
the project; (3) the yearly and total Federal appropriations that can
be planned or anticipated for existing FFGAs for each fiscal year
through 2026; (4) a detailed analysis of annual commitments for
current and anticipated FFGAs against the program authorization,
by individual project; (5) a financial analysis of the project’s cost
and sponsor’s ability to finance the project, which shall be con-
ducted by an independent examiner and which shall include an as-
sessment of the capital cost estimate and finance plan; (6) the
source and security of all public and private sector financing; (7)
the project’s operating plan, which enumerates the project’s future
revenue and ridership forecasts; and (8) a listing of all planned con-
tingencies and possible risks associated with the project.
The Committee also directs the FTA to inform the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations in writing 30 days before ap-
proving schedule, scope, or budget changes to any FFGA. Cor-
respondence relating to all such changes shall include any budget
revisions or program changes that materially alter the project as
originally stipulated in the FFGA, including any proposed change
in rail car procurement.
The Committee directs the FTA to continue to provide a monthly
capital investment grants program update to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations, detailing the status of each project.
This update should include anticipated milestone schedules for ad-
vancing projects, especially those within 2 years of a proposed
FFGA. It should also highlight and explain any potential cost and
schedule changes affecting projects.
Annual Report on Funding Recommendations.—The Committee
directs the Secretary to submit the fiscal year 2027 annual report
on funding recommendations required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o), and di-
rects the Secretary to maintain the Federal Government funding
commitments for all existing grant agreements and identify all
projects with a medium or higher rating that anticipate requesting
a grant agreement in fiscal year 2027.
New Transportation Projects in Low-Growth Areas.—The Com-
mittee encourages the FTA to prioritize projects that connect com-
munities unserved or underserved by transit to employment cen-
ters and projects that support economic growth in disadvantaged
areas.
New Starts.—The Committee urges the FTA to proceed expedi-
tiously while reviewing revised new start project applications for
91
projects previously recommended for funding in more than one FTA
annual report on funding recommendations.
GRANTS TO THE WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT
AUTHORITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $150,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 150,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides assistance to the Washington Metro-
politan Area Transit Authority [WMATA] for capital investment
and asset rehabilitation as authorized by section 601 of division B
of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008
(Public Law 110–432) and section 30019 of the IIJA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $150,000,000 for grants
to WMATA for capital and preventive maintenance expenses, in-
cluding pressing safety-related investments, which is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. These grants are in addition to the
Federal formula and competitive grant funding WMATA receives,
as well as funding from local jurisdictions. This funding will sup-
port WMATA in addressing ongoing safety deficiencies and improve
the reliability of service throughout the Metrorail system. Safety
must continue to be a top priority. This prioritization means work-
ing to establish and build a culture of safety throughout the organi-
zation, including a culture that fosters rigorous adherence to safety
rules and procedures as a matter of routine. WMATA must also
continue to improve its relationship with the Washington Metro-
politan Safety Commission, including improving communication
and transparency that supports the resolution of issues and dis-
agreements in a timely fashion.

MARITIME ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Maritime Administration [MARAD] is responsible for pro-
grams authorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended
(46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.). MARAD is also responsible for pro-
93
grams that strengthen the United States maritime industry in sup-
port of the Nation’s security and economic needs. MARAD
prioritizes the DoD use of ports and intermodal facilities during
DoD mobilizations to guarantee the smooth flow of military cargo
through commercial ports. MARAD manages the maritime security
program, the voluntary intermodal sealift agreement program, and
the ready reserve force, which ensure DoD access to commercial
and strategic sealift and associated intermodal capacity. MARAD
also ensures the safe disposal of obsolete ships in the National de-
fense reserve fleet. Further, MARAD administers education and
training programs through the United States Merchant Marine
Academy [USMMA] and six State maritime academies [SMAs] that
assist in producing skilled merchant marine officers capable of
serving defense and commercial transportation needs.

1Includes $122,400,000 in new budget authority and a rescission of $77,000,000 from prior
year appropriations.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Section 83:
Section 3511 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283)
authorized the tanker security fleet program to establish and main-
tain a fleet of active, commercially viable, militarily useful, pri-
vately owned product tank vessels to meet national defense and
other security requirements. The tanker security fleet program pro-
vides direct payments to U.S. flag vessel operators, and partici-
pating operators are in turn required to operate in U.S. foreign
commerce, mixed U.S. foreign commerce, and domestic trade and to
make vessels available upon the request of the DoD.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance Program [META] ......................................................... 2,000,000
United States Marine Highway Program...................................................................................................... 5,000,000
MARAD Headquarters Operations................................................................................................................. 72,398,000
Total................................................................................................................................................ 240,898,000
Staffing.—The Committee continues to direct MARAD to provide
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with quar-
terly staffing updates, including on hiring and separations, by pro-
gram office for all positions funded by this act in MARAD head-
quarters operations and USMMA operations.
USMMA Capital Asset Management Program.—The Committee
remains deeply concerned about the current condition of the
USMMA’s facilities, which has a direct impact on the quality of the
education provided to students and the ability to attract new en-
trants to serve as future leaders in the United States Merchant
Marine. As such, the Committee’s recommendation provides
$50,000,000 for the USMMA’s facilities maintenance and repair,
and equipment [FMRE] activities. In addition, the Committee pro-
vides $10,000,000 for the capital improvement program [CIP],
which in addition to the $160,000,000 in unobligated balances, pro-
vides the USMMA with $170,000,000 to move forward with several
CIP projects over the next few years. The Committee reminds the
USMMA that, in the event that flexibility is necessary to address
imminent safety hazards or quality of life issues, it has the ability
to exercise the reprogramming authorities under section 405 of this
act, including by seeking approval from the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee is disappointed that the USMMA has yet to sub-
mit its annual CIP plan to Congress, leading to further delays in
implementing much needed improvements of the campus. Given
the significant amount of unobligated balances for CIP projects, it
is unacceptable that the USMMA has yet to formulate a long-term
plan on which it can move forward. The Secretary is directed to
provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with
the CIP plan within 30 days of enactment of this act. In addition,
the USMMA’s Director of Facilities and Infrastructure shall pro-
vide quarterly briefings to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the status of all short- and long-term capital im-
provement projects and FMRE activities and continue to provide
the annual report in the same manner and context as in previous
fiscal years. The Committee strongly encourages the USMMA to
maintain current information on CIP projects and any major repair
FMRE activities on its website to expand the availability of this in-
formation to students and external stakeholders, such as the alum-
ni foundation which also provides support to USMMA projects. The
Committee also directs the OST Assistant Secretary of Administra-
tion to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
on the status of its hiring search for the recently vacated Super-
intendent and Deputy Superintendent positions at the USMMA
96
within 30 days of enactment of this act, as having such leadership
in place is critical to advancing FMRE and CIP projects.
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment [SASH] at the
USMMA.—Creating a culture of safety, respect, and dignity for ca-
dets and faculty is essential to reducing student vulnerability to
SASH, and every student deserves to pursue an education and a
future workplace free from unwanted sexual aggression. The Com-
mittee commends students who have courageously come forward to
publicly report allegations of SASH in an effort to hold perpetrators
accountable and prevent future violations.
The Committee acknowledges MARAD and the USMMA have
made meaningful steps to improving safety for USMMA mid-
shipmen, but it remains a work in progress to sustain staffing for
the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office [SAPRO], to se-
cure broader industry participation in the every mariner builds a
respectful culture [EMBARC] program, and to improve access to
mental health and counseling services. The Committee directs the
USMMA to fully staff the SAPRO, including a second victim advo-
cate position. The Committee directs MARAD to brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on how the USMMA fac-
ulty and staff are improving the culture of safety on campus.
Vessel Generated Underwater Noise.—MARAD shall use not less
than $1,500,000 of the funds provided under the META program to
collect data and further investigate vessel generated underwater
noise. When selecting projects, the Committee directs MARAD to
strongly consider projects led by regional coalitions that conduct re-
search, mitigation, and management activities to reduce vessel-gen-
erated underwater noise on the maritime environment, including
large commercial vessels impacting Endangered Species Act-listed
whales.
Vessel Generated Noise While Docked.—The Committee strongly
encourages MARAD to work as expeditiously as possible to identify
and implement mitigation measures that will minimize noise im-
pacts to surrounding communities when MARAD ships are not op-
erating on shore power. Not later than 60 days after enactment of
this act, MARAD is directed to provide a briefing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations detailing the planning in-
volved in determining the June 2025 relocation of the USNS Pom-
eroy and USNS Charlton, the timeline and implementation of con-
necting the ships to shore power, and the mitigation measures
taken to minimize noise impacts in surrounding communities.
Secure Composite Shipping Containers.—The Committee strongly
encourages MARAD to continue to collaborate with the Federal
Maritime Commission, DoD, and DHS to support the transition of
secure composite shipping containers into wider use to provide in-
creased security, shipment visibility, and cargo facilitation. Only a
fraction of the millions of shipping containers coming to the United
States are scanned due to logistics limitations. This technology en-
ables Federal agencies and commercial high-value good producers
to combat tampering by sophisticated adversaries, and minimize
loss from theft, damage, or spoilage. The ultimate goal of the se-
cure container transition effort led by DHS and supported by
MARAD is to provide the level of security to law enforcement offi-
cials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not
97
been inserted into the container for smuggling into the United
States. A December 2023 container deployment report to DHS de-
termined that at least 250 six-sided containers will need to be built
and deployed in field trials in order to achieve industry’s confidence
level to adopt the new technology. MARAD should work with DHS
and the DoD to identify shipping routes for secure container dem-
onstration and field trials, engage with government and commer-
cial shippers to educate potential users of the secure containers
about the capabilities and benefits of the containers, review govern-
ment policies and make recommendations to DHS and other agen-
cies on policy changes that could accelerate the transition of secure
container technology into the marketplace, and use the existing
America’s marine highway program and the port infrastructure de-
velopment program to promote and provide funding for secure com-
posite shipping containers, if available and if eligible.
STATE MARITIME ACADEMY OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $125,788,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 143,400,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Committee provides funding for the six SMAs to support the
training and education of the Nation’s maritime transportation
workforce. Funding provided supports financial assistance for the
SMAs as well as maintenance and operation of the schools’ training
ships.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $143,400,000 for
state maritime academy operations. The recommendation is
$17,612,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The bill
provides the following funding levels for specific activities within
this account:
2026
Recommendation
School ship maintenance and repair .......................................................................................................... $7,800,000
Student incentive program .......................................................................................................................... 4,800,000
Fuel assistance program ............................................................................................................................. 9,800,000
Direct payments for SMAs ........................................................................................................................... 6,000,000
National security multi-mission vessel program......................................................................................... 115,000,000
Total................................................................................................................................................ 143,400,000
National Security Multi-Mission Vessel [NSMV] Program.—The
Committee recommendation includes $115,000,000 for the NSMV
program, which provides funding for program operations in support
of SMA shore-side infrastructure improvements, ship delivery,
cyber security, transit costs, GPS hardening, operations, integra-
tion, oversight, and management of the NSMVs. Of this total,
$60,000,000 shall be for shore-side infrastructure improvements at
the SMAs, and $55,000,000 shall be for expenses related to the op-
eration, integration, oversight and management of national secu-
rity multi-mission school ships, including insurance, maintenance,
repair, and equipment costs.
98
The Committee continues to direct MARAD to conduct vigorous
oversight of the vessel construction manager, as well as the ship-
yard, to ensure the NSMVs are delivered on budget and on time.
MARAD is directed to continue to provide briefings to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of the
NSMV program on a quarterly basis, including detailed reporting
on the shore-side infrastructure improvements needed at SMAs to
ensure successful berthing and operation of the NSMVs and 5-year
cost projections for the overall NSMV program. MARAD should
provide immediate notification of any risks to the construction
schedule or cost.
Consistent with previous fiscal years, shore-side infrastructure
shall only include NSMV-specific improvements required by
MARAD to safely moor the vessels and other improvements that
are necessary for SMAs to receive the NSMVs. Specifically, shore-
side infrastructure shall include pier construction and upgrades di-
rectly related to the mooring of the vessel, but not general mainte-
nance that would otherwise be necessary absent receiving an
NSMV, and is inclusive of associated utility upgrades directly re-
lated to mooring and operating the vessel, including, but not lim-
ited to, electricity and steam. The Committee directs MARAD to
implement a non-Federal cost share of 20 percent for shore-side in-
frastructure improvements. In the event that there are extenuating
circumstances that an SMA is unable to meet the 20 percent non-
Federal cost-share requirement, MARAD may determine whether a
different non-Federal cost-share requirement is appropriate, nec-
essary, and executable. In addition, the Committee directs MARAD
to sequence the funding distributed to SMAs for shore-side infra-
structure improvements based on the vessel delivery schedule. Fur-
ther, MARAD shall notify the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations prior to obligating any funds for shore-side infra-
structure improvements, and such notification shall include the
amount of funding provided by non-Federal sources for such infra-
structure.
ASSISTANCE TO SMALL SHIPYARDS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,750,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 30,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
As authorized under section 54101 of title 46, United States
Code, the assistance to small shipyards program provides assist-
ance in the form of grants, loans, and loan guarantees to small
shipyards for capital improvements and training programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $30,000,000 for assist-
ance to small shipyards. This level of funding is $21,250,000 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Funding for this program
is intended to help small shipyards improve the efficiency of their
operations by providing funding for equipment and other facility
upgrades. The funding recommended by the Committee will help
improve the competitiveness of our Nation’s small shipyards, as
99
well as support workforce training and apprenticeships in commu-
nities dependent upon maritime transportation.
SHIP DISPOSAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The ship disposal account provides resources to dispose of obso-
lete merchant type vessels that are 150,000 gross tons or more and
no longer useful for defense or aid missions. The goals of the ship
disposal program are to remove vessels that present the highest or
most immediate risk to the environment and provide disposal alter-
natives and necessary funding to ensure that obsolete vessels are
disposed faster than vessels are added to the MARAD fleet.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $6,000,000 for
MARAD’s ship disposal program. This amount is equal to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.
MARITIME GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM [TITLE XI]
(INCLUDING RESCISSION)
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $53,586,000
Committee recommendation1 ............................................................... 3,940,000
1Includes $3,940,000 for administrative expenses and a rescission of $25,000,000 from unobli-
gated balances.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The maritime guaranteed loan program was established pursu-
ant to title XI of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (Public Law 74–
835), as amended. The program provides for a full faith and credit
guarantee by the U.S. Government of debt obligations issued by: (1)
U.S. or foreign shipowners for the purposes of financing or refi-
nancing either U.S. flag vessels or eligible export vessels con-
structed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in U.S. shipyards; and (2)
U.S. shipyards, for the purpose of financing advanced shipbuilding
technology of privately owned general shipyard facilities located in
the United States. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990
(Public Law 101–508), appropriations to cover the estimated costs
of a project must be obtained prior to the issuance of any approvals
for title XI financing.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee provides an appropriation of $3,940,000 for ad-
ministrative expenses of the maritime guaranteed loan title XI pro-
gram, which is $940,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Of the unobligated balances for title XI loan guarantee subsidy,
$25,000,000 are rescinded, and sufficient balances remain to pro-
vide loan guarantees to the six applicants currently in process.

level. Of the total amount provided, $21,482,000 is for CDS, and
the Committee directs MARAD to provide funding for the projects
listed in the table at the end of this report in corresponding
amounts. MARAD should strive to distribute PIDP funding to the
various regions of the United States.
Set Asides.—The Committee directs MARAD to set aside 25 per-
cent of the funds for small inland river and coastal ports and ter-
minals, as required by 46 U.S.C. 54301. The recommendation di-
rects MARAD to allow Federal cost shares above 80 percent for
projects in rural areas, as permitted by 46 U.S.C. 54301.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION–MARITIME ADMINISTRATION

Section 84:
Section 170 authorizes MARAD to furnish utilities and services
and to make necessary repairs in connection with any lease, con-
tract, or occupancy involving Government property under control of
MARAD and allows payments received to be credited to the Treas-
ury and to remain available until expended.
PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
[PHMSA] was established within the Department of Transpor-
tation on November 30, 2004, pursuant to the Norman Y. Mineta
Research and Special Programs Improvement Act (Public Law 108–
426). PHMSA is responsible for the Department’s pipeline safety
program as well as oversight of hazardous materials transportation
safety operations. The agency is dedicated to safety, including the
elimination of transportation related deaths and injuries associated
with hazardous materials and pipeline transportation, and to pro-
moting transportation solutions, which enhance communities and
protect the environment. The following table summarizes the Com-
mittee’s recommendations:

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $31,681,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 31,312,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for program support costs for
PHMSA, including policy development, civil rights, management,
administration, and other agency-wide expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $31,312,000 for this account, of
which not less than $2,000,000 shall be for pipeline safety informa-
tion grants to communities and $2,500,000 shall be for emergency
response grants. The Committee’s recommendation is $369,000 less
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Staffing.—According to the DOT, PHMSA will experience a sig-
nificant workforce reduction from employees choosing to take the
DRP offer. The committee directs PHMSA to provide a report on
the number and types of positions lost through the DRP within
each office included in the congressional budget justification and
identify if the position is based in headquarters or the field. The
report shall include an analysis of the impact of these staffing re-
ductions on PHMSA’s ability to implement programs, grants, and
all statutory responsibilities.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $74,556,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 73,660,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
PHMSA oversees the safety of more than one million hazardous
materials shipments daily within the United States, using risk
management principles and security threat assessments in order to
fully review and reduce the risks inherent in hazardous materials
transportation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $73,660,000 for
hazardous materials safety, which is $896,000 less than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. The Committee recommendation includes
$1,000,000 for the assistance for local emergency response training
[ALERT] grants. The Committee directs PHMSA to prioritize
ALERT grants for training in rural areas. The Committee rec-
ommendation also includes $4,000,000 for community safety
grants.
102
East Palestine, Ohio.—The NTSB’s investigation of the East Pal-
estine derailment resulted in five safety recommendations for
PHMSA, which the agency made initial responses to in October

Section 85:
2024. First, the NTSB found that the vulnerability of tank car plac-
ards to fire exposure resulted in illegible placards and hampered
emergency responders’ efforts to identify hazards. The Committee
directs PHMSA to work with the authorizing committees of juris-
diction in Congress to require placards to be able to survive fires
and accidents and remain legible during emergencies long enough
to fulfill their functions as described in the emergency response
guidebook.
The NTSB also found that the post-derailment fire likely began
because of hazardous materials released from a punctured DOT–
111 tank car. It has been over 10 years since the Lac-Megantic rail
accident in 2013, which destroyed an entire town near the Maine
border, and which led to Congress mandating the gradual phase
out of DOT–111s. However, the phase out will not be completed
until 2029, nearly 16 years after the Lac-Megantic rail accident.
The Committee directs PHMSA to work with the relevant author-
izing committees to accelerate the phase-out of DOT–111 tank cars.
Further, the NTSB’s East Palestine investigation found the need
to revise the definition of a ‘‘high-hazard flammable train.’’ While
this definition is set in statute, the DOT’s most recent Significant
Rulemaking Report includes an initiated rulemaking by PHMSA,
RIN 2137–AF65, related to applying regulatory requirements and
operational controls on a larger set of newly designated high-haz-
ard train makeups. PHMSA is directed to provide a status update
on RIN 2137–AF65 to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations within 180 days of enactment of this act. In addition, the
Committee directs PHMSA to work with the relevant authorizing
committees to revise the definition of high-hazard flammable train.
Finally, the NTSB recommended that PHMSA distribute the
FRA’s most current guidance on the vent and burn methods to
emergency response agencies, and the Committee directs PHMSA
to do so expeditiously.
PIPELINE SAFETY
(PIPELINE SAFETY FUND)
(OIL SPILL LIABILITY TRUST FUND)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $218,186,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 218,186,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Pipeline Safety [OPS] promotes the safe, reliable,
and sound transportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids
through the Nation’s more than 2.6 million miles of privately-
owned and operated pipeline.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $218,186,000 for the
OPS. The amount is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of
103
this amount, $12,500,000 is for research and development and up
to $88,558,000 is for grants.
Liquefied Natural Gas [LNG] COE.—The Committee appreciates
PHMSA’s efforts to locate and begin staffing the national COE for
LNG Safety that was authorized, nearly 5 years ago, under section
111 of the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhanc-
ing Safety Act of 2020 [PIPES] Act. The Committee provides
PHMSA no less than $5,000,000 to continue its work to establish
the national COE for LNG Safety in accordance with the criteria
outlined in the PIPES Act.
Hydrogen Pipeline Leak Detection and Monitoring.—With the sig-
nificant Federal investment and policies to incentivize the develop-
ment of hydrogen pipelines, it is important for PHMSA to have ap-
propriate hydrogen gas pipeline-specific provisions in regulations to
ensure such pipelines operate safely and to protect the environ-
ment (as required under 49 U.S.C. 60102(b)). The Committee di-
rects PHMSA to consider initiating a rulemaking that would en-
sure that hydrogen infrastructure is designed or modified to oper-
ate safely and to protect the environment, with minimal leaks, and
by leveraging all possible learning from methane leak detection,
monitoring, and prevention Federal programs and efforts.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS GRANTS
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
(EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FUND)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $46,825,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 46,825,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of
1990 (Public Law 101–615) requires PHMSA to: (1) develop and im-
plement a reimbursable emergency preparedness grant program;
(2) monitor public sector emergency response training and plan-
ning, and provide technical assistance to States, political subdivi-
sions, and Indian Tribes; and (3) develop and periodically update
a mandatory training curriculum for emergency responders.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $46,825,000 for emergency pre-
paredness grants. The recommendation continues to provide
PHMSA the authority to use prior year carryover and recaptures
for the development of Web-based, off-the-shelf training materials
that can be used by emergency responders across the country. The
Committee encourages PHMSA to continue to enhance its training
curriculum for local emergency responders, including response ac-
tivities for crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids trans-
ported by rail. The Committee also encourages PHMSA to train
public sector emergency response personnel in communities on or
near rail lines, which transport a significant volume of high-risk
energy commodities or toxic inhalation hazards.
The Committee directs PHMSA to include recommendations for
the development of courses necessary for public sector employees to
104
be able to respond safely and efficiently to an accident or incident
involving the transportation of hazardous material and to provide
such training for virtual learning and any courses for which the
Secretary has recommended adaptation to provide virtual options,
subject to the condition that the Secretary ensures that the virtual
options recommended will provide an equivalent level of training as
in-person courses.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $116,452,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 116,452,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Inspector General Act of 1978 (Public Law 95–452) estab-
lished the Office of Inspector General as an independent, objective
organization with a mission to: conduct and supervise audits and
investigations relating to the programs and operations of the De-
partment; provide leadership and recommend policies designed to
promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administra-
tion of programs and operations; prevent and detect fraud, waste,
and abuse; and keep the Secretary and the Congress informed re-
garding problems and deficiencies.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation provides $116,452,000 for the
activities of the Office of Inspector General, which is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Independent Authorities.—The Office of Inspector General relies
on special agents, law enforcement personnel, auditors, and inves-
tigators to save money for the taxpayer and find waste, fraud, and
abuse. The Committee reminds the Office of Inspector General that
all Inspector Generals have complete authority over all staffing de-
cisions in their office, as provided under section 406 of title 5,
United States Code. Given the significant reduction of staff in the
Office of Inspector General, the Committee directs the Office of In-
spector General to increase hiring to the levels sustainable by the
funds made available in this act.
Audit Reports.—The Office of Inspector General is directed to
continue to provide copies of all audit reports to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations as soon as they are issued,
and to continue to make such Committees aware immediately of
any review that recommends cancellation of, or modifications to,
any major acquisition project or grant, or significant budgetary sav-
ings. The Office of Inspector General is also directed to withhold
from public distribution for a period of 15 days any final audit or
investigative report which was requested by the House or Senate
Committees on Appropriations.

TITLE II
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
HUD was established by the Housing and Urban Development
Act (Public Law 89–174), effective November 9, 1965. This Depart-
ment is the principal Federal agency responsible for programs con-
cerned with the Nation’s housing needs, fair housing opportunities,
and improving and developing communities.
Reorganizations and Staffing.—As part of the fiscal year 2025
operating plan, the Department did not provide organizational
charts that differed from the organizational charts transmitted to
the Committee on May 30, 2024, nor has the Department requested
any reorganizations for fiscal years 2025 or 2026. Thus, the Com-
mittee directs HUD to continue to use the organizational charts
transmitted to the Committee on May 30, 2024 as the baseline for
any reorganization requests pursuant to section 405 of this act. Ad-
ditionally, the Committee directs HUD to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of
enactment of this act on the number of positions that have been
reduced within each office named in such organizational charts, as
compared to the number of full-time personnel on board at the end
of calendar year 2024. The report shall include an analysis of the
impact of these staffing reductions on the agency’s ability to imple-
ment the HUD programs and all other statutory responsibilities.
Child Care.—The Committee recognizes that both housing and
child care present significant challenges for families, businesses,
and the economy. The Department is directed to work with afford-
able housing and child care stakeholders to support innovative ap-
proaches that coordinate housing and child care support to address
both needs and is encouraged to prioritize applications for Depart-
ment funding that show promise in those efforts, where appro-
priate.
Insurance Costs.—The Committee directs the Secretary of HUD
to complete a report on the current state of the property insurance
market with an emphasis on affordable housing properties that are
rent-restricted or rent-assisted. This should include, but not be lim-
ited to, properties developed through the use of the low-income
housing tax credit and other applicable State-level affordable hous-
ing tax credits, public housing that is not self-insured, or properties
participating in any Federal housing assistance program. The Sec-
retary should provide an analysis on the potential impact that in-
creasing insurance premiums may have on: (1) the supply of new
affordable housing, and (2) the financial sustainment of existing af-
fordable housing. The Secretary should also assess the implications
of rising insurance costs on program operations, such as housing
(106)
107
authorities’ levels of reserves, and conduct outreach to property
owners to solicit qualitative feedback on how rising insurance costs
affect their ability to effectively meet the goal of providing afford-
able housing. The Secretary should also, to the extent possible, pro-
vide an analysis and prediction on the potential effects of increased
insurance premiums on Federal section 8 housing choice voucher
and project-based rental assistance housing, including properties
that have undergone or are undergoing conversion through the
rental assistance demonstration [RAD]. In carrying out this effort,
the Secretary should coordinate with state insurance commis-
sioners and other Federal agencies, as needed, to complete the re-
port within 2 years of the date of enactment of this act, and update
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status
of the report every 6 months.
Environmental Review.—The Committee directs the Department
to work across its program offices, the White House Council on En-
vironmental Quality, the Advisory Council on Historic Preserva-
tion, and other stakeholders to improve processes for environ-
mental reviews with the goal of lowering the cost of reviews,
streamlining review procedures, reducing duplication, and accel-
erating new housing construction. As part of this effort, the Depart-
ment is encouraged to consider options for streamlining environ-
mental reviews for office-to-residential conversions, including the
feasibility of a categorical exclusion within defined parameters, tar-
geted technical assistance, and new toolkits, and is directed to brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on these ef-
forts within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Rent Reporting.—As many as 64 million Americans have limited
or no credit history, which impacts their ability to purchase a first
home, what apartments they can rent, and where they work. Mul-
tiple studies have demonstrated that rent reporting can lead to in-
creases in credit scores and scorability. The Committee encourages
the Department to support and promote training and technical as-
sistance opportunities and resources, either through HUD or pro-
vided by other Federal, State, and non-profit partners, for public
housing authorities, Tribally designated housing entities, and pri-
vate owners of affordable housing on how to move forward with
rent reporting. The Committee encourages the Department, to the
greatest extent possible, to partner with one or more organizations
specialized in rent reporting and make educational or training ma-
terials publicly available on the HUD website.
Buy America.—The Committee appreciates the Department’s ac-
tions to implement Build America, Buy America [BABA] require-
ments to ensure Federal housing funds are supporting American
industry and jobs. The Committee directs the Department to en-
sure BABA waiver requests can be appropriately evaluated and
processed in a timely and transparent manner, to brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its plans to do so
within 90 days of enactment of this act, and to report on processing
times for BABA waiver requests within 180 days of enactment of
this act.
GAO Priority Recommendations.—As of May 2025, HUD had 100
open GAO recommendations, of which 9 are considered priority rec-
ommendations in areas including, but not limited to, disaster recov-
108
ery, homelessness, cybersecurity, and information technology. The
Committee notes that HUD has substantially improved its imple-
mentation rate of GAO recommendations since 2021, and the Com-
mittee urges the Department to build on this progress. The Com-
mittee directs HUD to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this act on all
priority recommendations, the steps taken in fiscal year 2025 to
implement those recommendations, and what additional actions
will be undertaken in fiscal year 2026 to address outstanding rec-
ommendations.
Rural Areas.—The Committee urges the Department to enhance
its efforts to provide decent, affordable housing and to promote eco-
nomic development for Americans living in rural areas. When de-
signing programs and making funding decisions, the Secretary
shall take into consideration the unique conditions, challenges, and
scale of rural areas.
Appropriations Attorneys.—For fiscal year 2026, the Committee
continues to fund appropriations attorneys in the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer [OCFO], directs HUD to refer all appropria-
tions law issues to such attorneys within the OCFO, and urges the
Department to ensure the office has adequate personnel and non-
personnel resources to fulfill their responsibilities, including train-
ing HUD staff in funds control procedures and directives, as re-
quired by section 214 of this act.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee recognizes that the use of
artificial intelligence across the housing industry presents benefits
as well as risks. Within 270 days of enactment of this act, the Sec-
retary shall provide a report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations, the House Committee on Financial Services,
and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
on the extent to which the housing industry, HUD recipients and
partners, including landlords, public housing authorities, lenders,
and property management companies, are using artificial intel-
ligence technologies, such as dynamic price-setting and biometric
technologies, and an assessment of HUD’s current capacity and
subject matter expertise to monitor and incorporate emerging
trends in this field into management and oversight of its programs.
Working Capital Fund.—The Committee recommendation does
not include authority for a WCF in fiscal year 2026. The Com-
mittee notes that since the establishment of the WCF in fiscal year
2016, the Department has failed to fully utilize the authorities pro-
vided. The Committee is concerned that as an agency, the Depart-
ment may be too small to take full advantage of a WCF. Rather
than a nimble and responsive mechanism, the WCF has functioned
as a series of fixed price contracts, which do not incentivize cost-
conscious behavior. The Committee believes that winding down the
WCF now will enable the Department to take advantage of greater
efficiencies through participation in the General Services Adminis-
tration’s shared acquisition services and the economies of scale so-
lutions such government-wide participation offers.
EXECUTIVE OFFICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $19,400,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 17,500,000
109
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Executive Offices account provides the salaries and expenses
funding to support the Department’s senior leadership and other
key functions, including the immediate offices of the Secretary,
Deputy Secretary, Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations,
Public Affairs, Adjudicatory Services, the Center for Faith, and the
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $17,500,000 for
this account, which is $1,900,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
Violence Against Women Act.—For several years, the Committee
has directed HUD to address shortcomings in the Department’s im-
plementation and oversight of the housing protection requirements
for survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault in HUD-as-
sisted properties. The Department is directed to brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than December
31, 2025 on agency progress on: (1) ensuring program offices pro-
vide support to covered housing providers on emergency transfers,
including through written instructions, notices, and frequently
asked questions, (2) collecting data on the use and timeliness of
emergency transfers established by the Violence Against Women
Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–4), (3) implementing
the 2022 reauthorization (division W of Public Law 117–103), and
(4) closing all open recommendations in the GAO–24–106481 report
that was conducted at the direction of this Committee, including
target timeframes for major milestones and how the Department
intends to resource that action plan. The Committee recommends
an appropriation of not less than $500,000 for the Office of Gender-
Based Violence Prevention within the Office of the Deputy Sec-
retary to carry out the statutorily-mandated duties under 34 U.S.C.

Section 102:
12493.
Office of Disaster Management.—In fiscal year 2022, Congress
approved HUD’s request to create an Office of Disaster Manage-
ment within the Office of the Deputy Secretary to improve coordi-
nation of disaster-related activities across HUD and to better sup-
port communities and households impacted by major disasters. The
Committee recommends not less than $1,200,000 for its operations
in fiscal year 2026.
Affordable Housing Program Alignment.—As noted in the front
matter of this report, the Committee remains committed to reduc-
ing duplicative inspections and other conflicts and fragmentation
between Federal programs that are commonly layered together to
build affordable housing. Making continued progress on these ef-
forts requires consistent attention, strategic prioritization and lead-
ership. The Committee directs HUD to brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this
act on the Department’s top priority alignment actions for fiscal
years 2026 and 2027, target milestones, and how the Department
intends to track progress and facilitate resolution of any inter-
agency disputes that may arise.
110
Whistleblower Protections.—The Office of Inspector General iden-
tified in the ‘‘Management Alert: HUD Should Take Additional
Steps to Protect Contractor Employees Who Disclose Wrongdoing
[2023–IG–0002]’’ a troubling gap in HUD contracts when it found
that several aggrieved employees of contractors who receive funds
from HUD lacked whistleblower protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712.
These critical protections have not been added to project-based
rental assistance housing assistance payment contracts and con-
tracts in other programs that have yet to undergo a major modi-
fication following the codification of whistleblower protections in 41
U.S.C. 4712 in 2013. Section 237 of the bill addresses this gap and
applies these whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections to all
contracts, subcontracts, grants, subgrant, and personal service con-
tracts.

and expenses of the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer,
the Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity, the
Office of Field Policy and Management, the Office of the Chief
Human Capital Officer, the Office of Administration, and the Office
of the Chief Information Officer.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $590,000,000 for
this account, which is $96,400,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Funds are made available as follows:
Committee
recommendation
Office of the Chief Financial Officer ............................................................................................................... $89,000,000
Office of the General Counsel ......................................................................................................................... 103,000,000
Office of Administration................................................................................................................................... 224,000,000
Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer ..................................................................................................... 47,000,000
Office of the Chief Procurement Officer.......................................................................................................... 26,000,000
Office of Field Policy and Management .......................................................................................................... 46,000,000
Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity ................................................................................. 3,000,000
Office of the Chief Information Officer ........................................................................................................... 52,000,000
Office of the Chief Financial Officer [OCFO].—The Committee
recommendation includes sufficient funding to support the work-
load associated with BABA compliance and providing timely re-
sponses to BABA waiver requests.
The Committee recommendation is supportive of the Depart-
ment’s goals to modernize the management of its over 60 grant pro-
grams and their related systems, as well as the payment integrity
of its rental assistance programs, which is a long-standing weak-
ness identified by both HUD’s Inspector General and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office. The Committee is concerned that there
may be insufficient time to fully map out and institutionalize an
action plan to accomplish these objectives during this Administra-
111
tion. Therefore, the Committee urges the Chief Financial Officer to
swiftly work towards both the development of an action plan as
well as demonstrate feasibility and utility with a successful ‘‘proof
of concept’’, as planned in fiscal year 2025. Not more than
$10,000,000 within the amounts available for the OCFO should be
used for the program payments integrity project, and the Com-
mittee directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act
on the planned use of these funds in fiscal year 2026, the project
management structure, and the timeline for full implementation of
the project.
Weaver Building.—In the 2024 interim report to Congress, the
Public Building Reform Board reported that ‘‘taxpayers overspend
to house agencies, while Federal employees often work in sub-
standard office conditions that negatively impact mission outcomes,
employee recruitment and retention, and sustainability goals.’’ The
Committee has supported the Department’s efforts to improve of-
fice conditions for its employees, consolidate its footprint and reas-
sess its space requirements and assets, while stressing the impor-
tance of transparency on any decision as significant and costly as
the moving from HUD’s headquarters building, as well as the need
for stakeholder input to minimize disruption on the operation of
HUD and any other agencies impacted by this decision. The Com-
mittee notes that HUD has recently announced its intention to
move out of its headquarters building, and that a budget and
timeline for such a move is still being developed. As such, the De-
partment has not requested any funding in fiscal year 2026 to fa-
cilitate a transition out of the current headquarters space, and the
Committee recommendation does not include any funding for that
purpose at this time. The Committee directs the Department to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
30 days of enactment of this act on: (1) the program of require-
ments developed for the HUD headquarters, (2) the total budget for
the move, build-out, and maintenance of the new headquarters
space, with agency responsibilities and sources of funding delin-
eated between HUD and the General Services Administration, (3)
the detailed timeline for the proposed move, and (4) any analysis
of alternative buildings considered this year.

The Program Offices account funds the salaries and expenses of
six program offices, including the Offices of Public and Indian
Housing, Community Planning and Development, Housing, Policy
Development and Research, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity,
and Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.
112
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $903,200,000 for this account, which
is $193,964,130 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Funds
are made available as follows:
Amount
Office of Public and Indian Housing............................................................................................................... $250,000,000
Office of Community Planning and Development ........................................................................................... 142,000,000
Office of Housing ............................................................................................................................................. 395,000,000
Office of Policy Development and Research.................................................................................................... 34,000,000
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity................................................................................................ 72,000,000
Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes ........................................................................................ 10,200,000
Maintaining Mission Critical Activities.—With the significant re-
duction in staffing levels in fiscal year 2025, the Committee is con-
cerned about the potential for workforce, knowledge, and skills
gaps across HUD that would need to be addressed to ensure the
Department can carry out its most critical functions. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to carry out all statutorily required
activities and to expeditiously address any knowledge and staffing
gaps the Department may encounter. The Committee directs the
Department, when undertaking any additional staffing increases,
to prioritize staffing needs related to the health and safety of HUD-
assisted residents and the timely approval and disbursement of
funds to grantees. The Committee directs HUD to inform the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on how it is im-
plementing this direction as part of the semiannual staffing reports
required under section 407 of this act.
Grant Execution.—In order to bring greater transparency to the
grant execution process, the Committee directs the Department to
provide the status of: (1) all awarded but not obligated competitive
and disaster-related grants; and (2) all community project funding/
congressionally directed spending projects. The Department shall
continue to provide data on community project funding/congres-
sional directed spending projects in the manner it is currently pro-
vided, and for all other programs, provide a list of all such awards
by program, fiscal year, and grantee, and include the name of the
project, the state of the project location, the original amount of the
award, and the amount obligated to date. The Department shall
provide the data to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 120 days after the enactment of this act
and biannually after the first submission of such data.
Real Estate Assessment Center [REAC].—One of the Depart-
ment’s most fundamental responsibilities is ensuring that its as-
sisted properties are decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. The
Committee is concerned that Department may not have the nec-
essary inspection capacity, quality controls, organizational manage-
ment structures, or policies and procedures that are needed to en-
sure the entire HUD portfolio receives high-quality inspections on
time and that all deficiencies are identified and resolved in a time-
ly manner. The Committee directs HUD to: (1) ensure adequate
staff are allocated to REAC to support the implementation of the
National standards for the physical inspection of real estate
[NSPIRE] and oversee the property inspection needs of the entire
HUD portfolio, (2) support strategic coordination within HUD and
113
across other Federal agencies and external stakeholders to reduce
duplicative physical inspections, as directed in Senate Report 118–
70, and (3) brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions within 30 days of enactment of this act and quarterly there-
after on: (a) current property inspection capacity, (b) how REAC in-
tends to put property inspections back on schedule, including re-
lated timelines, (c) current mechanisms in place to support quality
assurance and how issues of significant discrepancies between in-
spection entities are addressed (e.g., multiple reports of properties
receiving excellent scores from HUD-funded inspections that were
subsequently condemned by local officials or had contracts termi-
nated by HUD), and (d) how the Department will close all open rec-
ommendations in the HUD Office of Inspector General reports
2024–CH–0001 and 2023–CH–0004, and ensure priority rec-
ommendations in report 2023–CH–0004 remain closed. The Com-
mittee also directs HUD to provide a report to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of
this act that includes: (1) an assessment of whether current man-
agement, communication, and decision-making protocols adequately
reflect that most housing units inspected by REAC are part of the
multifamily housing, not public housing, portfolio, and whether
HUD’s mission would be better served by REAC being outside of
the Office of Public and Indian Housing organizational structure,
including reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary, and (2) an as-
sessment of REAC’s top challenges and whether increasing internal
staffing capacity would more cost effectively address those chal-
lenges.
Lead Safe Housing and Other Health Hazards.—The Committee
recognizes there is no cure for lead poisoning, and childhood lead
poisoning can lead to lifelong medical expenses, increased criminal
activity, and lost productivity over the long-term. Multiple offices,
including the Office of Public and Indian Housing (particularly the
Real Estate Assessment Center and Office of Field Operations), Of-
fice of Housing, and Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy
Homes (particularly the Program and Regulatory Support Division)
all play critical roles in preventing childhood lead poisoning and
addressing housing-related health hazards. The Committee believes
that these offices include positions necessary for public safety, and
strongly encourages the Department to sufficiently staff these pub-
lic safety functions. The Committee directs the HUD to report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 60
days of enactment of this act detailing how the Office of Public and
Indian Housing, Office of Housing, and Office of Lead Hazard Con-
trol and Healthy Homes are working together to address all rec-
ommendations in the HUD Office of Inspector General reports
2021–OE–0011b and 2025–OE–0801 regarding the improvements
needed to monitoring elevated blood lead levels in HUD-assisted
housing, the steps taken to date to address the recommendations,
what additional actions will be undertaken in fiscal year 2026 to
address outstanding recommendations, and an assessment of
HUD’s current capacity and key staffing needs to carry out that
work.
Office of Housing.—The Committee directs the Office of Housing
to provide a briefing to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
114
propriations within 15 days of enactment of this act on the status
of all funds provided under section 30002 of Public Law 117–169,
any challenges that exist in processing disbursements, and if
amounts provided in this act will be needed to address those chal-
lenges and support funding execution.

Section 103:
Section 240 of the bill enables the Department to provide direct
support to small properties and owners converting assistance under
RAD who lack the capacity needed to meet due diligence and un-
derwriting requirements, including properties assisted under the

Section 104:
section 202 and section 8 moderate rehabilitation and McKinney-
Vento single room occupancy programs. The Committee directs the
Department to use not more than $2,000,000 for this purpose
through existing cooperative agreements with participating admin-
istrative entities until further data is available on the scope of de-
mand among such properties.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $383,050,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 365,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The information technology fund finances the IT systems that
support departmental programs and operations, including FHA
mortgage insurance, housing assistance and grant programs, as
well as core financial and general operations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $365,000,000 for the IT Fund for
fiscal year 2026, which is $18,050,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Consistent with the budget request, the Committee
recommendation does not include any funding for development,
modernization and enhancement [DME], but directs the Depart-
ment to continue to provide necessary information requested by the
Committee to maintain oversight of all ongoing DME efforts and
balances.
IT Fund Reporting and Oversight.—The Committee directs HUD
to continue to include sufficient detail in its congressional justifica-
tions to delineate between funding for operations and maintenance
[O&M] and DME, which as defined by OMB includes planning, and
include plain language summaries of proposed DME projects, total
costs and savings potential, target functionality, estimated
timeline, and mission benefits associated with the requested
amount. The Committee also directs HUD to continue to delineate
funding for O&M and DME by project in its fiscal year 2026 oper-
ating plan.
Quarterly Briefings.—The Committee continues to direct HUD to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on IT
modernization efforts on a quarterly basis. For fiscal year 2026,
such briefings shall address, for each development, modernization,
and enhancement project to be funded from available balances, in-
cluding carryover: (1) results of the prior quarter, including actual
expenditures and major milestones achieved; (2) any variances in
cost, schedule (including procurement), or functionality from the
previously provided project plan, reasons for such variances and es-
115
timated impact on total lifecycle costs; and (3) risks and mitigation
strategies associated with ongoing work.
Active Partners Performance System [APPS].—APPS supports the
Department in its responsibility to review the previous participa-
tion of property owners in order to make decisions about future
participation. The Office of Inspector General Report 2023–KC–
0002 found that HUD lacked an automated process for flagging a
property once it received a second consecutive REAC score below

Section 105:
60. The Committee appreciates that the Office of Multifamily Hous-
ing has automated such flags within APPS, but remains concerned
that all related entities may not be identified within the system.
The Committee encourages the Department to address this tech-
nical capability gap expeditiously, and directs the Department to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment of this act on whether such changes require
a system enhancement and the extent to which such needs can be
addressed through business process changes and data manage-
ment.
PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING
TENANT–BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $36,041,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 37,354,709,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for the section 8 tenant-based
[voucher] program, one of the principal appropriations for Federal
housing assistance, serving approximately 2.3 million families.
Under this program, eligible low-income individuals and families
pay 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent, and the Federal
Government is responsible for the remainder of the rent, up to the
fair market rent or some other payment standard. This account
also provides funding for tenant protection vouchers for the re-
placement of units lost from the assisted housing inventory, admin-
istrative fees for public housing authorities [PHAs], mainstream
vouchers, HUD–Veterans Affairs supportive housing [HUD–VASH],
and other incremental vouchers for vulnerable populations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $37,354,709,000 for fiscal year 2026,
including $4,000,000,000 as an advance appropriation to be made
available on October 1, 2026. This amount is $1,313,709,000 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Contract Renewals.—The Committee recommends
$33,974,000,000 for the renewal costs of section 8 vouchers. The
total cost of renewals, based on HUD-provided estimates, are par-
tially offset by programmatic reserves. The Committee rec-
ommendation prohibits HUD from taking an offset from any PHA
if doing so is expected to put that PHA into shortfall in 2026. For
amounts subject to single fund budget authority for PHAs partici-
pating in the moving to work demonstration, the Committee directs
the Department to execute the offset in a manner that is consistent
with the estimates transmitted to the Committee, which protects 4
116
months of voucher and public housing operating expenses. To en-
sure this authority is managed responsibly and does not negatively
impact construction efforts or PHA relationships with development
partners, the Committee directs HUD to also protect amounts com-
mitted to capital improvement, development, or other repositioning
activities that are scheduled to close within 1 year and to establish
an appeals process of not less than 60 days.
Emergency Housing Vouchers [EHVs].—The EHVs funded in sec-
tion 3202(b) of Public Law 117–2 provided housing support to fami-
lies and individuals who were homeless, at-risk of homelessness or
fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking
or human trafficking at the height of the COVID–19 pandemic. The
Committee does not want the individuals assisted by the program
to face eviction or return to homelessness, but must balance this
goal against the long-term sustainability of this account. The Com-
mittee does not provide any additional funds for the EHV program.
Instead, the Committee urges the Department and PHAs to take
all necessary actions to extend the use of the remaining balances
as long as possible, including through: (1) the expeditious use of
the waiver authorities provided in this act to maximize the number
of EHVs that can be transitioned into the regular voucher program
through normal turnover and attrition in that program before the
end of calendar year 2026, (2) the recapture and reallocation of un-
used EHV services fees and housing assistance payments, and (3)
providing timely responses and direct technical assistance to PHAs
to prevent and avoid displacement of EHV tenants. The Committee
directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on a quarterly basis on how HUD is carrying out
this direction, expenditure rates of EHV funding, and PHA
progress in transitioning EHVs residents to the regular voucher
program. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to
maintain the EHV dashboard on its website.
Mainstream Renewals.—The recommendation includes
$809,866,000 for section 811 mainstream vouchers within the total
amount provided for renewals and administrative fees. Additional
amounts set-aside for renewal adjustments shall also be provided
for costs associated with mainstream vouchers. Funding lines have
been consolidated in order to reduce the administrative burden on
HUD and PHAs. However, section 811 vouchers must continue to
serve non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover. The
Committee directs HUD to continue to provide timely updates on
the voucher dashboard on the number of mainstream vouchers allo-
cated and leased to ensure continued transparency.
Tenant Protection Vouchers [TPVs].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $429,709,000 for new tenant protection
vouchers, $92,709,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This funding level is equal to HUD’s current estimates for all TPV
needs in fiscal year 2026 for planned repositioning projects and to
help HUD-assisted families relocate and avoid hardship.
Administrative Fees.—The Committee recommends
$2,906,000,000 for administrative fees, $135,065,000 more than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee notes that these
funds are critical to the execution and success of the voucher pro-
gram, supporting a diverse range of activities and critical functions
117
such as: property inspections; case management, including tenant
screening, income recertification, and emergency transfers; landlord
outreach; the issuance of new vouchers upon program turnover;
and assistance for tenants seeking housing. The Committee con-
tinues to direct the Department to brief the House and Senate
Committee on Appropriations not less than annually on the utiliza-
tion of administrative fees for eligible expenses to improve leasing,
such as security deposit assistance and landlord recruitment and
incentive payments.
HUD–VASH.—The Committee recommendation includes
$15,000,000 to expand the HUD–VASH program, of which up to
$10,000,000 may be used for other eligible expenses defined by no-
tice to facilitate leasing, such as security deposit assistance and
other costs related to retention and support of participating own-
ers. Over the past year, at the direction of this Committee, HUD
and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] have taken several
actions to improve the HUD–VASH voucher utilization. This in-
cludes publishing guidance to allow a PHA to be a designated serv-
ice provider; allowing third party providers to provide case manage-
ment services through contracts and other collaborative case man-
agement models, particularly in instances where the VA is insuffi-
ciently staffed; making multiple rounds of HUD–VASH and addi-
tional administrative fees available; and supporting HUD–VASH
boot camps across the country to bring PHAs and VA medical cen-
ter staff together to work through the challenges they face on the
ground. The Committee directs HUD, in coordination with the VA,
to consider conducting additional HUD–VASH boot camps, to con-
tinue to provide targeted technical assistance based on action plans
and learning from the HUD–VASH boot camps, and to provide a
status update to the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions, within 90 days of enactment of this act, regarding the extent
to which communities have deployed alternative methods to expand
HUD–VASH case management capacity.
Veteran Disability Income.—The Committee urges HUD to con-
tinue the policy of excluding VA disability compensation when de-
termining initial eligibility for the HUD–VASH program, as incor-
porated in the Federal Register Notice ‘‘Section 8 Housing Choice
Vouchers: Revised Implementation of the HUD–Veterans Affairs
Supportive Housing Program,’’ published on August 13, 2024. The
Committee directs HUD, in consultation with the VA, to provide to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations the following
information within 180 days of enactment of this act: (1) the num-
ber of veterans who receive rental assistance under any program
administered by HUD; (2) the number HUD-assisted veterans who
also receive VA disability compensation; (3) an estimate of the
number of veterans who would be newly eligible for HUD rental as-
sistance if HUD did not include VA disability compensation as in-
come when determining initial eligibility for rental assistance; (4)
an estimate of the number or proportion of veterans who receive
VA disability compensation who live in high-cost areas and likely
face severe housing cost burden; and (5) an estimated cost of ex-
cluding all VA disability compensation from its definition of income
while, at minimum, preserving all existing rental subsidies to the
118
veteran and non-veteran households currently served by HUD rent-
al assistance programs.
Tribal HUD–VASH.—The Committee includes $10,000,000 for
the renewal of rental assistance and associated administrative
costs for Tribal HUD–VASH within the Native American Programs
account to improve alignment with program execution.
Family Unification Program [FUP].—The Committee includes
$30,000,000 for new FUP vouchers. To ensure that vouchers are
available where youth need assistance, the Committee directs the
Department to base the maximum number of vouchers that a PHA
may request in a Federal fiscal year on identified need and refer-
rals. To improve the accessibility of youth FUP vouchers, the Com-
mittee directs HUD in its training materials to encourage PHAs to
affirmatively amend their administrative plans to facilitate re-
questing youth FUP vouchers.
The Committee reminds the Department of the requirement in
Senate Report 118–70 on the FUP voucher request and reallocation
processes.
The Committee directs HUD to consult with PHAs participating
in FUP, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], ex-
perts on child welfare, and other stakeholders regarding any poten-
tial program challenges due to statutory time limits, statutory cri-
teria, policy definitions, or other operational aspects. The Com-
mittee directs HUD to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations and respective authorizing committees within
180 days of enactment of this act on such consultation, and provide
its recommendations: (1) to improve program operations; (2) to as-
sist youth in navigating the housing search process and preventing
returns to homelessness after the subsidized rental assistance sun-
sets; and (3) on how Federal, State, and local stakeholders can best
support participants as they transition from foster care to success-
ful adulthood.
Special Purpose Vouchers.—The Committee understands that
populations served by section 811 mainstream, FUP, and foster
youth initiative vouchers face certain challenges to finding units
available for lease within the normal timeframes of the larger
voucher program. These difficulties increase the risk of these vul-
nerable groups experiencing homelessness and cause these vouch-
ers to be unused. Therefore, the bill continues to permit HUD to
waive or specify alternative requirements for certain waiting list
and timing requirements.
Project-Based Vouchers.—The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s efforts to improve its data on the number and percentage
of vouchers that are, or planned to be, project-based at each PHA
through the planned improvements to the housing information por-
tal [HIP], and directs the Department to expeditiously launch this
functionality. To support the implementation of the final rule re-
lated to project-based voucher changes made in HOTMA, the Com-
mittee directs HUD to provide training and direct technical assist-
ance, as appropriate, to clarify the categories of units excluded
from the 20 percent limitation and 10 percent exception. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations and relevant authorizing committees
within 120 days of enactment of this act on: (1) the analysis of im-
119
pact required under 24 CFR 983.6(a) when a PHA project-bases 50
percent or more of its authorized voucher units; (2) what informa-
tion will be expected regarding local market constraints, needs, and
the PHA’s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to provide tenant-
based assistance to project-base assisted families that wish to
move; and (3) the potential benefits and policy considerations of
modifying existing waivers and amending limitation exceptions to
support rebuilding in disaster-impacted areas, particularly areas
with high rates of homelessness and low vacancy rates.
Homeownership.—The housing choice voucher homeownership
program allows assisted families to use their vouchers to buy a
home. However, PHA staff who administer rental programs may
not have the expertise to facilitate homeownership. The Committee
encourages the Department to support training and education op-
portunities for PHA staff on the mortgage and loan process and
best practices in the housing choice voucher homeownership pro-
gram. To the greatest extent possible, educational or training mate-
rial produced shall be publicly available on the HUD exchange
website.
Housing Choice Voucher Data Dashboard.—The Committee is ap-
preciative of the Department’s work to increase program trans-
parency though the development of the voucher data dashboard
tool. To better inform the identification of program challenges and
where additional policy and research considerations may be bene-
ficial, the Committee directs HUD to add PHA and special purpose
voucher-level data points on voucher success rates and to identify
the amount of reserves that HUD determines are appropriate for
prudent program management. The Committee underscores that
neither additional data point should be inherently viewed as a defi-
ciency of PHAs’ operations. Rather, such data can be instructive for
identifying broader issues such as a lack of available housing stock
at current fair market rents or a lack of landlord participation
where more targeted outreach may be beneficial.
HOUSING CERTIFICATE FUND
(INCLUDING RESCISSIONS)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Until fiscal year 2005, the housing certificate fund provided fund-
ing for both the project-based and tenant-based components of the

Section 106:
section 8 program. Project-based rental assistance and tenant-
based rental assistance are now separately funded accounts. The
housing certificate fund retains balances from previous years’ ap-
propriations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee has included language that will allow unobli-
gated balances from specific accounts to be used to renew or amend
project-based rental assistance contracts.
PUBLIC HOUSING FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,810,784,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,397,326,000
120
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for the payment of operating sub-
sidies, as well as modernization and capital expenses for approxi-
mately 3,000 PHAs (except tribally designated housing entities)
that manage approximately 900,000 public housing units.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $8,397,326,000
for the public housing fund, which is $413,458,000 less than the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level.
Operating Expenses.—The Committee recommendation includes
$4,873,326,000 for allocations to PHAs through the operating fund
formula and $214,000,000 to mitigate the risk of financial short-
falls among PHAs. Combined, these recommended funding levels
provide sufficient resources for every PHA to maintain current
service levels and have 4 months of operating reserves based on
current estimates.
Capital Expenses.—The Committee recommendation includes
$3,200,000,000 for allocations to PHAs through the capital fund
formula, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Receiverships and Troubled, Substandard or Otherwise At-Risk
PHAs.—The Committee recommendation includes $15,000,000 for
the cost of administrative and judicial receiverships and competi-
tive grants for PHAs in receivership, designated troubled or sub-
standard, or otherwise at risk to address capital needs.
The Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of
the enactment of this act, and on an annual basis thereafter no
later than March 1, on the status of PHAs under receivership, and
the factors that informed the receivership, such as physical and fi-
nancial scores, deficiencies with internal controls, and other infor-
mation demonstrating why HUD believes PHAs are unable to effec-
tively oversee their business operations. This report shall also in-
clude an identification of funding resources and technical assist-
ance provided to each PHA for the purpose of transitioning out of
receivership, and future steps HUD will take to address defi-
ciencies in an effort to return the respective PHAs to local control.
The Committee also directs the Department to promptly brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations if there are any
changes to the list of administrative and judicial receiverships.
Emergency and Safety and Security Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $30,000,000 for emergency capital needs, of
which at least $10,000,000 is to be used for safety and security
measures in public housing in order to protect tenants. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to fund eligible safety and secu-
rity projects with a portion of these funds as quickly as possible.
Residential Health Hazards.—The Committee recommendation
includes $65,000,000 to help PHAs address lead-based paint and
other residential health hazards, including mold, carbon monoxide,
radon and fire, in public housing units. The Committee continues
to include prohibitions on the Department’s ability to preclude
funds from being awarded to any PHA that is under the direction
of a monitor or any PHA as ineligible to apply for or receive fund-
121
ing that has a violation or violations of the lead-safe housing or
lead disclosure rules, or from being used to carry out work to settle
an outstanding violation.
Flexibility for Operating Funds for Capital Needs.—The Com-
mittee is committed to addressing the physical needs of troubled
public housing properties and provides a new flexibility to allow
PHAs with one or more properties with low physical inspection
scores to use available operating funds and excess reserves for cap-
ital expenses.
Utility Allowance Schedule.—The Committee urges HUD to up-
date its regulations in 24 CFR 982.517 and 24 CFR 983.301(f), and
related policies and notices, to allow public housing authorities dis-
cretion to utilize project-by-project utility allowances based on more
accurate state or federally verified utility allowance calculators.
The Committee believes that by allowing more efficient and ex-
panded private financing of new and rehabilitated units, this
change will allow Federal affordable housing programs to operate
more cost effectively and lead to the production of additional afford-
able housing units.
Pet Retention.—The Committee is aware of incidences where the
conversion of public housing properties managed by PHAs through
the RAD program may impact pet ownership policies and undercut
resident support for RAD conversions. Existing research affirms
that the human-animal bond provides tangible health benefits.
Having a pet can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and
triglyceride levels, decrease feelings of loneliness, and increase op-
portunities for exercise and socialization. Residents of public hous-
ing are permitted to have one or more common household pets,
subject to reasonable restrictions, but when a project is converted
under RAD, those permissions under the public housing program
may not carryover. The Committee directs the Department to work
to align pet ownership policies for RAD conversion projects.
ASSISTED HOUSING INSPECTIONS AND ASSESSMENTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $50,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 50,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account supports financial, and health and safety inspec-
tions conducted by the REAC for over 2.4 million units of HUD-as-
sisted affordable housing. Prior to fiscal year 2024, funding for
such inspections were provided under the public housing fund and
multifamily housing accounts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $50,000,000 to support
ongoing physical and financial assessment activities performed by
REAC, including implementation of NSPIRE.
Health Hazards.—The implementation of the NSPIRE standards
and supporting systems has enabled a more comprehensive under-
standing of health hazards in HUD-assisted housing. The Secretary
shall provide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations within 120 days of enactment of this act on the cur-
rent state of data collection and analysis of health hazards in
122
HUD-assisted housing, including lead-based paint and service
pipes, as well as the presence, absence, and condition of automated
fire sprinkler systems.
Physical Property Inspection Coordination.—As discussed in the
front matter of this report, the Committee directs the Department
in coordination with other Federal partners to, within existing au-
thorities, take steps to minimize the need for duplicative inspec-
tions. The Committee reminds the Department that Senate Report
118–70 directed HUD to report to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations on the extent to which the physical inspec-
tion alignment program [PIAP] is currently utilized, the number of
duplicative inspections and estimated costs that could eliminated if
the PIAP was maximized, and any identified limitations to pro-
viding this data. The Committee directs HUD to promote use of the
interagency housing alignment portal [IHAP], address data gaps in
IHAP, including the current exclusion of project-based vouchers,
and to ensure adequate staff are allocated to REAC to support stra-
tegic coordination efforts with other Federal agencies and external
stakeholders to reduce duplicative physical inspections.
CHOICE NEIGHBORHOODS INITIATIVE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $75,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The choice neighborhoods initiative provides competitive grants
to transform underserved distressed neighborhoods into sustain-
able, mixed-income neighborhoods with co-location of appropriate
services, schools, public assets, transportation options, and access
to jobs or job training. Choice neighborhoods grants fund the devel-
opment of comprehensive neighborhood transformation plans that
involve broad civic engagement from residents and the community
and the implementation of these plans through affordable housing
activities and supportive services for residents. Grantees include
PHAs, Tribes, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. For-
profit developers may also apply in partnership with another eligi-
ble grantee.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $40,000,000 for
the choice neighborhoods initiative. This amount is $35,000,000
less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee con-
tinues to direct the Secretary to give recipients of prior year plan-
ning grants priority consideration for implementation grant
awards.
SELF–SUFFICIENCY PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $195,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 211,400,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for self-sufficiency programs, in-
cluding the family self-sufficiency [FSS] and the resident opportu-
123
nities and self-sufficiency [ROSS] programs, and the jobs plus ini-
tiative [JPI]. FSS provides funding to PHAs for the salaries of FSS
coordinators to help section 8 and public housing residents achieve
self-sufficiency and economic independence. ROSS provides funding
to PHAs, public housing resident associations, Native American
Tribes, and nonprofit organizations to hire and maintain service co-
ordinators to connect residents of public housing and Indian hous-
ing with supportive services including employment and educational
opportunities. The JPI provides grants to PHAs, which are required
to partner with Department of Labor jobs centers, to assist public
housing residents with job placement and increasing earned in-
come.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$211,400,000 for self-sufficiency programs in fiscal year 2026,
which is $15,900,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This includes $156,400,000 for the FSS program, $45,000,000 for
the ROSS program, and $10,000,000 for the JPI.
FSS Program.—The Committee strongly supports the FSS pro-
gram, which provides public housing and section 8 residents with
the tools to improve their economic stability and financial manage-
ment skills, and ultimately achieve self-sufficiency. Before award-
ing funding to new grantees, the Committee directs the Depart-
ment to first prioritize the renewal of all existing coordinators and
second prioritize funding additional coordinators for current grant-
ees whose program sizes qualify for additional coordinators.
JPI.—The bill includes a general provision that enables the JPI
financial and rent incentive expenses to be paid from housing as-
sistance source accounts to help reduce administrative burdens for
HUD and grantees. To ensure transparency, HUD is directed to
provide in its congressional justifications the actual total cost of the
JPI, including the financial and rent incentives provided to pro-
gram participants.
NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,344,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,354,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account funds the Indian housing block grant program
[IHBG], as authorized under title I of the Native American Hous-
ing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (Public Law
104–330), and the Indian community development block grant pro-
gram [ICDBG], authorized under title I of the Housing and Com-
munity Development Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–383). The IHBG
program provides a funding allocation on a formula basis to Indian
Tribes and their Tribally designated housing entities [TDHEs] to
help address the housing needs within their communities. The
ICDBG program provides Indian Tribes the opportunity to compete
for funding to address Tribal community development needs.
124
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommended funding level for Native American
programs is $1,354,000,000, which is $10,000,000 more than the
amount provided in fiscal year 2025. The table below provides
funding levels for activities within this account.

Total, Native American Programs................................................................................................... 1,354,000,000
IHBG Grants.—The IHBG program is a vital resource for Tribal
governments to address the dire housing conditions in Indian
Country, as the quality of and access to affordable housing remains
in a critical state for many Tribes across the country. To assist
Tribes with these daunting housing challenges, the Committee rec-
ommendation includes $1,111,000,000 in formula funding and
$100,000,000 in competitive funding in order to assist areas with
greater need.
In administering the competitive program, the Committee directs
HUD staff to review and score each application in its entirety. Ad-
ditionally, the fiscal year 2026 appropriation shall be administered
as a new stand-alone competition and may not be combined with
prior or future year appropriations, although any remaining bal-
ances from the fiscal year 2025 competition or prior competition
may be included in the fiscal year 2026 competition. Demonstrating
sufficient administrative capacity to administer these grants has
been, and remains, a critical consideration. Applicants should be
required to meet a threshold of capacity, but the competition
should not provide additional points for capacity above and beyond
what is needed to successfully administer these grants.
Tribal HUD–VASH.—The Committee recommendation includes
$10,000,000 for the renewal of rental assistance and associated ad-
ministrative costs for the Tribal HUD–VASH demonstration pro-
gram. The Committee continues to encourage HUD to use its exist-
ing reallocation authority where necessary to ensure this program
is utilized to the greatest extent possible.
Coordinated Environmental Reviews for Tribal Housing and Re-
lated Infrastructure.—Since fiscal year 2015, the Committee has di-
rected HUD to collaborate with its Federal agency partners to de-
velop a coordinated environmental review process to simplify and
streamline Tribal housing development and its related infrastruc-
ture needs. The Committee believes that eliminating unnecessary
Federal barriers to housing development is an essential component
to facilitate an effective use of Federal funding, while also bal-
ancing the need to ensure appropriate and necessary environ-
mental protections. The Committee supports HUD’s efforts to ad-
vance the Tribal Housing and Related Infrastructure Interagency
125
Task Force in order to identify opportunities for greater effi-
ciencies.
Technical Assistance.—Limited capacity hinders the ability of
many Tribes to effectively address their housing needs. The Com-
mittee recommendation includes $7,000,000 for technical assistance
needs in Indian Country to support the IHBG program, as well as
other HUD programs, in order to meet the needs of Native Amer-
ican families and Indian Country. The Committee expects HUD to
use the technical assistance funding provided to aid Tribes with ca-
pacity challenges, especially Tribes receiving small grant awards.
The funding should be used for training, contract expertise, and
other services necessary to improve data collection, increase
leveraging, and address other needs identified by Tribes. The Com-
mittee also expects that these technical assistance funds will be
provided to organizations with experience in providing technical as-
sistance that reflects the unique needs and culture of Native Amer-
icans.
Legislative Proposals.—The bill includes legislative proposals to:
(1) allow for mortgages to be guaranteed for up to 40 years in
length when seeking to modify a loan to avoid foreclosure to align
loss mitigation options with that of the FHA; and (2) to expand pro-
gram service areas to all Tribal members, regardless of where they
purchase a home; and (3) to correct implementation challenges
with the authority for Tribes to participate in the Continuum of
Care [CoC] program.
INDIAN HOUSING LOAN GUARANTEE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT

Appropriations, 2025....................................................................................................... $1,500,000 $1,800,000,000
Committee recommendation ........................................................................................... 1,400,000 1,200,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This program provides access to private financing for Indian fam-
ilies, Indian Tribes, and their TDHE’s that otherwise could not ac-
quire housing financing because of the unique status of Indian
trust land. HUD continues to be the largest single source of financ-
ing for housing in Tribal communities. This program makes it pos-
sible to promote sustainable reservation communities by providing
access to financing for higher income Native Americans to achieve
homeownership within their Native communities. As required by
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508), this
account includes the subsidy costs associated with the loan guaran-
tees authorized under this program.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,400,000 for
credit subsidy and administrative contract expenses to support a
loan level of $1,200,000,000. This appropriation is $100,000 less
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Native Advantage.—The Committee directs the Department to
update the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations quar-
126
terly during fiscal year 2026 on its progress in both completing the
Native advantage system and resolving the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral’s open finding and recommendations.
Skilled Workers Loan Credit Subsidy.—The Committee notes
that there remains substantial carry over from fiscal year 2017 for
skilled workers credit loan subsidy which can generate meaningful
investments across Indian Country. The Committee strongly urges
the Department to significantly expand stakeholder outreach re-
garding the availability of these resources which will help develop
housing for the critical workforces that supports the education,
healthcare, law enforcement, emergency response, and construction
needs of Tribal communities.
NATIVE HAWAIIAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $22,300,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 22,300,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000 (Public
Law 106–568) created the Native Hawaiian housing block grant
program to provide grants to the State of Hawaii Department of
Hawaiian Home Lands [DHHL] for housing and housing-related
assistance, in order to develop, maintain, and operate affordable
housing for eligible low-income Native Hawaiian families. As one
of the United States’ indigenous people, Native Hawaiian people
have a unique relationship with the Federal Government.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $22,300,000 for
the Native Hawaiian housing block grant program, which is equal
to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee is encouraged to learn that DHHL intends to ad-
dress the needs of low-income Native Hawaiians through the devel-
opment of multifamily, affordable housing rental units, rent to own
options on Hawaiian homelands, and permanent supportive hous-
ing for Native Hawaiians experiencing homelessness. The expan-
sion of programmatic services beyond those that afford homeowner-
ship options will help to serve all Native Hawaiians on the waiting
list.
NATIVE HAWAIIAN HOUSING LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Limitation on
guaranteed
loans
Appropriation, 2025 ..................................................................................................................................... $28,000,000
Committee recommendation ........................................................................................................................ 28,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Native Hawaiian housing loan guarantee fund (section 184A
program) offers Native Hawaiian homeownership, property reha-
bilitation, and new construction opportunities on Hawaiian home
lands. The section 184A program expands the market for lenders
and ensures access to private-market mortgages for a traditionally
127
underserved population. Private financing is used to cover con-
struction or acquisitions costs, while Federal funding is used only
to guarantee payment in the event of a default. Eligible borrowers
include Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on the
Hawaiian home lands, DHHL, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and
organizations experienced in the planning and development of af-
fordable housing for Native Hawaiians.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation provides $28,000,000 in loan
guarantee commitment authority, including the authority to refi-
nance loans.
COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $505,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 529,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The housing opportunities for persons with AIDS [HOPWA] pro-
gram provides grants to States, localities, and nonprofits to devise
and deploy long-term, comprehensive strategies for meeting the
housing and supportive service needs of persons living with HIV/
AIDS and their families.
By statute, 90 percent of appropriated funds are distributed to
qualifying States and metropolitan areas on the basis of the num-
ber of living HIV and living AIDS cases, as well as poverty and
local housing cost factors. The remaining 10 percent of funds are
awarded through a national competition, with priority given to the
renewal of funding for expiring agreements consistent with appro-
priations act requirements.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $529,000,000 for the HOPWA pro-
gram, which is $24,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
Meeting the Current Needs of Communities.—It is critical that
people in every State have access to funding that supports low-in-
come persons living with HIV/AIDS. Accordingly, 10 percent of
nonformula funding provides an opportunity to States and units of
general local government that do not receive formula funding to
apply for competitive grants. The Committee continues to include
language requiring HUD to prioritize the renewal or replacement
of expiring agreements in a manner that preserves existing
HOPWA programs and allows active competitive grantees to mod-
ify and update their original activities to meet the current needs
of persons living with HIV/AIDS within their communities. The
Committee directs HUD to ensure competitive grantees are aware
of the opportunity to modify and update service models and any po-
tential benefits to doing so.
Formula Eligibility.—The Committee directs the Department to
continue to conduct outreach to all grantees with potential formula
changes in 2026, pursuant to the HOTMA, and to provide direct
128
technical assistance as needed. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions and the relevant authorizing committees with a quarterly sta-
tus update on its efforts to ensure adequate transition plans are in
place to minimize disruptions to housing assistance due to the pro-
jected 2026 formula changes.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,430,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,541,397,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1974 (Public Law 93–383), as amended, the Department is author-
ized to award block grants to units of general local government and
States for the funding of local community development programs.
A wide range of physical, economic, and social development activi-
ties are eligible, with spending priorities determined at the local
level. The law enumerates general objectives which the block
grants are designed to fulfill, including adequate housing, a suit-
able living environment, and expanded economic opportunities,
principally for persons of low- and moderate-income. Grant recipi-
ents are required to use at least 70 percent of their block grant
funds for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons.
Funds are distributed to eligible recipients for community devel-
opment purposes utilizing the higher of two objective formulas, one
of which gives somewhat greater weight to the age of housing
stock. Of the funds appropriated, 70 percent are distributed to enti-
tlement communities and 30 percent are distributed to non-entitle-
ment communities after deducting designated amounts for insular
areas.
Funding under this heading also accommodates investments au-
thorized under the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Pro-
motes Opioid Recovery and Treatment [SUPPORT] for Patients
and Communities Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–271), in order to
provide safe transitional housing for individuals recovering from
substance use disorders.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee provides $4,541,397,000 for the community devel-
opment fund, which is $1,111,397,000 above the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Within this total, $3,100,000,000 is for CDBG,
$30,000,000 is for activities authorized under section 8071 of the
SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, $60,000,000 is for
grants to reduce barriers to affordable housing development, and
$1,351,397,000 is for economic development initiatives [EDIs].
The flexibility associated with CDBG funding enables State and
local governments to tailor solutions to effectively meet the unique
needs of their communities. As HUD works with communities to
determine eligible activities that meet the national objective of ben-
efiting low- and moderate-income persons, the Committee encour-
ages the Department to extend flexibility to rural communities
with less than 1,000 residents to use alternate sources of data
when American community survey data is considered by the CDBG
129
applicant to be unreliable. Additionally, to ensure accountability
and transparency, the Committee recommendation continues provi-
sions in this act that prohibit any community from selling its
CDBG award to another community, and that require any funding
provided to a for-profit entity for an economic development project
funded under this act to undergo appropriate underwriting.
Reducing Red Tape In Housing Production.—For decades, hous-
ing production across the country has not kept pace with popu-
lation and economic growth, resulting in a nation-wide housing
shortage. This is in part due to restrictive local zoning and land
use regulations as well as a lack of necessary housing-related infra-
structure. The Federal Government can support communities as
they remove barriers to the production and preservation of unsub-
sidized affordable housing in order to increase housing supply,
lower housing costs, and ensure families have an affordable place
to live, particularly in high-opportunity neighborhoods. The Com-
mittee includes $60,000,000 for the Pathways to Removing Obsta-
cles to Housing [PRO Housing] program to reward State, local, and
regional jurisdictions that have made significant progress in reduc-
ing red tape in housing production by enacting or implementing
less restrictive zoning, land use, or permitting laws and regulations
that the Secretary expects to preserve or produce new housing
units. Less restrictive laws and regulations shall include, but are
not limited to, increasing density, reducing minimum lot sizes, cre-
ating transit-oriented development zones, streamlining or short-
ening permitting processes and timelines, expanding by-right mul-
tifamily zoned areas, allowing accessory dwelling units [ADU] on
lots with single-family homes, eliminating or relaxing residential
property height limitations, eliminating or reducing off-street park-
ing requirements, and allowing the conversion of vacant retail and
office space into residential housing. Eligible grant activities shall
include new construction of housing, including mixed-income hous-
ing to the greatest extent possible, and addressing costs associated
with housing supply growth such as infrastructure for new housing
development. When making awards, the Committee encourages
HUD to ensure geographic diversity amongst grantees, including in
urban, suburban, and rural areas. Further, the Committee directs
HUD to continue to seek ways to permit a more streamlined appli-
cation process and to ensure grants are awarded in a timely man-
ner. Finally, the Committee emphasizes its expectation that grant
funds be used on outcome-focused activities that will unlock hous-
ing availability.
Accessory Dwelling Units.—As localities consider and pass new
laws and regulations to permit ADUs, more public data is needed
to examine how these changes impact the uptake and construction
of ADUs and what barriers remain in utilizing ADUs to increase
housing supply. The Committee directs the GAO to conduct a study
on localities with zoning laws permitting the construction of ADUs,
or casitas, in single-family residential areas. In its study, the GAO
should identify and describe zoning laws around the country that
permit the building of ADUs, analyze the effects of such laws on
housing availability, density, and property values, and identify bar-
riers to both financing ADU construction and the rental and man-
agement of ADUs. The GAO is directed to provide the results of
130
this study in a report to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations within 1 year of the enactment of this act.
Impact of New Housing on Municipal Finance.—When localities
are considering new housing construction, rehabilitation, and con-
version, concerns may arise that population growth will lead to an
expansion in municipal services and expenditures. However, popu-
lation growth can also lead to financial benefits for the munici-
pality from increased tax revenues from new housing, more eco-
nomic development, and higher average incomes from younger pop-
ulations with more earning potential. The Committee believes that
better data is needed to understand this financial impact. The
Committee directs the GAO to study and issue a report on the
long-term impacts of new housing construction, rehabilitation, and
conversions on municipal fiscal health and economic development.
The Committee directs the GAO to brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the proposed scope and timeline
of this report no later than 90 days after enactment of this act and
to submit the final report upon completion.
CDBG Formula Modernization.—The Committee notes that the
CDBG formula has not been updated since 1978 and appreciates
HUD’s updated report, entitled ‘‘An Evaluation of the CDBG For-
mula’s Targeting to Community Development Need,’’ in order to
analyze the current formula’s effectiveness in meeting the goals of
the CDBG program. This report offers considerations for updating
the current formula to better target community development needs,
and HUD is encouraged to work with the relevant congressional
committees on updating the formula and reauthorizing the pro-
gram.
CDBG Rulemaking.—The Committee commends HUD for pub-
lishing a proposed rulemaking for the CDBG program regulations,
working within the constraints of the existing statute. The Com-
mittee continues to direct HUD to work expeditiously towards a
final rule that will enhance grantees’ ability to use CDBG funds
while streamlining reporting requirements, and take steps in the
interim to use administrative authorities to reduce unnecessary
burdens.
Recovery Housing Program [RHP].—The Committee directs HUD
to provide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations within 180 days of enactment of this act on the impact
of the RHP since it began receiving funding in 2020, lessons
learned from service delivery models, and recommendations for
modifications to the program’s formula that would modernize the
data utilized, reflect the widespread needs across the Nation, and
ensure appropriate allocations of funding.
EDIs.—The Committee recommends $1,351,397,000 for EDIs.
EDIs are CDS projects that support a variety of community devel-
opment and affordable housing needs and benefit low- and mod-
erate-income populations or meet an urgent need. The Committee
directs HUD to provide funding for the projects listed in the table
at the end of this report in the corresponding amounts and for the
corresponding recipient. The Committee continues to direct HUD to
provide semi-annual briefings to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on the implementation of EDIs and the Depart-
ment’s oversight of projects. The Committee continues to direct
131
HUD to prioritize timely outreach and responses to EDI grantees.
To support HUD in its efforts, the Committee recommendation in-
cludes increased funding for the Office of Community Planning and
Development above the budget request to help address the signifi-
cant workload associated with EDIs.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LOAN GUARANTEES PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Limitation on
guaranteed
loans
Appropriations, 2025.................................................................................................................................... $400,000,000
Committee recommendation ........................................................................................................................ 400,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Section 107:
Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1974 (Public Law 93–383), as amended, authorizes the Secretary to
issue Federal loan guarantees of private market loans used by
CDBG entitlement and non-entitlement communities, enabling
grantees to borrow up to five times their most recent CDBG alloca-
tion to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development,
housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation provides a loan level guarantee
of $400,000,000, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. The Committee requires HUD to collect fees to offset credit
subsidy costs such that the program operates at a net zero credit
subsidy cost.
This program enables CDBG recipients to use their CDBG dol-
lars to leverage financing for economic development projects, com-
munity facilities, and housing rehabilitation programs.
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,250,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,250,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Title II of the National Affordable Housing Act (Public Law 101–
625), as amended, authorizes the HOME program. This program
provides assistance to States and local governments for the purpose
of expanding the supply and affordability of housing to low- and
very low-income people. Eligible activities include tenant-based
rental assistance, acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental
and ownership housing, and housing construction. To participate in
the HOME program, State and local governments must develop a
comprehensive housing affordability strategy. There is a 25 percent
matching requirement for participating jurisdictions, which can be
reduced or eliminated if they are experiencing fiscal distress.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,250,000,000 for the HOME pro-
gram, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
132
Affordable Housing Needs.—Communities across the country con-
tinue to face an affordable housing crisis as rents remain high na-
tionwide, low and moderate incomes have not kept pace with hous-
ing cost increases, and the production of affordable housing units
lags far behind the need. According to HUD’s most recent ‘‘Worst
Case Housing Needs: 2023 Report to Congress,’’ in 2021, only 57
affordable units were available for every 100 very low-income
renter households and only 36 units were available for every 100
extremely low-income renter households. The HOME program is an
essential tool to address the shortfall of affordable housing for rent
or homeownership and provides necessary public gap financing to
facilitate private sector investment in affordable housing, enabling
significant leverage capacity of public and private resources.
PRESERVATION AND REINVESTMENT INITIATIVE FOR COMMUNITY
ENHANCEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $10,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 10,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The preservation and reinvestment initiative for community en-
hancement [PRICE] program provides competitive grants to pre-
serve and revitalize manufactured housing and eligible manufac-
tured housing communities. Grants support low- and moderate-in-
come homeowners with manufactured housing units and manufac-
tured housing communities with repairs, infrastructure improve-
ments, upgrades to increase resilience, services like eviction pre-
vention and housing counseling, and planning activities such as
those needed to transition to resident-managed and resident-owned
communities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $10,000,000 for
the PRICE program. This amount is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
SELF–HELP AND ASSISTED HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $60,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 70,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The self-help and assisted homeownership opportunity program
provides funding for a number programs, including the self-help
homeownership opportunity program [SHOP], which assists low-in-
come homebuyers who are willing to contribute ‘‘sweat equity’’ to-
ward the construction of their houses. These funds increase the
ability of nonprofit organizations to leverage funds from other
sources. This account also includes funding for the capacity build-
ing for community development and affordable housing program, as
well as assistance to rural communities, as authorized under sec-
tions 6301 through 6305 of Public Law 110–246. These programs
assist in the development of the capacity of nonprofit organizations
133
to carry out community development and affordable housing
projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $70,000,000 for the self-help and as-
sisted homeownership opportunity program, which is $10,000,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $13,000,000 for SHOP, as authorized under

Section 108:
section 11 of the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of
1996 (Public Law 104–120); $49,000,000 for capacity building, as
authorized by section 4(a) of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993
(Public Law 104–120), of which not less than $5,000,000 is for rural
capacity building activities; and $8,000,000 to carry out the na-
tional capacity building activities in rural communities. The Com-
mittee notes that funding for technical assistance is being provided
in the research and technology account and directs that funds
available for the section 4 program be used solely for capacity
building activities.

Section 109:
Section 4 Capacity Building.—In administering the section 4 ca-
pacity building program, the Committee directs HUD to ensure
that funding is made available on a competitive basis to each of the
second, third, and fourth capacity building entities specified in sec-
tion 4(a) of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 9816
note). The Committee also directs HUD to brief the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of
this act on its plans to make this funding available to all eligible
grantees.
SHOP Per Unit Average Investment Cap.—SHOP funds can be
used to acquire land, purchase foreclosed or abandoned properties,
and improve the infrastructure of homes for first time, low-income
homeowners. The Committee recognizes these activities are some of
the most difficult activities for nonprofits to finance. The Com-
mittee notes that HUD increased the allowable average SHOP ex-
penditure for the combined cost of land acquisition and infrastruc-
ture improvements for the first time since 2004 in the fiscal year
2022 NOFO. The Committee directs HUD to use its existing au-
thorities to include an allowable average per SHOP unit cost in the
fiscal year 2026 NOFO that is greater than the historical cap of
$15,000 per SHOP unit.
Capacity Building to Address the Needs of Tribal Communities.—
American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native commu-
nities and populations face rising housing cost burdens and bar-
riers to homeownership, as well as disproportionate physical hous-
ing and capacity deficiencies. HUD is directed to ensure section 4
grantees collectively invest not less than $1,000,000 in targeted ca-
pacity building activities to benefit Native Hawaiian, American In-
dian, and Alaska Native communities and populations. This min-
imum investment is separate from the required investment for
rural capacity building activities of not less than $5,000,000.
Rural Capacity Building Program.—Funding for the rural capac-
ity building program for community development and affordable
housing is intended for truly national organizations. For the pur-
poses of the national rural capacity building NOFO, the Committee
directs HUD to define an eligible national organization as ‘‘a non-
134
profit entity, which has ongoing experience in rural housing, in-
cluding experience working with rural housing organizations, local
governments, and Indian Tribes, as evidenced by past and con-
tinuing work in one or more States in eight or more of HUD’s Fed-
eral regions.’’
Manufactured Housing.—More than 20 million people live in
manufactured housing across the country, and manufactured
homes represent approximately 10 percent of new single-family
home starts. The Committee encourages section 4 grantees to sup-
port manufactured housing communities, including resident-owned
cooperatives that are working to improve infrastructure, purchase
their communities, preserve housing affordability, and develop
more affordable homes.
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,051,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,530,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Homeless assistance grants assist localities in addressing the
housing and service needs of a wide variety of homeless popu-
lations while developing coordinated systems to help those who are
homeless attain housing and move toward self-sufficiency. These
grants provide funding for rental assistance, emergency shelter,
transitional and permanent housing, prevention, rapid re-housing,
and supportive services to homeless persons and families or those
at risk of homelessness. The emergency solutions grants [ESG] pro-
gram is a formula grant program, while the continuum of care
[CoC] and rural housing stability programs are competitive grants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,530,000,000
for homeless assistance grants in fiscal year 2026. This amount is
$479,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee recommendation rejects the budget request proposal to con-
solidate funding for the programs funded under this heading and
for housing opportunities for persons with AIDS into a modified
emergency solutions grant block grant, and instead includes
$4,023,000,000 to support the CoC program, including the renewal
of existing projects, and $290,000,000 for the ESG program.
Improving the Speed and Predictability of Funding.—In fiscal
year 2024, the Committee provided HUD the authority to utilize a
2-year NOFO for the CoC program. In doing so, the Committee rec-
ognized that an annual CoC competition is a significant adminis-
trative undertaking for both CoCs and HUD; one that strains lim-
ited resources and can lead to unnecessary delays in funding. Con-
sistent with that determination, the Committee recommendation
requires HUD to issue a 2-year NOFO for fiscal years 2026 and
2027, and establishes statutory deadlines for publishing the NOFO
and announcing fiscal year 2026 funding awards. This 2-year
NOFO will enable CoCs and HUD to redirect the thousands of
hours that would have been spent on the application process to di-
rect service delivery and working on program improvements.
135
Improving Access to Healthcare and Services.—Several studies
have demonstrated that interventions focused on social deter-
minants of health can help support housing permanency while also
reducing healthcare costs. Moreover, shelters and homeless assist-
ance programs across the country are seeing sharp increases in the
number of elderly individuals, many of whom have complex med-
ical conditions that necessitate coordination between housing and
healthcare services to help them become or remain stably housed.
The Committee continues to support coordination between HUD
and the HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, Adminis-
tration for Community Living and Assistant Secretary for Planning
and Evaluation to provide direct technical assistance to commu-
nities to improve coordination and cross-leveraging of programs,
such as Medicaid, to deliver more integrated and seamless services
to people experiencing homelessness. The Committee recommenda-
tion includes no less than $20,000,000 for technical assistance, of
which $5,000,000 is provided to support such direct, community-
specific technical assistance.
To ensure that service providers can offer competitive wages to
hire and retain qualified personnel, the Committee recommenda-
tion for the CoC program includes an estimate of $43,000,000 to
support reasonable cost of living adjustments for supportive service
line items, and directs the Secretary to provide such increases.
Permanent Supportive Housing.—The Committee recommenda-
tion includes $100,000,000 for grants to CoCs for the construction,
acquisition, or rehabilitation of new permanent supportive housing.
These funds are largely intended to be one-time grants, but up to
20 percent of a grant may be used for operational and supportive
costs which will be eligible for renewal within the context of the
overall CoC competition. The Committee encourages HUD and
CoCs to leverage these funds with other sources, such as tax cred-
its and project-based rental assistance, to maximize the amount of
housing that can be directed to meeting the needs of homeless indi-
viduals and families, especially those who are unsheltered or seek-
ing to exit emergency shelter.
Homelessness Among Older Adults.—For multiple years, this
Committee has noted its concern regarding the growing population
of seniors experiencing homelessness. With this national demo-
graphic shift, the homelessness response system needs to adapt to
an aging clientele with increased service needs. The Committee di-
rects HUD, in coordination with the United States Interagency
Council on Homelessness [USICH], to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 270 days
of enactment of this act that provides recommendation for addi-
tional flexibilities most needed by ESG and CoC grantees to better
serve seniors experiencing homelessness and whether legislative
changes are necessary to provide those flexibilities.
Addressing the Needs of Survivors of Domestic Violence.—The
Committee recommendation continues to provide no less than
$52,000,000 in CoC grants for rapid re-housing projects and sup-
portive service projects providing coordinated entry and other crit-
ical activities in order to assist survivors of domestic violence, dat-
ing violence, and stalking. As grants through the CoC program,
136
such projects are eligible for renewal and subject to the same terms
and conditions as other renewal applicants in the CoC program.
To further understand how to best meet the needs of survivors
of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking,
the Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this act that identifies: (1) how CoC and ESG re-
sources have been utilized to support this population over the last
three fiscal years, (2) recommendations for how CoCs can be inclu-
sive of, and effectively collaborate with, survivor housing and sup-
portive service providers, (3) measurable criteria that CoCs can use
to evaluate how well these programs serve survivors, and (4) rec-
ommendations, following consultation with victim service providers,
on how coordinated entry systems and initial intake procedures can
improve to ensure survivor safety and confidentiality, without in-
hibiting a client’s choice to secure housing and services. The Com-
mittee also encourages the Department to coordinate with the De-
partment of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women [OVW] on
opportunities to better coordinate CoC resources with OVW’s tran-
sitional housing grants to ensure that survivors of domestic vio-
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking have access to
safe and affordable housing and services.
Youth Homelessness.—The Committee recommendation includes
$107,000,000 to continue implementation of comprehensive ap-
proaches to serving homeless youth, of which up to $10,000,000
shall be used to provide technical assistance to grantees, and of
which up to $25,000,000 shall be for youth homelessness system
improvement [YHSI] grants. YHSI grants are intended to improve
youth homelessness systems on a local level and help implement
successful, evidence-based intervention methods for this population.
The Committee prohibits the use of YHSI funds for direct services
or housing. When determining YHSI funding allocations, the Com-
mittee expects the Department to adjust the funding level between
YHSI and additional projects serving youth based on the level of
interest in the next competition cycle for YHSI and the youth
homelessness demonstration program. The Committee directs HUD
to ensure that sufficient technical assistance resources and equal
consideration for YHSI grants are provided to rural areas. The
Committee further encourages HUD to coordinate with HHS on
project and system outcome measures for youth aged 25 and under,
including families headed by youth aged 25 or under, which should
include: (1) permanent connections; (2) education or employment;
and (3) stable housing.
Tribal Participation.—The Committee recommendation provides
additional flexibilities to Tribes and TDHEs to enable their in-
creased participation in homeless assistance programs, which was
made eligible by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public
Law 116–260), and directs HUD to continue to provide guidance or
trainings to support such participation.
Transitional Housing.—The Committee notes that successfully
meeting the needs of differing homeless subpopulations, improving
self-sufficiency, and reducing returns to homelessness requires
varying approaches. The Committee reminds HUD and service pro-
viders that well-designed transitional housing can be an effective
137
and successful housing strategy for homeless youth and individuals
in substance abuse treatment.
Homeless Management Information Systems [HMIS].—The Com-
mittee previously directed HUD to work with CoCs, people who
have experienced homelessness, vendors, and other stakeholders to
enable a standard report of all currently active individuals and key
program information that is available to CoCs to inform real-time
decisions, and to specify application programming interface re-
quirements and other specifications so CoCs can better share infor-
mation and ensure privacy and security for more effective real-time
program management. The Committee directs HUD to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this act on the result of this engagement, rec-
ommendations for future data standards and HUD system updates,
and how HUD intends to work with HMIS software vendors and
CoCs to address structural and financial barriers impeding CoCs’
ability to utilize their data to rehouse those experiencing homeless-
ness in their communities.
Point-in-Time Count.—The Committee reminds HUD that the
joint explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year 2023 ap-
propriations act directed the Department to report to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the viability of cre-
ating a digital point-in-time count data collection and analysis plat-
form for communities to use. As part of the report, HUD is directed
to also examine the opportunity for using such digital platform to
conduct multiple counts throughout the year (particularly for cold-
weather States) and better inform seasonable changes. Addition-
ally, the Committee directs HUD to continue to include data on the
population of homeless individuals and households who are elderly
and near elderly in its annual point-in-time estimates to improve
national understanding of the aging homeless population and the
implications for Federal policy. The Committee also directs HUD to
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
within 180 days of enactment of this act on the feasibility, merits
of, and recommendations, if warranted, on how to better distin-
guish and track the increased use of interim strategies, such as
safe parking and safe sleeping programs, to respond to unsheltered
homelessness in a service-based setting within the annual point-in-
time estimates.
Annual Homeless Assessment Report [AHAR].—The Committee
continues to direct HUD to incorporate additional Federal data on
homelessness, particularly as it relates to youth homelessness, into
the AHAR. This information is important to ensure that commu-
nities develop and implement policies that respond to local needs.
Disaster Preparedness and Coordination for Homeless Popu-
lations.—When disasters strike, the lowest-income survivors, in-
cluding people experiencing homelessness, are often the hardest hit
and are left with the longest, steepest paths to recovery. HUD’s
rapid unsheltered survivor housing [RUSH] aims to ‘‘help commu-
nities provide outreach, emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, and
other assistance to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness
who are in a disaster-affected area but who cannot access all serv-
ices provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA]
programs.’’ However, initial implementation of funds has been slow
138
and requires improvement. The Committee directs HUD, in coordi-
nation with FEMA, to brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations within 120 days of enactment of this act on the spe-
cific actions taken in fiscal year 2025 and planned for fiscal year
2026 to improve coordination and the deployment of assistance to
the homeless population when natural disasters strike, including
actions taken to address open recommendations from the GAO–23–
105379 report. This briefing shall include lessons learned from the
challenges recent disaster-impacted communities have faced in
quickly deploying RUSH funds, recommendations for how to im-
prove relationships between emergency management and homeless-
ness stakeholders, and ways to support better pre-disaster pre-
paredness.
HOUSING PROGRAMS
PROJECT–BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $16,890,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 17,804,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Section 110:
Section 8 project-based rental assistance provides a rental sub-
sidy to a private landlord that is tied to a specific housing unit, as
opposed to a voucher, which allows a recipient to seek a unit, sub-
ject primarily to certain rent caps. Amounts in this account include
funding for the renewal of and amendments to expiring section 8
project-based contracts, including section 8 moderate rehabilitation,
and single room occupancy housing. This account also provides
funds for contract administrators.
The section 8 project-based rental assistance [PBRA] program
supports approximately 17,700 contracts with private owners of
multifamily housing. Through this program, HUD and private sec-
tor partners support the preservation of safe, stable, and sanitary
housing for approximately 1.3 million low-income households.
Without PBRA, many affordable housing projects would convert to
market rates with large rent increases that current tenants would
be unable to afford.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$17,804,000,000 for annual PBRA contract renewals and related
activities, of which up to $509,000,000 is for the cost of contract ad-
ministrators. The recommended level of funding is $914,000,000
above the amount provided in fiscal year 2025.
Performance-Based Contract Administrators.—Performance-based
contract administrators [PBCAs] are PHAs, or their instrumental-
ities, and State housing finance agencies [HFAs], and are respon-
sible for conducting on-site management reviews of assisted prop-
erties; adjusting contract rents; and reviewing, processing, and pay-
ing monthly vouchers submitted by owners, among other tasks.
The Committee notes that PBCAs are integral to the Department’s
efforts to be more effective and efficient in the oversight and moni-
toring of this program in order to reduce improper payments, pro-
tect tenants, and ensure properties are well maintained. There are
139
current PBCAs that have demonstrated success in providing high
quality program services and have valuable experience in admin-
istering affordable housing resources in the States in which they
operate. The bill includes a general provision to help address the
challenges in a new competition and directs HUD to ensure that
any new arrangements result in improved and cost-effective over-
sight and monitoring of the PBRA program; quality services offered
to property owners and tenants in each State; and the maintenance
of safe, stable, and affordable housing for the approximately 1.3
million households living in PBRA properties across the country.
HUD is directed to continue to work with relevant stakeholders
and congressional committees on a permanent statutory framework
for PBCAs. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that tenants
can serve a valuable role in identifying potential problems with the
physical condition of a property. The Committee urges HUD to as-
sess the effectiveness of using resident surveys as a tool to help
PBCAs conduct effective oversight.
Managing Troubled Properties.—The Committee places a priority
on providing access to safe, sanitary, and affordable housing to
those most in need and holding HUD and owners accountable for
failing to upload those standards. The Committee remains con-
cerned for tenants enduring deplorable living conditions as a result
of delayed or inaccurate REAC inspections of troubled properties
and HUD’s inability to track property owners under litigation for
failure to maintain decent, safe, and sanitary housing. The Com-
mittee continues to include a general provision that (1) requires the
Secretary to take specific actions if an owner fails to maintain its
property, including imposing civil monetary penalties, securing a
different owner for the property, or transferring the section 8 con-
tract to another property and (2) requires HUD to report on prop-
erties with failing physical inspection scores of less than 60 or that
have received an unsatisfactory management and occupancy review
within the past 36 months to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations. For properties identified in this report, HUD shall
include the PBCA associated with its oversight. In addition, the
Committee continues to direct HUD to include in this report data
on project-based rental assistance program properties and units, in-
cluding the State in which the property is located, that have exited
the programs as a result of contract abatement from poor physical
conditions or for other reasons and to identify if the properties and
units are preserved through a transfer to other properties or are
lost.
Improving Properties with Health, Safety, or Operational Defi-
ciencies.—The Committee strongly supports preserving the PBRA
affordable housing stock. The Committee notes that HUD issued a
notice in February 2024 on the process for making the first round
of budget-based rent adjustments to PBRA contracts that have
been renewed through the mark-to-market [M2M] program fol-
lowing the statutory authority provided in fiscal year 2023. The
Committee directs HUD to provide a briefing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of enactment
of this act on the dollar amount and number of funding requests
received under this notice, as well as HUD’s property selection
process, and planned oversight of properties following the rent ad-
140
justments. Further, the Committee again reminds HUD of the di-
rective included in the fiscal year 2023 joint explanatory statement
to assess the needs amongst post-M2M properties and other PBRA
properties with health and safety deficiencies, and to provide the
results of this assessment to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations.
Survivors of Domestic Violence or Sexual Assault.—GAO issued a
report [GAO–24–106481] in July 2024 identifying opportunities for
HUD to improve its oversight of housing providers’ emergency
transfers for relocating victims of domestic violence or sexual as-
sault. Of the seven recommendations, three apply directly to PBRA
properties and involve HUD taking action to provide written in-
structions to PBRA property owners on implementing emergency
transfers, revising the management and occupancy review form,
and collecting data. HUD is directed to close these recommenda-
tions quickly to ensure compliance with the Violence Against
Women Act requirements, and to protect survivors in HUD-assisted
rental housing.
HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $931,400,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 972,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for housing for the elderly pursu-
ant to section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (Public Law 86–372).
Under this program, the Department provides capital grants to eli-
gible entities for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of
housing for seniors, as well as project-based rental assistance con-
tracts [PRACs] to support the operational costs of such units. Ten-
ants living in section 202 supportive housing units can access a va-
riety of community-based services in order to continue living inde-
pendently in their communities and effectively age in place.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $972,000,000 for
the section 202 program. This amount is $40,600,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee’s recommenda-
tion includes: $842,000,000 for the costs associated with fully fund-
ing all annual PRAC renewals and amendments; $122,000,000 to
fund the renewal of existing for service coordinators and congregate
service grants; $4,000,000 to support preservation transactions of
housing for the elderly originally developed by a capital advance
and assisted by a project rental assistance contract; and $4,000,000
for contract services.
Service Coordinators.—The Committee recognizes that service co-
ordinators in the section 202 program serve an essential component
of housing-based care for seniors. To expedite the process of renew-
ing existing service coordinator grants, the bill includes authority
for HUD to renew these grants every 2 years, rather than annu-
ally.
In addition, the Committee directs HUD to review the distribu-
tion of section 202 service coordinators amongst States with the
oldest populations according Census Bureau data and the avail-
141
ability of eligible multifamily properties in those States that could
qualify for the service coordinator program. As part of this review,
HUD should assess if these areas are underserved by the service
coordinator program and if future program expansion funding
should be prioritized to these States. HUD is directed to provide
this review to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
within 1 year of enactment of this act.
HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $256,700,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 265,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for housing for persons with dis-
abilities pursuant to section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National
Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–625). Tradition-
ally, the section 811 program provided capital grants to eligible en-
tities for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of housing
for persons with disabilities, as well as PRACs to support the oper-
ational costs of such units. Since fiscal year 2012, HUD has
transitioned to providing project rental assistance to State housing
finance agencies or other appropriate entities, which act in partner-
ship with State health and human services agencies to provide sup-
portive services, as authorized by the Frank Melville Supportive
Housing Investment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–374).
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $265,000,000 for
the section 811 program. This amount is $8,300,000 more than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This level of funding, in addition to
residual receipts, recaptures, and other unobligated balances, will
support all project-based renewals and amendments.
HOUSING COUNSELING ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $57,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 57,500,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The housing counseling assistance program provides comprehen-
sive housing counseling services to eligible homeowners and ten-
ants through grants to non-profit intermediaries, State government
entities, and other local and national agencies. Eligible counseling
activities include: pre- and post-purchase education, personal finan-
cial management, reverse mortgage product education, foreclosure
prevention and mitigation, and rental counseling.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $57,500,000 for
housing counseling assistance, which is equal to the fiscal year
2025 enacted level. Of the amount provided, up to $4,500,000 is
available for administrative contract services. The Committee di-
rects HUD to use not less than $3,000,000 of the funds provided
for the housing counseling grant program specifically for housing
142
counseling agencies to partner with historically black colleges and
universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and other minority
serving institutions. In addition, up to $5,000,000 may be used for
a homeownership initiative that is targeted to historically under-
served communities. Outreach efforts may include culturally sen-
sitive and linguistically appropriate service delivery, materials, and
educational initiatives.
PAYMENT TO MANUFACTURED HOUSING FEES TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety
Standards Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–383), as amended by the
Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–
569), authorizes the Secretary to establish Federal standards for
the construction, design, safety, and performance of manufactured
homes. All manufactured homes are required to meet these Federal
standards, and fees are charged to producers to cover the costs of
administering the act.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $14,000,000 to support the manu-
factured housing standards programs, of which $14,000,000 is ex-
pected to be derived from fees collected and deposited into the man-
ufactured housing fees trust fund account. No direct appropriation
is provided. The total amount recommended is equal to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.

Committee recommendation ....................................................................................... 1,000,000 35,000,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The FHA fund covers the mortgage and loan insurance activity
of HUD mortgage/loan insurance programs. These include the mu-
tual mortgage insurance [MMI] fund, cooperative management
housing insurance [CMHI] fund, general insurance [GI] fund, and
the special risk insurance [SRI] fund. For presentation and ac-
counting control purposes, these are divided into two sets of ac-
counts based on shared characteristics. The unsubsidized insurance
143
programs of the MMI fund and the CMHI fund constitute one set;
and the GI and SRI funds make up the other.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee has included the following amounts for the MMI
Program account: a limitation on guaranteed loans of
$400,000,000,000, a limitation on direct loans of $1,000,000, and
$160,000,000 for administrative contract expenses. This amount for
administrative contract expenses is $10,000,000 more than the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level. For the GI/SRI account, the Committee
recommends a limitation on guaranteed loans of $35,000,000,000
and a limitation on direct loans of $1,000,000.
Barriers to Innovation.—The Committee directs FHA to consult
with relevant stakeholders and conduct a review the regulatory
and sub-regulatory policies that may: (1) hinder the use of FHA
programs to support shared equity homeownership models, includ-
ing but not limited to restrictions on resale and conveyance, and
(2) limit the use of FHA multifamily programs for properties using
offsite construction and other nontraditional construction tech-
niques, and brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions on such review within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Institutional Investment in Single-Family Housing.—The Com-
mittee notes that in some local housing markets there are increas-
ing concentrations of institutional financial investment in single-
family housing, and that trend has the potential to affect local real
estate markets. The Committee directs HUD to continue to
prioritize the sale of HUD owned single-family homes to owner-oc-
cupants, HUD-approved nonprofits, and government entities to
mitigate any negative effects from institutional investors. The
Committee also urges the GAO to expeditiously complete the sec-
ond part of the report on institutional investment in single-family
housing as required in the joint explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328.
Energy Audits.—The Committee notes that FHA’s single family
housing handbook 4000.1 requires the incorporation of energy au-
dits into home appraisals for special energy-related component that
affect the value of the property. The FHA is directed to brief the
House and Senate Committee on Appropriations within 180 days of
enactment of this act on the impact these energy audits can have
on home appraisal values.
Affordable Housing Finance.—The Committee is concerned about
the diminished supply of affordable housing across the country and
is supportive of efforts and initiatives that result in measurable in-
creases in that supply. The section 542(c) housing finance agency
risk-sharing initiative has been in place since 2021 and warrants
broader evaluation to understand the extent to which it has in-
creased housing supply. The Committee directs the GAO to review
this initiative and submit a report to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this act.
This review should include at a minimum: the number of loans
funded and geographic interest in this initiative; the underwriting
standards applicable through this initiative compared to other
similar FHA-insured loans outside of this initiative; the differences
between HUD’s multifamily accelerated processing guide [MAP
144
Guide] and the guidelines for a HFA-underwritten loan, including
an analysis of if MAP Guide results in higher costs and longer pro-
duction time when creating affordable housing when compared to
the requirements of an HFA-underwritten loan; if the lower bor-
rowing costs through this initiative results in lower rents to fami-
lies; the extent to which this initiative has resulted in the produc-
tion of more housing units rather than shifting production from one
sector to another; and the oversight requirements applicable under
this initiative compared to non-initiative financing.
FHA Mortgage Insurance for New Multifamily Construction.—
The United States is facing a severe housing shortage and needs
millions of new units to balance supply and demand. However, the
Federal Government currently provides very little assistance for
new multifamily construction. FHA’s 221(d)(4) program is the larg-
est Federal program that backstops loans for new multifamily
housing construction, but it endorsed fewer than 75 developments
in fiscal year 2024. The Committee directs GAO to study the effec-
tiveness of the 221(d)(4) program and recommend legislative and
regulatory programmatic improvements that would expand pro-
gram uptake.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Ginnie Mae, through the mortgage-backed securities pro-
gram, guarantees privately issued securities backed by pools of
Government-guaranteed mortgages. Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned
corporate instrumentality of the United States within the Depart-
ment. Its powers are prescribed generally by title III of the Na-
tional Housing Act (Public Law 73–479), as amended. Ginnie Mae
is authorized by section 306(g) of the National Housing Act to guar-
antee the timely payment of principal and interest on securities
that are based on and backed by a trust, or pool, composed of mort-
gages that are guaranteed and insured by FHA, the Rural Housing
Service, or the VA. Ginnie Mae’s guarantee of mortgage-backed se-
curities is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
This account also funds all salaries and benefits funding to support
Ginnie Mae.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on new commitments
on mortgage-backed securities of $550,000,000,000. This level is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The bill allows Ginnie
Mae to use $56,000,000 for salaries and expenses. This is
$2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee directs Ginnie Mae to submit quarterly data to the House
145
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on staffing levels, staff-
ing expenses, and other non-personnel expenses.
Nonbank Mortgage Companies.—Since 2008, the issuer landscape
of Ginnie Mae has shifted dramatically toward nonbank mortgage
companies, who now make up 73 percent of Ginnie Mae issuers and
service 85 percent of its portfolio. The Committee is concerned by
the risks this may pose and directs Ginnie Mae to provide a report,
within 180 days of enactment of this act, to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations detailing how it would react to
stress on nonbank mortgage companies, including liquidity stress,
protocols to identify viable servicers that could assume the portfolio
of a failed nonbank mortgage company, and actions Ginnie Mae
could take to prevent and minimize such risks. The Committee fur-
ther encourages Ginnie Mae to coordinate with the Federal Hous-
ing Finance Agency, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and
other relevant housing oversight bodies to develop this report.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Title V of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 (Pub-
lic Law 91–609), as amended, directs the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development to undertake programs
of research, evaluation, and reports relating to the Department’s
mission and programs. These functions are carried out internally
and through grants and contracts with industry, nonprofit research
organizations, educational institutions, and through agreements
with State and local governments and other Federal agencies. The
research programs seek ways to improve the efficiency, effective-
ness, and equity of HUD programs and to identify methods to
achieve cost reductions. Additionally, this appropriation is used to
support HUD evaluation and monitoring activities and to conduct
housing surveys.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $131,028,000 for
the research and technology account in fiscal year 2026. This level
is $7,972,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the Committee’s recommendations for fis-
cal year 2026:

Core Research and Technology.—The Committee recommenda-
tions includes not less than $72,900,000 for core research and tech-
nology. The Committee supports the use of these funds for coopera-
tive agreements and research partnerships with minority serving
institutions. The Committee recognizes the value that cooperative
agreements and research partnerships can provide to urban com-
munities and encourages the Department to award a cooperative
agreement to a minority serving institute located in an urban set-
ting to conduct research on matters related to economic oppor-
tunity, reducing homelessness, or other areas that improve the
long-term capacity of communities or otherwise address priorities
of the Department. Within the amounts for core research and tech-
nology, up to $4,900,000 is for building technology research.
Research, Evaluation, and Demonstration.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes up to $3,128,000 research, evaluation, and
demonstration. Of this amount, up to $2,100,000 shall be for ongo-
ing research on moving to work [MTW] expansion, and the commu-
nity choice demonstration. The remaining $1,028,000 shall be for
HUD to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine [National Academies] as delineated under
the ‘‘Housing Data Infrastructure’’ heading in this report.
Housing Data Infrastructure.—Housing is a fundamental aspect
of people’s daily lives and well-being, but millions of Americans
face insecurity or displacement from their homes due to rapid rent
increases, evictions, foreclosures, increasing property taxes and in-
surance costs, and post-disaster upheavals. However, existing Fed-
eral housing data infrastructure lacks the timely local data needed
to adequately track housing market disruptions and effectively in-
form policies intended to address these problems. HUD is directed
to contract with the National Academies to convene an expert con-
sensus committee, including housing policy, economics, social
science, statistics, public policy, and survey methodology experts, to
consider the issues in a holistic fashion and provide solutions for
moving forward.
Such a consensus committee should review key uses and needs
for a modern housing data and statistics infrastructure designed to
track key aspects of the Nation’s housing conditions and inform de-
cision-making, such as: housing starts and completions, develop-
ment timelines, costs to build, hazard insurance costs, property
ownership, local changes to rent, evictions, foreclosures and
demolitions, homelessness, unique needs and data gaps relating to
Tribal areas and territories, and post-disaster impacts on housing
markets and households. Such a consensus committee should: (1)
review current sources of housing information; (2) identify short-
comings and strengths in these sources for key research and policy
uses; (3) hold open meetings to seek input from key stakeholders;
and (4) recommend strategies for modernizing the housing data in-
frastructure to inform Federal, State, and local policymaking in a
timely manner. The Committee directs the National Academies to
submit a report with its findings, conclusions, and recommenda-
tions no later than 2 years after the work has been contracted.
Disaster-Impacted Renters and Rental Markets.—The Committee
is concerned insufficient attention is being paid to renter household
needs and rental market forces following natural disasters. Recent
147
analysis shows that rents in disaster-impacted communities rise
and then remain higher than their original rates for years. These
impacts are amplified in already constrained rental markets, espe-
cially when communities are hit by successive disasters. Without
adequate and thoughtful intervention, these market impacts can
lead to secondary displacement of other vulnerable renter house-
holds who were not directly affected by the disaster. If funds are
available, HUD may, in coordination with and after consulting
FEMA, contract with NAPA, to study this issue. The study should
be overseen by a panel of experts, to examine in-depth how renters
and rental markets have recovered from recent major disasters,
with a special focus on disasters that involve long displacement
times for a large number of renter households. The study should
consider the roles of the insurance industry, FEMA, HUD, Small
Business Administration [SBA], and State and local governments
as they relate to: (1) addressing the temporary and long-term hous-
ing needs and the recovery of impacted renters; (2) how the dis-
aster and disaster response impacts other renters in the housing
market; and (3) the replacement of lost affordable rental housing
inventory. The expert panel should include the experience and ex-
pertise of former FEMA, HUD, and SBA leaders, expertise in re-
search and advocacy for displaced renters and impacted single-fam-
ily and multi-family rental property owners; insurance and reinsur-
ance industry; support services for those at risk of homelessness;
and State and local emergency management and long-term recov-
ery. From that review, NAPA should make recommendations on re-
forms to guide FEMA, HUD, and SBA that would, in coordination
with the insurance industry, facilitate affordable, faster, inclusive,
and resilient recovery for renters, and include guidance on improv-
ing how Federal, State and local governments monitor rental mar-
ket trends to inform disaster recovery policy decisions. NAPA
should communicate with the GAO and the National Academy of
Sciences over the course of its study and review previous studies
to prevent duplication of effort.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee recommendation includes
$40,000,000 for technical assistance, of which $5,000,000 is for the
distressed cities and persistent poverty technical assistance pro-
gram. The Committee directs HUD to assess how it can improve
technical assistance to State and local entities to access Federal
housing resources across the country and make recommendations
on best practices and the Federal support necessary to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Institutional Investors.—The Committee remains interested in
the feasibility of HUD collecting data related to investor owned res-
idential rental housing units, and looks forward to receiving the as-
sessment required in Senate Report 118–70.
Fair Market Rents [FMRs].—The Committee continues to encour-
age HUD, to the extent permissible under current regulations, to
set FMRs at no lower than the previous year’s level for an FMR
area, unless the Department has sufficient local data to justify
such a change and encourages HUD to continue its progress toward
reforming the process of setting FMRs. Data limitations that result
in inadequate FMR levels for communities and families undercut
148
the mission of the voucher program, and these impacts are espe-
cially concerning in areas that lack the third-party data sources
HUD has identified to supplement its FMR data. In response to
these challenges and in addition to HUD’s on-going FMR improve-
ment efforts, the Committee directs the Department to consider
and assess the merits and potential operational concerns of permit-
ting state housing finance agencies to support calculations of FMR
levels. Additionally, this assessment should focus on the potential
of permitting this flexibility only where there is a lack of either
HUD or third-party data to make local FMR determinations. The
Committee directs HUD to report its finding to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enactment of
this act. In addition, the Department shall report to the House and
Senate Committee on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment
of this act on strategies to improve data, to better forecast rents in
communities that are habitually miscalculated and decrease the
cost of private rental surveys.
Conversion of Office Buildings to Housing.—Office vacancies in
the United States are at an all-time high, while the country simul-
taneously searches for creative solutions to address its shortage of
millions of homes. Despite the interest in office-to-residential con-
versions, structural and legal limitations can make such conversion
to conventional apartments cost prohibitive. The Committee en-
courages the Department to support efforts to advance innovation
in the conversion of high-vacancy commercial buildings into resi-
dential use, including by investigating the availability and limita-
tions of existing waiver authorities to promote conversion and the
economic viability of co-living configurations, and identifying any
barriers to using Federal funds to support conversions. The Depart-
ment is directed to report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations within 270 days of enactment of this act on all Fed-
eral barriers to such conversions and potential changes to Federal
law that could further incentivize such conversions. In order to bet-
ter support communities in their adaptive reuse efforts, HUD is
also encouraged to help local jurisdictions with high housing costs
to develop a building inventory, in coordination with local planning
departments, to determine which commercial properties are most
suitable for residential conversion.
Master Leasing Models.—Master leasing models, where a home-
lessness services provider or a CoC leases a whole building or a
block of units from a property owner’s portfolio to provide housing
to persons experiencing homelessness, have been shown to remove
critical barriers to housing people. However, some existing HUD
regulations have made the model administratively burdensome to
operationalize. The Committee directs the Department to submit a
report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on
master leasing models across the country and provide an assess-
ment with recommendations on how the Department can adjust its
regulations to better accommodate this innovative model.
Off-Site Construction.—The Committee supports efforts to
incentivize the use of off-site construction through local adoption of
and improvements to off-site construction standards. Such con-
struction can help increase housing supply, affordability, and acces-
sibility. In addition, the Committee encourages HUD to conduct re-
149
search on the impact of regulatory inconsistencies in off-site con-
struction regulation across the United States.
Community Choice Demonstration Program.—The Committee an-
ticipates the completion of phase I and the published rapid cycle
evaluation report in 2025, and requests that HUD brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its findings related
to the outcomes of phase I of the demonstration.
Native and Tribal Housing Needs.—The Committee is aware of
the lack of data on the housing needs of Native Americans, which
are difficult to capture in aggregate housing surveys. In January
2017, HUD published an Assessment of American Indian, Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs, which has been the
most comprehensive analysis and source of information about hous-
ing needs in Indian Country and Native American communities.
The Committee directs the Department to update the Assessment
of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Housing Needs,
and to publish reports with these comprehensive updates by Janu-
ary 2029.
Share Equity Homeownership.—The Committee is aware of con-
cerns that certain HUD program certification barriers and resale
restriction requirements can impede non-profit shared equity
homeownership programs across the country. As such, HUD should
report on how its policy have supported or hindered nonprofit
shared equity homeownership, including the potential impact of
HUD and FHA policy changes in supporting nonprofit shared eq-
uity.
FAIR HOUSING AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
FAIR HOUSING ACTIVITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $86,355,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 86,355,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The fair housing activities appropriation includes funding for
both the fair housing assistance program [FHAP] and the fair
housing initiatives program [FHIP], among others.
FHAP assists State and local fair housing agencies with imple-
menting title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law 90–
284), as amended, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rent-
al, and financing of housing and in the provision of brokerage serv-
ices. The major objective of the program is to ensure prompt and
effective processing of title VIII complaints, with appropriate rem-
edies for complaints being provided by State and local fair housing
agencies.
FHIP is authorized by section 561 of the Housing and Commu-
nity Development Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–242), as amended,
and by section 905 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–550). This program provides support
to public and private organizations for the purpose of eliminating
or preventing discrimination in housing, and enhances fair housing
opportunities.
150
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $86,355,000 for the Office of Fair
Housing and Equal Opportunity, which is equal to the fiscal year
2025 enacted level. Of the amounts provided: (1) $26,355,000 is for
FHAP; (2) $56,000,000 is for FHIP, including not less than
$10,400,000 for education and outreach programs, not less than
$3,700,000 for fair housing organization initiatives, and up to
$40,500,000 for the private enforcement initiative; (3) $1,000,000 is
for the creation, promotion, and dissemination of translated mate-
rials that support the assistance of persons with limited English
proficiency; and (4) $3,000,000 is for the national fair housing
training academy.
Test Coordinator Training.—The Committee recognizes that test-
ing remains one of the most effective investigative tools and is fun-
damental to fair housing law enforcement. Those who coordinate
testing investigations need specialized training from skilled and ex-
perienced professionals in this field. HUD shall continue to imple-
ment a comprehensive test coordinator training program to provide
ongoing training, technical assistance, and resources to test coordi-
nators working in fair housing organizations throughout the coun-
try. HUD shall not merge existing test coordinator training with
other fair housing activities, including the national fair housing
training academy.
OFFICE OF LEAD HAZARD CONTROL AND HEALTHY HOMES
LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $295,600,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 295,600,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992
(Public Law 102–550) established the Residential Lead-Based Paint
Hazard Reduction Act, under which HUD is authorized to make
grants to States, localities, and Tribes in order to conduct lead-
based paint hazard remediation and abatement activities in pri-
vate, low-income housing. Lead is a significant environmental
health hazard, particularly for young children and pregnant
women, and exposure can result in neurological damage, learning
disabilities, and impaired growth. The healthy homes initiative,
which was authorized under sections 501 and 502 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1970 (Public Law 91–609), provides
grants to remediate hazards in housing that have been scientif-
ically shown to negatively impact occupant health and safety.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $295,600,000 for the lead hazard re-
duction account, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
Unobligated Balances.—The Committee acknowledges the signifi-
cant progress HUD has made in recent years to reduce unobligated
balances for lead hazard reduction grants, and does not accept the
151
budget proposal to eliminate funding for the program in fiscal year

Section 111:
2026. The Committee continues to direct the Department to pro-
vide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with up-
dated reports on all unobligated balances for each program fol-
lowing each funding competition award announcement.
Lead Hazard Reduction Grants.—The Committee recommenda-
tion provides $155,600,000 for lead hazard reduction grants. With-
in this amount, $105,000,000 is set aside for jurisdictions with the
highest lead-based paint abatement needs, which is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee directs the Department to continue to conduct
outreach and improve the NOFOs to encourage more grantees to
apply and make efficient use of lead hazard reduction grant funds.
The Committee directs the Department to include in such outreach
smaller and rural communities, and nonprofit organizations and
community development financial institutions [CDFIs] interested in
being co-applicants. The Committee directs the Department to brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of enactment of this act on such outreach, major participation
barriers identified, whether those barriers are administrative or
statutory in nature, and how CDFI lending capabilities can be le-
veraged to increase the pace at which low-income communities can
address lead paint hazards in high-risk communities. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to provide maximum flexibility within
statutory limits to extend grant periods of performance to allow
grantees more time to reach lead hazard reduction grant bench-
marks and to make more housing lead-safe.
Lead Interagency Coordination.—The Committee reminds HUD
of an outstanding requirement from Senate Report 118–70 to brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its data
sharing needs with the Environmental Protection Agency related to
lead service line inventories.
Lead Risk Assessment.—The Committee reminds Office of Lead
Hazard Control and Healthy Homes and Office of Public and In-
dian Housing of the outstanding requirement from Public Law
118–42 to jointly engage with PHAs and other stakeholders to un-
derstand why so few applications were submitted for the lead risk
assessment demonstration and brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations on the findings of this engagement.
Aging-in-Place.—The Committee recommendation includes
$30,000,000 within the healthy homes initiative for aging-in-place
home modification grants in order to enable low-income seniors
(persons who are 62 years of age or older) to remain in their homes
through low-cost, high-impact home modifications. The intended
beneficiaries of these grants are low-income seniors living in homes
that are not receiving project-based rental assistance, and HUD
shall ensure the use of funds appropriated will reflect that intent.
The Committee recommendation includes language to streamline
the environmental review process for these low-cost interventions
and directs HUD to take several other common-sense actions to im-
prove the impact of these grants. HUD is directed to adjust the
current $5,000 cap on the cost of home modifications per housing
unit to account for annual changes in the cost of labor, materials
and supplies. In designing the NOFO for this program, the Com-
152
mittee continues to encourage the use of successful models of low-
barrier, participant-led, holistic approaches to aging-in-place. How-
ever, the Committee is concerned that the Department’s required
use of occupational therapists in the program services model is not
practical nor necessary for all communities, and excludes other suc-
cessful models that have helped form the Committee’s appreciation
for the value of these investments, including the State of Maine’s
community aging-in-place grant program. Thus, the Committee di-
rects the Department to accept without additional justification al-
ternative program services models that do not require occupational
therapists for grants awarded with fiscal year 2026 funds or bal-
ances remaining from prior years. Applicants that propose an alter-
native model shall not be disadvantaged during the application and
selection process on that basis. The Committee continues to direct
HUD to track the outcomes of seniors whose homes have been
modified in order to better understand the effectiveness of this
funding in reducing at-home falls, hospitalizations, and emergency
response calls, as well as improving independence and tenure in
home over time. The Committee also encourages HUD to support
research and technical studies on housing technologies that enable
aging-in-place strategies within the amounts available for healthy
homes technical studies.
Weatherization Assistance Program.—The Committee reminds
the Department of its responsibility to continue collecting informa-
tion on how many units benefit from this coordinated execution of
HUD lead-based paint hazard control grants and the Department
of Energy weatherization assistance program, to quantify how this
coordination has reduced costs for hardware and labor, and to pro-
vide this information to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations after the end of each grant cycle. The Committee looks
forward to receiving the first such report in the near future and en-
courages the Department to highlight best practices in coordination
that can be integrated into grant management practices.
Streamlining Environmental Review Processes.—The Committee
has provided limited flexibilities related to environmental reviews
for the aging-in-place home modification grant program. To more
comprehensively examine the costs and benefits of current environ-
mental review processes for the programs funded in this account,
the Committee directs HUD to conduct an analysis and provide a
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
within 120 days of enactment of this act that examines the history
of grants awarded under this section in order to provide rec-
ommendations for statutory authority to ease some of the environ-
mental review requirements of these programs, including but not
limited to considerations of coastal zone management, endangered
species protection, farmland protection, flood plain management,
radon, noise control, off-site contamination, wetlands for existing
structures, and public comment and objection periods, to improve
project delivery and eliminate administrative burdens that are not
cost effective.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Inspector General conducts independent investiga-
tions, audits, and evaluations not only to prevent and detect fraud,
waste, and abuse, but also to promote efficiency and effectiveness
in the programs and operations of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. This appropriation will finance all salaries
and related expenses associated with the operation of the Office of
Inspector General.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $146,000,000 for
the Office of Inspector General, which is $6,924,000 less than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Audit Reports.—The Committee expects the Office of Inspector
General to continue providing copies of all audit reports to the
Committee immediately after they are issued and to make the
Committee aware immediately of any review which recommends
significant budgetary savings.
Contracting Audits of Annual Financial Statements.—The Com-
mittee directs the Office of the Inspector General to continue to
procure and rely upon the services of an independent external
auditor, or auditors, to audit the financial statements of the De-
partment, including the financial statements of the FHA and
Ginnie Mae.
REAC Inspections.—The Committee directs the Office of Inspec-
tor General to conduct a review of all HUD-assisted properties with
REAC scores of 60–70 over the past year, including how many had
exigent health and safety deficiencies, how those properties com-
pare to those with failing scores, the adequacy of HUD oversight
and management of those inspections and properties, and the im-
pact of HUD staffing reductions and contract cancellations on the
oversight of these properties. The Committee directs the Office of
Inspector General to provide this report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of the enactment of
this act.

INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
ACCESS BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,955,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 9,955,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Access Board is responsible for developing design guidelines
for the build environment, transit vehicles, information commu-
nications technology, and medical diagnostic equipment under the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–336) and
other laws. The Access Board also enforces the Architectural Bar-
riers Act, ensuring accessibility to a wide range of federally funded
facilities, including national parks, post offices, social security of-
fices, and prisons. In addition, the Access Board provides training
and technical assistance on its guidelines and standards to Federal
agencies, public and private organizations, individuals, and busi-
nesses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $9,955,000 for the operations of the
Access Board. This level of funding is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $40,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Maritime Commission [FMC] is an independent reg-
ulatory agency, which administers the Shipping Act of 1984 (Public
Law 98–237), as amended by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of
1998 (Public Law 105–258); section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920 (41 Stat. 998); the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988
(Public Law 100–418); Public Law 89–777; and the Ocean Shipping
Reform Act of 2022 (OSRA 2022, Public Law 117–146).
The FMC’s mission is to foster a fair, efficient, and reliable inter-
national ocean transportation system and to protect the public from
unfair and deceptive practices. To accomplish this mission, the
FMC regulates the international waterborne commerce of the
United States. In addition, the FMC has responsibility for licensing
(157)
158
and bonding ocean transportation intermediaries and for ensuring
that vessel owners or operators establish financial responsibility to
pay judgments for death or injury to passengers, or nonperform-
ance of a cruise, on voyages from United States ports.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $40,000,000 for the salaries and ex-
penses of the FMC for fiscal year 2026, which is equal to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.
NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $29,240,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 29,240,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Inspector General for Amtrak was created by the
Inspector General Act Amendment of 1988 (Public Law 100–504).
The act recognized Amtrak as a ‘‘designated Federal entity’’ and re-
quired the railroad to establish an independent and objective unit
to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the
programs and operations of Amtrak; recommend policies designed
to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Amtrak, and
prevent and detect fraud and abuse; and to provide a means for
keeping the Amtrak leadership and the Congress fully informed
about problems in Amtrak operations and the corporation’s
progress in taking corrective action.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $29,240,000 for the
Amtrak Office of Inspector General. This funding level is equal to
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee retains language
that requires the Amtrak Office of Inspector General to submit a
budget request in similar format and substance to those submitted
by other executive agencies in the Federal Government.
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $145,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 145,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Initially established along with the Department of Transpor-
tation, the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] com-
menced operations on April 1, 1967, as an independent Federal
agency. The Board is charged by Congress with investigating every
civil aviation accident in the United States, as well as significant
accidents in the other modes of transportation—railroad, highway,
marine, and pipeline—and issuing safety recommendations aimed
at preventing future accidents. Although it has always operated
159
independently, NTSB relied on the DOT for funding and adminis-
trative support until the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974
(Public Law 93–633) severed all ties between the two organizations
starting in 1975.
In addition to its investigatory duties, NTSB is responsible for
maintaining the Government’s database of civil aviation accidents
and also conducts special studies of transportation safety issues of
national significance. Furthermore, in accordance with the provi-
sions of international treaties, NTSB supplies investigators to serve
as U.S. accredited representatives for aviation accidents overseas
involving U.S. registered aircraft, or involving aircraft or major
components of U.S. manufacture. NTSB also serves as the ‘‘court
of appeals’’ for any airman, mechanic, or mariner whenever certifi-
cate action is taken by the FAA or the U.S. Coast Guard Com-
mandant, or when civil penalties are assessed by the FAA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $145,000,000 for the NTSB, which
is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee re-
mains concerned with private companies that have voluntarily
signed a party agreement with the NTSB, who have the privilege
of receiving investigative information (as defined in 59 CFR 831.13)
from the NTSB during the investigation, but have repeatedly vio-
lated the terms of such agreement. The Committee fully supports
the use of the party system in NTSB’s investigations, and directs
the NTSB to notify other entities party to an investigation if any
entity with party status violates the terms of the party agreement.
NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION
PAYMENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $158,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 158,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation was created by the
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act (Title VI of the Hous-
ing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, Public Law
95–557) and operates under the trade name ‘‘NeighborWorks Amer-
ica’’. NeighborWorks provides financial, technical, and training as-
sistance to community-based organizations that work in partner-
ship with community residents, the private sector, and local gov-
ernments to promote community revitalization and affordable hous-
ing opportunities. These partnership-based organizations are inde-
pendent, tax-exempt, non-profit entities, collectively known as the
‘‘NeighborWorks Network.’’ The NeighborWorks Network consists
of nearly 250 local and regional organizations that serve individ-
uals, families, and communities in every State, the District of Co-
lumbia, and Puerto Rico.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $158,000,000 for NeighborWorks,
which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee
directs NeighborWorks to provide at least three days’ advance no-
160
tice to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior
to the announcement of any grant exceeding $50,000 that is award-
ed to a NeighborWorks Network organization. The Committee
notes that awarding formula grant funds in multiple installments,
as NeighborWorks has done in fiscal year 2025, adds inefficiency
and delays to what are intended to be flexible funds. As such, the
Committee directs NeighborWorks to notify network organizations
of their full formula grant award no later than the latter of 60 days
after enactment of this act or March 1, 2026 and to expeditiously
disburse those amounts.
Rural Areas.—The Committee commends NeighborWorks’ efforts
to build capacity in rural areas and urges NeighborWorks to con-
tinue those initiatives.
Multilingual Training Courses.—NeighborWorks is encouraged to
continue to develop and offer new professional development and
certification training courses and translated materials to meet the
needs of the Network and support its work on minority homeown-
ership.
Shared Equity Homeownership.—The Committee directs
NeighborWorks to work with affiliated organizations with extensive
experience in offering shared equity homeownership opportunities
as technical assistance providers and to continue to develop and en-
hance professional development offerings around shared equity
housing.
Policies and Procedures.—The Committee acknowledges that, as
of January 2025, all 10 of the recommendations from the GAO–23–
105944 report have been closed, which includes enhancing policies,
procedures, and internal controls related to procurement, whistle-
blowers, conflicts of interest, and audits, among others. The Com-
mittee stresses the importance of implementing these recommenda-
tions to ensure any future reports of wrongdoing are managed with
objectivity and independence, and appreciates that NeighborWorks
has committed the resources and staff needed to maintain these
policies and procedures.
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriation Cred c it o in ll g e c o ti f o f n se s t ting
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................. $47,452,000 $1,250,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................... 40,799,000 1,250,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Surface Transportation Board [STB] was created by the
Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (Public
Law 104–88). The Board is a five-member, bipartisan, decisionally
independent adjudicatory body responsible for the regulation of the
rail and pipeline industries and certain non-licensing regulations of
motor carriers and water carriers.
The STB’s rail oversight activities include rate reasonableness,
car service and interchange, mergers, line acquisitions, line con-
structions, and abandonments. The STB’s jurisdiction also includes
161
certain oversight of the intercity bus industry, non-energy and non-
water pipelines, intercity passenger rail, rate regulation of non-
contiguous domestic water transportation, and household goods
carriers.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of $40,799,000.
This funding level is $6,653,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. Included in the recommendation is $1,250,000 in fees,
which will offset the appropriated funding, resulting in a final ap-
propriation from the general fund estimated at no more than
$39,549,000
Regulatory Proceedings.—There remains a number of pending
regulatory proceedings that would reform existing regulations at
the STB. The Committee continues to encourage the STB to facili-
tate a timely and decisive regulatory process. For example, EP 704
‘‘Review of Commodity, Boxcar, and TOFC/COFC Exemptions,’’ was
first issued as a proposed rulemaking in 2016. The Committee di-
rects the STB to provide an update in writing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of the EP 704
proceeding within 120 days of the enactment of this act. Further,
the Committee notes a board member vacancy exists and urges the
administration to nominate the full complement of board members
to the STB as soon as possible.
Rail Rate Evaluation.—In 2015, the Transportation Research
Board of the National Academy of Sciences issued a report titled
‘‘Modernizing Freight Rail Regulation,’’ as authorized in section
9007 of Public Law 109–59. The report raised concerns with the
methodology used to identify unusually high rail rates. Since then,
the STB has taken steps to improve rate reasonableness. In 2020,
the Board commissioned a study, issued in March 2022, which ana-
lyzed and evaluated alternatives to its current economic model. In
December 2022, the Board issued two final rules establishing new
rate reasonableness procedures which provide two streamlined ap-
proaches for shippers and railroads to resolve smaller rate dis-
putes: final offer rate review and voluntary arbitration. However,
the STB was forced to remove the final offer rate review rule in
May 2025 following a decision by the Eighth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals vacating it. The Committee directs the STB to evaluate the
need to construct a new economic model of rail rates, the appro-
priate method for constructing such a model, and the authorization
and resources that would be required to construct the model. The
Committee directs the STB to provide this evaluation in writing to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 1 year
of enactment of this act.
Reorganization.—The Committee appreciates the STB submitting
a request to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
for approval of a reorganization plan. The proposal would reorga-
nize its staff offices by combining the Office of Proceedings and the
Office of the General Counsel into one legal office, as well as by
executing the Passenger Rail program as a Passenger Rail Flex
Team rather than as an office separate from other function-based
offices. Based on additional information provided by the STB, the
Committee understands that executing the Passenger Rail program
162
as a Passenger Rail Flex Team as proposed will still ensure the
STB can meet its passenger rail responsibilities and requirements
under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008
(division B of Public Law 110–432) and section 22309 of the IIJA.
Therefore, the Committee approves the reprogramming request as
submitted.
UNITED STATES INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS
OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,300,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness is an
independent agency created by the McKinney-Vento Homeless As-
sistance Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–77) to coordinate the Federal
response to homelessness. USICH was authorized to review Fed-
eral programs that assist homeless persons, to take necessary ac-
tions to reduce duplication, and to recommend improvements in
programs and activities conducted by Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments, as well as local volunteer organizations. USICH consists
of the heads of 19 Federal agencies, including the Departments of
Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services,
Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education,
Labor, and Transportation, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and other entities as deemed appropriate.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,000,000 for
USICH. This funding level is sufficient to sustain statutory staffing
levels as well as operational and reporting functions. The Com-
mittee directs USICH to brief the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act on how
it will staff the organization to carry out its statutory responsibil-
ities under 42 U.S.C. 11313.
Documentation Barriers for People Experiencing Homelessness.—
As noted in a 2024 GAO report [GAO–24–105435], documentation
requirements can often act as a barrier to assistance, especially
when homeless individuals are attempting to access assistance
across multiple agencies to exit homelessness, but strategies exist
to overcome those barriers. The Committee reminds USICH of the
requirement in Senate Report 118–70 to brief the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations on the actions taken in fiscal
years 2024 and 2025 to streamline eligibility and documentation
requirements that can often act as a barrier to assistance and any
actions planned for fiscal year 2026 to reduce barriers or promote
best practices.
Implementation of Best Practices.—To prevent USICH from mis-
using Federal funds through sharing inaccurate or misleading data
with Federal partners, community practitioners, and other stake-
holders, the Committee continues to direct USICH to ensure best
practices and evidence-based conclusions are central to any tech-
nical assistance and recommendations released by the agency.

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term congressionally
directed spending item means a provision or report language in-
cluded primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests). Following is a list of congressionally directed spending
items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this ex-
planatory statement, along with the name of each Senator who
submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item
so identified. Neither the Committee recommendation nor this re-
port contains any limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as
defined in rule XLIV.

OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF THE BILL
The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Re-
lated Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for a wide array
of Federal programs, mostly in the Departments of Transportation
[DOT] and Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. Programs in
the DOT support road, transit, rail, pipeline, maritime, and avia-
tion infrastructure development, as well as safety, oversight, and
enforcement across the various modes. Resources for HUD support
economic development, affordable housing production, and housing
assistance for those most in need, including the elderly, individuals
with disabilities, and people experiencing homelessness. The bill
also provides funding for the Federal Housing Administration
[FHA] and the Government National Mortgage Association [Ginnie
Mae] to continue their traditional roles of providing access to af-
fordable homeownership in the United States.
The bill, as reported, provides the proper balance of funding for
transportation, housing, and community development programs
and activities. It is consistent with the subcommittee’s allocation
for fiscal year 2026. All accounts in the bill have been closely exam-
ined and funding is provided to carry out the programs and activi-
ties of the DOT, HUD, and related agencies. Details on each of the
accounts and the Committee’s justifications for the funding levels
are included in this report.
PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY
During fiscal year 2026, for the purposes of the Balanced Budget
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as
amended, with respect to appropriations contained in the accom-
panying bill, the terms ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ [PPA] shall
mean any item for which a dollar amount is contained in appro-
priations acts (including joint resolutions providing continuing ap-
propriations), accompanying reports or explanatory statements of
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, or accom-
panying conference reports and joint explanatory statements of the
committee of conference. This definition shall apply to all programs
for which new budget (obligational) authority is provided, as well
as to discretionary grants and discretionary grant allocations made
through either bill, report, or joint explanatory statement language.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The Committee includes provisions in section 405 establishing
the authority by which funding available to the agencies in this
act, division J of Public Law 117–58, or previous appropriations
acts may be reprogrammed for other purposes. These provisions
specifically require the advanced notification and approval of the
(4)

5
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of any proposal
to reprogram funds that:
—creates a new program;
—eliminates a PPA;
—increases funds or personnel for any PPA for which funds have
been denied or restricted by the Congress;
—proposes to redirect funds that were directed in such reports
or explanatory statements for a specific activity to a different
purpose;
—augments an existing PPA in excess of $5,000,000 or 10 per-
cent, whichever is less;
—reduces an existing PPA by $5,000,000 or 10 percent, which-
ever is less; or
—creates, reorganizes, or restructures a branch, division, office,
bureau, board, commission, agency, administration, or depart-
ment different from the congressional budget justifications or
most recent organizational charts submitted to the Committees
on Appropriations or the report accompanying this act, which-
ever is more detailed. This direction applies to both the bill
and accompanying reports or joint explanatory statements.
The Committee retains the requirement that each agency submit
an operating plan to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 60 days after enactment of this act to es-
tablish the baseline for application of reprogramming and transfer
authorities provided in this act. Specifically, each agency should
provide a table for each appropriation with columns displaying the
prior year enacted level; budget request; adjustments made by Con-
gress; adjustments for rescissions, if appropriate; and the fiscal
year enacted level. The table shall delineate the appropriation and
prior year enacted level both by object class and by PPA, as de-
tailed in this act, accompanying reports or joint explanatory state-
ments, or in the budget appendix for the respective appropriations,
whichever is more detailed, and shall apply to all items for which
a dollar amount is specified and to all programs for which new
budget (obligational) authority is provided, as well as to discre-
tionary grants and discretionary grant allocations. In addition, the
operating plan shall include an organizational chart with the num-
ber of full-time personnel onboard as of the end of the most recent
pay period for each office as approved by this act or a report or
joint explanatory statement accompanying this act that provides
the same level for detail provided in the congressional budget jus-
tification or most recent organizational charts submitted to the
Committees on Appropriations, with an exception. The operating
plan must also identify items of special congressional interest.
The Committee expects the agencies and bureaus to submit re-
programming requests in a timely manner and to provide a thor-
ough explanation of the proposed reallocations, including a detailed
justification of increases and reductions and the specific impact the
proposed changes will have on the budget request for the following
fiscal year. Except in emergency situations, reprogramming re-
quests should be submitted no later than June 30.
The Committee expects each agency to manage its programs and
activities within the amounts appropriated by Congress. The Com-
mittee reminds agencies that reprogramming requests should be

6
submitted only in the case of an unforeseeable emergency or a situ-
ation that could not have been anticipated when formulating the
budget request for the current fiscal year. Further, the Committee
notes that when a Department or agency submits a reprogramming
or transfer request to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations and does not receive identical responses from the House
and Senate, it is the responsibility of the Department to reconcile
the House and Senate differences before proceeding, and if rec-
onciliation is not possible, to consider the request to reprogram
funds not approved.
The Committee would also like to clarify that these sections
apply to the working capital fund [WCF] for the DOT, and that no
funds may be obligated from such funds to augment programs,
projects or activities for which appropriations have been specifically
rejected by the Congress, or to increase funds or personnel for any
PPA above the amounts appropriated by this act or a report or
joint explanatory statement accompanying this act.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS
Budget justifications are the primary tool used by the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations to evaluate the resource re-
quirements and fiscal needs of agencies. Timely receipt of such
budget justifications is integral to the Committee’s ability to
produce an effective and efficient annual appropriations bill, as is
the prompt and comprehensive briefing of Committee staff on the
details of the President’s budget request. The Committee is aware
that the format and presentation of budget materials is largely left
to the agency within presentation objectives set forth by the Office
of Management and Budget [OMB]. The Committee expects all of
the budget justifications to provide the data needed to make appro-
priate and meaningful funding decisions. Section 424 of this act
outlines the information that agencies are required to include in
the congressional budget justification for fiscal year 2027. Among
other items, agencies shall use or provide a comparison to the ac-
count and sub-account structure provided under this act or a report
or joint explanatory statement accompanying this act; provide all
available budgetary resources from contract authority, mandatory
budget authority, advance appropriations, and discretionary au-
thority, including disaster and emergency-designated funding; pro-
vide detailed information on all programs, including detailed dis-
cussion of proposed new initiatives or changes to the agency’s fi-
nancial plan; and provide detailed tables and organizational charts
that delineate funding for salaries and expenses and the number
of full-time equivalent [FTE] and full-time positions [FTP] as well
as justifications for all funding and staffing changes, reorganiza-
tions, and restructurings at the same level of detail provided to
support the fiscal year 2025 budget justifications and amounts pro-
vided for salaries and expenses by the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act [IIJA] and any other supplemental or emergency-des-
ignated funding shall be presented separately. This shall include
all salaries and expenses funding and FTE/FTP provided by admin-
istrative takedowns from any and all budgetary resources. Advance
appropriations from division J of the IIJA includes takedowns for
administrative expenses, and amounts that are made available for

7
programmatic activities should not be used to exceed the adminis-
trative limitation specified in division J of the IIJA. FTEs funded
by division J are expected to be managed as a separate and distinct
resource and shall not be included or represented as an adjustment
to base in the annual discretionary budget request for salaries and
expenses.
The Committee is aware that the analytical materials required
for review by the Committee are unique to each agency in this act.
Therefore, the Committee expects that each agency will coordinate
with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in ad-
vance on its planned presentation for its budget justification mate-
rials in support of the fiscal year 2027 budget request.
TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENT
The Committee remains interested in increasing transparency
and accountability of Federal grant spending. The Departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education are directed by
the Stevens Amendment, section 505 of title V, division H of Public
Law 115–141, to require grantees to include the total cost of the
project, the percentage of Federal funds in the project or program,
and identify all of the sources of funding for the total project or
program in all public documents announcing the grant award. The
Committee directs agencies to collect data on what information
Federal grant recipients currently include in the public documents
announcing the grant award to determine whether recipients of
funding in this act could comply with the Stevens Amendment
without unreasonable burden. The Committee expresses apprecia-
tion for the Department that has submitted the report and again
reminds the remaining Department to provide the report required
in fiscal year 2020 on the feasibility of complying with the Stevens
Amendment.
FEDERAL TRUST AND TREATY RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee reminds agencies funded by this act of their obli-
gation to uphold the Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to
Tribes and Federal obligations to the Native Hawaiian community.
This includes upholding treaty and reserved rights, and any other
rights and obligations under Federal law; supporting self-deter-
mination efforts by Native communities; and conducting early and
robust government-to-government consultation with Tribes, and
meaningful outreach and engagement with Native Hawaiians.
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Committee directs the DOT and HUD to provide the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations with quarterly written
notifications on the status of pending reports required by this and
prior appropriations acts. The agencies are reminded that these re-
ports are important to the Committee’s ability to carry out its over-
sight responsibilities, and each agency is expected to comply with
specified deadlines.

8
AUDIT STANDARDS
The Committee is concerned about Federal agencies executing
contracts with certain independent financial auditing and audit re-
mediation firms that have been penalized for poor auditing prac-
tices. The Committee believes that all firms contracting with de-
partments and agencies funded in this act, particularly for finan-
cial auditing and accounting services, should have qualified profes-
sionals and ethics, and integrity controls in place to ensure they
are in compliance with Federal accounting and procurement stand-
ards. For all contract actions (including awards, renewals, and
amendments), Departments and agencies funded in this act shall
require any accounting firm providing financial auditing or audit
remediation services to provide a statement setting forth the de-
tails of any disciplinary proceedings occurring within 1 year of the
projected performance period related to noncompliance with rules
or laws applying to audit services.
FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH
The Committee urges the DOT and HUD to affirmatively deter-
mine and make available on a publicly accessible website a jus-
tification that federally funded research grants or agreements pro-
mote the progress of science in the United States or will advance
a national security or economic interest.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM ALIGNMENT
The Committee remains steadfast in its commitment to reducing
duplicative inspections addressing the statutory, regulatory, and
procedural barriers that add time and cost to affordable housing
projects that are developed with multiple Federal funding sources.
The Committee commends HUD for issuing several rules recently
to improve alignment across Federal affordable housing programs
and reduce administrative burdens on grantees. The actions taken
by HUD to update the community development block grant [CDBG]
and HOME investment partnerships [HOME] programs regula-
tions, as well as to implement the Housing Opportunity Through
Modernization Act of 2016 [HOTMA] will streamline and simplify
coordination. However, the Committee notes continued challenges
within HUD to align and streamline efforts across other Federal
agencies. The Committee directs HUD, in coordination with the In-
ternal Revenue Service [IRS] and other Federal agencies, to take
steps, within existing authorities, to streamline and better coordi-
nate Federal affordable housing development incentives and pro-
grams with the goals of simplifying the work necessary for devel-
opers to build the capital stack for affordable housing and redevel-
opment projects and minimizing the need for duplicative inspec-
tions. The Committee directs HUD, in coordination with the IRS
and other agencies, to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations no later than 180 days after enactment of this
act on policy recommendations to address statutory barriers and to
identify additional authorities necessary to further this goal.

9
FOREIGN MALIGN INFLUENCE MITIGATION
For more than a decade, adversaries of the United States—pri-
marily Russia, China, and Iran—have utilized foreign malign influ-
ence [FMI] to conduct influence operations against the Nation to
create divisiveness and fracture communities. Per the Department
of Homeland Security [DHS], FMI refers to the deliberate and cov-
ert actions, such as disinformation campaigns and propaganda,
used by foreign governments, organizations, or individuals to ma-
nipulate, disrupt, or undermine that political, social, or economic
stability of another country. FMI aims to create their own nar-
rative to shape public opinion, destabilize democratic processes,
sow discord, and advance the interests of the foreign actor. These
influence operations generally target politically charged issues, but
the Committee is concerned that our adversaries are exploiting
U.S. transportation incidents, infrastructure, and companies in an
effort to instill a fear of travel and to undermine the economy with
an adversarial narrative. To gain a better understanding, scope,
and impact of these nefarious efforts, the Committee directs the
DOT to coordinate efforts with the Office of the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence [ODNI] Foreign Malign Influence Center and
the National Center for Narrative Intelligence [NCNI] to produce
a public report on state backed influence operations on U.S. trans-
portation infrastructure and transportation companies.

TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
Section 3 of the Department of Transportation Act of October 15,
1966 (Public Law 89–670), provides for the establishment of the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Transportation [OST]. OST is comprised of
the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary immediate and support of-
fices; the Office of the General Counsel; the Office of the Under
Secretary of Transportation for Policy, including the offices of the
Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, the As-
sistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, and the Assistant Sec-
retary for Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy; five As-
sistant Secretarial offices for Budget and Programs, Governmental
Affairs, Research and Technology, and Administration; and the Of-
fices of Public Affairs and Public Engagement, the Executive Secre-
tariat, Intelligence, Security and Emergency Response, the Chief
Information Officer, and Tribal Government Affairs. OST also in-
cludes the Department’s Office of Civil Rights and the Depart-
ment’s working capital fund.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $191,295,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 185,965,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation finances the costs of policy development and
central supervisory and coordinating functions necessary for the
overall planning and direction of the Department. It covers the im-
mediate secretarial offices as well as those of the assistant secre-
taries and the general counsel.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $185,965,000 for the salaries and
expenses of OST, including $70,000 for reception and representa-
tion expenses. The recommendation is $5,330,000 less than the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee recommendation authorizes the Secretary to
transfer up to 4 percent of the funds among the purposes funded
in the Office of the Secretary. The bill also continues language that
permits up to $2,500,000 of fees to be credited to the Office of the
Secretary for salaries and expenses. The Committee recommenda-
tion supports the realignment of individual office WCF expenses
being streamlined into one shared services account, as well as the
(10)

11
realignment of information technology development, modernization,
and enhancement [IT DME] efforts.
The following table summarizes the Committee’s recommenda-
tion in comparison to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

World Cup, Olympic, and Paralympic Events.—The Committee
recognizes that the mobility needs of competitors, supporting staff,
and spectators place high demands on the transportation and infra-
structure systems in U.S. cities hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup
and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic events. These include providing
safe and reliable event-specific mass transportation operations
across aviation, road, rail, and transit systems for attendees, resi-
dents, and visitors to the United States. The Committee directs the
Department to expedite technical assistance and to exercise flexi-
bilities in providing Federal resources, funding, approvals, and
waivers in a timely manner to the host cities, States, local govern-
ments, regional or metropolitan agencies, transit agencies, airport
and public authorities, and associated entities to enable adequate
preparation for the events.
The DHS designating the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games
as a national special security event commits all Federal agencies
to provide full cooperation and support to ensure the safety of all
participants. Because significant resources will need to be dedi-
cated to the planning, design, and implementation of transit infra-
structure over the next 3 years, the Secretary shall report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the full scope
of the DOT’s obligations, including the nature of its coordination
with other Federal agencies and departments, as well as represent-
atives of the relevant State and local transportation entities in-
volved in the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The report
shall also include the host locations’ projected resource needs for
fiscal year 2027 through fiscal year 2029, including specific account
details for each fiscal year.

12
IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Secretary of Transportation provides leadership and has the
primary responsibility to provide overall planning, direction, and
control of the Department.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $3,764,000 for the Immediate Office
of the Secretary, which is $6,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. The Committee directs the Department to abide by
both the will and intent of Congress in all funding and policy deci-
sions, and to consult with the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations prior to issuing all notices of funding opportunities
[NOFOs].
IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SECRETARY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Deputy Secretary has the primary responsibility of assisting
the Secretary in the overall planning and direction of the Depart-
ment.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,348,000 for the Immediate Office
of the Deputy Secretary, which is $22,000 less than the fiscal year
2025 enacted level.
OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of the General Counsel provides legal services to the
Office of the Secretary, including the conduct of aviation regulatory
proceedings, and coordinates and reviews the legal work in the
chief counsels’ offices of the operating administrations. The General
Counsel is the chief legal officer of the Department and the final
authority on all legal questions.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $27,780,000 for the Office of the
General Counsel, which is $4,492,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Of the amount provided, not less than $8,000,000 is
to continue the Department’s efforts to address aviation consumer
complaints and related consumer aviation activities as well as im-
plement aviation consumer protection laws through the Office of
Aviation Consumer Protection within the Office of the General
Counsel.
Aviation Consumer Complaints.—The number of air travel serv-
ice complaints surged to an unprecedented level of 102,561 in 2020
versus 15,332 in 2019, an increase of 569 percent. Since that time,
complaints have de-escalated, but remain unacceptably high at a
rate of 86,240 in 2022, 96,853 in 2023, and 97,906 in 2024. There-
fore, the Committee directs the Department to report to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations an annual summary of

13
air travel consumer complaints from the preceding year accounting
for flight delays; mishandled baggage, wheelchairs, and scooters;
over sales; airlines reports of the loss, injury, or death of animals
during transportation; customer reports to the Transportation Se-
curity Administration; and other consumer complaints. Further,
the bill requires the Secretary to report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the implementation of all sec-
tions under title V of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 not
later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR POLICY
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Under Secretary for Policy is the chief policy officer of the
Department and is responsible for the analysis, development, and
review of policies and plans for domestic and international trans-
portation matters. The office administers the economic regulatory
functions regarding the airline industry and is responsible for
international aviation programs, the essential air service program,
airline fitness licensing, acquisitions, international route awards,
computerized reservation systems, and special investigations. With-
in this office, the IIJA also created an Office of Multimodal Freight
Infrastructure and Policy [MFIP] to oversee certain multimodal
freight grant programs, carry out the National multimodal freight
policy, and facilitate the movement of freight across and within dif-
ferent modes of transportation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $20,222,000 for the Office of the
Under Secretary for Policy, which is $158,000 more than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. Of the amount provided, $1,970,000 is for
the MFIP and $2,000,000 is for the freight logistics optimization
works [FLOW] program.
Competitive Grants.—The Committee strongly believes in the im-
portance of Federal competitive grant programs that provide fund-
ing above Federal formula programs and allow both State and local
transportation agencies to build and maintain infrastructure that
would otherwise not receive Federal funding. While reaching a
grant agreement between the Department and a grant recipient
can be a time-consuming and burdensome process, the grant agree-
ment is critical to ensuring grantees meet all Federal requirements
and make prudent use of taxpayer funding. The Committee appre-
ciates the Department’s progress in approving over 1,900 competi-
tive grant awards for obligation since January 2025, but remains
concerned that the on-going review of previously awarded competi-
tive grants is slowing down transportation projects in every State
and leading to unnecessary delays and cost increases. The Com-
mittee directs the DOT to expeditiously complete its reviews to
minimize impacts on grantees. Further, the Committee directs the
Department to continue helping at-risk grantees and in particular
grantees whose funds have an obligation deadline of September 30,
2026. The Committee directs the Department to prioritize staffing
increases in the relevant division, regional, or field offices that can
help improve the timeliness of reaching grant agreements, espe-

14
cially given the significant losses in staffing the Department has
recently experienced. In order to bring greater transparency to this
process, the Committee directs the Department to provide the sta-
tus of all awarded but not obligated competitive grant and commu-
nity project funding/congressionally directed spending projects. The
Department shall provide a list of all such awards by program, fis-
cal year, and grantee, and include the name of the project, the
state of the project location, the original amount of the award when
announced, and the amount obligated to date. The Department
shall provide the data to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations not later than 120 days after the enactment of this act
and biannually after the first submission of such data.
FLOW Program.—The Committee continues to support the De-
partment’s efforts to improve supply chain resiliency through the
FLOW program, and industry-supported data-sharing network, and
is pleased with the progress the FLOW program has made in im-
proving the transparency of the supply chain. The Committee en-
courages the DOT to consider integrating commercially available
artificial intelligence and machine learning tools into the FLOW
program. Further, the Committee directs the Department to coordi-
nate with the DHS Supply Chain Resiliency Center [SCRC] to im-
prove forecasting and scenario planning for various supply chain
disruptions, including staffing at U.S. ports.
Cargo Theft Prevention.—The Committee recognizes the substan-
tial increase in cargo theft that has affected the transportation sup-
ply chain over the last few years. The Committee directs the De-
partment to coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Investigations
[FBI], the Department of Justice, the DHS SCRC, and relevant
stakeholders, including professional policing organizations, to pro-
vide a report on cargo theft trends in the transportation supply
chain, along with a strategy to combat cargo theft, to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations not later than 120 days
after enactment of this act.
Department Policies.—The Department’s current statement of
international air transportation policy was last updated in 1995
and is now almost 30 years old. The Committee once again directs
the Department to brief the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations on the status of this policy document not later than
120 days after enactment of this act.
Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything Safety Technology.—The Com-
mittee commends the Department’s commitment to reducing deaths
and serious injuries on our Nation’s roadways. The Department’s
October 2023 draft report Saving Lives with Connectivity: A Plan
to Accelerate V2X Deployment calls cellular vehicle-to-everything
[C–V2X] technologies a ‘‘powerful tool for achieving its ambitious,
long-term goal’’ of eliminating roadway fatalities. C–V2X enables
vehicles to communicate with each other, with other road users
such as pedestrians and cyclists, and with roadside infrastructure.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to find ways to
incentivize and accelerate the deployment of cellular C–V2X tech-
nologies through coordinated actions across modal agencies, includ-
ing incorporation into the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration’s [NHTSA’s] new car assessment program [NCAP] and
through program guidance, NOFOs for discretionary grant pro-

15
grams, and national roadway safety strategy implementation. Fur-
ther, the Committee directs the Department to update and publish
its draft report Saving Lives with Connectivity: A Plan to Accelerate
V2X Deployment.
Communications Services for Limited English Proficient Commu-
nities.—The Committee directs the Department to continue improv-
ing multi-lingual communications, which should include mediums
such as television and radio, to reach limited English proficient
[LEP] communities. However, to improve implementation, the
Committee encourages the DOT to review its communication prac-
tices and create uniform applications across all modes, as appro-
priate, in order to strengthen communication including through
digital, television, and radio advertising. The Committee further di-
rects agencies at the DOT that engage in educational outreach
campaigns to report to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations on their annual advertising budgets not later than 90
days after enactment of this act.
Digital Twin Technologies.—The Committee understands the po-
tential that digital infrastructure technologies, including software
and related services, have in modernizing our Nation’s existing and
future infrastructure. These technologies have the potential to re-
duce project costs, accelerate project delivery, and build more inno-
vative, resilient, and efficient infrastructure, including bridges and
other surface transportation assets. As such, the Committee directs
the Department to include digital infrastructure technologies in
NOFOs in an effort to leverage Federal resources to the maximum
extent possible and to bring the U.S. into the next generation of
bridge design, construction, operations, and maintenance. The
Committee also directs the Department to ensure non-Federal
stakeholders are informed of the eligibility of technology in the de-
livery of federally funded projects.
Transportation Workforce Outreach Program.—The Committee
strongly supports initiatives to encourage awareness of career op-
portunities in the transportation sector. The Committee directs the
Department to implement the transportation workforce outreach
program as authorized in section 25020 of the IIJA. Further, the
Committee directs the Department to utilize program funds to sup-
port the development, production, and use of broadcast, digital, and
print media advertising and outreach efforts as part of a public
awareness campaign.
Foreign Control of Helicopter Operators.—The Committee expects
the Department to address allegations of U.S. carriers under actual
foreign control that are operating between two U.S. points for com-
pensation without satisfying 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(15) and to take en-
forcement or other action as appropriate on such carriers found to
be operating in violation of existing law.
Battery Powered Mobility Devices.—The Committee notes the
rapid rise of battery powered mobility devices in the United States,
and the limitations of current battery options due to long charge
times and limited life cycles. As such, the Department is encour-
aged to support the development of hybrid supercapacitor-lithium-
ion battery modules to improve the performance and accessibility
of battery powered mobility devices.

sistant Secretary for Research and Technology, which is
$16,335,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to continue to improve the represen-
tation of administrative costs for the office and directs the Depart-
ment to include details relating to staffing levels across activities
in future budget justifications. The following table provides funding
levels for activities within this account, and includes programmatic
and staffing related to such activities.
Recommendation
Highly automated systems safety center of excellence .................................................................................. $4,000,000
PNT technologies and GPS backup.................................................................................................................. 3,000,000
Advanced research projects agency-infrastructure [ARPA–I] initiative .......................................................... 9,000,000
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing [PNT] Technologies and
Global Positioning System [GPS] Backup.—The Committee rec-
ommendation provides $3,000,000 to support this initiative estab-
lished by Congress in 2022 that allows for the wide adoption of
multiple technologies that provide the necessary GPS backup and
complementary PNT technologies as identified in 2021 in the Com-
plementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstration Re-
port (DOT–VNTSC–20–07). The Department is directed to use the
funds provided in this and prior year appropriations acts to enable
the deployment of commercial solutions that provide permanent
complementary PNT services. The Committee also encourages the
Department to use enhanced contracting authority, such as: cooper-
ative agreements, cooperative research, and development agree-
ments, or small business innovation research [SBIR] to deploy such
services rapidly.

20
ARPA–I.—The recommendation includes $9,000,000 to support
ARPA–I as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 119, and the open research
initiative as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 5506. The funding will ad-
vance and deploy technology products that have the potential to
transform transportation systems and the way they are used. The
Committee is aware of the significant number of bridges across the
country in need of repair or replacement and the high costs associ-
ated with traditional bridge construction and maintenance tech-
niques and materials. Therefore, of the amount provided for
ARPA–I, $6,000,000 is to support ARPA–I’s work to advance and
deploy composite material technology for short- and medium-span
bridge construction in order to reduce costs and improve bridge life-
spans.
Ferry Decarbonization Data.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to collect additional data in conjunction with the national
census of ferry operators [NCFO] to better understand the condi-
tion of the existing domestic ferry fleet, including the baseline
emissions, engine model year, segment layover duration, and exist-
ing electric utility infrastructure at terminal. Additionally, the De-
partment shall obtain information on whether the respondent has
specified published emissions reductions goals, what those specific
emissions reductions goals are, and whether each organization
maintains a long-range fleet capitalization plan. Responses to the
NCFO shall be mandatory.
Infrastructure Durability.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of ensuring long-lasting transportation improvements that
are capable of withstanding extreme events, natural disasters, and
other potential impacts to ensure durability, efficiency, and cost ef-
fectiveness. The DOT has published research showing the advances
in the science of concrete materials and specifically the enhanced
durability benefits and exceptional performance of ultra-high-per-
formance concrete [UHPC]. The Committee directs the Department
to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
on the use of UHPC in Federal infrastructure projects and how the
use of such materials are expected to improve the overall lifespan
of federally funded infrastructure projects.
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $345,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 250,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This program provides grants and credit assistance to State and
local governments, Tribes, transit agencies, ports, or a collaboration
of such entities for capital investments in surface transportation in-
frastructure that will have a significant impact on the Nation, a
metropolitan area, or a region. Eligible projects include highways
and bridges, public transportation, freight and passenger rail, and
port infrastructure. The Department awards grants on a competi-
tive basis; however, the Department must ensure an equitable geo-
graphic distribution of funds and an appropriate balance in ad-

21
dressing the needs of urban and rural communities, including Trib-
al areas.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $250,000,000 for grants and credit
assistance as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 6702, which is
$95,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The national infrastructure investments program, known again
as the BUILD program, has become integral to improving safety
and mobility in communities throughout the country for more than
a decade. The outcome-oriented selection criteria that includes
state of good repair, economic competitiveness, quality of life, envi-
ronmental sustainability, safety, innovation, and partnership, nur-
tures stronger applications and results in successful multimodal
projects. Given the importance of infrastructure reuse projects for
transportation, economic development, emissions reduction, and
recreation, the Committee encourages the Department to consider
supporting infrastructure reuse projects.
Geographic Distribution.—The Committee continues to believe
that our Federal infrastructure programs must benefit commu-
nities across the country. The Committee continues to require the
Secretary to award grants and credit assistance in a manner that
ensures an equitable geographic distribution of funds and an ap-
propriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural com-
munities, including Tribal areas.
Mega Grants.—The Committee recognizes that inland ports are
an important element in the international supply chain, increasing
intermodal capacity and efficiencies in the movement of global com-
merce from ships to major transportation networks for distribution.
Benefits include reduced congestion at marine terminals and on the
Nation’s highways, lower costs of moving cargo, environmental and
safety benefits, economic development in underserved or rural
areas, as well as consolidation of import/export centers. Within the
advance appropriations for this program, the Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to consider mega grant applications that include
the development of coastal and inland ports that provide supply
chain improvements and reduce supply chain disruption and to
continue to support major infrastructure projects that are too com-
plex or costly for traditional funding sources while likely gener-
ating significant national or regional benefits.
Further, the Committee notes that the mega grant program was
designed to be a multi-modal transportation program, including to
support transit projects. Specifically, 49 U.S.C. 6701(d)(1)(E) makes
transit projects eligible that are ‘‘part of’’ eligible highway or
bridge, freight intermodal or rail, highway-rail grade crossing, or
intercity passenger rail projects. Within the advance appropriations
for this program, the Committee encourages the Secretary to con-
sider mega grant applications for transit projects that are ‘‘part of’’
otherwise eligible projects under the program.
NATIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND INNOVATIVE FINANCE
BUREAU
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,558,000

Transit Oriented Development.—Maximizing a community’s ac-
cess to DOT financing for transit oriented development has the po-
tential to make affordable and mixed-income housing projects co-lo-
cate near rail and transit infrastructure possible due to the pro-
gram’s favorable lending rates compared to the private market. The
Committee supports the efforts of the Departments in this act to
leverage HUD expertise in housing development financing to
streamline the application process for loans under the DOT’s
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act [TIFIA]
credit program and the RRIF program. To that end, the DOT and
HUD shall establish a task force to examine ways to leverage exist-
ing underwriting procedures and proformas that are familiar to
housing developers for use in the TIFIA and RRIF application proc-
ess, to explore opportunities to layer Federal financing to meet the
investment grade rating requirement of TIFIA, to address timing
challenges for projects with multiple financing sources, and to min-
imize the need for duplicative credit reviews. The Committee di-
rects the task force to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on its priority objectives, assessment of adminis-
trative and statutory barriers, and planned action items and mile-
stones not later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
RURAL AND TRIBAL INFRASTRUCTURE ADVANCEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $25,000,000

gaps in the Department’s cyber security. The initiative includes
support for essential program enhancements, infrastructure im-
provements, and contractual resources to enhance the security of
the Department’s computer network and reduce the risk of security
breaches.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $60,000,000 to support the Sec-
retary’s cyber security initiative, which is $11,000,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $18,228,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 12,228,000

research, and development activities needed to assist the Secretary
in the formulation of national transportation policies. The program
is carried out primarily through contracts with other Federal agen-
cies, educational institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and
private firms.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $34,259,000 for transportation plan-
ning, research, and development, which is $13,333,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Within this funding level, the
Committee recommendation includes $9,647,000 to accommodate
congressionally directed spending [CDS] for eligible projects. The
Committee directs the Office of the Secretary to provide funding for
those projects listed in the table at the end of this report in the
corresponding amounts.
Flight 5342.—In light of the traffic accident of American Eagle
Flight 5342 with an U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter, the Com-
mittee remains fully committed to ensuring no such accident occurs
again. As such, the Committee recommendation includes
$2,000,000 for the DOT to commission the National Academies of
Science within 30 days of enactment of this act to conduct an inde-
pendent review of airspace design, civil-military coordination, and
operational safety in the National Capital Region, with particular
focus on airspace activities at Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport [DCA]. The review shall be conducted by an independent
panel of experts in aviation safety, airspace operations, and civil-

25
military coordination. Panel members shall be selected by the Na-
tional Academies of Science, in consultation with the National
Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations, and other relevant authorizing commit-
tees. Panel members shall include representatives from academia,
former regulators currently unaffiliated with the Federal Aviation
Administration [FAA] or the Department of Defense [DoD], rel-
evant industry partners, stakeholders, unions, and nationally rec-
ognized safety institutions. The panel shall be formed within 90
days of enactment of this act. The review shall assess: (1) historical
and ongoing risks associated with DCA airspace design and usage,
including historical incidents relevant to current protocols; (2) the
adequacy of coordination protocols between the FAA, DoD, and
other entities involved in or affected by airspace coordination; (3)
patterns of near-miss incidents involving military aircraft; and (4)
structural, cultural, or procedural barriers to risk identification and
accountability. The DOT and the FAA shall: (1) not chair, direct,
or control the panel’s work; (2) allocate sufficient resources to en-
sure timely completion of the review; and (3) provide full coopera-
tion, including access to non-classified data, documentation, and
personnel. The DOT and FAA shall fully cooperate with the Na-
tional Academies of Science and respond to all requests for data,
including by coordinating with the DoD to provide their data. The
National Academies of Science shall issue a summary of findings
and recommendations as determined by the panel not later than
180 days after enactment of this act. The findings and rec-
ommendations shall convey key conclusions without redacting non-
sensitive procedural information, and shall be submitted to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and published
online not later than 180 days after enactment of this act. The full
report of the panel shall be submitted to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than 210 days after enact-
ment of this act. The DOT and the FAA shall respond publicly in
writing to the recommendations of the panel within 90 days of pub-
lication of the final report.
Human Trafficking.—Globally, millions of people are subject to
human trafficking and forced labor. The vast majority of inter-
national human trafficking journeys cross through official border
control points such as airports and land borders. Educating and
empowering travelers and transportation employees of the indica-
tors of this abuse of human rights is a valuable prevention mecha-
nism that can enhance community-coordinated responses and sup-
port informed interventions. The Committee supports the DOT’s
‘‘Combating Human Trafficking in the Transportation Sector
Awareness Training’’ and directs the Department to encourage rel-
evant stakeholders, including airports, transit hubs, and recipients
of financial assistance from the Department, to implement com-
prehensive policies to combat human trafficking and support sur-
vivors based on guidance and recommendations from DOT’s Advi-
sory Committee on Human Trafficking.

WORKING CAPITAL FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $522,165,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 650,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The WCF provides technical and administrative services to the
Department’s operating administrations and other Federal entities.
The services are centrally performed in the interest of economy and
efficiency, are funded through negotiated agreements with the De-
partment’s operating administrations and other Federal customers,
and are billed on a fee-for-service basis to the maximum extent
possible.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation of $650,000,000 on ac-
tivities financed through the WCF, which is $127,835,000 more
than the limit enacted for fiscal year 2025. As in past years, the
bill specifies that the limitation on the WCF shall apply only to the
Department and not to services provided for other entities. The
Committee directs services to be provided on a competitive basis to
the maximum extent possible.
Consolidation Efforts.—The Committee appreciates the Depart-
ment’s efforts to identify opportunities to derive efficiencies in oper-
ations across the Department and its modal administrations. While
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have pre-
viously prohibited the Department from expanding activities within
the WCF to include non-commodity IT, the Committee recognizes
the potential for economies of scale and efficiencies that could be
gained by the Department by expanding the WCF’s existing work
on commodity IT to non-commodity IT activities. However, the
Committee remains concerned with the lack of a clearly defined
plan for the consolidation of non-commodity IT activities. The bill
specifies how the Department may proceed with the consolidation
of non-commodity IT activities and requires the Secretary to pro-
vide a plan to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
describing the non-commodity IT consolidation not less than 30
days prior to using the authorities provided within the bill. Such
plan shall include details on the IT programs and systems being
consolidated, the modal administrations participating in such con-
solidation, impacts on staffing within the OST and any partici-
pating modal administration, the expected costs and benefits to the
OST and any participating modal administrations from such con-
solidation, and the expected timeline for such consolidation.
SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS UTILIZATION AND OUTREACH
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $5,330,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,330,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides contractual support to assist small,
women-owned, Native American, and other disadvantaged business

27
firms in securing contracts and subcontracts for transportation-re-
lated projects that involve Federal spending. Separate funding is
provided for these activities since this program provides grants and
contract assistance that serve Department-wide goals and not just
OST purposes.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $5,330,000 for the Office of Small
and Disadvantaged Business Utilization and Outreach, which is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee directs
the office to provide a briefing to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations on certification requirements for the dis-
advantaged business enterprise determinations regarding Tribal
entities.
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program.—The Committee
recognizes the critical role that the Department’s Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise [DBE] program has played in the success of
women- and minority-owned businesses since its inception in 1983.
The Committee directs the Department to carefully consider the
impact of any proposed changes to the program on the success of
women- and minority-owned firms and on economic development in
the transportation sector.
PAYMENTS TO AIR CARRIERS
(AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $450,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 513,637,231
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides funding for the essential air service
[EAS] program, which was created to continue air service to com-
munities that had received federally mandated air service prior to
deregulation of commercial aviation in 1978. The program cur-
rently provides subsidies to air carriers serving small communities
that meet certain criteria.
The FAA collects user fees that cover the air traffic control serv-
ices the agency provides to aircraft that neither take off from, nor
land in, the United States. These fees are commonly referred to as
‘‘overflight fees’’ and the receipts from the fees are used to help fi-
nance the EAS program.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
Appropriations Mandatory Total
Appropriations, 2025 ..................................................................... $450,000,000 $166,091,000 $616,091,000
Committee recommendation .......................................................... 513,637,231 173,891,000 687,528,231
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $513,637,231 for
the EAS program. This appropriation is in addition to an estimated
$173,891,000 from overflight fees collected by the FAA, allowing
the Department to support a total program level for EAS of

FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for the safe
movement of civil aviation and the evolution of a national system
of airports. The Federal Government’s regulatory role in civil avia-
tion began with the creation of an Aeronautics Branch within the
Department of Commerce pursuant to the Air Commerce Act of
1926 (Public Law 69–254). This act instructed the agency to foster
air commerce; designate and establish airways; establish, operate,
and maintain aids to navigation; arrange for research and develop-
ment to improve such aids; issue airworthiness certificates for air-
craft and major aircraft components; and investigate civil aviation
accidents. In the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 (Public Law 75–
706), these activities were transferred to a new, independent agen-
cy named the Civil Aeronautics Authority. Congress streamlined
regulatory oversight in 1957 with the creation of two separate
agencies, the Federal Aviation Agency and the Civil Aeronautics
Board. When the DOT began its operations in 1967, the Federal
Aviation Agency was renamed the FAA and became one of several
modal administrations within DOT. The Civil Aeronautics Board
was later phased out with enactment of the Airline Deregulation
Act of 1978 (Public Law 95–504), and ceased to exist in 1984. Re-
sponsibility for the investigation of civil aviation accidents was
given to the National Transportation Safety Board in 1967. FAA’s
mission expanded in 1995 with the transfer of the Office of Com-
mercial Space Transportation from the Office of the Secretary, and
decreased in December 2001 with the transfer of civil aviation se-
curity activities to the Transportation Security Administration.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The total recommended funding level for the FAA for fiscal year
2026 amounts to $22,427,551,000, including new budget authority
and a limitation on the obligation of contract authority. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the Committee’s recommendations and

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides funds for the operation, mainte-
nance, communications, and logistical support of the air traffic con-
trol and air navigation systems. It also covers administrative and
managerial costs for the FAA’s regulatory, international, commer-
cial space, medical, research, engineering, and development pro-
grams, as well as policy oversight and agency management func-
tions. The operations appropriation includes the following major ac-
tivities:
—the Air Traffic Organization [ATO], which operates, on a 24-
hour daily basis, the National air traffic system, including the
establishment and maintenance of a national system of aids to
navigation, the development and distribution of aeronautical
charts and the administration of acquisition, and research and
development programs;
—the regulation and certification activities, including establish-
ment and surveillance of civil air regulations to ensure safety
and development of standards, rules and regulations governing
the physical fitness of airmen, as well as the administration of
an aviation medical research program;
—the Office of Commercial Space Transportation; and
—headquarters and support offices.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total of $13,818,183,000 for FAA
operations. This funding level is $335,400,000 more than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. As in past years, the FAA is directed to
report immediately to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations in the event resources are insufficient to operate a safe
and effective air traffic control system. The following table summa-
rizes the Committee’s recommendation in comparison to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level:

Funding Level.—The Committee provides $13,818,183,000 for
FAA operations, which is $335,400,000 above the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. This increase consists of $217,220,000 in adjustment
to base increases and the following discretionary adjustments:
—$97,253,000 for the controller hiring and training surge, with
a goal of hiring 2,500 new controllers in fiscal year 2026;
—$9,744,000 for air carrier surveillance and production over-
sight, to be prioritized for the FAA’s enhanced oversight of
Boeing;

31
—$35,000,000 for cybersecurity efforts; and
—$23,817,000 in funding reductions due to staffing decreases
(except for air traffic organization and aviation safety).
Staffing.—The Committee recommendation includes
$9,700,420,000 for the FAA’s personnel expenses. According to the
FAA, over 2,000 employees have accepted the DRP and will leave
the agency in the next few months. The Committee directs the FAA
to provide a complete list of positions that will not be filled due to
the employee accepting the DRP within 30 days of enactment of
this act. The Committee expects the FAA to accumulate hundreds
of millions of dollars in savings from the DRP, and directs the FAA
to provide a report on how such funds will be used.
Air Traffic Controller Hiring.—The Committee supports the
FAA’s efforts to hire 2,500 new air traffic controllers in fiscal year
2026. The FAA shall expand training at the FAA Training Acad-
emy at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center [MMAC] and sup-
plement these efforts by expanding air traffic controller training
through the air-traffic collegiate training initiative [AT–CTI] pro-
gram. The Committee directs the FAA to provide quarterly staffing
updates, including hiring and separations, by program office for all
positions funded by this and any other act, and to provide on a
quarterly basis: (1) the status of hiring new controllers; (2) actual
staffing levels, including hiring and separation levels, at all air
traffic control [ATC] facilities; and (3) flight delays at each ATC fa-
cility by category.
AT–CTI.—The FAA should ensure that all air traffic controller
trainees from the AT–CTI and enhanced-CTI programs are taught
according to the same rigorous and uniform standards, and the
FAA should closely monitor these programs and provide sufficient
oversight for each school. The Committee directs the FAA provide
within 270 days of enactment of this act a report on: (1) FAA hiring
and separation numbers for AT–CTI and E–CTI graduates; (2) the
total number of AT–CTI and E–CTI program graduates and the
proportion that seek employment as certified professional control-
lers [CPCs] within one calendar year of program completion; and
(3) a comparison of training performance, separation rates and at-
tainment of necessary qualifications between AT–CTI and E–CTI
graduates and the FAA-academy trained CPCs. For each hiring
pool opened in fiscal year 2026, the report shall contain the total
number of applicants, for AT–CTI, E–CTI, and the FAA academy,
who have: (1) applied for the position of air traffic controller; (2)
been issued a tentative offer letter for the position of air traffic con-
troller; (3) been issued a firm offer letter for the position of air traf-
fic controller; and (4) been hired for the position of air traffic con-
troller.
Designee Training.—The Committee directs the FAA to provide
a $9,000,000 increase for the Office of Aviation Safety [AVS] to im-
prove the training of designees, potential designees, and FAA em-
ployees assigned to provide oversight of designees authorized under
14 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 183. These funds should
also be used to increase the number of designees authorized under
14 CFR Parts 183.23, 183.25, 183.29, and 183.33, but only to the
extent that such designees will improve aviation safety. AVS may
select appropriate third-party providers, including educational in-

32
stitutions, to provide this training. This funding may facilitate the
effective use of designees to support the certification of new and
novel aircraft designs and other certificate activities, to the extent
permissible under current law.
Organization Chart.—The Committee directs the FAA to include
a more detailed organization chart as an exhibit to section one of
the President’s budget justification that provides not less than two
levels of offices below the Office of the Administrator and Deputy
Administrator for the Air Traffic Organization and the Office of the
Assistant Administrator for Aviation Safety.
NextGen Advisory Committee.—The FAA is directed to reinstate
the NextGen Advisory Committee, or a successor advisory com-
mittee or other forum through which aviation stakeholders convene
and help provide independent advice and recommendations to the
FAA and respond to specific taskings received directly from the
FAA.
Congested Airspace.—The Committee urges the FAA to increase
the use of performance based navigation instrument flight proce-
dures in congested airspace in order to enhance safety and oper-
ational efficiency through more precise and predictable aircraft
routing. The Committee directs the FAA to assess the impact of
limiting aircraft to those equipped with certain NextGen avionics
at times based on operational efficiency without leading to air serv-
ice loss to small communities or any reduction in safety. In assess-
ing potential loss of air carrier service, the FAA shall examine the
current equipage at congested airports and work with stakeholders
to assess realistic timelines for air carriers to equip all aircraft
with certain NextGen avionics. The FAA shall brief the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act on this assessment.
Medical Certifications and Clearances.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $100,063,000, an increase of $3,000,000
above the budget request, for the Office of Aerospace Medicine to
increase staffing and to modernize its information management
system in order to reduce processing times and improve decision-
making for medical certification and clearances. The FAA is di-
rected to increase staffing for additional staff psychiatrists, legal
instrument examiners, and program analysts who can help expe-
dite and reduce the existing backlogs for pilot and air traffic con-
troller medical certification, including special issuance or special
consideration, and medication approvals. The FAA should also use
the additional funding to modernize its information management
system by developing a template electronic submission platform to
reduce errors and omissions in information submitted to the FAA
by aviation medical examiners. The FAA should also publish prac-
tical medical certification/clearance guidance for applicants and en-
sure that information and documentation made available to avia-
tion stakeholders is correct and consistent. The FAA should strive
to achieve fair and reasonable time limits on certification decisions
of all classes of medical applications. Finally, the FAA is directed
to provide a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this act to the
House and Senate Committee on Appropriations on: (1) implemen-
tation of recommendations from the mental health and aviation
medical clearances rulemaking committee; and (2) the findings and

33
recommendations from the aviation workforce mental health task
group established in section 411 of the FAA Reauthorization of
2024.
Air Traffic Control Privatization.—The United States has the
largest, safest, most efficient, and most complex air traffic control
system in the world, and the FAA should remain a global leader
with a singular and unified mission of safety. To that end, the
Committee does not support any efforts to transfer the FAA’s air
traffic functions to a not-for-profit, independent, private corpora-
tion. The Committee is aware that if the Nation’s air traffic control
system had been privatized during the COVID–19 pandemic, simi-
lar to other air navigation service providers in Canada and the Eu-
ropean Union, the United States would have faced severe funding
shortfalls. These shortfalls would have likely led to controller lay-
offs and greater risks to flight safety, and a slower recovery after
the end of the pandemic, thus leading to more flight delays and
price increases for consumers.
Contract Towers.—The Committee recommendation provides not
less than $279,200,000 for the contract tower program, including
the cost-share for contract towers. The Committee directs the FAA
to continue to operate all contract towers currently in the program,
including the contract tower cost-share program, as well as to expe-
ditiously add qualified eligible airports. The Committee directs the
FAA to expedite the applications for cost-benefit ratio studies upon
receipt of all applications to the contract tower program and to
take into account all relevant operations activities, including mili-
tary and commercial operations, as permissible under current law.
The Committee recommendation also includes $8,000,000 for the
pilot program to convert high activity air traffic control towers op-
erating under the contract tower program to FAA staffed visual
flight rules towers, as authorized under section 625 of the FAA Re-
authorization Act of 2024. The Committee directs the FAA to com-
mence this program within 180 days of enactment of this act and
to prioritize contract towers as required under section 625(a)(2) of
such act.
Safety Management System [SMS] Rulemaking.—The Committee
continues to support the FAA’s efforts to implement the final SMS
rulemaking issued on April 26, 2024. However, the Committee is
also aware that the FAA needs to further increase the use of SMS,
such as by adding part 145 repair stations and to meet other Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization requirements under Annex 19.
The FAA should also consider including other approval holders in
SMS, such as supplemental type certificate holders, parts manufac-
turer approval holders, and technical standard order holders. How-
ever, no change to the current SMS shall in any way reduce the
overall safety of the national airspace system [NAS].
Radar Approach Control.—The Committee is aware that radar
approach control enhances aviation safety and efficiency for regu-
larly scheduled commercial airline service. The FAA should utilize
existing budget authorities, if excess funding is available, to pro-
vide radar to all air traffic control towers with significant adverse
terrain and seasonal winter weather conditions.
FAA Public Hearing.—The Committee notes that the proposal to
modify the Condor 1 and Condor 2 military operating areas has

34
been withdrawn. However, the Committee remains concerned with
any potential proposals to modify these military operating areas
and encourages the FAA to work with its partner agencies by hold-
ing a public hearing with representatives from the relevant Federal
agencies in western Maine if any such proposal is issued. The Com-
mittee recognizes that the Air National Guard, as the lead agency
under the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] (Public Law
91–190) process, has previously sought to meet the minimum legal
requirements for public participation and comment in past pro-
posals. Should any similar proposal be issued, the Committee di-
rects the FAA to report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations prior to the issuance of a record of decision regard-
ing any modification of the Condor 1 and Condor 2 military oper-
ations areas that includes a summary of any public meetings and
hearings and a list of the comments, questions, and responses pre-
sented at these meetings and hearings.
Special Use Airspace.—The Committee directs the FAA to con-
tinue its efforts to improve airspace sharing with the DoD for spe-
cial use.
Next Generation Radio Altimeters.—The Committee continues to
support the FAA’s ongoing work at the MMAC, in partnership with
aviation manufacturers, to accelerate testing, certification, and im-
plementation of new radio altimeter capabilities consistent with the
next generation avionics standards. The Committee directs the
FAA to provide an updated report on the roadmap and timeline for
development, testing, and certification to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of the enactment of
this act.
Unmanned Aircraft Systems [UAS] Test Sites.—The Committee
recommendation includes $6,000,000 for providing matching funds
to commercial entities that contract with an FAA-designated UAS
test range to demonstrate or validate technologies that the FAA
considers essential to the safe integration of UAS into the NAS.
The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 allows the FAA to select up
to two additional locations as UAS test sites through a criteria-
based selection process. Prior to selecting these two additional loca-
tions, the FAA shall brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the criteria that will be used to select these ad-
ditional test site locations, including references to criteria used to
select the previous test sites, whether those criteria will be re-
tained, and if not, why they were replaced. The Committee further
expects the FAA to ensure that any new test site selected possesses
a level of expertise and capacity to safely operate UAS equivalent
to the existing test sites.
Know Before You Fly.—The Committee supports FAA’s ‘‘Know
Before You Fly’’ public-private partnership to improve the safety of
UAS operations.
UAS Beyond Visual Line of Sight [BVLOS] Rulemaking.—The
FAA should meet all requirements in the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2024 for the BVLOS rulemaking, including the required timeline
for the proposed and final rule. The FAA should continue to keep
UAS stakeholders informed of a realistic BVLOS rulemaking
timeline, including the challenges associated with this rulemaking,

35
and any differences between the proposed rulemaking and the
BVLOS aviation rulemaking committee’s recommendations.
UAS Environmental Reviews.—The expanded use of small UAS
across the country requires the FAA to conduct environmental re-
views, and the FAA has made progress toward broader, area-wide
environmental reviews for UAS operations. The Committee directs
the FAA to continue to streamline area- or region-wide environ-
mental reviews, and brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on its progress within 90 days of enactment of this
act.
Military UAS Integration.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes up to $1,000,000 to support collaborative efforts with the
DoD to safely integrate military UAS into the NAS.
Protecting Domestic Manufacturing From Unauthorized Drone
Use.—The Committee is concerned about the use of drones to spy
on and facilitate theft at automotive manufacturing plants. The
Committee directs the FAA to report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this
act on any challenges associated with including major manufac-
turing plants and domestic automotive manufacturing sites as crit-
ical infrastructure under section 2209 of the FAA Extension, Safe-
ty, and Security Act of 2016.
UAS and Advanced Air Mobility Integration.—The Committee is
mindful that the proliferation of UAS deployments around the
country will require careful coordination with advanced air mobil-
ity [AAM] aircraft as new AAM entrants are certified and begin to
operate in the NAS. As such, the Committee supports the FAA’s ef-
forts to work with public and private stakeholders that are actively
testing and advancing the operation of UAS and AAM aircraft as
a tool to connect small communities to improve the delivery of
goods and services. The FAA should work with State partners with
broad expertise in aviation manufacturing, research, and innova-
tion to demonstrate the application of these air traffic management
technologies, to the extent such partnerships benefit the FAA’s mis-
sion. The FAA should also engage with local communities, includ-
ing those not represented at airport roundtables, on how AAM will
integrate into the NAS and local communities.
Aircraft Certification.—The Committee recommendation includes
not less than $379,223,000 for the aircraft certification service
[AIR]. The additional 32 positions included in the budget request
shall be prioritized to address the FAA’s increased oversight of Boe-
ing and other aviation manufacturers.
Alaska Air Flight 1282.—The NTSB’s final report on the Alaska
Air flight 1282 accident principally highlighted the manufacturer’s
failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight of its
manufacturing personnel, particularly for the parts removal proc-
ess. In addition, the NTSB determined that the FAA had ineffec-
tive compliance and audits over the manufacturer, including failure
to identify and address repetitive and systemic nonconformance
issues. As the FAA continues its increased oversight over the man-
ufacturer, the FAA is directed to also address all NTSB rec-
ommendations to both the FAA and the manufacturer, and to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment of this act on a timeframe for implementing

36
the NTSB recommendations. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes sufficient resources for efforts to improve record systems for
managers and inspectors overseeing production approval holders
and to convene a third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive re-
view of the manufacturer’s commercial airplanes’ safety culture.
Aircraft Certification Modernization and International Competi-
tiveness.—The Committee provides sufficient resources to ensure
technical expertise and workforce training is made available to
strengthen safety and production oversight. The aircraft certifi-
cation process can, at times, be plagued by antiquated procedures
and delayed due to the need to transfer thousands of physical docu-
ments between the FAA and manufacturers. Manufacturers have
also highlighted the lack of harmonization between the FAA’s regu-
latory requirements and those of international regulatory bodies.
Such competitive distortion may not have any corresponding safety
benefits. The Committee believes investing in the digitization and
modernization of the aircraft certification process, while ensuring a
safety-focused and level international playing field, will serve to ad-
vance the FAA’s safety mission while enhancing U.S. industry’s
competitiveness. The Committee expects the FAA to expedite im-
plementation of sections 310, 311, 313, 358, and 359 of the FAA
Reauthorization Act of 2024 and requests a briefing from the FAA
on its implementation plans within 30 days of the enactment of
this act.
New Aircraft Technologies to Improve Safety.—Multiple redun-
dant sensors can provide accurate and consistent data to aircraft,
and validating aircraft and environmental data that feeds these
systems will be increasingly critical as automation increases in
flight control systems. Within 180 days of enactment of this act,
the FAA shall provide the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations a report analyzing the safety benefit of employing a re-
dundant technology sensing requirement for safety critical air data
systems, including but not limited to primary ice detectors for part
23 and part 25 aircraft, as well as part 27 and part 29 rotorcraft.
Aviation Safety-Enhancing Technology.—The Committee sup-
ports the use of new aviation technologies to improve aviation safe-
ty. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 will help the FAA to bet-
ter oversee and improve its cross-agency efforts to integrate such
technologies. These efforts should include coordination within FAA
offices to the extent such efforts can demonstrably improve safety.
Parts Manufacturer Approval [PMA].—The FAA should adhere to
its regulations and remain objective in the assessment of critical
technology and applications for PMA parts. The FAA must balance
the requirement to not disclose PMA applications to competitors
while ensuring that any third-party input is fact-based and justi-
fied by operational data and technical merit, with documented ra-
tionale for such input. The Committee directs the FAA to brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, no later than 90
days after enactment of this act, on any significant changes to the
PMA process, submit the report required from the instructions for
continue airworthiness aviation rulemaking committee, as author-
ized under section 349 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.
Whistleblower Reports.—Currently, the FAA only releases the
final report for a whistleblower complaint or information that has

37
been substantiated by the FAA through a Freedom of Information
Act [FOIA] request. The Committee acknowledges the importance
of protecting any sensitive non-public information in these reports,
but is concerned that the FAA has, in some instances, taken
months to provide these reports to the brave whistleblowers who
identified aviation safety concerns. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the FAA to increase staffing in relevant offices to ensure
FOIA requests can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.
Veterans’ Pilot Training.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $3,000,000 for the pilot program to provide veterans with
pilot training services, as authorized under section 418 of the FAA
Reauthorization Act of 2024. This program is an important tool to
increasing the number of commercial pilots. The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of building upon existing agreements between
the FAA and flight training schools to continue providing training
and education to veterans to become commercial airline pilots, and
directs that any remaining funds previously appropriated for the
program remain available for use in fiscal year 2026. The Com-
mittee recommends that the FAA assess best practices and ways
to improve pilot training to veterans as it implements this pro-
gram.
Aviation Manufacturing.—The Committee acknowledges the con-
tributions of manufacturing and maintenance to U.S. competitive-
ness and exports. For the general aviation sector, this supports
1,300,000 jobs and $339,000,000,000 in economic output annually
to the U.S. economy. Collectively, aviation is the second largest
manufacturing export sector and the largest positive trade balance
of any manufacturing sector resulting in a net positive export trade
balance of $104,000,000,000, with exports of $124,000,000,000 and
imports of $20,000,000,000 in 2024. The Committee encourages the
DOT and the FAA to support efforts that sustain this leadership
through workforce investment, certification improvements, and ex-
pansion of a trade policy that has supported U.S. dominance.
Office of Commercial Space Transportation [AST].—The Com-
mittee recommendation includes $41,546,000 for AST and expects
AST to accelerate the pace of hiring in fiscal year 2026 in order to
keep up with the pace of licensing applications, as well as the tran-
sition to part 450 regulations in March 2026. The Committee is
aware that despite AST evaluating license applications on average
within 118 days, well within the statutory mandated deadline, li-
cense applicants continue to face delays in the pre-application proc-
ess. However, the licensing process has become increasingly
strained due to delays in resolving substantive disagreement about
how to comply with part 450 regulations between AST staff and
certain applicants. Therefore, the Committee directs AST to imple-
ment a technical escalation process through which disputes can be
adjudicated. This process, which may be requested by the license
applicant when the applicant receives a notification from AST that
a technical methodology or application element is insufficient,
should ensure a consistent standard of review between all license
applications, provide equal opportunity for licensing material that
may represent new or innovative solutions, and ensure that indi-
vidual AST licensing staff can access additional resources for crit-
ical decisions. The process must include the license applicant, re-

38
quire adjudications to be made within 15 days, and require that ra-
tionale be documented and shared with the applicant. The appli-
cant shall have three opportunities for adjudications for a new li-
cense application. The Committee directs the FAA to brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status and
utilization of this process within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Airspace Integration.—The Committee directs the FAA to include
updates to tools and systems used to integrate space launch and
reentry operations into the NAS, including capabilities to provide
real-time hazard area generation and project live telemetry data
onto air traffic controller scopes, in efforts to modernize the United
States’ air traffic control system. While these efforts would provide
limited benefits to the users of the NAS in comparison to other
technology efforts, they will help optimize airspace management
around space launch and reentry operations, mitigate the impact of
such operations on other users of the NAS, and provide greater in-
formation and operational readiness to air traffic controllers ac-
tively managing the airspace. The FAA is directed to include the
FAA ATO office that handles space operations integration in all
discussions on the planning, development, and implementation of
air traffic control modernization efforts to ensure that the full inte-
gration of space launch and reentry operations remains a possi-
bility.
Tower Services.—The FAA is directed to: (1) identify airports
that are currently served by FAA towers with nonradar approach
and departure control; and (2) develop an implementation plan,
which takes into account budgetary and flight volume consider-
ations, to provide an airport identified under section (1), if appro-
priate, with approach control radar.
Direct Aircraft-to-Aircraft Communications.—The Committee re-
mains concerned about the expected potential exponential growth
in the NAS of UAS creating significant traffic and congestion and
increasing the risk of collisions. The Committee believes that, in
addition to UAS traffic management services, fast, reliable, and se-
cure communications between drones are also needed to ensure
safe flights and to prevent collisions. Direct aircraft-to-aircraft com-
munications enable drones to detect and avoid each other without
the need for terrestrial or satellite connectivity and can play a crit-
ical role in ensuring that safety-critical communications are always
available. Therefore, the Committee expects the FAA to consider
and study the use of well-established wireless communications
standards for direct aircraft-to-aircraft communications, including
those proposed by the radio technical commission for aeronautics,
3rd generation partnership project, and Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, to ensure safe drone operations in the NAS.
The Committee directs the FAA to report its findings to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Mobile Clearances.—The Committee is aware the FAA has spon-
sored research and conducted trials to advance a safe and secure
mobile platform for delivering clearances to pilots with the aim of
reducing controller workload and enabling fuel savings. As author-
ized under section 614 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, the
FAA shall establish a pilot program for mobile clearances for gen-

39
eral aviation and part 135 air carriers at five airports or heliports
which do not have towered data link services to test and set secu-
rity, safety, and operational requirements and expects the FAA to
report its progress on this program to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this act.
Epinephrine Autoinjectors on Airplanes.—Consistent with section
368 in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, the FAA should take
such action as necessary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding first aid and emergency medical kit equipment and train-
ing required for flight crewmembers. The FAA should take into
consideration the feasibility and costs associated with requiring
adult and child epinephrine autoinjectors on airplanes. As part of
its work on the rulemaking, the FAA should take into consideration
the feasibility of requiring passenger airlines to systematically re-
port to the FAA about the type and number of incidences of med-
ical emergencies in the air and the use of onboard emergency med-
ical kits, as well as how the FAA should maintain a database of
this information.
New York City Helicopter Noise Report.—The New York metro-
politan area has one of the highest rates of helicopter use in the
world, and helicopter-related noise complaints have gone up dra-
matically in the last 5 years. Not later than 180 days after the date
of enactment of this act, the Government Accountability Office
[GAO] shall initiate a study regarding the impact of helicopter op-
erations over New York City including, but not limited to: (1) the
impact of helicopter noise on human health, businesses, and non-
profit organizations; (2) common flight paths; (3) trends in heli-
copter usage; (4) types of helicopter operations occurring over New
York City; and (5) efforts by the State of New York and local gov-
ernment authorities to mitigate the impact of helicopter noise.
Flight Diversions.—The Committee directs the Secretary to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on: (1)
the number of flight diversions by regularly scheduled passenger
airlines in the most recent year for which the FAA has such data
compared to the previous three calendar years; (2) the location to
which such flights were diverted; (3) the reason for such diversions;
and (4) the airlines’ obligations under current laws and regulations
to support its passengers during a flight diversion.
Airspace Modernization Roadmap Work.—The FAA can achieve
significant efficiencies in air traffic by modernizing outdated design
and procedures. For example, modernization of the 30-year old Ha-
waii airspace design would lead to faster interisland flights, fewer
flight delays and cancellations, and more reliable air service. The
Committee directs the FAA to complete the Hawaiian islands air-
space modernization project and to brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this
act on the status and timelines for completion of this project.
Human Intervention Motivation Study [HIMS] and Flight Attend-
ant Drug and Alcohol Program [FADAP].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes not less than $1,000,000 for HIMS and
FADAP, which are important for mitigating drug and alcohol abuse
through a peer identification and intervention program. The FAA
shall continue to prioritize these programs.

40
Bessie Coleman Women in Aviation Advisory Committee.—In rec-
ognition of the lack of recruitment and retention of women in key
aviation fields, the Committee directs the FAA to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the implemen-
tation of the Bessie Coleman Women in Aviation Advisory Com-
mittee, as authorized under section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization
Act of 2024, including the timeline for appointing board members
and holding board meetings.
High Speed Testing with Hypersonic Aircraft.—Consistent with
the requirements of section 1009 of the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2024, the Committee directs the FAA, in consultation with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to establish a
high-speed testing corridors for development and airworthiness
testing and demonstration flights for manufacturers and operators
of high-speed aircraft within 1 year of enactment of this act.
Crew Complements.—The presence of a minimum of two well
trained, qualified pilots in commercial aircraft is another example
of safety through redundancy. Funding made available in this act
shall not support reductions in flight deck crew in commercial oper-
ations as provided under 14 CFR Part 121. This direction is not in-
tended to limit the FAA’s research and development activities re-
lated to unmanned aerial vehicles.
Office of Spectrum Engineering.—The Committee recommenda-
tion includes $14,000,000 for the Office of Spectrum Engineering,
which provides funding for five additional staff. The Committee is
aware that pending legislation could significantly increase the
number of covered facilities or assets where DoD could deploy
counter-UAS systems. As such, the FAA should increase staffing in
this office in order to be able to expeditiously provide the required
consultation prior to DoD’s deployment of counter-UAS systems.
Illegal Charter Enforcement.—The Committee remains concerned
about uncertified air charters—also referred to as illegal charters—
conducting commercial flights in violation of 14 CFR parts 119 and
135. The Committee strongly encourages the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration to continue to pursue enforcement action against ille-
gal charters, consult with the Department of Justice as appropriate
in such cases, and to maintain a single public-facing portal for re-
porting suspected illegal-charter activity, so that rogue operators
can be identified and removed without hindering legal, compliant
Part 135 air carriers.
Coordination.—The Committee notes that the FAA and the Coast
Guard have been in discussion regarding the regulation of Wing-
in-ground-effect craft. The FAA shall continue to coordinate with
its Coast Guard counterparts to develop and execute a memo-
randum of understanding governing the specific roles, authorities,
delineations of responsibilities, resources, and commitments of the
FAA and the Coast Guard, respectively, pertaining to wing-in-
ground-effect craft. The FAA shall brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on its progress within 90 days of the
enactment of this act.

UAS.—The Committee recommendation includes $16,000,000 for
this program to enable the FAA to complete the development and

44
standardization of the airborne collision avoidance system [ACAS]
program, to support UAS, small UAS, and rotorcraft operations.
The ACAS program may provide a safety-enhancing replacement
for the existing traffic alert and collision avoidance system [TCAS
II] to support NextGen operations.
Airport Non-Cooperative Surveillance Radar [ANSR] Program.—
The Committee directs the FAA to report on the status of the
ANSR program, including long-term funding needs for the pro-
gram; a cost-benefit analysis of the most effective solutions to pro-
vide ongoing ANSR services, including a comparison of a
sustainment approach versus a replacement approach; an analysis
of how the FAA intends to provide commercial service airports with
necessary equipment; an update on the radar divestiture program;
and the projected lifecycle support needs of the existing inventory
of non-cooperative airport surveillance radar models 8, 9, and 11.
Offshore Automation.—The Committee recommendation includes
$48,300,000 for offshore automation. The FAA should keep the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations up to date on this
critical project and ensure that the project incorporate the needs of
the FAA service operations centers, including equipage, cabinetry
and consoles, and improved floor-space design.
Commercial Space Integration.—The Committee recommendation
includes $1,000,000 for commercial space integration activities.
This includes funding to operationalize the space operations portal
and for the investment analysis in preparation for the final invest-
ment decision for a program to enable space data to be displayed
on existing automation systems. The FAA should continue its work
on the development, acquisition, and deployment of technologies
and capabilities, including automation where appropriate, to aid in
space launch and reentry integration into the NAS and to enable
near real-time dynamic rerouting of commercial aircraft during and
following commercial space launch and reentry operations. The
FAA is directed to brief the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations no later than 180 days after the enactment of this act
on its efforts, including potential challenges it may face, to inte-
grate space launch and reentry tracking data into air traffic con-
troller displays.
Remote Towers.—The Committee is aware of the growing need
from small and rural communities to improve safety and modernize
the air traffic control capabilities of their airports in a timely man-
ner. The Committee supports the FAA’s work on remote towers as
a potential solution to address this need. The Committee provides
no less than $3,000,000 for the remote towers program. The Com-
mittee directs the FAA to provide a briefing to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations no later than 30 days after en-
actment of this act on the status of the system design approval and
timeframe for approval.
Future Flight Services Program.—The Committee remains sup-
portive of the Department’s efforts to offer enhanced capabilities to,
as well as improve the safety of, general aviation pilots in Alaska.
The current legacy automation service reached end-of-life in 2024
and is no longer cost-efficient to sustain. Following completion of
its plan and investment analysis, the FAA shall make a final in-

45
vestment decision to replace this legacy automation service within
1 year of enactment of this act.
Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative.—The Committee
recommendation includes $25,000,000 to implement the Don Young
Alaska aviation safety initiative [DYAASI], which includes
$20,000,000 from this budget line item [BLI], $3,500,000 from the
ADS–B NAS-wide implementation BLI, and $1,500,000 from the
weather camera program BLI. The Committee notes the persistent
lack of certified weather reporting capability in the FAA Alaska re-
gion and directs the FAA to provide the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations with a plan for the visual weather observa-
tion program within 90 days of enactment of this act.
Terminal Flight Data Manager [TFDM].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $47,300,000 and directs the FAA to report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the fea-
sibility, challenges, and benefits of expanding the number of air-
ports on the TFDM waterfall, consistent with section 619(e) of the
FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.
FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure.—The Committee appre-
ciates the FAA’s efforts to address recent challenges with tele-
communications systems in the New York City area airports to pre-
vent any future outages of critical data for air traffic controllers.
The Committee directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate
Committee on Appropriations on the status of all FAA tele-
communications infrastructure and the FAA’s efforts to accelerate
the transition from time division multiplexing to modern internet
protocol-based communications within 120 days of enactment of
this act.
Terminal and En Route Surveillance Portfolio.—The DoD and the
FAA operate networks of airport surveillance radar that monitor
the airspace for cooperative and non-cooperative aircraft and
weather conditions for commercial flights. The FAA should con-
tinue its efforts to upgrade these radars to extend their life and
avoid costly replacements.
Landing and Lighting Portfolio.—The Committee is aware that
many aging instrument landing systems [ILS] were installed in the
1970’s and 1980’s and their age presents a significant threat to
maintaining NAS capacity and safety. The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for ILS within this heading.
Light Emitting Diode [LED] Medium Intensity Approach Lighting
System [MALSR] Lamps.—The Committee appreciates the FAA’s
focus on expediting the transition to LED lamps for MALSR with
runway alignment indicator lights installations which will provide
significant benefits in safety, reliability, and cost savings. The
Committee directs the FAA to prioritize the acquisition and instal-
lation of commercial off-the-shelf LED lamps that have already
been FAA-approved for MALSR LED transitions by the spectrum
engineering services group at the MMAC and successfully installed
at more than 20 airports across the United States.
Military Operations Areas.—The Committee finds that radar and
future NextGen systems capable of controlling airspace down to
500 feet above ground level enhances aviation safety in military op-
erations areas that overlay public use airports. The Committee rec-
ommends that the FAA utilize existing resources to promptly pro-

46
vide radar or NextGen capability in areas with more than 5,000 op-
erations per year.
Spectrum Coordination.—The Committee directs the FAA to co-
ordinate with the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] on
the impact of spectrum utilization on aviation safety and aircraft
operations. Specifically, the FAA is directed to establish, with the
FCC, a permanent interagency working group to consult on poten-
tial spectrum impacts on aviation safety systems, including radio
altimeters and other critical avionics. Any FAA-identified risks to
aviation safety resulting from changes in spectrum use shall be
communicated to the FCC and be addressed expeditiously. The
FAA shall provide a report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this act detail-
ing the coordination process with the FCC, including any findings
or recommendations resulting from their joint assessment of spec-
trum-related aviation safety concerns.
Facility Replacement and Radar Modernization.—The FAA cur-
rently owns 370 facilities and 618 radars, most of which are dec-
ades old and well beyond their useful life, requiring expensive re-
pairs and short-term fixes to avoid gaps in air traffic services. As
the FAA continues to replace aging air traffic control towers, the
Committee directs the FAA to be mindful of the consideration of
aging towers referenced in section 608 of the FAA Reauthorization
Act of 2024 in the development of this proposal and in the facilities
and equipment spend plans.
Federal Aviation Administration—Department of Defense
Deconfliction Coordination.—The Committee supports FAA’s joint
efforts with DoD to ensure coordination and management of com-
mercial and military flight operations, including in special use air-
space, with an emphasis on deconfliction. As the FAA moves to
modernize our Nation’s air traffic control systems, the Committee
encourages the deployment and testing of software capabilities that
provide real-time, dynamic status-sharing and management to opti-
mize the use of the National airspace system for all stakeholders,
including for use with FAA Contract Towers. In doing so, the Com-
mittee encourages the FAA to utilize off-the-shelf capabilities to ex-
pedite the deployment of new technologies. The Committee further
directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations within 120 days of enactment of this act on its coordi-
nation with DoD for such real-time dynamic scheduling.
Airborne Situational Awareness Technology.—The Committee is
aware that many FAA contract towers operate without radar dis-
play capabilities, which may limit air traffic controller’s situation
awareness. The Committee further understands that the FAA is in
the process of reviewing the use of Airborne Position Reference
Tools [APRT] to supplement non-FAA operated control towers vis-
ual operations and radio communications with pilots. The Com-
mittee encourages the FAA to expeditiously conduct the review of
these technologies to enhance aviation safety at contract tower air-
ports and further encourages the FAA, through its ongoing review
of the AIP handbook, to consider allowing non-Federal entities to
acquire these technologies using both discretionary and entitlement
grant funding.

Advanced Materials/Structural Safety.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes a total of $4,500,000 for advanced materials/
structural safety, and an additional $11,500,000 shall be for ad-
vanced materials/structural safety work at the center of excellence
[COE] for joint advanced materials and structures [JAMS]. Of the
amounts provided in both BLIs, the Committee recommendation
provides $6,000,000 to advance the use of these new additive mate-
rials (both metallic and non-metallic based additive processes) in
the commercial aviation industry and for the FAA to work with the
advanced composites institute and private partners to evaluate
resin-infused materials and processes for airworthiness certification
and $4,000,000 to advance the use of fiber reinforced composite ma-
terials in the commercial aviation industry through JAMS.
The Committee recognizes the importance of advanced manufac-
turing for aerospace. The FAA should conduct research, in partner-
ship with the commercial sector, to address gaps in knowledge for
the use of large-scale metal wire arc additive manufacturing in
aerospace, including to manufacture aerospace products such as
aircraft and other aerospace vehicles. The focus of the research
should be: (1) process development for the creation of additive man-
ufacturing design and manufacturing standards for aerospace vehi-
cles; (2) improving certification efficiency of additively manufac-
tured aviation products; (3) evaluating long-term material and
structural behavior and associated maintenance, including support
for fatigue life determination, structural changes related to fatigue,
thermal, corrosive environments, and expected maintenance of such
material to include recommended repair techniques; and (4) uti-
lizing commercial partners to mature and certify large-scale metal
wire arc additive manufacturing and advanced materials capabili-
ties, including the development and qualification of new material
chemistries, optimized for large-scale metal wire arc additive man-
ufacturing, to be used in the manufacture of aerospace vehicles.
UAS Research.—The Committee recommendation includes
$7,500,000 for UAS research and an additional $14,000,000 for the
UAS COE. Of the amounts for the UAS COE, $2,000,000 is for
transportation disaster preparedness and response, in partnership
with institutions that have demonstrated experience in damage as-
sessment, collaboration with State transportation agencies, and ap-
plied UAS field testing; and $2,000,000 is to continue efforts with
the safety standards of UAS for development and validation of cer-
tification standards for such systems. The UAS COE research may
include cyber security, agricultural applications, and BVLOS.
Environment and Energy.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $12,500,000 for environment and energy, and an additional
$8,500,000 for environment and energy for the aviation sustain-
ability center [ASCENT] COE for research focused on sustainable
aviation fuels [SAFs].
NextGen-Environmental Research-Aircraft Technologies and
Fuels.—The Committee recommendation includes $5,000,000 for
NextGen Environmental Research-Aircraft Technologies and Fuels,
an additional $27,000,000 for the ASCENT COE on SAFs and avia-
tion noise, and an additional $40,000,000 for the continuous lower
energy, emissions, and noise [CLEEN] program. The Committee
continues to direct the FAA to prioritize research related to SAFs,

49
certification of SAFs, and challenges associated with the SAF sup-
ply chain. The Office of Environment and Energy and the Office of
Airports should work together to identify SAF-related projects at
airports that can be funded from airport improvement program
grants. The FAA should also support hydrogen and fuel-cell related
technologies that could reduce the noise and emissions footprint in
future aircraft.
Within the CLEEN program, the FAA may use any unused funds
to work with commercial supersonic aircraft manufacturers that
will help mature clean and quiet technologies for conventional non-
supersonic aircraft manufacturers.
Aviation Grant Management.—The Committee recommendation
includes $30,000,000 for the aviation workforce development pro-
grams as authorized by section 625 of the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2018, as amended by the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.
The Committee encourages the FAA, to prioritize applicants for
the aviation workforce development programs that provide an as-
surance to either use grant funds to: (1) encourage the participa-
tion of populations that are underrepresented in the aviation in-
dustry, including women, minorities, and individuals in economi-
cally disadvantaged communities and rural communities; or (2)
strengthen aviation programs at a minority-serving institution, a
public institution of higher education, or a public postsecondary vo-
cational institution, including such institutions in rural commu-
nities.
Aircraft Accessibility Research.—Persons with reduced mobility
have been disproportionately impacted by challenges associated
with air travel due to limited cabin space and relevant accommo-
dating technologies. The Department continues to receive numer-
ous consumer complaints related to commonly mishandled and/or
damaged equipment in aircraft cargo handling. The Committee
supports the FAA and the aviation industry’s efforts to develop,
test, and certify aviation accessibility technologies, including solu-
tions for passengers to travel onboard aircraft using power wheel-
chairs in cabins, accessible lavatories and other boarding and cabin
technologies that would enable greater mobility and ease of travel.
PFAS–Free Aviation Fire Suppression Technologies.—The Com-
mittee encourages the FAA to conduct research and development
activities, including partnerships with the DoD and U.S. industry,
to identify, develop, and test technologies that will provide an alter-
native to fire protection systems with hydrofluorocarbons and halon
technologies that are critical to the safety of flight systems in use
across civil, commercial and military aircraft today.
Electric Aircraft.—The FAA should identify and prioritize tech-
nical assistance, research, workforce development, and funding op-
portunities to support aircraft operators transitioning to electric
aircraft. The FAA should also coordinate with outside stakeholders
to identify opportunities to advance electrification of current and
future aircraft.
Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing [eVTOL] Aircraft.—The
Committee directs the FAA to conduct research, development, and
testing of eVTOL vehicles and AAM systems to ensure that these
emerging technologies are integrated into the NAS in a safe man-
ner. The Committee encourages the FAA to collaborate with inde-

50
pendent testing and research facilities to help improve the safe cer-
tification and deployment of eVTOL vehicles and other AAM sys-
tems. The FAA should encourage collaboration with independent
testing centers and private-sector partners to: conduct comprehen-
sive testing of eVTOL vehicles for safety, reliability, airworthiness,
and operational performance; assess the integration of eVTOL vehi-
cles into urban and rural airspace in coordination with local trans-
portation agencies, air traffic controllers, and airport authorities;
develop and test safety protocols, air traffic management systems,
and cyber security measures specific to eVTOL vehicles and AAM
networks; and create a framework for certification and regulatory
approval of eVTOL vehicles and related infrastructure to support
commercial deployment.
GRANTS-IN-AID FOR AIRPORTS
(LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
(AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Funding for grants-in-aid for airports pays for capital improve-
ments at the Nation’s airports, including those investments that
emphasize capacity development, safety improvements, and secu-
rity needs. Other priority areas for funding under this program in-
clude improvements to runway safety areas that do not conform to
FAA standards, investments that are designed to reduce runway
incursions, and aircraft noise compatibility planning and programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations and a liq-
uidating cash appropriation of $4,000,000,000 for grants-in-aid for
airports for fiscal year 2026. This is equal to the enacted level for
fiscal year 2025.
Administrative Expenses.—The Committee recommends not more
than $160,000,000 to cover administrative expenses. This funding
level is $3,768,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. In-
creased staffing should be used to support the FAA’s work to help
airports develop plans to mitigate the impact of climate change on
airport infrastructure.
Airport Cooperative Research.—The Committee recommends not
less than $15,000,000 for the airport cooperative research program.
This funding level is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Airport Technology.—The Committee recommends not less than
$41,827,000 for airport technology research. This funding level is
$26,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of this
amount, $6,000,000 is for the airfield pavement technology pro-
gram authorized under section 744 of Public Law 115–254, of
which $3,000,000 is for concrete pavement research and $3,000,000
is for asphalt pavement research.

51
Small Community Air Service Development Program.—The Com-
mittee recommends $15,000,000. This funding level is $5,000,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Cost Share.—The bill includes a provision that allows small air-
ports to continue contributing 5 percent of the total cost for unfin-
ished phased projects that were underway prior to the passage of
the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–
095).
Zero-Emission Vehicle [ZEV] and Voluntary Airport Low Emis-
sions [VALE] Programs.—The Committee directs the FAA to pro-
vide not less than $50,000,000 for ZEV and VALE eligible projects.
The Committee expects the FAA to actively engage with airport
sponsors at major hubs to identify projects suitable for the VALE
program, such as energy efficiency, energy resiliency, and renew-
able energy projects that would help prevent power disruptions or
outages.
Sound Insulation.—The Committee is aware that certain sound
insulation projects installed prior to 2002 caused physical damage
to the residence or the materials used for such insulation have de-
teriorated, broken, or are otherwise no longer functional. As such,
the Committee directs the FAA to consider residences that were
mitigated prior to 2002 with sound insulation as ‘‘unmitigated’’,
and any new sound insulation shall be considered a one-time miti-
gation, subject to current requirements for determining eligibility
for sound insulation, if an airport can verify that: (1) the residences
continue to fall within the latest day-night average sound level
[DNL] 65 decibel [dB] contour; (2) the residential structure is expe-
riencing an average interior noise level of DNL 45 dB or higher;
(3) any previously installed sound insulation for which prior Fed-
eral financial assistance or passenger facility charges resulted in
structural deterioration that was not caused by any actions attrib-
uted to the owner or occupant of the residence, nor by the failure
of a property owner to repair or maintain a residential building;
and (4) the applicant and the property owner demonstrate having
made good faith effort to exhaust any amounts available through
warranties, insurance coverage, and legal remedies for the sound
insulation treatment previously installed on the eligible residence.
The FAA has previously determined other sound insulation treat-
ments to be considered as ‘‘unmitigated’’ and should provide the
same flexibility to these treatments. The FAA should also continue
to require applicants and property owners to conform to currently
published FAA standards that would achieve a measurable reduc-
tion in interior noise levels.
Airport Growth.—Airport modernization and growth projects rely
on a combination of Federal, State, and local funds, as well as air-
line funds, in some instances. For airports experiencing growth in
traffic, this requires long-term cooperation and partnerships be-
tween these government and private sector entities. The Secretary
and the FAA should help coordinate these partnerships between
airports and airlines, to the extent permissible under current law,
to ensure funding commitments are met and that they adequately
capitalize on prior or ongoing Federal investments at the airport.
Long-Term Trends in Aviation.—Certain long-term trends in so-
ciety, such as extreme weather, electrification, automation, and de-

52
mographic changes of the workforce, may have significant impacts
on airports and their funding needs. The Committee directs the
GAO to conduct a study on these and other major trends that could
impact airports and their funding needs over the long-term, and
how the U.S. commercial aviation industry and the FAA can adapt
to them.
Boarding Bridges.—The Committee supports section 711 of the
FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, that prohibits Federal funding
from going towards the procurement of passenger boarding bridges
from Chinese State-owned, controlled, or subsidized companies that
seek to threaten the United States’ economy and national security.
Reimbursable Agreements.—The Committee is aware of chal-
lenges facing the administration of the State block grant program
for certain airports, and the reimbursable agreement [RA] associ-
ated with them. The RA process can be burdensome and costly for
some States and their airports. The Committee directs the FAA to
work with stakeholders who participate in a block grant program,
and all relevant FAA offices, to modify the current process in order
to reduce any additional costs and delays being imposed on States
and airports. Specifically, the FAA must work with stakeholders to
identify and address the root cause of these challenges, which may
include: (1) disclosing the upfront cost for each item required to
perform their duties on a project; (2) providing a commitment on
when work will be completed; and (3) once the duties are com-
pleted, requiring the FAA to provide a line-item receipt of their
costs and reimbursing the paying entity for any costs that are less
than what was pre-paid within 120 days.

FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The principal mission of the Federal Highway Administration
[FHWA] is, in partnership with State and local governments, to
foster the development of a safe, efficient, and effective highway
and intermodal system nationwide.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
Under the Committee recommendations, a total program level of
$63,932,530,821 is provided for the activities of the FHWA in fiscal
year 2026. The recommendation is $1,538,860,276 more than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This limitation on obligations provides for the salaries and ex-
penses of the FHWA for program management, direction, and co-
ordination; engineering guidance to Federal and State agencies;
and advisory and support services in field offices.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of
$507,435,977 for the administrative expenses of the FHWA, of
which $3,248,000 is for the administrative expenses of the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 104.
Additional staff should be prioritized for administration and over-
sight of competitive grants, including to reach grant agreements
between the Department and awardees.

(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $61,314,170,545
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 62,657,105,821

55
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal-aid highway program provides financial support to
States and localities for the development, construction, and repair
of highways and bridges through grants. This program is financed
from the Highway Trust Fund, and most of the funds are distrib-
uted through apportionments and allocations to States. Title 23 of
the United States Code and other supporting legislation provide
authority for the various activities of the FHWA. Funding is pro-
vided by contract authority, with program levels established by an-
nual limitations on obligations set forth in appropriations acts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends limiting fiscal year 2026 obligations
for the Federal-aid highway program to $62,657,105,821, which is
$1,342,935,276 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Staffing.—The Committee is aware of the significant reduction in
the agency’s workforce, resulting in part from employees choosing
to take the DRP offer. The Committee also understands that some
division offices have lost up to 50 percent of their staff. The Com-
mittee is concerned about the impact of these dramatic staffing re-
ductions on the Department’s ability to build our Nation’s high-
ways, bridges, and other infrastructure projects. As such, the Com-
mittee directs the FHWA to provide a report on the number of posi-
tions lost through the DRP within each office included in the con-
gressional budget justification as well as each State division office.
The report shall include an analysis of the impact of these staffing
reductions on the agency’s ability to implement the Federal-aid
highway program and all other statutory responsibilities.
Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure.—When the FHWA
stopped all further obligations from the National Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure [NEVI] formula program, it also rescinded the pro-
gram guidance from June 11, 2024. At the same time, the FHWA
committed to ‘‘have updated draft NEVI Formula Guidance pub-
lished for public comment in the spring of 2025.’’ As of July 2025,
no such guidance has been published for public comment. The
Committee directs the Secretary to issue new guidance for the
NEVI formula program. The Secretary may also consider releasing
funding under the previous guidance while the FHWA works to up-
date the guidance. The Committee also encourages the FHWA to
update guidance to adopt technology-neutral charger deployment
requirements.
Bridge Investment Program.—The demand for Bridge Investment
Program funding has demonstrated the need for a dedicated fund-
ing source for improving the condition of large and important
bridges across the country. The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment to implement this program to rebuild bridges in significant
states of disrepair.
Reducing Wildlife-Vehicle Collisions.—The Committee encour-
ages the FHWA to work with States to reduce wildlife-vehicle colli-
sions through quick implementation of the wildlife crossings pilot
program and through the highway safety improvement program
and eligibilities under 23 U.S.C. 148(a)(4)(B)(xvii). The Committee

56
directs the FHWA to provide technical assistance related to the im-
plementation of 23 U.S.C. 148(a)(4)(B)(xvii), as needed.
Asphalt Research.—The Committee directs the FHWA to evalu-
ate research initiatives eligible under the FHWA’s highway re-
search and development program focusing on the properties of puri-
fied bituminous coal waste as a source of high quality carbon to be
used as an additive for asphalt road building, and provide a report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of enactment of this act outlining the FHWA’s action plan to
evaluate such research. The Committee also encourages the FHWA
to use public-private partnerships to advance its research on the
use of purified carbon-rich materials as environmentally beneficial
additives for road building material.
Safety.—The Committee remains concerned by the staggering
number of pedestrian fatalities each year involving vehicles, and is
aware that an increasing number of municipalities are developing
plans to significantly reduce these incidents. The Committee di-
rects the FHWA to continue developing resources and providing
technical assistance to help State and local governments facilitate
the implementation of their vision zero plans and strategies to re-
duce pedestrian fatalities and injuries consistent with the direc-
tives in House Report 117–402 and Senate Report 118–70. Pro-
grams such as the safe streets and roads for all grant program sup-
port projects that improve road safety for pedestrians, bicyclists,
and other vulnerable road users, and the Secretary should imple-
ment this program. The FHWA should also use existing funds to
fund the bollard installation pilot program, as authorized under
section 11502 of the IIJA.
Truck Parking.—The Committee is aware of the lack of safe
truck parking on our Nation’s highways, which creates a hazard for
truck drivers, reduces safety for all road users, and hinders recruit-
ment. The Committee commends the Department for identifying
existing sources of funding in the IIJA that States can use to ad-
dress the nationwide truck parking shortage and for working with
private sector stakeholders, State DOTs, and metropolitan plan-
ning organizations to fund requests for discretionary grant funding
to increase the availability of safe truck parking. The Committee
directs the Department to continue these efforts and to continue to
use existing discretionary grant programs to fund truck parking
projects, where eligible and appropriate.
Permeable Pavements.—The Committee continues to encourage
the Secretary to accelerate deployment of permeable pavements, in-
cluding permeable pavers, to achieve flood mitigation, pollutant re-
duction, stormwater runoff reduction, and resilience in new road
construction and retrofitting existing roads and other facilities. The
Secretary is also encouraged to support the use of permeable pave-
ments and permeable pavers in Federal lands highway projects.
Roadside Safety.—The Committee is concerned with the signifi-
cant number of fatalities caused by high-speed roadway departure
crashes and notes that guardrail end terminals remain a critical
safeguard for reducing such incidents. The current testing standard
for guardrail end terminals in the manual for assessing safety
hardware [MASH], under which the FHWA requires devices to be
tested in order to be Federal-aid eligible, utilizes a maximum speed

57
of 62 miles-per-hour and relies on research that was conducted
more than 40 years ago. According to the MASH, ‘‘after a system
has been proven to meet the recommended impact performance
guidelines, the evaluation should switch to an in-service evaluation
of the feature’s field performance. It is recommended that in-serv-
ice performance evaluations be conducted when new safety features
are placed in service,’’ and ‘‘experience has shown that as new de-
signs are developed, current test procedures may not properly
evaluate critical conditions for these designs.’’ Given the significant
changes to vehicle fleets, highway speed limits, other changes to
the operating environment, and the development of more advanced
devices, the Committee strongly encourages the FHWA to engage
with the American Association of State Highway and Transpor-
tation Officials to pursue updates to the testing standard that bet-
ter reflect current real-world conditions. The Committee directs the
FHWA to, within 180 days of enactment of this act, provide a re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the
design of a potential pilot program to help facilitate State-led in-
service performance evaluations of guardrail end terminals with
documented effectiveness beyond the scope of MASH compliance.
This report should include consideration of the number of partici-
pants, minimum funding amount needed for a successful pilot, and
any other program requirements necessary to ensure its effective-
ness.
National Culvert Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant
Program.—The Committee appreciates the Department clarifying
in its recent NOFO for the culvert aquatic organisms passage
[AOP] program that recipients and sub-recipients may request al-
ternative funding arrangements, as permissible under 2 CFR Part
200. However, the NOFO does not provide any details on what
these alternative funding arrangements are or what information
recipients are required to submit to be approved for them. The
Committee is aware that AOP applicants face challenges with a
grant program that provides funding on a reimbursable basis. The
Committee directs the Department to proactively provide informa-
tion on alternative funding arrangements, including what written
procedures and financial management systems applicants are re-
quired to maintain and demonstrate in order to meet the fund con-
trol and accountability requirements under 2 CFR Part 200. The
Committee also directs the Department to provide information with
regard to the authority it has to provide cash on a working capital
advance basis. The Department should provide information
through webinars, trainings, technical assistance, and any means
necessary to bring this information to the large number of potential
applicants for this grant program. The Department should use suc-
cessful examples of such arrangements from the first round of
awardees. The Department should make available to potential ap-
plicants, upon request, relevant staff with sufficient budgetary and
legal expertise in these alternative funding arrangements, and re-
spond to questions from potential applicants on these matters with-
in 15 days of such request. The Committee also urges the Depart-
ment to further clarify to potential applicants how grant recipients
can partner with implementation entities, such as non-profit orga-

58
nizations, through the use of a contract or other agreement, to de-
liver a project.
The most recent NOFO also requires applicants to identify de-
sign standards that will be used for fish passage improvements,
but does not specifically identify any such design standards. The
Committee expects the Department to work with the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], and other Federal
agencies, to develop a minimum design standard that includes min-
imum fish passage requirements, hydraulic design methodology
that incorporates the impact of climate change on hydrology, and
minimum project design life and sizing standards that are climate
resilient. The Department shall brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations on these efforts within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Further, the Committee directs the FHWA to make grant awards
for the fiscal year 2023 NOFO within 60 days of enactment of this
act, and to issue the fiscal year 2024 NOFO for this program not
later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
Salmon Mitigation.—The Committee provided $5,000,000 in fis-
cal year 2023 to establish a cooperative series of agreements with
universities, Federal agencies, the National Academy of Sciences,
transportation agencies, or nonprofit organizations to examine the
impacts of culverts, roads, and bridges on threatened or endan-
gered salmon populations. The Committee notes that the FHWA
has not published a solicitation for these funds. The Committee di-
rects the FHWA to publish a solicitation for these funds within 90
days of enactment of this act and award funds within 180 days of
enactment on this act.
Update and Expand 14th Amendment Highway Report.—Section
1927 of Public Law 109–59 required a report describing the steps
and estimated funding to designate and construct a route for the
14th Amendment Highway, which comprises much of the I–14
route. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide an update
to this report and to include a comprehensive feasibility analysis
of the I–14 corridor, with an emphasis on its potential to serve as
a bypass to Atlanta and other major cities; enhance connectivity to
key military installations, ports, energy production areas, and
other economic centers; utilize established modeling systems, in-
cluding the highway economic requirements system, travel demand
models, and regional economic development models; analyze envi-
ronmental and economic impacts, safety improvements, and na-
tional security benefits; and produce actionable recommendations
for inclusion in statewide and metropolitan plans and transpor-
tation improvement programs.
I–69 Corridor Development in West Tennessee.—The Committee
encourages the FHWA to continue working with the Tennessee De-
partment of Transportation and local stakeholders to advance the
completion of I–69 through Tennessee, a critical component of high
priority corridor 18. With I–69 now providing continuous interstate
connectivity from the Canadian border to the Kentucky state line,
completing segments seven through nine is essential to closing a
major gap in the national corridor. The Committee supports contin-
ued coordination and investment to complete this nationally signifi-
cant corridor.

59
U.S. 50 Blue Mesa Bridge.—The Committee is aware that the
U.S. 50 Blue Mesa Bridge in Colorado is in need a repair due to
a crack found in the steel and is currently shut down to all traffic.
The Committee encourages the Department to work with the state
to identify potential sources of funding for repairing this bridge.
Computer Vision in Roadway Maintenance.—The Department es-
tablishes minimum standards for traffic control devices that en-
hance safety and reliability throughout our Nation’s roadway infra-
structure. The Committee recognizes the safety and operational
benefits of computer vision, a specialized field of artificial intel-
ligence, in assisting infrastructure owners and operators to assess
roadway conditions and damage to roadway assets, such as missing
signage, pavement damage, and other infrastructure concerns,
without requiring human inspectors to enter dangerous or inacces-
sible areas. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes the critical im-
portance of maintaining pavement marking and retroreflectivity for
roadway safety. As such, the Committee believes it is important to
ensure that non-Federal stakeholders are informed of the eligibility
of computer vision technologies for inspecting roadways and traffic
control devices and directs the Department to provide sufficient no-
tice to relevant non-Federal stakeholders.
Emerging Vehicle Technology Safety.—The Committee is con-
cerned by the results of recent testing of the compatibility of road-
side safety hardware with electric vehicles. With an increasing
number of electric vehicles on the roadways and the emergence of
other technologies including hydrogen and autonomous vehicles,
the Committee believes that continued research and testing is es-
sential to ensure the safe integration of emerging vehicle tech-
nologies on our Nation’s roadways. Such efforts should prioritize
the testing of current, and development and testing of new, road-
side safety hardware. The FHWA is encouraged to collaborate with
State DOTs and institutions of higher education that have experi-
ence with and are currently conducting research and testing on
roadside safety hardware for emerging vehicle technologies, as well
as participants in transportation pooled fund studies examining
these issues.
Emergency Relief Manual.—The Committee remains dis-
appointed that the FHWA has yet to meet the statutory deadlines
for updating the Emergency Relief program manual (section 11519
of Public Law 117–58) and directs the FHWA to provide an update
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the sta-
tus of implementation on a quarterly basis instead of the current
monthly requirement.
Anti-Competitive Bidding.—The Department’s Office of Inspector
General has found nearly $1,200,000,000 in estimated higher costs
associated with undetected collusive bidding on Federal highway
projects in six randomly-selected eastern States over 8 years. These
cost increases represent a nearly 7 percent increase in project costs
due to anti-competitive bidding practices, primarily driven by com-
plementary bidding amongst bidding firms. If extrapolated to all
Federal-aid highways program funding, there could be over
$21,000,000,000 in highway funds lost to fraud, rather than spent
on highway construction. The Committee directs the FHWA to re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, with-

60
in 180 days of enactment of this act, on steps taken to implement
the Inspector General’s recommendations to amend FHWA guid-
ance to recommend State DOTs: (1) conduct frequent, regular, sys-
tematic reviews of procurements made over multiple years using
specific statistics to identify anti-competitive bidding patterns; and
(2) to the extent practical, reduce reliance on historical data when
developing engineer’s estimates, instead moving to methods FHWA
has found to be more reliable, including cost-based estimation.
Stormwater Management.—The Committee is concerned with the
impact of emerging contaminants on the environment, such as the
compound N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine
[6PPD] and its transformant, 6PPD-quinone. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $8,000,000 for the FHWA to work with
State DOTs and other relevant State agencies to build or imple-
ment, operate, and maintain low-cost and rapidly deployable
stormwater management technologies and techniques to reduce the
impacts of 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone on salmon-bearing streams.
The results of this research shall be used by the FHWA to inform
its stormwater policies and guidance publications. This research
shall be conducted in coordination with Federal, State, and Tribal
agencies engaged in relevant research, along with academia. This
research shall be conducted in locations that: (1) have resident
salmonid populations that have documented acute toxicity effects to
the stormwater contaminant, 6PPD-quinone, and where harmful
stormwater contaminants may bioaccumulate in endangered south-
ern resident killer whales through their salmon prey; (2) provide a
variety of land uses for optimizing technologies to specific transpor-
tation scenarios; (3) are available for near-term installation; and (4)
provide opportunities for long-term monitoring.
In conducting this research, the FHWA is directed to collaborate
and consult with NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service
[NMFS] to ensure that NMFS will be able to directly corroborate
the findings and endorse treatment alternatives with proven effec-
tiveness. The intent of this collaboration shall be to ensure that de-
monstrably effective treatment alternatives identified through this
research can help expedite NMFS consultations to the extent that
stormwater quality is a consideration for determination.
Unobligated Balances.—The Committee directs the FHWA to
submit a list of all unobligated balances of contract authority and
budget authority as of September 30, 2025, to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations by January 1, 2026, and provide
an annual update with each year’s President’s budget request. The
list of unobligated balances shall include the account name, pro-
gram name, Treasury account symbol, amounts remaining avail-
able for obligation, date of most recent obligation, and any other in-
formation that will help the Committees determine the status of all
unobligated balances. For allocated program unobligated balances
that remain available for obligation, the FHWA shall determine
whether the funds are likely to be obligated in the near term. For
each formula program unobligated balances that remain available
for obligations, the FHWA shall provide a state-by-state distribu-
tion list.

LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION
HIGHWAY TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $62,053,170,545
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 63,396,105,821
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal-aid highway program is funded through contract au-
thority paid out of the Highway Trust Fund. Most forms of budget
authority provide the authority to enter into obligations and then
to liquidate those obligations. Put another way, it allows a Federal
agency to commit to spending money on specified activities and
then to actually spend that money. In contrast, contract authority
provides only the authority to enter into obligations, but not the
authority to liquidate those obligations. The authority to liquidate
obligations, to actually spend the money committed with contract
authority, must be provided separately. The authority to liquidate
obligations under the Federal-aid highway program is provided
under this heading. This liquidating authority allows the FHWA to
follow through on commitments already allowed under current law;
it does not provide the authority to enter into new commitments for
Federal spending.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a liquidating cash appropriation of
$63,396,105,821. The recommended level is $1,342,935,276 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This level of liquidating au-
thority is necessary to pay outstanding obligations from various
highway accounts pursuant to this and prior appropriations acts.
HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $340,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,136,425,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Committee provides funding for highway infrastructure pro-
grams [HIP] to improve highway safety and efficiency for all Amer-
icans through general fund investments in addition to levels au-
thorized in the IIJA (Public Law 117–58).
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $1,136,425,000 in fund-
ing from the general fund for highway infrastructure programs,
which is $795,925,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Of the total amount provided, $581,225,000 is for CDS, and the
Committee directs the FHWA to provide funding for the projects
listed in the table at the end of this report in the corresponding
amounts.
National Scenic Byways Program.—The Committee directs the
FHWA to not include any preference for projects based on the total
cost of the project when awarding grants under this program. The
Committee notes that the FHWA has yet to produce a comprehen-

62
sive map of the Nation’s scenic byways and encourages the FHWA
to prioritize producing such a map, which would be a useful re-
source for both transportation planners and the traveling public. Of
the funds provided for this program, up to $1,000,000 shall be for
FHWA technical assistance activities. For the purposes of this pro-
gram, technical assistance as authorized in 23 U.S.C. 162 may in-
clude the development and dissemination of resources for use by
States and Tribes such as a program website, updated maps, and
economic research.
Reconnecting Communities.—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $62,200,000 for the Reconnecting Communities Pilot pro-
gram, which is in addition to the $100,000,000 provided for this
program in division J of the IIJA and $105,000,000 provided for
this program from the Highway Trust Fund. The Committee di-
rects the Department to provide technical assistance, including
webinar and other informational sessions, to help local government
applicants whose grant funding was recently rescinded work with
State DOTs and Federal agencies to identify other sources of fund-
ing to complete these projects.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS—FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION
Section 120 distributes obligation authority among Federal-aid
highway programs.
Section 121 continues a provision that credits funds received by
the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to the Federal-aid high-
ways account.
Section 122 sets forth parameters for any waiver of Buy America
requirements.
Section 123 mandates 60-day notification for any grants for a
project under 23 U.S.C. 117 and requires these notifications to be
made within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Section 124 allows State DOTs to repurpose certain highway
project funding and for those funds to be used within 25 miles of
their original designation.
Section 125 extends the period of availability of certain INFRA
grant funds.
Section 126 extends the period of availability of certain bridge in-
vestment program funds.
Section 127 requires the Secretary to issue an update to the
NEVI formula program guidance.
Section 128 extends the period of availability of certain grants.
FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s [FMCSA’s]
mission is to promote safe commercial motor vehicle and motor
coach operations, as well as reduce the number and severity of acci-
dents involving those vehicles. Agency resources and activities pre-
vent and mitigate commercial motor vehicle and motor coach acci-
dents through education, regulation, enforcement, stakeholder
training, technological innovation, and improved information sys-
tems. The FMCSA is also responsible for ensuring that all commer-
cial vehicles entering the United States along its southern and

63
northern borders comply with all Federal motor carrier safety and
hazardous materials regulations. To accomplish these activities, the
FMCSA works with Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies,
the motor carrier industry, highway safety organizations, and the
public.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total level of $926,600,000 for obli-
gations from the Highway Trust Fund, which is $17,650,000 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides necessary resources to support motor car-
rier safety program activities and to maintain the agency’s admin-
istrative infrastructure. This funding supports nationwide motor
carrier safety and consumer enforcement efforts, including Federal
safety enforcement activities at the United States-Mexico border in
order to ensure that Mexican carriers entering the United States
are in compliance with FMCSA regulations. Resources are also pro-
vided to fund motor carrier regulatory development and implemen-
tation, information management, research and technology, safety
education and outreach, and the 24-hour safety and consumer tele-
phone hotline.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of
$390,000,000 for the FMCSA’s operations and programs, which is
$7,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of the

64
total limitation on obligations, $14,073,000 is for research and tech-
nology and not less than $63,098,000 is for information technology
and information management [IM].
The Committee continues to direct the FMCSA to provide a
spending plan for the amounts provided for IT and IM and to up-
date the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on mod-
ernizing its legacy systems no less than every 6 months.
Predatory Towing.—The Committee is aware that 49 U.S.C.
14501(c)(1) makes the Federal Government the sole regulator of
tow truck operators when towing a vehicle with the prior consent
or authorization of its owner or operator; however, like the States,
the FMCSA does not have explicit statutory authority to regulate
towing fees, and Federal regulations have never been promulgated
to prohibit excessive fees in these circumstances. While the vast
majority of towing and storage firms are honest and well-inten-
tioned, some bad actors have been allowed to operate in a regu-
latory gap without oversight or accountability. Predatory towing
can lead to supply chain disruptions when motor carriers are held
hostage to unethical practices in towing and recovery. The Com-
mittee directs the FMCSA to engage with local, State, and private
sector stakeholders to study current practices concerning towing
and recovery regulation and fees in order to ensure fair and equi-
table treatment of roadway safety clearance opportunities for motor
carriers.
Alternative Warning Devices for AV Trucks.—The deployment
and operation of autonomous trucks are currently inhibited by
roadway safety warning device regulations that require human de-
ployment in the event of a motor vehicle being disabled. The Com-
mittee directs the FMCSA to review existing research and informa-
tion on the safety impacts of alternative safety warning device sys-
tems or signs that can be placed on the roadway, on or around a
stopped commercial motor vehicle [CMV] without human deploy-
ment while maintaining an equivalent or greater level of safety and
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
its findings not later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
English Language Proficiency Enforcement.—The Committee
notes that 49 CFR 391.11(b)(2) requires that CMV drivers ‘‘can
read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse with
the general public, to understand highway traffic signs and signals
in the English language, to respond to official inquiries, and to
make entries on reports and records’’. On May 20, 2025, the
FMCSA issued an internal agency enforcement policy (MC–SEE–
2025–0001) reinforcing established safety regulations in accordance
with 49 CFR 391.11(b)(2), and the commercial vehicle safety alli-
ance’s North American standard out-of-service criteria was amend-
ed to make non-compliance with such section a driver out-of-serve
violation effective June 25, 2025. Section 132 of this act requires
the Secretary to update the Department’s regulations to ensure
that non-compliance with 49 CFR 391.11(b)(2) triggers an out-of-
service order. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a re-
port to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
non-compliance and out-of-service orders pursuant to 49 CFR
391.11(b)(2) pre- and post-May 2025 not later than 180 days after
enactment of this act.

65
Entry-Level Driver Training [ELDT].—The ELDT regulations, es-
tablished by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century
Act, improve highway safety by setting minimum Federal training
requirements for new commercial driver’s license [CDL] applicants.
FMCSA’s training provider registry [TPR] serves as a public re-
source for future drivers to identify training providers and records
of drivers that have completed entry-level driver training. To im-
prove the utility of this public resource, the Committee directs the
FMCSA to clarify its TPR guidance for timely removal of training
providers that do not meet ELDT requirements not later than 180
days after enactment of this act. In addition, the bill requires the
Secretary to provide certain information relating to training pro-
viders on the TPR to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 90 days after enactment of this act and a
plan on how the FMCSA will conduct regular audits of the TPR not
later than 120 days after enactment of this act.
Staffing.—With the significant reduction in staffing levels in fis-
cal year 2025 as a result of employees electing to take the DRP,
the Committee is concerned about the impact of these staffing re-
ductions on the Department’s ability to fulfill the FMCSA’s mission
to ‘‘reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks
and buses’’. As such, the Committee directs the FMCSA to provide
a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on
the number and job series of positions lost through the DRP within
each office included in the congressional budget justification as well
as each field office, service center, and State-level motor carrier di-
vision office. The report shall include an analysis of the impact of
these staffing reductions on the agency’s ability to implement
motor carrier safety and enforcement programs and all other statu-
tory responsibilities.
Enforcement Training and Support Grant Program.—The com-
mercial motor vehicle enforcement training and support grant pro-
gram was established in the IIJA to train non-Federal employees
who conduct CMV enforcement activities and to develop related
training materials. The NOFOs for this program have required
grantees to use non-Federal instructors who have successfully com-
pleted the FMCSA instructor development program [IDP] and
maintain all FMCSA-required instructor certifications. Such in-
structors may receive training through the FMCSA’s Federal law
enforcement training course accreditation that is different than the
training such instructors deliver through the grant program. To
better align the training received by non-Federal instructors and
provided to non-Federal employees under the grant program, the
Committee directs FMCSA to notify grantees of any updates to the
IDP and Federal law enforcement training course accreditation.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides resources for Federal grants to support
compliance, enforcement, and other programs performed by States.
Grants are also provided to States for enforcement efforts at both
the Southern and Northern borders in order to fortify points of
entry into the United States with comprehensive safety measures;
improve State CDL oversight activities to prevent unqualified driv-
ers from being issued CDLs; and support the performance registra-
tion information systems and management program, which links
State motor vehicle registration systems with carrier safety data in
order to identify unsafe commercial motor carriers.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations and au-
thority to liquidate an equal amount of contract authorization of
$536,600,000 for motor carrier safety grants, which is $10,150,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS–FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY
ADMINISTRATION
Section 130 prohibits funds from being used to enforce the elec-
tronic logging device rule with respect to carriers transporting live-
stock or insects.
Section 131 prohibits funds from being used to require the use
of inward-facing cameras or require a motor carrier to be enrolled
in the Department of Labor’s registered apprenticeship program as
conditions for participation in the safe driver apprenticeship pilot
program.
Section 132 requires the Secretary to update the Department’s
regulations to ensure that non-compliance with 49 CFR
391.11(b)(2) triggers an out-of-service order.
Section 133 requires the Secretary to provide certain information
relating to training providers on the TPR and an audit plan for the
TPR.
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA]
was established as a separate organizational entity within the De-
partment of Transportation in March 1970 in order to administer
motor vehicle and highway safety programs. It is the successor
agency to the National Highway Safety Bureau, which was housed
within the FHWA. NHTSA is responsible for administering motor
vehicle safety, highway safety behavior, motor vehicle information,
and automobile fuel economy programs.
NHTSA’s mission is to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic
losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. To accomplish these
goals, NHTSA establishes and enforces safety performance stand-
ards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, investigates
safety defects in motor vehicles, and conducts research on driver
behavior and traffic safety. NHTSA provides grants and technical
assistance to State and local governments to enable them to con-

67
duct effective local highway safety programs. Together with State
and local partners, NHTSA works to reduce the threat of drunk,
impaired, and distracted driving, and to promote policies and de-
vices with demonstrated safety benefits, including helmets, child
safety seats, airbags, and graduated licenses. NHTSA establishes
and ensures compliance with fuel economy standards, investigates
odometer fraud, establishes and enforces vehicle anti-theft regula-
tions, and provides consumer information on a variety of motor ve-
hicle safety topics.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,124,255,000, including both
budget authority and limitations on the obligation of contract au-
thority. This funding is $135,590,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
These programs support traffic safety initiatives and related re-
search, demonstrations, technical assistance, and national leader-
ship for highway safety programs conducted by State and local gov-
ernments, the private sector, universities, research units, and var-
ious safety associations and organizations. These highway safety
programs emphasize alcohol and drug countermeasures, vehicle oc-
cupant protection, traffic law enforcement, emergency medical and
trauma care systems, traffic records and licensing, State and com-
munity traffic safety evaluations, protection of motorcycle riders,
pedestrian and bicyclist safety, pupil transportation, distracted
driving prevention, young and older driver safety, and improved ac-
cident investigation procedures.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee provides $419,600,000 for operations and re-
search, which is $8,800,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. Of the total amount recommended for Operations and Re-
search, $210,000,000 is from the general fund, and $209,600,000 is
from the Highway Trust Fund.
Rulemakings.—The Committee directs NHTSA to continue to
provide quarterly briefings on the status of all major rulemakings
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
Digital Alert Technology.—The Committee continues to support
use of digital alert technologies that can provide up-to-date infor-
mation about dynamic conditions on roads to drivers. NHTSA
should deploy this technology with local law enforcement in the
field.
Improving Recall Grant Outreach.—NHTSA’s ‘‘State Process for
Informing Consumers of Recalls’’ grant program is intended to re-
duce the number of vehicles that have not been repaired appro-
priately for a vehicle safety recall. This program has been shown
to be a cost-effective way to both improve safety and reduce the
burden on vehicle owners. The Committee directs NHTSA to exam-

68
ine ways to incentivize more States to apply for this grant pro-
gram.
Over-the-Air [OTA] Technology.—The Committee recognizes that
as vehicles become more automated and connected, the use of over-
the-air [OTA] software updates by manufacturers to improve vehi-
cle safety will be increasingly important and a core experience of
modern vehicle ownership. Section 24104 of the FAST Act allows
vehicle manufacturers to include notification of recalls by electronic
means in addition to notification by first class mail. The Committee
encourages NHTSA to modernize the recall process to better utilize
new technological opportunities presented by OTA software up-
dates.
Impaired Driving.—The Committee continues to support the
timely implementation of section 24220 of the IIJA, which requires
NHTSA to establish an impaired driving prevention technology
safety standard. Pursuant to the IIJA, NHTSA was required to pro-
mulgate a final rule by November 2024 or submit a report to Con-
gress explaining why the deadline could not be met. NHTSA sub-
mitted a report explaining that the agency is continuing to address
key issues in order to advance this critical rulemaking, including
alcohol-detection system readiness, test procedure development,
and countermeasure evaluation. NHTSA should continue to work
with auto manufacturers and equipment suppliers to identify any
improvements in technology that will help meet the intent of the
Congressional rulemaking requirement.
The Committee is also aware of the privacy concerns related to
this rulemaking mandate, and expects NHTSA to build privacy pro-
tections into this new standard that prevent inappropriate access
to and misuse of driver data. The success of the implementation of
any new standard will depend on public acceptance and under-
standing of the technology. Therefore, the Committee encourages
NHTSA to work with industry and other stakeholders, including
privacy experts and drunk driving victims and survivors, on coordi-
nating a public education program regarding the new safety stand-
ard.
The IIJA requires NHTSA to provide $45,000,000 from fiscal
year 2022 through 2025 for in-vehicle technology research efforts to
prevent alcohol-impaired driving. NHTSA may provide additional
resources for these efforts in fiscal year 2026 if necessary to com-
plete this research. However, NHTSA should use some of these
funds for consumer education programs designed to aid public ac-
ceptance of the technology when it becomes available in vehicles,
and should make the technology available to auto manufacturers
and suppliers by the end of this research in fiscal year 2026.
New Car Assessment Program [NCAP].—The final NCAP road-
map should adopt the most technologically advanced safety equip-
ment, including the most advanced anthropomorphic test dummies
and test procedures available in the global and domestic market-
place that can be used to physically validate the safety of occupants
within motor vehicles in an objective manner.
Drug-Impaired Driving.—The Committee remains concerned
about the rates of drug-impaired driving and supports NHTSA’s
drug-impaired driving initiative, research initiatives, and continued
education and training efforts with law enforcement and prosecu-

69
tors, such as drug recognition expert and advanced roadside im-
paired driving enforcement training. The Committee encourages
the collection of toxicology data in fatal accidents, and the develop-
ment of an objective standard to measure drug impairment and re-
lated field sobriety tests. Additionally, NHTSA is encouraged to
continue public awareness campaigns.
The Committee directs NHTSA to provide States with flexibility,
as permissible under current law, to use impaired driving counter-
measures grants for these purposes, and to issue clarifying guid-
ance on the eligible uses of highway safety program grants for
roadside drug testing devices.
Automated Vehicles [AVs].—The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $13,900,000 for NHTSA’s Office of Automation Safety within
the Office of Rulemaking to support the safe deployment of AVs by
developing and setting safety standards, evaluating exemption peti-
tions, and overseeing safety demonstrations. The Committee is
aware that this office lost almost all of its staff due to recent staff-
ing actions and retirement offers such as the DRP, and highly en-
courages the Department to prioritize hiring in this office.
The Committee recommendation includes $3,500,000 for the pub-
lic-private partnership for analytics research in traffic safety
[PARTS] and its focus on real-world insights that can improve the
performance of advanced vehicle safety technologies. The Com-
mittee encourages NHTSA to include more leading-edge advanced
driver assistance systems and automated driving systems in the
program.
Tire Standards.—In 2017, in response to E.O. 13777, Enforcing
the Regulatory Reform Agenda, the Department of Transportation
issued a Federal Register notice requesting public comment on ex-
isting rules. Respondents identified tire-related regulations that
were outdated, ineffective, and unnecessary, prompting NHTSA to
issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking [ANPRM] in 2019
that sought public comment on provisions contained in the Federal
motor vehicle safety standards for tires. NHTSA has noted that
comments to the notice will inform the agency as it considers regu-
latory reform aimed at reducing the regulatory burden while main-
taining existing safety levels for motor vehicle tires. The Com-
mittee notes that NHTSA has not taken action to fulfill its direc-
tive under E.O. 13777 since the ANPRM was issued in 2019. The
Committee directs NHTSA, within 180 days of enactment of this
act, to finalize the rulemaking initiated in the ANPRM, which
would support the objectives of both E.O. 13777 and E.O. 14192,
Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation, issued in 2025.
In the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Congress
directed that a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information
program be established to educate consumers about the safety, du-
rability, and fuel efficiency of replacement tires. In the FAST Act,
Congress directed NHTSA to promulgate regulations for tire fuel
efficiency and minimum performance standards, which will be im-
portant for energy savings, dissemination of information to con-
sumers, ensuring U.S. consumers have access to the latest tire
technologies, and assuring an equal playing field for domestic tire
producers. The Committee is disappointed that NHTSA has not
completed this congressionally mandated rulemaking. In 2021, the

70
IIJA required the DOT to report to Congress on why it had not
completed these regulations. The report indicated that NHTSA was
still collecting and analyzing data, however the agency failed to
meet its own deadline to publish a proposed rule in 2024. The Com-
mittee is concerned that NHTSA is having to restart its research
program for this rulemaking in order to meet the requirements of
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act under 49 U.S.C.
30111, and directs NHTSA to provide a status update on this re-
search program. The Committee also directs NHTSA to issue a no-
tice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the timeline set
forth by the OMB’s unified agenda and regulatory plan and brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on a realistic
timeline to complete this much-delayed rulemaking.
Traffic Fatalities and Injuries on Tribal Land.—The Committee
is concerned that crash data on Tribal lands may be underreported
by NHTSA. In 2018, NHTSA issued a report showing that fatal
crashes on Native American reservations were underreported in
previous years, and proposed a new methodology to better identify
these fatal crashes using a special jurisdictional element in the fa-
tality analysis reporting system. However, it is unclear what im-
pact this new methodology has had in improving fatal crash data,
and if this new methodology has been used for non-fatal crash re-
ports in NHTSA’s crash reporting sampling system. The Committee
directs the GAO to conduct a study to assess Federal management
of crash data on Tribal lands. The study should consider: (1) the
data available on fatal and nonfatal crashes on Tribal lands, and
the extent to which American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal gov-
ernments have access to these data; (2) any actions the DOT and
the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] have taken to improve the qual-
ity and use of data about crashes on Tribal lands; (3) additional ac-
tions that the DOT, the BIA, or others could take to improve the
quality and availability of data about crashes on Tribal lands; and
(4) the extent to which the IIJA funding for the crash data program
as authorized under section 24108 of the IIJA has benefited Tribes.
The GAO should provide this report to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 1 year of the date of enactment
of this act.
Stroke Assessment Performance Measures.—Strokes are a leading
cause of death and long-term disability among adults in the United
States, but faster diagnosis and treatment greatly increase chances
of survival. The Committee applauds NHTSA and its Office of
Emergency Medical Services [EMS] for its work to develop and dis-
seminate information on assessment, treatment, and transport-des-
tination protocols within the national model EMS clinical guide-
lines as part of a comprehensive highway and traffic safety system.
The Committee encourages NHTSA to engage with the Centers for
Disease Control [CDC] and its Federal partners on the Federal
Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services [FICEMS]
to further the adoption of EMS performance measures developed by
the national EMS quality alliance, including the existing national
EMS performance measure for stroke. The Committee directs
NHTSA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions within 180 days of enactment of this act on progress made in
engaging the CDC and FICEMS. The Committee believes that

71
these efforts will improve the timeliness and quality of stroke care
nationwide and ultimately save lives.
Independent Review.—The Committee is extremely concerned by
the lack of progress in addressing roadway fatalities over the last
decade, despite significant increases in resources to NHTSA. The
Committee is particularly concerned with the delays in promul-
gating regulations and issuing reports, often mandated by Con-
gress. To address these concerns, the Committee directs NHTSA to
contract with the National Academy of Public Administration
[NAPA] within 60 days of enactment of this act to conduct a review
to determine how NHTSA can improve: (1) the timeliness of re-
sponses to Congressional directives and mandates, including
rulemakings; (2) its expertise in research and enforcement of regu-
lations; (3) its culture to be more focused on performance and out-
comes; and (4) its communications and coordination within the
agency, within the DOT, and with external stakeholders. The
[NAPA] shall submit a final report to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations no later than 1 year after the date of en-
actment of this act.
Motorcyclist Safety.—The IIJA requires the DOT to form a Mo-
torcyclist Advisory Council to advise the Secretary on improving
safety for motorcyclists, who face a disproportionate number of
roadway fatalities and injuries. The Department has selected the
members of the Council but has yet to hold its first meeting. The
Committee believes it is extremely important for the Secretary to
receive feedback from stakeholders on key policy issues to improve
motorcyclist safety and directs the Secretary to hold a meeting of
the Motorcyclist Advisory Council within 180 days of enactment of
this act.
Accessibility of Child Safety Seats.—The Committee is concerned
that NHTSA has yet to complete and publish a report examining
the accessibility of child safety seats, as required by section 24207
of the IIJA. NHTSA is directed to brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations on the results of the report within 30
days of enactment of this act.
Motorcycle Safety.—The Committee supports automotive safety
technology that can better detect motorcycles and protect motor-
cycle riders on roadways. It is important that safety innovations
consider all roadway users, especially those who are most vulner-
able to serious injury.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
These programs support section 402 State and community for-
mula grants, the high visibility enforcement grants, and the con-
solidated national priority safety program, which consists of occu-

72
pant protection grants, State traffic safety information grants, im-
paired driving countermeasures grants, distracted driving grants,
motorcycle safety grants, State graduated driver license grants,
and non-motorized safety grants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on obligations of
$849,654,625 and authority to liquidate an equal amount of con-
tract authorization for the highway traffic safety grant programs
funded under this heading. The recommended limitation is
$18,209,793 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee continues to prohibit the use of section 402 funds
for construction, rehabilitation, or remodeling costs, or for office
furnishings and fixtures for State, local, or private buildings or
structures.
Improving Sections 402 and 405 Highway Safety Grant Pro-
grams.—NHTSA’s section 402 State and community highway safe-
ty grants program and section 405 national priority safety program
provide funding for State programs to address critical traffic safety
issues. The Committee encourages NHTSA to identify possible
changes to the administration of these grant programs in order to
streamline their administration and reduce the reporting burden
on States, as permitted by law. The Committee directs NHTSA to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment on the methods that have been identified to
reduce the administrative burden on the recipients of these grant
programs. In addition, the Committee directs the GAO to conduct
a study to assess NHTSA’s management and implementation of the
sections 402 and 405 grant programs, and to provide a report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 1 year
of the date of enactment of this act. The study should consider: (1)
the steps NHTSA takes to review State plans and applications; (2)
the extent to which NHTSA examines States’ use of data to develop
performance plans and targets and assesses State results; (3) the
practices or programs States have implemented that have resulted
in large improvements in safety outcomes for selected national pri-
orities; and (4) whether NHTSA has identified and shared these
practices or programs with other States.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS–NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY
ADMINISTRATION
Section 140 exempts obligation authority, which was made avail-
able in previous public laws, from limitations on obligations for the
current year.

management reviews and highway safety staff core competency de-
velopment training.
FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Railroad Administration [FRA] is responsible for
planning, developing, and administering programs to achieve safe
operating and mechanical practices in the railroad industry. The

73
FRA is also responsible for administering grants to the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation [Amtrak] and other financial as-
sistance programs to rehabilitate and improve railroad infrastruc-
ture.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
Under the Committee recommendation, a total program level of
$2,958,891,000 is provided for the activities of the FRA in fiscal
year 2026. The recommendation is $34,329,000 more than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. This amount is in addition to the
$13,200,000,000 in advance appropriations in the IIJA for fiscal
year 2026. The following table summarizes the Committee’s rec-
ommendations and total budgetary resources for fiscal year 2026:

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Safety and Operations account provides support for FRA rail
safety activities and all other administrative and operating activi-
ties related to staff and programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recognizes the importance of taking a holistic ap-
proach to improving railroad safety and supports a comprehensive
strategy of data-driven regulatory and inspection efforts, proactive
approaches to identify and mitigate risks, and strategic capital in-
vestments in order to improve safety. The Committee recommends
$264,549,000 for Safety and Operations for fiscal year 2026, which
is $3,250,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The fol-
lowing table provides funding levels for activities within this ac-
count.

74
Program Committee recommendation
Confidential close call reporting system................................................................................... up to $4,800,000
Grant and project development technical assistance, oversight.............................................. up to $500,000
Inspector Workforce.—The Committee remains concerned with
the current level of safety inspectors despite available resources.
The Committee supports the FRA increasing staffing for this crit-
ical safety workforce. As part of addressing potential hiring and re-
tention challenges, the Committee encourages the FRA to complete
its internal update to the classification standard of railroad inspec-
tors. Once complete, the FRA shall provide the Office of Personnel
and Management the suggested update for appropriate action. The
Committee also directs the FRA to continue to exercise its classi-
fication authority and review position descriptions for accuracy on
an ongoing basis.
Multi-Disciplinary Safety Audits.—The funding for FRA safety-
related personnel supports multi-disciplinary safety audit [MDSA]
teams. MDSAs were developed in response to the East Palestine in-
cident to gain a more comprehensive understanding of systemic
safety issues on a railroad by examining not only regulatory com-
pliance, but also overall safety culture and operations. The Com-
mittee commends the FRA for initiating these assessments, which
will include a thorough review of each Class I freight railroad’s
safety culture, practices, regulatory compliance, and recommend
changes that the FRA will track to completion. To date, the FRA
has completed supplemental safety assessments on three of the six
Class I freight railroads. The Committee is disappointed by reports
of other assessments being halted after processes were undermined
by potential employee coaching. The Committee encourages the
FRA to continue its due diligence in these assessments and in pub-
lishing reports detailing the agency’s findings.
Automated Track Inspection Program [ATIP].—The Committee
recommendation includes no less than $21,600,000 for ATIP to sup-
port the FRA’s contracts for advanced inspection vehicles, which
complement the FRA’s field inspectors, to validate the railroads in-
spection programs, and to advance research priorities. The FRA
shall continue to prioritize the inspection of routes transporting
passengers and hazardous materials.
System Safety and Maintenance Standards.—The Committee
urges the FRA to continue prioritizing investments in safety and
maintenance standardization across the industry, which supports
the development of technologies designed to verify the functional
performance of complex onboard and wayside electronic systems
such as, but not limited to: positive train control [PTC], automated
train control, passenger door control, train communications, com-
puter based train control, propulsion systems, power distribution,
braking systems, land mobile radio testing, train environmental
control, and railcar signs. The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of developing and deploying these technologies to address the
state of good repair backlog and urges the FRA to continue working
with industry to develop standardized performance verification,
testing, diagnostics, and repair for such systems.

75
Blocked Crossings.—The Committee urges the FRA to require
States receiving funding through the railroad safety State partici-
pation grant program to require first responders to report verified
blocked crossing incidents to the FRA blocked crossing portal. The
Committee also directs the FRA to work with railroads to collect
data on specific blocked crossing events, the causes of blocked
crossings, and share best practices for preventing and reducing the
number and duration of blocked crossing events. Consistent with
fiscal year 2024, the Committee directs the FRA to include in the
next annual public report required under section 22404(j) of the
IIJA potential solutions and best practices to improve safety, mobil-
ity, and emergency response capabilities at highway-rail crossings.
Recognizing that both railroad operational practices and local cir-
cumstances lead to the occurrence of blocked crossings, the report
will be informed by the FRA’s outreach to stakeholders, including
railroads, communities, first responders, labor, and State and local
authorities. The report should include: (1) best practices for engag-
ing the railroad with the public, labor, police, highway officials and
other stakeholders; (2) how current and future technology can be
used to identify impacted high risk or 911-critical locations; (3)
what role train length plays in blocked crossings; (4) how to miti-
gate impacts from crossing blockage; (5) how to improve mobility
for both pedestrians and motorists; (6) how to improve community
level emergency response capabilities; (7) how to identify crossing
blockage or other mobility constraints at passive crossings that are
not a part of the National PTC environment; and (8) how to incor-
porate data from the FRA crossing blockage reporting website, or
other data sources, to ensure effective emergency and response
plans.
Confidential Close Call Reporting System [C3RS].—The confiden-
tial close call reporting system program enables railroad employees
to report close calls and unsafe events without fear of retribution
from a railroad or the FRA. The Committee acknowledges the
FRA’s work to grow the program with industry, but remains con-
cerned with the low level of participation from Class I freight rail-
roads as only two of the six Class I freight railroads have joined
the pilot program. In addition, those pilot programs are time-lim-
ited and will expire in 2025. The Committee supports further en-
rollment and directs the FRA to continue to work with railroads on
ways to improve the C3RS program to expand enrollment and pro-
vide protections for railroad employees who report close calls and
unsafe events. The Committee further directs the FRA to continue
to ensure that the program contains protections for railroad em-
ployees to keep their identities confidential and that they are not
subject to discipline by their employers or the FRA for reports sub-
mitted through the program. Additionally, the FRA shall notify the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations upon the expira-
tion of the current Class I freight railroads pilot programs and if
the programs will be renewed.
Hazardous Materials Incident Mitigation.—The NTSB’s inves-
tigation of the East Palestine derailment found a need to improve
emergency response procedures for unloading damaged railroad
tank cars in the field. The Committee understands that the FRA
has initiated an update to the 2007 vent and burn reports in col-

76
laboration with rail industry hazardous material teams, the first
responder community, and other incident command stakeholders.
The Committee directs the FRA to complete this update and re-
publish the reports which shall include clear instructions to consult
the shipper when considering a vent and burn; more comprehen-
sive guidance on what products are candidates for a vent and burn,
along with what chemicals and other hazards may result from a
vent and burn; and an updated process flow chart. These reports
shall be distributed to emergency responder associations.
Staffing.—According to the DOT, the FRA will experience a sig-
nificant workforce reduction resulting from employees choosing to
take the DRP offer. The committee directs the FRA to provide a re-
port on the number and types of positions lost through the DRP
within each office included in the congressional budget justification
and identify if the position is based in headquarters or the field.
The report shall include an analysis of the impact of these staffing
reductions on the FRA’s ability to implement programs, grants, and
all statutory responsibilities.
RAILROAD RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $54,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 43,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The railroad research and development program provides sci-
entific and engineering support for the FRA’s rail safety rule-
making and enforcement efforts. The program also identifies and
develops emerging technologies for voluntary adoption by industry
and supports intercity passenger rail development by providing
technical assistance, equipment specifications, and proposal evalua-
tions.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $43,000,000 for
railroad research and development as authorized under section
22102 of the IIJA, which is $11,000,000 less than the fiscal year
2025 enacted level.
Rolling Stock Equipment and Components [RSEC] Safety, Main-
tenance, and Inspection.—The recommendation includes no less
than $5,000,000 to continue support for RSEC research in order to
evaluate, test, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
automated inspection and maintenance equipment and procedures.
The NTSB’s investigation of the East Palestine derailment found
that more FRA research is necessary to determine whether changes
to wayside bearing defect detection systems, such as lowering alert
and alarm thresholds, would result in significant safety improve-
ments and to determine which operational responses to bearing
alerts and alarms are sufficient to prevent derailments. Therefore,
as part of the funding for RSEC research, the FRA shall continue
to research the effectiveness of current bearing defect detection sys-
tems, including heat and acoustic; bearing alert and alarm thresh-
olds; the distances between wayside detectors; the installation, in-
spection, and maintenance of wayside bearing defect detectors; and

77
operational responses by railroads to bearing alerts and alarms.
The FRA shall make research on these topics publicly available.
The FRA’s research and evaluation will inform the capabilities and
limitations of existing technologies and provide railroads and regu-
lators with information on what changes could improve railroad
safety. The FRA’s research is critical for the development of any fu-
ture standards and minimum requirements for commercially avail-
able systems that could protect railroad personnel and the public.
Further, the Committee commends the DOT and the FRA for
taking steps within current authority to improve railroad safety,
such as tasking the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee [RSAC] in
2023 with considering and reviewing issues related to wayside de-
tectors. The Committee appreciates the status update provided by
the RSAC wayside detectors working group in October 2024 and
looks forward to the RSAC’s recommendations resulting from this
review. The Committee directs the FRA to continue to use the
RSAC to inform industry, Congress, and the public on additional
safety measures that should be taken, including regulatory and
statutory changes.
Short Line Safety Institute [SLSI].—The Committee remains sup-
portive of the FRA’s efforts, in partnership with short line and re-
gional railroads, to build a stronger, more sustainable safety cul-
ture in this segment of the rail industry, and includes $2,750,000
for the SLSI. These efforts include safety culture assessments and
the provision of hazardous materials emergency response training
in an effort to improve the safe transportation of crude oil and
other hazardous materials on our Nation’s rail network. Funds
shall be available for maintenance of safety trainsets and supple-
ment hazardous material safety training for railroad employees
and emergency responders, in addition to ongoing safety culture as-
sessments, training and education, outreach activities, and re-
search.
Rail Research and Development COE.—The Committee supports
the FRA’s intent to use no less than $2,500,000 of the resources
provided under this heading for the rail research and development
COE as authorized in section 22413 of the IIJA. The COE is in-
tended to advance basic and applied research, evaluation, edu-
cation, workforce development, and training efforts related to safe-
ty, project delivery, efficiency, reliability, resiliency, and sustain-
ability of urban commuter, intercity high-speed, and freight rail
transportation.
Transportation Technology Center.—The Committee includes up
to $3,000,000 for the construction, alteration, and repair of build-
ings and improvements at the Transportation Technology Center,
which is equal to fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
FEDERAL–STATE PARTNERSHIP FOR INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL
GRANTS

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal-state partnership for intercity passenger rail grant
program provides support for capital projects that reduce the state
of good repair backlog with respect to qualified railroad assets and
projects that expand or establish new intercity passenger rail serv-
ice, as authorized under 49 U.S.C. 24911.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $75,000,000 for the Federal-state
partnership for intercity passenger rail grant [FSP] program, which
is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This amount is in ad-
dition to the $7,200,000,000 in advance appropriations made avail-
able in the IIJA for fiscal year 2026.
Regional Rail Planning.—Of the funds provided under this head-
ing in this act and in the IIJA for fiscal year 2026, the Committee
directs the Secretary to exercise the authorities under 49 U.S.C.
24911(k) to withhold 5 percent of the total amounts made available
to carry out planning and development activities related to the cor-
ridor identification and development program authorized under 49
U.S.C. 25101.
Washington Union Station.—The Committee recommendation
provides $5,000,000 for the repair and rehabilitation of Washington
Union Station. As the owner of the station, the Federal government
has a clear role in addressing station infrastructure and system
needs. The Committee directs the FRA to provide a briefing to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this act on the structural challenges and defi-
ciencies at this Federal facility, an estimate of the scope of work
necessary to preserve this historical asset, and planned expendi-
ture of the funds provided in this act. Further, the DOT and the
FRA are directed to pursue adding designees from the Common-
wealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland to the Union Station
Redevelopment Corporation Board of Directors.
CONSOLIDATED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS
GRANTS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $100,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 151,524,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The consolidated rail infrastructure and safety improvements
[CRISI] grants program was authorized to improve the safety, effi-
ciency, and reliability of passenger and freight rail systems. Eligi-
ble activities include a wide range of freight and passenger rail
capital, safety, technology deployment, planning, environmental
analysis, research, workforce development, and training projects as
authorized under 49 U.S.C. 22907. Eligible recipients include
States, local governments, Class II and Class III railroads, Amtrak,
and other intercity passenger rail operators, rail carriers and
equipment manufacturers that partner with an eligible public-sec-
tor applicant, the Transportation Research Board, university trans-

79
portation centers, and non-profit rail labor organizations. As au-
thorized, the program requires a minimum non-Federal share of 20
percent, that preference be given to projects with at least a 50 per-
cent non-Federal match, and that at least 25 percent of the funds
be provided to projects in rural areas.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $151,524,000 for the CRISI pro-
gram, which is $51,524,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. This amount is in addition to the $1,000,000,000 in advance
appropriations made available in the IIJA for fiscal year 2026.
Within the amounts made available in this act, the recommenda-
tion includes $51,524,000 for CDS. The Committee directs the FRA
to provide funding for those projects listed in the table at the end
of this report in the corresponding amounts and for the cor-
responding recipient. The Committee further directs that the spe-
cific funding allocated in the table at the end of this report shall
not diminish or prejudice any application or geographic region to
receive other discretionary grants or loans.
Railroad Workforce Development Program.—The Committee di-
rects that not less than $5,000,000 of the funds made available
under this heading be directed to develop and execute workforce
development, training, and apprenticeship programs.
THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,427,763,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,427,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail services in 46 States
and the District of Columbia, in addition to serving as a contractor
in various capacities for several commuter rail agencies. Congress
created Amtrak in the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Public
Law 91–518) in response to private carriers’ inability to profitably
operate intercity passenger rail service. Thereafter, Amtrak as-
sumed the common carrier obligations of the private railroads in
exchange for the right to priority access to their tracks for incre-
mental cost.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$2,427,000,000 for Amtrak, which is $763,000 less than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. The amount is in addition to the
$4,400,000,000 in advance appropriations made available in the
IIJA in fiscal year 2026, which is limited to only capital projects
to address the state of good repair backlog.
Charter Trains and Private Cars.—Amtrak is directed to once
again report on the impact of its policies to charter trains and pri-
vate trains in the fiscal year 2027 budget request, and to include
the amounts and percentages by which revenues and usage de-
clined, including separate figures for charter trains run with Am-
trak-owned and with privately-owned cars. Amtrak should also con-
tinue to update the list of eligible locations for private car moves

80
and continue to evaluate such locations going forward. Amtrak
should continue to strive to improve public outreach and offer its
stakeholders an opportunity to comment on policies that affect
services prior to finalizing any such decisions.
Amtrak Station Agents.—Amtrak is required to provide station
agents, which include either Amtrak ticket agents or caretakers, at
all Amtrak stations that had a ticket agent position eliminated in
fiscal year 2018. Amtrak is again directed to communicate and col-
laborate with local partners and take into consideration the unique
needs of each community, including impacts to local jobs, when
making decisions related to the staffing of Amtrak stations.
Food and Beverage.—The Committee urges Amtrak to provide
food and beverage services in a cost effective manner consistent
with available revenue and Federal funds. The Committee directs
Amtrak to periodically update the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on the food and beverage offerings, new initia-
tives, and operating loss, as appropriate.
Services.—The Committee is concerned with any potential
offshoring of services contracts and the potential displacement of
U.S. labor. Amtrak should take the necessary affirmative steps to
ensure the contracts for customer, professional, and IT services, in-
cluding such subsidiary services, be performed within the United
States, to the extent practicable.
Lactation Accommodations.—The Committee recognizes Amtrak’s
work to implement lactation accommodations for employees and
customers that are nursing, and encourages Amtrak to consider the
continued expansion of such accommodations on board its trains
and at its stations. Amtrak is directed to report to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of this act
with an assessment on the feasibility and demand for lactation
spaces or other accommodations on board its trains or in its sta-
tions, as well as cost estimates for the design and installation of
such spaces or accommodations and if there are low-cost alter-
natives.
Passenger Rail Feasibility Analysis.—Within 1 year after the
date of enactment of this act, Amtrak, in coordination with poten-
tial infrastructure-owning freight railroads and the FRA, shall com-
plete a feasibility study for temporarily providing expanded Am-
trak long-distance service(s) during the 2034 Salt Lake City Olym-
pics. Temporary services to be assessed include two identified from
the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study required under sec-
tion 22214 of the IIJA: Salt Lake City, Utah to Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia and Denver, Colorado to Seattle, Washington. The analysis
shall assess the requirements of instituting temporary long-dis-
tance service(s) to include any track or station improvements, pro-
jected ridership and revenue, fleet and labor assessment, capital
and operational costs, host railroad agreements, and a timeline of
initiating improvements. Additional consideration should be made
of how intercity passenger rail service may complement existing or
planned commuter passenger rail service and the potential tem-
porary impacts on Amtrak’s network service levels and perform-
ance.
Fleet Modernization.—The Committee acknowledges Amtrak has
made significant progress in the production of new, modern train

81
equipment through its work on the next-generation Acela and Airo
trainsets. The need to replace these decades-old railcars was re-
cently made evident when Amtrak had to remove 70 Horizon rail-
cars, which have been in use since 1989, from service on state-sup-
ported routes in the spring of 2025 because of corrosion and other
safety issues. The Committee expects Amtrak to remain on-sched-
ule to safely deliver the new Airo trainsets for service on state-sup-
ported routes in 2026 so old trainsets can be retired. Delivery of
the next-generation Acela trainsets for the northeast corridor
[NEC] remains equally important, but the Committee is concerned
by the persistent delays, on which the Amtrak Office of Inspector
General has also reported. The Committee directs Amtrak and the
FRA to jointly provide a briefing to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act on
the status of the next-generation Acela trainset production, compli-
ance with federally mandated safety and operational testing re-
quirements, and outstanding challenges to launch revenue service
in 2025.
NORTHEAST CORRIDOR GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD
PASSENGER CORPORATION
The Committee recommends $850,000,000 for northeast corridor
grants to Amtrak, which is in addition to the $1,200,000,000 in ad-
vance appropriations made available in the IIJA in fiscal year
2026. The funding level provided includes $5,000,000 for the North-
east Corridor Commission established under 49 U.S.C. 24905,
which is in addition to the $5,000,000 in advance appropriations
made available for the Northeast Corridor Commission in the IIJA
in fiscal year 2026.
NATIONAL NETWORK GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER
CORPORATION
The Committee recommends $1,577,000,000 for national network
grants to Amtrak, which is in addition to the $3,200,000,000 in ad-
vance appropriations made available in the IIJA in fiscal year
2026. The funding level provided includes $3,000,000 for the State-
Supported Route Committee established in the FAST Act (Public
Law 114–94), which is in addition to the $3,000,000 in advance ap-
propriations made available in the IIJA in fiscal year 2026.
National Network Services.—Amtrak’s long-distance routes pro-
vide much needed transportation access in hundreds of commu-
nities and for rural areas where mobility options are limited.
Equally important are routes that provide service to rural areas
from urban areas along the NEC. The Committee does not support
proposals that will inevitably lead to long-term or permanent serv-
ice cuts or segmentation of routes, which will result in less service
for rural communities.
Corridor Identification and Development Program [CIDP].—Pur-
suant to 49 U.S.C. 25101, the FRA established the CIDP in May
2023 to facilitate the development of intercity passenger rail cor-
ridors across the Nation. To facilitate this effort, the Committee
recommendation includes up to $66,000,000 for Amtrak to carry
out activities for corridors selected under CIDP, as authorized
under section 22101(h) of the IIJA.

82
Modernization Projects.—The Committee acknowledges Amtrak’s
budget request includes modernization initiatives it could pursue
beyond its annual operations that would further improve the rail-
road and customer experience. Of the amount provided for the na-
tional network, $5,000,000 is for the Atlanta hub initiative for a
new intercity passenger rail hub in downtown Atlanta as included
in Amtrak’s fiscal year 2026 legislative and grant request.
Midwest Rail Commission Study.—The Committee directs the
GAO to examine the establishment of a federally authorized com-
mission for the purposes of developing a long-term delivery strat-
egy for Midwest rail. The study should identify lessons learned
from the establishment of the Northeast Corridor Commission,
which coordinates capital improvements made by Amtrak and
States to the NEC rail infrastructure, that could be applied to a
Midwest Rail Commission. This study should also examine any
Federal resources, including staff and funding, necessary to estab-
lish a federally authorized commission, where such a Commission
could be housed, as well as any successful practices for identifying
projects in need of prioritization, among other information. The
GAO shall provide initial findings in a briefing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enact-
ment of this act and final findings and recommendations within 1
year of enactment of this act.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS–FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION
(INCLUDING RESCISSIONS)
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Section 150 allows the FRA to transfer certain amounts made
available in this and prior acts to the financial assistance oversight
and technical assistance account to support the award, administra-
tion, project management oversight, and technical assistance of
grants administered by the FRA, with an exception.
Section 151 limits overtime payments to employees at Amtrak to
$35,000 per employee. However, Amtrak’s president may waive
this restriction for specific employees for safety or operational effi-
ciency reasons.
Section 152 prohibits the use of funds made available by this act
by Amtrak in contravention of the Worker Adjustment and Re-
training Notification Act.
Section 153 prohibits the use of funds provided to Amtrak to re-
duce the total number of Amtrak Police Department uniformed offi-
cers patrolling on board passenger trains or at stations, facilities,
or rights-of-way below the staffing level on May 1, 2019.
Section 154 permits the Union Station Redevelopment Corpora-
tion to be an eligible recipient for the FSP program.
Section 155 expresses the sense of Congress in support of Am-
trak’s long-distance passenger routes.
Section 156 rescinds certain unobligated balances.

83
FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Transit Administration [FTA] was established as a
component of the Department of Transportation by Reorganization
Plan No. 2 of 1968, effective July 1, 1968, which transferred most
of the functions and programs under the Federal Transit Act of
1964, as amended (78 Stat. 302; 49 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The missions of
the FTA are: to help develop improved mass transportation sys-
tems and practices; to support the inclusion of public transpor-
tation in community and regional planning to support economic de-
velopment; to provide mobility for Americans who depend on tran-
sit for transportation in both metropolitan and rural areas; to
maximize the productivity and efficiency of transportation systems;
and to provide assistance to State and local governments and agen-
cies in financing such services and systems.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
Under the Committee recommendation, a total program level of
$16,890,357,000 is provided for programs administered by the FTA
in fiscal year 2026. The recommendation is $203,288,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This amount is in addition to the
$4,250,000,000 in advance appropriations in the IIJA for fiscal year
2026.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Communities use formula grants funding for bus and railcar pur-
chases, facility repair and construction, maintenance, and where el-
igible, planning and operating expenses. The formula grants ac-
count includes funding for the following programs: transit-oriented
development; planning programs; urbanized area formula grants;
enhanced mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities; a
pilot program for enhanced mobility; formula grants for rural
areas; public transportation innovation; technical assistance and
workforce development, including a national transit institute; a bus
testing facility; the national transit database; state of good repair
grants; buses and bus facilities formula and competitive grants;
and growing States and high-density States formula grants. Set-
asides from formula funds are directed to a grant program for each
State with rail systems not regulated by the FRA to meet the re-
quirements for a State safety oversight program. The account also
provides funding to support passenger ferry services, public trans-
portation on Indian reservations, and the administrative expenses
of the FTA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends limiting obligations and the liquida-
tion of contract authorizations in the transit formula grants ac-
count in fiscal year 2026 to $14,642,000,000, which is $363,000,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Ferry Fleet Transition Plans.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to consider ferry fleet transition plans as eligible under
the planning programs in 49 U.S.C. 5305, the urbanized area for-

85
mula program (49 U.S.C. 5307), and rural area formula program
(49 U.S.C. 5311).
Bus-to-Person Collisions.—The Committee commends the FTA for
its efforts to encourage the adoption of mitigation strategies that
reduce bus-to-person collisions, including the issuance of FTA safe-
ty advisory 23–1. The Committee expects the FTA to encourage
transit agencies to adopt proven on-board technology solutions to
detect, deter, and avoid collisions through program guidance and
NOFOs, where permissible and feasible.
Bus Safety and Accessibility Research.—The FTA issued a NOFO
on November 18, 2024, for the bus safety and accessibility research
program making up to $10,000,000 in public transportation innova-
tion program funding available for research, development, dem-
onstration, and deployment activities. A strategic goal for this pro-
gram is to make ‘‘existing and new buses safer for their operators
and vulnerable road users’’ and a key focus area is ‘‘Driver Safety
Systems’’. The Committee notes that applications were due to the
FTA on January 17, 2025, and directs the FTA to make awards for
the bus safety and accessibility research program not later than 90
days after the date of enactment of this act.
Roadway Worker Protections.—The Committee is concerned
about the safety of transit employees working on or near transit
rail tracks. Proven roadway worker protection [RWP] technologies
exist that provide advanced train approach warnings and have the
potential to improve the safety and efficiency of rail operations.
The Committee encourages the FTA to promote the maximum level
of RWP safety, to the extent permissible under current law.
Updates to the FTA’s Best Practices Procurement and Lessons
Learned Manual.—The FTA is directed to update its best practices
procurement manual not later than 180 days after enactment of
this act and to the greatest extent practicable incorporate rec-
ommendations submitted to the agency by industry stakeholders
for consideration.
Staffing.—With the significant reduction in staffing levels in fis-
cal year 2025 as a result of employees electing to take the DRP,
the FTA is experiencing a 33 percent reduction to the agency’s
workforce. The Committee is aware that this will impact staffing
in regional offices. The Committee is concerned about the impact
of these staffing reductions on the Department’s ability to oversee
and support the maintenance and construction of transit infra-
structure projects. As such, the Committee directs the FTA to pro-
vide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions on the number and job series of positions lost through the
DRP within each office included in the congressional budget jus-
tification as well as each regional office. The report shall include
an analysis of the impact of these staffing reductions on the agen-
cy’s ability to implement Federal transit formula and grant pro-
grams and all other statutory responsibilities.
Employer-Sponsored Transit Benefits.—Employer-sponsored tran-
sit benefits play a role in increasing the rate of transit use. Public
Law 115–97 eliminated employer deductions for qualified transpor-
tation fringe benefits, which include mass transit benefits, van
pools, qualified parking, and other forms of commuter benefits. The
Committee directs the GAO to conduct a study to assess the preva-

86
lence and effects of employer-sponsored transit benefits, including
possible impacts the tax changes to the qualified transportation
fringe benefit has had on such programs and employee transit use.
The GAO is directed to provide a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on such study not later than 1 year
after the date of enactment of this act.
Major International Sporting Events.—The Committee is encour-
aged by the support the Secretary and administration have pro-
vided for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic and
Paralympic Games. The Committee directs the Secretary to con-
tinue to provide technical assistance as host cities and transit pro-
viders work to deliver high quality transit service for these events
of national significance. While the Committee recognizes that the
FTA issued a Dear Colleague letter on June 10, 2024 on providing
transit during major events and has advised transit providers to
work with FTA regional offices on specific issues relating to charter
service restrictions, the Committee understands that transit pro-
viders continue to have concerns with the applicability of certain
FTA requirements as such requirements do not contemplate events
of the scale and scope of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olym-
pic and Paralympic Games. For example, transit providers are con-
cerned with exceeding the FTA’s maximum spare ratio and not the
minimum number of spares as addressed in the Dear Colleague let-
ter. To support the ability of transit providers to prepare for and
deliver transit service during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028
Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary to work with transit providers to provide appropriate relief
from the spare ratio requirement and charter service restrictions,
if requested by a transit provider specifically for activities to sup-
port the preparation for and delivery of transit service during such
events. Further, the Committee directs the Secretary to convene
passenger and freight transportation stakeholders, including but
not limited to transit providers, intercity rail and bus operators,
freight railroads, ports, trucking companies, and labor, in an effort
to continue the efficient movement of goods and avoid potential
congestion during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic and
Paralympic Games.
2026 FIFA World Cup.—The Committee notes that the United
States will host 78 matches across nine States in 11 cities over 39
days during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Host cities and transit pro-
viders are preparing to move thousands of spectators to and from
matches and daily festivities surrounding the tournament. To sup-
port transit providers with increasing passenger capacity, extend-
ing service hours, employing additional personnel, and enhancing
transit security, the Committee recommendation repurposes
$78,115,871 from prior year activities for operational transpor-
tation assistance for planning and executing activities directly tied
to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.—The Committee notes
that for the two prior Olympic Games in the United States, Salt
Lake City, Utah in 2002 and Atlanta, Georgia in 1996, a program
was established under which public transit agencies throughout the
United States donated or leased buses (and in some instances pro-
vided bus operators) to the host public transportation agencies and

87
the host city Olympic committee. To build on that model and rep-
licate those successes, the Committee directs the Secretary and the
administration to assist in the implementation of a similar bus
leasing program for the cities hosting events in support of the 2028
Olympic and Paralympic Games. To that end, the Committee rec-
ommendation repurposes $68,000,000 from prior year activities to
support the planning, development, and operations of a supple-
mental bus system; regional traffic surveillance and management
systems; and identification and deployment of dedicated bus lanes
for the games route network.
TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $45,568,868
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 140,857,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Committee provides funding for transit infrastructure grants
to address targeted capital, operating, and state of good repair
needs for public transportation providers and services across Amer-
ica.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $140,857,000 in transit infrastruc-
ture grants to remain available until expended, which is
$95,288,132 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. An addi-
tional $193,905,005 is repurposed from prior year activities for a
total of $334,762,005 in budget authority. Of this total, $58,857,000
is for CDS.
Transit Vehicle Innovation Deployment Centers [TVIDC].—The
Committee supports the continued use of the FTA’s TVIDC pro-
gram to develop solutions to the challenges transit operators and
bus original equipment manufacturers face as they move to full
scale adoption of advanced transit technologies. The Committee di-
rects the FTA to prioritize research efforts focused on the dissemi-
nation of research and technologies that maximize the value of
these investments. The Committee directs the FTA to utilize the
TVIDC program to focus research on efficiency improvements and
directs the FTA to fund component testing (including the use of
FTA-appointed component testing centers), technical assistance co-
ordination, and increasing understanding and skill sets within
transit agencies in regards to planning, procuring, and deploying
advanced technologies using the TVIDC’s nation and industry-wide
coordination structure for the development and testing of new tech-
nology components and vehicles.
Cost Escalations.—The Committee recognizes that cost esca-
lations can reduce the impact of prior transit grant awards. The
Committee encourages the FTA to work with grantees when cost
adjustments or other factors impacting the completion of projects
become necessary to address.
Critical Components.—The Committee encourages the FTA to
work with OMB to utilize all available authorities to ensure critical
components of ferry vessels acquired with FTA funds are not ex-
cluded as a result of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j). Critical components include

88
items vital to relatability, safety, and performance, such as propul-
sion systems. The Committee continues to urge the Department to
continue to harmonize the regulatory regimes across modes, uti-
lizing existing authorities, to ensure Buy America provisions for
ferry construction are transparent and deliver the best vessel for
riders and the taxpayer.
Transit Safety.—The Committee notes the Department’s empha-
sis on the safety and security of public transportation. Federal
transit funding may be used by recipients for planning efforts that
address transit rider or employee safety and capital projects to im-
prove safety for transit riders and workers, such as purchasing and
installing cameras in subway cars, lighting at transit stations, and
shields for bus drivers. However, transit agencies in urbanized
areas with a population of more than 200,000 are prohibited from
using Federal transit funding for public transportation safety and
security operating assistance projects, such as staff salaries for per-
sonnel exclusively involved with security; contracts for security
services, including with police departments; and contracts or sala-
ries for crisis intervention specialists. Transit agencies in such
large urbanized areas use their non-Federal funding to support ac-
tivities and programs to improve safety and security. To bolster the
efforts of large urban area transit agencies, the Committee rec-
ommendation includes $20,000,000 for operating costs to improve
public safety, reduce crime, and increase security in transit sys-
tems.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,500,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The FTA is authorized to provide technical assistance, workforce
development programs, and training to the public transportation
industry under section 5314 of title 49, United States Code. Fund-
ing under this heading is supplemental to the funding provided
under the heading ‘‘Transit Formula Grants’’ heading as authorized
by the IIJA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $7,500,000 for technical assistance
and training, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee recognizes the need among transit providers serv-
ing small cities, rural areas, and disadvantaged communities for
technical assistance to help them take advantage of new tech-
nologies, including ride-hailing applications, autonomous shuttles,
and micro-transit innovations that are transforming how Ameri-
cans use public transportation. This funding will provide rural and
small city transit operators with hands-on technical assistance that
will facilitate the adoption of these new tools.
Cooperative Agreements.—The Committee includes $1,500,000 for
a cooperative agreement with a technical assistance center to assist
small-urban, rural, and Tribal public transit providers and plan-
ning agencies with applied innovation and capacity building that
helps these grantees and sub-recipients deploy innovative and

89
emerging technologies to maximize the efficiency of their oper-
ations. These efforts should include, but are not limited to: devel-
oping on-demand mobility options; exploring the feasibility of au-
tonomous technologies; assisting rural and small-urban areas with
changing mode-share strategies; and increasing data literacy and
effective use of data to increase operational efficiency. The Com-
mittee recommendation also includes $2,500,000 for a cooperative
agreement to a national non-profit organization with a dem-
onstrated capacity to develop and provide workforce development
and standards based training in maintenance and operations with-
in the public transportation industry.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $2,205,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,950,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Under the capital investment grants [CIG] program, the FTA
provides grants to fund the building of new fixed guideway systems
or extensions and improvements to existing fixed guideway sys-
tems. Eligible services include light rail, rapid rail (heavy rail),
commuter rail, and bus rapid transit. The program includes fund-
ing for four categories of eligible projects authorized under 49
U.S.C. 5309, and section 3005(b) of the FAST Act (Public Law 114–
94): new starts, small starts, core capacity, and the expedited
project delivery pilot program.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,950,000,000 for capital invest-
ment grants, which is $255,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. The recommendation adjusts the set-asides of the
$1,600,000,000 provided under this heading in the IIJA in order to
ensure that, when combined with amounts provided in this act,
there are total budgetary resources of $3,550,000,000 for the CIG
program in fiscal year 2026. The following table provides funding

Project Management Oversight [PMO] Activities.—The Committee
directs the FTA to continue to submit to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations the quarterly PMO reports for each
project with a full funding grant agreement.
Full Funding Grant Agreements [FFGAs].—Section 5309(k) of
title 49, United States Code, requires that the FTA notify the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, as well as the
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 15
days before executing a FFGA. In its notification to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations, the Committee directs the
FTA to submit the following information: (1) a copy of the proposed
FFGA; (2) the total and annual Federal appropriations required for
the project; (3) the yearly and total Federal appropriations that can
be planned or anticipated for existing FFGAs for each fiscal year
through 2026; (4) a detailed analysis of annual commitments for
current and anticipated FFGAs against the program authorization,
by individual project; (5) a financial analysis of the project’s cost
and sponsor’s ability to finance the project, which shall be con-
ducted by an independent examiner and which shall include an as-
sessment of the capital cost estimate and finance plan; (6) the
source and security of all public and private sector financing; (7)
the project’s operating plan, which enumerates the project’s future
revenue and ridership forecasts; and (8) a listing of all planned con-
tingencies and possible risks associated with the project.
The Committee also directs the FTA to inform the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations in writing 30 days before ap-
proving schedule, scope, or budget changes to any FFGA. Cor-
respondence relating to all such changes shall include any budget
revisions or program changes that materially alter the project as
originally stipulated in the FFGA, including any proposed change
in rail car procurement.
The Committee directs the FTA to continue to provide a monthly
capital investment grants program update to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations, detailing the status of each project.
This update should include anticipated milestone schedules for ad-
vancing projects, especially those within 2 years of a proposed
FFGA. It should also highlight and explain any potential cost and
schedule changes affecting projects.
Annual Report on Funding Recommendations.—The Committee
directs the Secretary to submit the fiscal year 2027 annual report
on funding recommendations required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o), and di-
rects the Secretary to maintain the Federal Government funding
commitments for all existing grant agreements and identify all
projects with a medium or higher rating that anticipate requesting
a grant agreement in fiscal year 2027.
New Transportation Projects in Low-Growth Areas.—The Com-
mittee encourages the FTA to prioritize projects that connect com-
munities unserved or underserved by transit to employment cen-
ters and projects that support economic growth in disadvantaged
areas.
New Starts.—The Committee urges the FTA to proceed expedi-
tiously while reviewing revised new start project applications for

91
projects previously recommended for funding in more than one FTA
annual report on funding recommendations.
GRANTS TO THE WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT
AUTHORITY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $150,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 150,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This appropriation provides assistance to the Washington Metro-
politan Area Transit Authority [WMATA] for capital investment
and asset rehabilitation as authorized by section 601 of division B
of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008
(Public Law 110–432) and section 30019 of the IIJA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $150,000,000 for grants
to WMATA for capital and preventive maintenance expenses, in-
cluding pressing safety-related investments, which is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. These grants are in addition to the
Federal formula and competitive grant funding WMATA receives,
as well as funding from local jurisdictions. This funding will sup-
port WMATA in addressing ongoing safety deficiencies and improve
the reliability of service throughout the Metrorail system. Safety
must continue to be a top priority. This prioritization means work-
ing to establish and build a culture of safety throughout the organi-
zation, including a culture that fosters rigorous adherence to safety
rules and procedures as a matter of routine. WMATA must also
continue to improve its relationship with the Washington Metro-
politan Safety Commission, including improving communication
and transparency that supports the resolution of issues and dis-
agreements in a timely fashion.

maintenance, and capital infrastructure activities of the GLS,
which is $336,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of
the amounts provided, not less than $15,950,000 is for the seaway
infrastructure program.
MARITIME ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Maritime Administration [MARAD] is responsible for pro-
grams authorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended
(46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.). MARAD is also responsible for pro-

93
grams that strengthen the United States maritime industry in sup-
port of the Nation’s security and economic needs. MARAD
prioritizes the DoD use of ports and intermodal facilities during
DoD mobilizations to guarantee the smooth flow of military cargo
through commercial ports. MARAD manages the maritime security
program, the voluntary intermodal sealift agreement program, and
the ready reserve force, which ensure DoD access to commercial
and strategic sealift and associated intermodal capacity. MARAD
also ensures the safe disposal of obsolete ships in the National de-
fense reserve fleet. Further, MARAD administers education and
training programs through the United States Merchant Marine
Academy [USMMA] and six State maritime academies [SMAs] that
assist in producing skilled merchant marine officers capable of
serving defense and commercial transportation needs.
MARITIME SECURITY PROGRAM

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $318,000,000
Committee recommendation1 ............................................................... 390,000,000
1Includes $390,000,000 in new budget authority and a rescission of $33,400,000 from prior
year appropriations.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The maritime security program [MSP] provides resources to
maintain a U.S. flag merchant fleet crewed by U.S. citizens to
serve both the commercial and national security needs of the
United States. The program provides direct payments to U.S. flag
vessel operators engaged in U.S. foreign trade. Participating opera-
tors are required to keep the vessels in active commercial service
and provide intermodal sealift support to the DoD in times of war
or national emergency.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $390,000,000 for
the MSP, which is $72,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. In addition, $33,400,000 from prior year appropriations
is rescinded.
CABLE SECURITY FLEET
(INCLUDING RESCISSION)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $10,000,000
Committee recommendation1 ............................................................... 10,000,000
1Includes $10,000,000 in new budget authority and a rescission of $12,000,000 from prior year
appropriations.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Section 3521 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92) authorized the cable security fleet
program to establish and maintain a fleet of privately owned, com-
mercially viable United States-documented cable vessels to meet
national security requirements. The cable security fleet program
provides payments to U.S. flag commercial vessel operators that
provide cable services upon the request of the United States.

94
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $10,000,000 for
the cable security fleet program, which is equal to the fiscal year
2025 enacted level. In addition, $12,000,000 from prior year appro-
priations is rescinded.
TANKER SECURITY FLEET
(INCLUDING RESCISSION)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $60,000,000
Committee recommendation1 ............................................................... 122,400,000
1Includes $122,400,000 in new budget authority and a rescission of $77,000,000 from prior
year appropriations.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Section 3511 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283)
authorized the tanker security fleet program to establish and main-
tain a fleet of active, commercially viable, militarily useful, pri-
vately owned product tank vessels to meet national defense and
other security requirements. The tanker security fleet program pro-
vides direct payments to U.S. flag vessel operators, and partici-
pating operators are in turn required to operate in U.S. foreign
commerce, mixed U.S. foreign commerce, and domestic trade and to
make vessels available upon the request of the DoD.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $122,400,000 for
the tanker security fleet program, which is $62,400,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. In addition, $77,000,000 from
prior year appropriations is rescinded.
OPERATIONS AND TRAINING
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $267,775,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 240,898,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The operations and training appropriation primarily funds the
salaries and expenses for MARAD headquarters and regional staff
for all MARAD programs. The account also includes funding for the
USMMA, port and intermodal development, cargo preference, inter-
national trade relations, deep-water port licensing, maritime envi-
ronmental and technical assistance, the United States marine high-
way program, and administrative support costs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $240,898,000 for operations and
training. This amount is $26,877,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. The following table provides funding levels for activi-
ties within this account:
2026
Recommendation
USMMA Operations....................................................................................................................................... $101,500,000

95
2026
Recommendation
USMMA Facilities Maintenance and Repair, and Equipment...................................................................... 50,000,000
USMMA Capital Improvement Program [CIP] .............................................................................................. 10,000,000
Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance Program [META] ......................................................... 2,000,000
United States Marine Highway Program...................................................................................................... 5,000,000
MARAD Headquarters Operations................................................................................................................. 72,398,000
Total................................................................................................................................................ 240,898,000
Staffing.—The Committee continues to direct MARAD to provide
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with quar-
terly staffing updates, including on hiring and separations, by pro-
gram office for all positions funded by this act in MARAD head-
quarters operations and USMMA operations.
USMMA Capital Asset Management Program.—The Committee
remains deeply concerned about the current condition of the
USMMA’s facilities, which has a direct impact on the quality of the
education provided to students and the ability to attract new en-
trants to serve as future leaders in the United States Merchant
Marine. As such, the Committee’s recommendation provides
$50,000,000 for the USMMA’s facilities maintenance and repair,
and equipment [FMRE] activities. In addition, the Committee pro-
vides $10,000,000 for the capital improvement program [CIP],
which in addition to the $160,000,000 in unobligated balances, pro-
vides the USMMA with $170,000,000 to move forward with several
CIP projects over the next few years. The Committee reminds the
USMMA that, in the event that flexibility is necessary to address
imminent safety hazards or quality of life issues, it has the ability
to exercise the reprogramming authorities under section 405 of this
act, including by seeking approval from the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee is disappointed that the USMMA has yet to sub-
mit its annual CIP plan to Congress, leading to further delays in
implementing much needed improvements of the campus. Given
the significant amount of unobligated balances for CIP projects, it
is unacceptable that the USMMA has yet to formulate a long-term
plan on which it can move forward. The Secretary is directed to
provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with
the CIP plan within 30 days of enactment of this act. In addition,
the USMMA’s Director of Facilities and Infrastructure shall pro-
vide quarterly briefings to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the status of all short- and long-term capital im-
provement projects and FMRE activities and continue to provide
the annual report in the same manner and context as in previous
fiscal years. The Committee strongly encourages the USMMA to
maintain current information on CIP projects and any major repair
FMRE activities on its website to expand the availability of this in-
formation to students and external stakeholders, such as the alum-
ni foundation which also provides support to USMMA projects. The
Committee also directs the OST Assistant Secretary of Administra-
tion to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
on the status of its hiring search for the recently vacated Super-
intendent and Deputy Superintendent positions at the USMMA

96
within 30 days of enactment of this act, as having such leadership
in place is critical to advancing FMRE and CIP projects.
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment [SASH] at the
USMMA.—Creating a culture of safety, respect, and dignity for ca-
dets and faculty is essential to reducing student vulnerability to
SASH, and every student deserves to pursue an education and a
future workplace free from unwanted sexual aggression. The Com-
mittee commends students who have courageously come forward to
publicly report allegations of SASH in an effort to hold perpetrators
accountable and prevent future violations.
The Committee acknowledges MARAD and the USMMA have
made meaningful steps to improving safety for USMMA mid-
shipmen, but it remains a work in progress to sustain staffing for
the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office [SAPRO], to se-
cure broader industry participation in the every mariner builds a
respectful culture [EMBARC] program, and to improve access to
mental health and counseling services. The Committee directs the
USMMA to fully staff the SAPRO, including a second victim advo-
cate position. The Committee directs MARAD to brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on how the USMMA fac-
ulty and staff are improving the culture of safety on campus.
Vessel Generated Underwater Noise.—MARAD shall use not less
than $1,500,000 of the funds provided under the META program to
collect data and further investigate vessel generated underwater
noise. When selecting projects, the Committee directs MARAD to
strongly consider projects led by regional coalitions that conduct re-
search, mitigation, and management activities to reduce vessel-gen-
erated underwater noise on the maritime environment, including
large commercial vessels impacting Endangered Species Act-listed
whales.
Vessel Generated Noise While Docked.—The Committee strongly
encourages MARAD to work as expeditiously as possible to identify
and implement mitigation measures that will minimize noise im-
pacts to surrounding communities when MARAD ships are not op-
erating on shore power. Not later than 60 days after enactment of
this act, MARAD is directed to provide a briefing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations detailing the planning in-
volved in determining the June 2025 relocation of the USNS Pom-
eroy and USNS Charlton, the timeline and implementation of con-
necting the ships to shore power, and the mitigation measures
taken to minimize noise impacts in surrounding communities.
Secure Composite Shipping Containers.—The Committee strongly
encourages MARAD to continue to collaborate with the Federal
Maritime Commission, DoD, and DHS to support the transition of
secure composite shipping containers into wider use to provide in-
creased security, shipment visibility, and cargo facilitation. Only a
fraction of the millions of shipping containers coming to the United
States are scanned due to logistics limitations. This technology en-
ables Federal agencies and commercial high-value good producers
to combat tampering by sophisticated adversaries, and minimize
loss from theft, damage, or spoilage. The ultimate goal of the se-
cure container transition effort led by DHS and supported by
MARAD is to provide the level of security to law enforcement offi-
cials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not

97
been inserted into the container for smuggling into the United
States. A December 2023 container deployment report to DHS de-
termined that at least 250 six-sided containers will need to be built
and deployed in field trials in order to achieve industry’s confidence
level to adopt the new technology. MARAD should work with DHS
and the DoD to identify shipping routes for secure container dem-
onstration and field trials, engage with government and commer-
cial shippers to educate potential users of the secure containers
about the capabilities and benefits of the containers, review govern-
ment policies and make recommendations to DHS and other agen-
cies on policy changes that could accelerate the transition of secure
container technology into the marketplace, and use the existing
America’s marine highway program and the port infrastructure de-
velopment program to promote and provide funding for secure com-
posite shipping containers, if available and if eligible.
STATE MARITIME ACADEMY OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $125,788,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 143,400,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Committee provides funding for the six SMAs to support the
training and education of the Nation’s maritime transportation
workforce. Funding provided supports financial assistance for the
SMAs as well as maintenance and operation of the schools’ training
ships.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $143,400,000 for
state maritime academy operations. The recommendation is
$17,612,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The bill
provides the following funding levels for specific activities within
this account:
2026
Recommendation
School ship maintenance and repair .......................................................................................................... $7,800,000
Student incentive program .......................................................................................................................... 4,800,000
Fuel assistance program ............................................................................................................................. 9,800,000
Direct payments for SMAs ........................................................................................................................... 6,000,000
National security multi-mission vessel program......................................................................................... 115,000,000
Total................................................................................................................................................ 143,400,000
National Security Multi-Mission Vessel [NSMV] Program.—The
Committee recommendation includes $115,000,000 for the NSMV
program, which provides funding for program operations in support
of SMA shore-side infrastructure improvements, ship delivery,
cyber security, transit costs, GPS hardening, operations, integra-
tion, oversight, and management of the NSMVs. Of this total,
$60,000,000 shall be for shore-side infrastructure improvements at
the SMAs, and $55,000,000 shall be for expenses related to the op-
eration, integration, oversight and management of national secu-
rity multi-mission school ships, including insurance, maintenance,
repair, and equipment costs.

98
The Committee continues to direct MARAD to conduct vigorous
oversight of the vessel construction manager, as well as the ship-
yard, to ensure the NSMVs are delivered on budget and on time.
MARAD is directed to continue to provide briefings to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of the
NSMV program on a quarterly basis, including detailed reporting
on the shore-side infrastructure improvements needed at SMAs to
ensure successful berthing and operation of the NSMVs and 5-year
cost projections for the overall NSMV program. MARAD should
provide immediate notification of any risks to the construction
schedule or cost.
Consistent with previous fiscal years, shore-side infrastructure
shall only include NSMV-specific improvements required by
MARAD to safely moor the vessels and other improvements that
are necessary for SMAs to receive the NSMVs. Specifically, shore-
side infrastructure shall include pier construction and upgrades di-
rectly related to the mooring of the vessel, but not general mainte-
nance that would otherwise be necessary absent receiving an
NSMV, and is inclusive of associated utility upgrades directly re-
lated to mooring and operating the vessel, including, but not lim-
ited to, electricity and steam. The Committee directs MARAD to
implement a non-Federal cost share of 20 percent for shore-side in-
frastructure improvements. In the event that there are extenuating
circumstances that an SMA is unable to meet the 20 percent non-
Federal cost-share requirement, MARAD may determine whether a
different non-Federal cost-share requirement is appropriate, nec-
essary, and executable. In addition, the Committee directs MARAD
to sequence the funding distributed to SMAs for shore-side infra-
structure improvements based on the vessel delivery schedule. Fur-
ther, MARAD shall notify the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations prior to obligating any funds for shore-side infra-
structure improvements, and such notification shall include the
amount of funding provided by non-Federal sources for such infra-
structure.
ASSISTANCE TO SMALL SHIPYARDS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,750,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 30,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
As authorized under section 54101 of title 46, United States
Code, the assistance to small shipyards program provides assist-
ance in the form of grants, loans, and loan guarantees to small
shipyards for capital improvements and training programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $30,000,000 for assist-
ance to small shipyards. This level of funding is $21,250,000 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Funding for this program
is intended to help small shipyards improve the efficiency of their
operations by providing funding for equipment and other facility
upgrades. The funding recommended by the Committee will help
improve the competitiveness of our Nation’s small shipyards, as

99
well as support workforce training and apprenticeships in commu-
nities dependent upon maritime transportation.
SHIP DISPOSAL
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The ship disposal account provides resources to dispose of obso-
lete merchant type vessels that are 150,000 gross tons or more and
no longer useful for defense or aid missions. The goals of the ship
disposal program are to remove vessels that present the highest or
most immediate risk to the environment and provide disposal alter-
natives and necessary funding to ensure that obsolete vessels are
disposed faster than vessels are added to the MARAD fleet.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $6,000,000 for
MARAD’s ship disposal program. This amount is equal to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.
MARITIME GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM [TITLE XI]
(INCLUDING RESCISSION)
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $53,586,000
Committee recommendation1 ............................................................... 3,940,000
1Includes $3,940,000 for administrative expenses and a rescission of $25,000,000 from unobli-
gated balances.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The maritime guaranteed loan program was established pursu-
ant to title XI of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (Public Law 74–
835), as amended. The program provides for a full faith and credit
guarantee by the U.S. Government of debt obligations issued by: (1)
U.S. or foreign shipowners for the purposes of financing or refi-
nancing either U.S. flag vessels or eligible export vessels con-
structed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in U.S. shipyards; and (2)
U.S. shipyards, for the purpose of financing advanced shipbuilding
technology of privately owned general shipyard facilities located in
the United States. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990
(Public Law 101–508), appropriations to cover the estimated costs
of a project must be obtained prior to the issuance of any approvals
for title XI financing.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee provides an appropriation of $3,940,000 for ad-
ministrative expenses of the maritime guaranteed loan title XI pro-
gram, which is $940,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Of the unobligated balances for title XI loan guarantee subsidy,
$25,000,000 are rescinded, and sufficient balances remain to pro-
vide loan guarantees to the six applicants currently in process.

PORT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $50,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 96,482,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The port infrastructure development program [PIDP] is author-
ized in 46 U.S.C. 54301 to provide grants for improving the safety,
efficiency, or reliability of the movement of goods through ports and
intermodal connections to ports.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $96,482,000 for the
PIDP, which is $46,482,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. Of the total amount provided, $21,482,000 is for CDS, and
the Committee directs MARAD to provide funding for the projects
listed in the table at the end of this report in corresponding
amounts. MARAD should strive to distribute PIDP funding to the
various regions of the United States.
Set Asides.—The Committee directs MARAD to set aside 25 per-
cent of the funds for small inland river and coastal ports and ter-
minals, as required by 46 U.S.C. 54301. The recommendation di-
rects MARAD to allow Federal cost shares above 80 percent for
projects in rural areas, as permitted by 46 U.S.C. 54301.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION–MARITIME ADMINISTRATION
Section 170 authorizes MARAD to furnish utilities and services
and to make necessary repairs in connection with any lease, con-
tract, or occupancy involving Government property under control of
MARAD and allows payments received to be credited to the Treas-
ury and to remain available until expended.
PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
[PHMSA] was established within the Department of Transpor-
tation on November 30, 2004, pursuant to the Norman Y. Mineta
Research and Special Programs Improvement Act (Public Law 108–
426). PHMSA is responsible for the Department’s pipeline safety
program as well as oversight of hazardous materials transportation
safety operations. The agency is dedicated to safety, including the
elimination of transportation related deaths and injuries associated
with hazardous materials and pipeline transportation, and to pro-
moting transportation solutions, which enhance communities and
protect the environment. The following table summarizes the Com-
mittee’s recommendations:

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for program support costs for
PHMSA, including policy development, civil rights, management,
administration, and other agency-wide expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $31,312,000 for this account, of
which not less than $2,000,000 shall be for pipeline safety informa-
tion grants to communities and $2,500,000 shall be for emergency
response grants. The Committee’s recommendation is $369,000 less
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Staffing.—According to the DOT, PHMSA will experience a sig-
nificant workforce reduction from employees choosing to take the
DRP offer. The committee directs PHMSA to provide a report on
the number and types of positions lost through the DRP within
each office included in the congressional budget justification and
identify if the position is based in headquarters or the field. The
report shall include an analysis of the impact of these staffing re-
ductions on PHMSA’s ability to implement programs, grants, and
all statutory responsibilities.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $74,556,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 73,660,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
PHMSA oversees the safety of more than one million hazardous
materials shipments daily within the United States, using risk
management principles and security threat assessments in order to
fully review and reduce the risks inherent in hazardous materials
transportation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $73,660,000 for
hazardous materials safety, which is $896,000 less than the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. The Committee recommendation includes
$1,000,000 for the assistance for local emergency response training
[ALERT] grants. The Committee directs PHMSA to prioritize
ALERT grants for training in rural areas. The Committee rec-
ommendation also includes $4,000,000 for community safety
grants.

102
East Palestine, Ohio.—The NTSB’s investigation of the East Pal-
estine derailment resulted in five safety recommendations for
PHMSA, which the agency made initial responses to in October
2024. First, the NTSB found that the vulnerability of tank car plac-
ards to fire exposure resulted in illegible placards and hampered
emergency responders’ efforts to identify hazards. The Committee
directs PHMSA to work with the authorizing committees of juris-
diction in Congress to require placards to be able to survive fires
and accidents and remain legible during emergencies long enough
to fulfill their functions as described in the emergency response
guidebook.
The NTSB also found that the post-derailment fire likely began
because of hazardous materials released from a punctured DOT–
111 tank car. It has been over 10 years since the Lac-Megantic rail
accident in 2013, which destroyed an entire town near the Maine
border, and which led to Congress mandating the gradual phase
out of DOT–111s. However, the phase out will not be completed
until 2029, nearly 16 years after the Lac-Megantic rail accident.
The Committee directs PHMSA to work with the relevant author-
izing committees to accelerate the phase-out of DOT–111 tank cars.
Further, the NTSB’s East Palestine investigation found the need
to revise the definition of a ‘‘high-hazard flammable train.’’ While
this definition is set in statute, the DOT’s most recent Significant
Rulemaking Report includes an initiated rulemaking by PHMSA,
RIN 2137–AF65, related to applying regulatory requirements and
operational controls on a larger set of newly designated high-haz-
ard train makeups. PHMSA is directed to provide a status update
on RIN 2137–AF65 to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations within 180 days of enactment of this act. In addition, the
Committee directs PHMSA to work with the relevant authorizing
committees to revise the definition of high-hazard flammable train.
Finally, the NTSB recommended that PHMSA distribute the
FRA’s most current guidance on the vent and burn methods to
emergency response agencies, and the Committee directs PHMSA
to do so expeditiously.
PIPELINE SAFETY
(PIPELINE SAFETY FUND)
(OIL SPILL LIABILITY TRUST FUND)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $218,186,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 218,186,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Pipeline Safety [OPS] promotes the safe, reliable,
and sound transportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids
through the Nation’s more than 2.6 million miles of privately-
owned and operated pipeline.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $218,186,000 for the
OPS. The amount is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Of

103
this amount, $12,500,000 is for research and development and up
to $88,558,000 is for grants.
Liquefied Natural Gas [LNG] COE.—The Committee appreciates
PHMSA’s efforts to locate and begin staffing the national COE for
LNG Safety that was authorized, nearly 5 years ago, under section
111 of the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhanc-
ing Safety Act of 2020 [PIPES] Act. The Committee provides
PHMSA no less than $5,000,000 to continue its work to establish
the national COE for LNG Safety in accordance with the criteria
outlined in the PIPES Act.
Hydrogen Pipeline Leak Detection and Monitoring.—With the sig-
nificant Federal investment and policies to incentivize the develop-
ment of hydrogen pipelines, it is important for PHMSA to have ap-
propriate hydrogen gas pipeline-specific provisions in regulations to
ensure such pipelines operate safely and to protect the environ-
ment (as required under 49 U.S.C. 60102(b)). The Committee di-
rects PHMSA to consider initiating a rulemaking that would en-
sure that hydrogen infrastructure is designed or modified to oper-
ate safely and to protect the environment, with minimal leaks, and
by leveraging all possible learning from methane leak detection,
monitoring, and prevention Federal programs and efforts.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS GRANTS
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
(EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FUND)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $46,825,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 46,825,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of
1990 (Public Law 101–615) requires PHMSA to: (1) develop and im-
plement a reimbursable emergency preparedness grant program;
(2) monitor public sector emergency response training and plan-
ning, and provide technical assistance to States, political subdivi-
sions, and Indian Tribes; and (3) develop and periodically update
a mandatory training curriculum for emergency responders.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $46,825,000 for emergency pre-
paredness grants. The recommendation continues to provide
PHMSA the authority to use prior year carryover and recaptures
for the development of Web-based, off-the-shelf training materials
that can be used by emergency responders across the country. The
Committee encourages PHMSA to continue to enhance its training
curriculum for local emergency responders, including response ac-
tivities for crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids trans-
ported by rail. The Committee also encourages PHMSA to train
public sector emergency response personnel in communities on or
near rail lines, which transport a significant volume of high-risk
energy commodities or toxic inhalation hazards.
The Committee directs PHMSA to include recommendations for
the development of courses necessary for public sector employees to

104
be able to respond safely and efficiently to an accident or incident
involving the transportation of hazardous material and to provide
such training for virtual learning and any courses for which the
Secretary has recommended adaptation to provide virtual options,
subject to the condition that the Secretary ensures that the virtual
options recommended will provide an equivalent level of training as
in-person courses.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $116,452,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 116,452,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Inspector General Act of 1978 (Public Law 95–452) estab-
lished the Office of Inspector General as an independent, objective
organization with a mission to: conduct and supervise audits and
investigations relating to the programs and operations of the De-
partment; provide leadership and recommend policies designed to
promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administra-
tion of programs and operations; prevent and detect fraud, waste,
and abuse; and keep the Secretary and the Congress informed re-
garding problems and deficiencies.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation provides $116,452,000 for the
activities of the Office of Inspector General, which is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Independent Authorities.—The Office of Inspector General relies
on special agents, law enforcement personnel, auditors, and inves-
tigators to save money for the taxpayer and find waste, fraud, and
abuse. The Committee reminds the Office of Inspector General that
all Inspector Generals have complete authority over all staffing de-
cisions in their office, as provided under section 406 of title 5,
United States Code. Given the significant reduction of staff in the
Office of Inspector General, the Committee directs the Office of In-
spector General to increase hiring to the levels sustainable by the
funds made available in this act.
Audit Reports.—The Office of Inspector General is directed to
continue to provide copies of all audit reports to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations as soon as they are issued,
and to continue to make such Committees aware immediately of
any review that recommends cancellation of, or modifications to,
any major acquisition project or grant, or significant budgetary sav-
ings. The Office of Inspector General is also directed to withhold
from public distribution for a period of 15 days any final audit or
investigative report which was requested by the House or Senate
Committees on Appropriations.

TITLE II
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
HUD was established by the Housing and Urban Development
Act (Public Law 89–174), effective November 9, 1965. This Depart-
ment is the principal Federal agency responsible for programs con-
cerned with the Nation’s housing needs, fair housing opportunities,
and improving and developing communities.
Reorganizations and Staffing.—As part of the fiscal year 2025
operating plan, the Department did not provide organizational
charts that differed from the organizational charts transmitted to
the Committee on May 30, 2024, nor has the Department requested
any reorganizations for fiscal years 2025 or 2026. Thus, the Com-
mittee directs HUD to continue to use the organizational charts
transmitted to the Committee on May 30, 2024 as the baseline for
any reorganization requests pursuant to section 405 of this act. Ad-
ditionally, the Committee directs HUD to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of
enactment of this act on the number of positions that have been
reduced within each office named in such organizational charts, as
compared to the number of full-time personnel on board at the end
of calendar year 2024. The report shall include an analysis of the
impact of these staffing reductions on the agency’s ability to imple-
ment the HUD programs and all other statutory responsibilities.
Child Care.—The Committee recognizes that both housing and
child care present significant challenges for families, businesses,
and the economy. The Department is directed to work with afford-
able housing and child care stakeholders to support innovative ap-
proaches that coordinate housing and child care support to address
both needs and is encouraged to prioritize applications for Depart-
ment funding that show promise in those efforts, where appro-
priate.
Insurance Costs.—The Committee directs the Secretary of HUD
to complete a report on the current state of the property insurance
market with an emphasis on affordable housing properties that are
rent-restricted or rent-assisted. This should include, but not be lim-
ited to, properties developed through the use of the low-income
housing tax credit and other applicable State-level affordable hous-
ing tax credits, public housing that is not self-insured, or properties
participating in any Federal housing assistance program. The Sec-
retary should provide an analysis on the potential impact that in-
creasing insurance premiums may have on: (1) the supply of new
affordable housing, and (2) the financial sustainment of existing af-
fordable housing. The Secretary should also assess the implications
of rising insurance costs on program operations, such as housing
(106)

107
authorities’ levels of reserves, and conduct outreach to property
owners to solicit qualitative feedback on how rising insurance costs
affect their ability to effectively meet the goal of providing afford-
able housing. The Secretary should also, to the extent possible, pro-
vide an analysis and prediction on the potential effects of increased
insurance premiums on Federal section 8 housing choice voucher
and project-based rental assistance housing, including properties
that have undergone or are undergoing conversion through the
rental assistance demonstration [RAD]. In carrying out this effort,
the Secretary should coordinate with state insurance commis-
sioners and other Federal agencies, as needed, to complete the re-
port within 2 years of the date of enactment of this act, and update
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status
of the report every 6 months.
Environmental Review.—The Committee directs the Department
to work across its program offices, the White House Council on En-
vironmental Quality, the Advisory Council on Historic Preserva-
tion, and other stakeholders to improve processes for environ-
mental reviews with the goal of lowering the cost of reviews,
streamlining review procedures, reducing duplication, and accel-
erating new housing construction. As part of this effort, the Depart-
ment is encouraged to consider options for streamlining environ-
mental reviews for office-to-residential conversions, including the
feasibility of a categorical exclusion within defined parameters, tar-
geted technical assistance, and new toolkits, and is directed to brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on these ef-
forts within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Rent Reporting.—As many as 64 million Americans have limited
or no credit history, which impacts their ability to purchase a first
home, what apartments they can rent, and where they work. Mul-
tiple studies have demonstrated that rent reporting can lead to in-
creases in credit scores and scorability. The Committee encourages
the Department to support and promote training and technical as-
sistance opportunities and resources, either through HUD or pro-
vided by other Federal, State, and non-profit partners, for public
housing authorities, Tribally designated housing entities, and pri-
vate owners of affordable housing on how to move forward with
rent reporting. The Committee encourages the Department, to the
greatest extent possible, to partner with one or more organizations
specialized in rent reporting and make educational or training ma-
terials publicly available on the HUD website.
Buy America.—The Committee appreciates the Department’s ac-
tions to implement Build America, Buy America [BABA] require-
ments to ensure Federal housing funds are supporting American
industry and jobs. The Committee directs the Department to en-
sure BABA waiver requests can be appropriately evaluated and
processed in a timely and transparent manner, to brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its plans to do so
within 90 days of enactment of this act, and to report on processing
times for BABA waiver requests within 180 days of enactment of
this act.
GAO Priority Recommendations.—As of May 2025, HUD had 100
open GAO recommendations, of which 9 are considered priority rec-
ommendations in areas including, but not limited to, disaster recov-

108
ery, homelessness, cybersecurity, and information technology. The
Committee notes that HUD has substantially improved its imple-
mentation rate of GAO recommendations since 2021, and the Com-
mittee urges the Department to build on this progress. The Com-
mittee directs HUD to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this act on all
priority recommendations, the steps taken in fiscal year 2025 to
implement those recommendations, and what additional actions
will be undertaken in fiscal year 2026 to address outstanding rec-
ommendations.
Rural Areas.—The Committee urges the Department to enhance
its efforts to provide decent, affordable housing and to promote eco-
nomic development for Americans living in rural areas. When de-
signing programs and making funding decisions, the Secretary
shall take into consideration the unique conditions, challenges, and
scale of rural areas.
Appropriations Attorneys.—For fiscal year 2026, the Committee
continues to fund appropriations attorneys in the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer [OCFO], directs HUD to refer all appropria-
tions law issues to such attorneys within the OCFO, and urges the
Department to ensure the office has adequate personnel and non-
personnel resources to fulfill their responsibilities, including train-
ing HUD staff in funds control procedures and directives, as re-
quired by section 214 of this act.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee recognizes that the use of
artificial intelligence across the housing industry presents benefits
as well as risks. Within 270 days of enactment of this act, the Sec-
retary shall provide a report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations, the House Committee on Financial Services,
and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
on the extent to which the housing industry, HUD recipients and
partners, including landlords, public housing authorities, lenders,
and property management companies, are using artificial intel-
ligence technologies, such as dynamic price-setting and biometric
technologies, and an assessment of HUD’s current capacity and
subject matter expertise to monitor and incorporate emerging
trends in this field into management and oversight of its programs.
Working Capital Fund.—The Committee recommendation does
not include authority for a WCF in fiscal year 2026. The Com-
mittee notes that since the establishment of the WCF in fiscal year
2016, the Department has failed to fully utilize the authorities pro-
vided. The Committee is concerned that as an agency, the Depart-
ment may be too small to take full advantage of a WCF. Rather
than a nimble and responsive mechanism, the WCF has functioned
as a series of fixed price contracts, which do not incentivize cost-
conscious behavior. The Committee believes that winding down the
WCF now will enable the Department to take advantage of greater
efficiencies through participation in the General Services Adminis-
tration’s shared acquisition services and the economies of scale so-
lutions such government-wide participation offers.
EXECUTIVE OFFICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $19,400,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 17,500,000

109
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Executive Offices account provides the salaries and expenses
funding to support the Department’s senior leadership and other
key functions, including the immediate offices of the Secretary,
Deputy Secretary, Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations,
Public Affairs, Adjudicatory Services, the Center for Faith, and the
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $17,500,000 for
this account, which is $1,900,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level.
Violence Against Women Act.—For several years, the Committee
has directed HUD to address shortcomings in the Department’s im-
plementation and oversight of the housing protection requirements
for survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault in HUD-as-
sisted properties. The Department is directed to brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than December
31, 2025 on agency progress on: (1) ensuring program offices pro-
vide support to covered housing providers on emergency transfers,
including through written instructions, notices, and frequently
asked questions, (2) collecting data on the use and timeliness of
emergency transfers established by the Violence Against Women
Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–4), (3) implementing
the 2022 reauthorization (division W of Public Law 117–103), and
(4) closing all open recommendations in the GAO–24–106481 report
that was conducted at the direction of this Committee, including
target timeframes for major milestones and how the Department
intends to resource that action plan. The Committee recommends
an appropriation of not less than $500,000 for the Office of Gender-
Based Violence Prevention within the Office of the Deputy Sec-
retary to carry out the statutorily-mandated duties under 34 U.S.C.
12493.
Office of Disaster Management.—In fiscal year 2022, Congress
approved HUD’s request to create an Office of Disaster Manage-
ment within the Office of the Deputy Secretary to improve coordi-
nation of disaster-related activities across HUD and to better sup-
port communities and households impacted by major disasters. The
Committee recommends not less than $1,200,000 for its operations
in fiscal year 2026.
Affordable Housing Program Alignment.—As noted in the front
matter of this report, the Committee remains committed to reduc-
ing duplicative inspections and other conflicts and fragmentation
between Federal programs that are commonly layered together to
build affordable housing. Making continued progress on these ef-
forts requires consistent attention, strategic prioritization and lead-
ership. The Committee directs HUD to brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this
act on the Department’s top priority alignment actions for fiscal
years 2026 and 2027, target milestones, and how the Department
intends to track progress and facilitate resolution of any inter-
agency disputes that may arise.

110
Whistleblower Protections.—The Office of Inspector General iden-
tified in the ‘‘Management Alert: HUD Should Take Additional
Steps to Protect Contractor Employees Who Disclose Wrongdoing
[2023–IG–0002]’’ a troubling gap in HUD contracts when it found
that several aggrieved employees of contractors who receive funds
from HUD lacked whistleblower protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712.
These critical protections have not been added to project-based
rental assistance housing assistance payment contracts and con-
tracts in other programs that have yet to undergo a major modi-
fication following the codification of whistleblower protections in 41
U.S.C. 4712 in 2013. Section 237 of the bill addresses this gap and
applies these whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections to all
contracts, subcontracts, grants, subgrant, and personal service con-
tracts.
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT OFFICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $686,400,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 590,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Administrative Support Offices account funds the salaries
and expenses of the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer,
the Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity, the
Office of Field Policy and Management, the Office of the Chief
Human Capital Officer, the Office of Administration, and the Office
of the Chief Information Officer.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $590,000,000 for
this account, which is $96,400,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Funds are made available as follows:
Committee

Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity ................................................................................. 3,000,000
Office of the Chief Information Officer ........................................................................................................... 52,000,000
Office of the Chief Financial Officer [OCFO].—The Committee
recommendation includes sufficient funding to support the work-
load associated with BABA compliance and providing timely re-
sponses to BABA waiver requests.
The Committee recommendation is supportive of the Depart-
ment’s goals to modernize the management of its over 60 grant pro-
grams and their related systems, as well as the payment integrity
of its rental assistance programs, which is a long-standing weak-
ness identified by both HUD’s Inspector General and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office. The Committee is concerned that there
may be insufficient time to fully map out and institutionalize an
action plan to accomplish these objectives during this Administra-

111
tion. Therefore, the Committee urges the Chief Financial Officer to
swiftly work towards both the development of an action plan as
well as demonstrate feasibility and utility with a successful ‘‘proof
of concept’’, as planned in fiscal year 2025. Not more than
$10,000,000 within the amounts available for the OCFO should be
used for the program payments integrity project, and the Com-
mittee directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act
on the planned use of these funds in fiscal year 2026, the project
management structure, and the timeline for full implementation of
the project.
Weaver Building.—In the 2024 interim report to Congress, the
Public Building Reform Board reported that ‘‘taxpayers overspend
to house agencies, while Federal employees often work in sub-
standard office conditions that negatively impact mission outcomes,
employee recruitment and retention, and sustainability goals.’’ The
Committee has supported the Department’s efforts to improve of-
fice conditions for its employees, consolidate its footprint and reas-
sess its space requirements and assets, while stressing the impor-
tance of transparency on any decision as significant and costly as
the moving from HUD’s headquarters building, as well as the need
for stakeholder input to minimize disruption on the operation of
HUD and any other agencies impacted by this decision. The Com-
mittee notes that HUD has recently announced its intention to
move out of its headquarters building, and that a budget and
timeline for such a move is still being developed. As such, the De-
partment has not requested any funding in fiscal year 2026 to fa-
cilitate a transition out of the current headquarters space, and the
Committee recommendation does not include any funding for that
purpose at this time. The Committee directs the Department to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
30 days of enactment of this act on: (1) the program of require-
ments developed for the HUD headquarters, (2) the total budget for
the move, build-out, and maintenance of the new headquarters
space, with agency responsibilities and sources of funding delin-
eated between HUD and the General Services Administration, (3)
the detailed timeline for the proposed move, and (4) any analysis
of alternative buildings considered this year.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $903,200,000 for this account, which
is $193,964,130 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Funds
are made available as follows:
Amount
Office of Public and Indian Housing............................................................................................................... $250,000,000
Office of Community Planning and Development ........................................................................................... 142,000,000
Office of Housing ............................................................................................................................................. 395,000,000
Office of Policy Development and Research.................................................................................................... 34,000,000
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity................................................................................................ 72,000,000
Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes ........................................................................................ 10,200,000
Maintaining Mission Critical Activities.—With the significant re-
duction in staffing levels in fiscal year 2025, the Committee is con-
cerned about the potential for workforce, knowledge, and skills
gaps across HUD that would need to be addressed to ensure the
Department can carry out its most critical functions. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to carry out all statutorily required
activities and to expeditiously address any knowledge and staffing
gaps the Department may encounter. The Committee directs the
Department, when undertaking any additional staffing increases,
to prioritize staffing needs related to the health and safety of HUD-
assisted residents and the timely approval and disbursement of
funds to grantees. The Committee directs HUD to inform the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on how it is im-
plementing this direction as part of the semiannual staffing reports
required under section 407 of this act.
Grant Execution.—In order to bring greater transparency to the
grant execution process, the Committee directs the Department to
provide the status of: (1) all awarded but not obligated competitive
and disaster-related grants; and (2) all community project funding/
congressionally directed spending projects. The Department shall
continue to provide data on community project funding/congres-
sional directed spending projects in the manner it is currently pro-
vided, and for all other programs, provide a list of all such awards
by program, fiscal year, and grantee, and include the name of the
project, the state of the project location, the original amount of the
award, and the amount obligated to date. The Department shall
provide the data to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 120 days after the enactment of this act
and biannually after the first submission of such data.
Real Estate Assessment Center [REAC].—One of the Depart-
ment’s most fundamental responsibilities is ensuring that its as-
sisted properties are decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. The
Committee is concerned that Department may not have the nec-
essary inspection capacity, quality controls, organizational manage-
ment structures, or policies and procedures that are needed to en-
sure the entire HUD portfolio receives high-quality inspections on
time and that all deficiencies are identified and resolved in a time-
ly manner. The Committee directs HUD to: (1) ensure adequate
staff are allocated to REAC to support the implementation of the
National standards for the physical inspection of real estate
[NSPIRE] and oversee the property inspection needs of the entire
HUD portfolio, (2) support strategic coordination within HUD and

113
across other Federal agencies and external stakeholders to reduce
duplicative physical inspections, as directed in Senate Report 118–
70, and (3) brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions within 30 days of enactment of this act and quarterly there-
after on: (a) current property inspection capacity, (b) how REAC in-
tends to put property inspections back on schedule, including re-
lated timelines, (c) current mechanisms in place to support quality
assurance and how issues of significant discrepancies between in-
spection entities are addressed (e.g., multiple reports of properties
receiving excellent scores from HUD-funded inspections that were
subsequently condemned by local officials or had contracts termi-
nated by HUD), and (d) how the Department will close all open rec-
ommendations in the HUD Office of Inspector General reports
2024–CH–0001 and 2023–CH–0004, and ensure priority rec-
ommendations in report 2023–CH–0004 remain closed. The Com-
mittee also directs HUD to provide a report to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of
this act that includes: (1) an assessment of whether current man-
agement, communication, and decision-making protocols adequately
reflect that most housing units inspected by REAC are part of the
multifamily housing, not public housing, portfolio, and whether
HUD’s mission would be better served by REAC being outside of
the Office of Public and Indian Housing organizational structure,
including reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary, and (2) an as-
sessment of REAC’s top challenges and whether increasing internal
staffing capacity would more cost effectively address those chal-
lenges.
Lead Safe Housing and Other Health Hazards.—The Committee
recognizes there is no cure for lead poisoning, and childhood lead
poisoning can lead to lifelong medical expenses, increased criminal
activity, and lost productivity over the long-term. Multiple offices,
including the Office of Public and Indian Housing (particularly the
Real Estate Assessment Center and Office of Field Operations), Of-
fice of Housing, and Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy
Homes (particularly the Program and Regulatory Support Division)
all play critical roles in preventing childhood lead poisoning and
addressing housing-related health hazards. The Committee believes
that these offices include positions necessary for public safety, and
strongly encourages the Department to sufficiently staff these pub-
lic safety functions. The Committee directs the HUD to report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 60
days of enactment of this act detailing how the Office of Public and
Indian Housing, Office of Housing, and Office of Lead Hazard Con-
trol and Healthy Homes are working together to address all rec-
ommendations in the HUD Office of Inspector General reports
2021–OE–0011b and 2025–OE–0801 regarding the improvements
needed to monitoring elevated blood lead levels in HUD-assisted
housing, the steps taken to date to address the recommendations,
what additional actions will be undertaken in fiscal year 2026 to
address outstanding recommendations, and an assessment of
HUD’s current capacity and key staffing needs to carry out that
work.
Office of Housing.—The Committee directs the Office of Housing
to provide a briefing to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-

114
propriations within 15 days of enactment of this act on the status
of all funds provided under section 30002 of Public Law 117–169,
any challenges that exist in processing disbursements, and if
amounts provided in this act will be needed to address those chal-
lenges and support funding execution.
Section 240 of the bill enables the Department to provide direct
support to small properties and owners converting assistance under
RAD who lack the capacity needed to meet due diligence and un-
derwriting requirements, including properties assisted under the
section 202 and section 8 moderate rehabilitation and McKinney-
Vento single room occupancy programs. The Committee directs the
Department to use not more than $2,000,000 for this purpose
through existing cooperative agreements with participating admin-
istrative entities until further data is available on the scope of de-
mand among such properties.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $383,050,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 365,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The information technology fund finances the IT systems that
support departmental programs and operations, including FHA
mortgage insurance, housing assistance and grant programs, as
well as core financial and general operations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $365,000,000 for the IT Fund for
fiscal year 2026, which is $18,050,000 less than the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Consistent with the budget request, the Committee
recommendation does not include any funding for development,
modernization and enhancement [DME], but directs the Depart-
ment to continue to provide necessary information requested by the
Committee to maintain oversight of all ongoing DME efforts and
balances.
IT Fund Reporting and Oversight.—The Committee directs HUD
to continue to include sufficient detail in its congressional justifica-
tions to delineate between funding for operations and maintenance
[O&M] and DME, which as defined by OMB includes planning, and
include plain language summaries of proposed DME projects, total
costs and savings potential, target functionality, estimated
timeline, and mission benefits associated with the requested
amount. The Committee also directs HUD to continue to delineate
funding for O&M and DME by project in its fiscal year 2026 oper-
ating plan.
Quarterly Briefings.—The Committee continues to direct HUD to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on IT
modernization efforts on a quarterly basis. For fiscal year 2026,
such briefings shall address, for each development, modernization,
and enhancement project to be funded from available balances, in-
cluding carryover: (1) results of the prior quarter, including actual
expenditures and major milestones achieved; (2) any variances in
cost, schedule (including procurement), or functionality from the
previously provided project plan, reasons for such variances and es-

115
timated impact on total lifecycle costs; and (3) risks and mitigation
strategies associated with ongoing work.
Active Partners Performance System [APPS].—APPS supports the
Department in its responsibility to review the previous participa-
tion of property owners in order to make decisions about future
participation. The Office of Inspector General Report 2023–KC–
0002 found that HUD lacked an automated process for flagging a
property once it received a second consecutive REAC score below
60. The Committee appreciates that the Office of Multifamily Hous-
ing has automated such flags within APPS, but remains concerned
that all related entities may not be identified within the system.
The Committee encourages the Department to address this tech-
nical capability gap expeditiously, and directs the Department to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment of this act on whether such changes require
a system enhancement and the extent to which such needs can be
addressed through business process changes and data manage-
ment.
PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING
TENANT–BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $36,041,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 37,354,709,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for the section 8 tenant-based
[voucher] program, one of the principal appropriations for Federal
housing assistance, serving approximately 2.3 million families.
Under this program, eligible low-income individuals and families
pay 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent, and the Federal
Government is responsible for the remainder of the rent, up to the
fair market rent or some other payment standard. This account
also provides funding for tenant protection vouchers for the re-
placement of units lost from the assisted housing inventory, admin-
istrative fees for public housing authorities [PHAs], mainstream
vouchers, HUD–Veterans Affairs supportive housing [HUD–VASH],
and other incremental vouchers for vulnerable populations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $37,354,709,000 for fiscal year 2026,
including $4,000,000,000 as an advance appropriation to be made
available on October 1, 2026. This amount is $1,313,709,000 more
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Contract Renewals.—The Committee recommends
$33,974,000,000 for the renewal costs of section 8 vouchers. The
total cost of renewals, based on HUD-provided estimates, are par-
tially offset by programmatic reserves. The Committee rec-
ommendation prohibits HUD from taking an offset from any PHA
if doing so is expected to put that PHA into shortfall in 2026. For
amounts subject to single fund budget authority for PHAs partici-
pating in the moving to work demonstration, the Committee directs
the Department to execute the offset in a manner that is consistent
with the estimates transmitted to the Committee, which protects 4

116
months of voucher and public housing operating expenses. To en-
sure this authority is managed responsibly and does not negatively
impact construction efforts or PHA relationships with development
partners, the Committee directs HUD to also protect amounts com-
mitted to capital improvement, development, or other repositioning
activities that are scheduled to close within 1 year and to establish
an appeals process of not less than 60 days.
Emergency Housing Vouchers [EHVs].—The EHVs funded in sec-
tion 3202(b) of Public Law 117–2 provided housing support to fami-
lies and individuals who were homeless, at-risk of homelessness or
fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking
or human trafficking at the height of the COVID–19 pandemic. The
Committee does not want the individuals assisted by the program
to face eviction or return to homelessness, but must balance this
goal against the long-term sustainability of this account. The Com-
mittee does not provide any additional funds for the EHV program.
Instead, the Committee urges the Department and PHAs to take
all necessary actions to extend the use of the remaining balances
as long as possible, including through: (1) the expeditious use of
the waiver authorities provided in this act to maximize the number
of EHVs that can be transitioned into the regular voucher program
through normal turnover and attrition in that program before the
end of calendar year 2026, (2) the recapture and reallocation of un-
used EHV services fees and housing assistance payments, and (3)
providing timely responses and direct technical assistance to PHAs
to prevent and avoid displacement of EHV tenants. The Committee
directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on a quarterly basis on how HUD is carrying out
this direction, expenditure rates of EHV funding, and PHA
progress in transitioning EHVs residents to the regular voucher
program. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to
maintain the EHV dashboard on its website.
Mainstream Renewals.—The recommendation includes
$809,866,000 for section 811 mainstream vouchers within the total
amount provided for renewals and administrative fees. Additional
amounts set-aside for renewal adjustments shall also be provided
for costs associated with mainstream vouchers. Funding lines have
been consolidated in order to reduce the administrative burden on
HUD and PHAs. However, section 811 vouchers must continue to
serve non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover. The
Committee directs HUD to continue to provide timely updates on
the voucher dashboard on the number of mainstream vouchers allo-
cated and leased to ensure continued transparency.
Tenant Protection Vouchers [TPVs].—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $429,709,000 for new tenant protection
vouchers, $92,709,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This funding level is equal to HUD’s current estimates for all TPV
needs in fiscal year 2026 for planned repositioning projects and to
help HUD-assisted families relocate and avoid hardship.
Administrative Fees.—The Committee recommends
$2,906,000,000 for administrative fees, $135,065,000 more than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee notes that these
funds are critical to the execution and success of the voucher pro-
gram, supporting a diverse range of activities and critical functions

117
such as: property inspections; case management, including tenant
screening, income recertification, and emergency transfers; landlord
outreach; the issuance of new vouchers upon program turnover;
and assistance for tenants seeking housing. The Committee con-
tinues to direct the Department to brief the House and Senate
Committee on Appropriations not less than annually on the utiliza-
tion of administrative fees for eligible expenses to improve leasing,
such as security deposit assistance and landlord recruitment and
incentive payments.
HUD–VASH.—The Committee recommendation includes
$15,000,000 to expand the HUD–VASH program, of which up to
$10,000,000 may be used for other eligible expenses defined by no-
tice to facilitate leasing, such as security deposit assistance and
other costs related to retention and support of participating own-
ers. Over the past year, at the direction of this Committee, HUD
and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] have taken several
actions to improve the HUD–VASH voucher utilization. This in-
cludes publishing guidance to allow a PHA to be a designated serv-
ice provider; allowing third party providers to provide case manage-
ment services through contracts and other collaborative case man-
agement models, particularly in instances where the VA is insuffi-
ciently staffed; making multiple rounds of HUD–VASH and addi-
tional administrative fees available; and supporting HUD–VASH
boot camps across the country to bring PHAs and VA medical cen-
ter staff together to work through the challenges they face on the
ground. The Committee directs HUD, in coordination with the VA,
to consider conducting additional HUD–VASH boot camps, to con-
tinue to provide targeted technical assistance based on action plans
and learning from the HUD–VASH boot camps, and to provide a
status update to the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions, within 90 days of enactment of this act, regarding the extent
to which communities have deployed alternative methods to expand
HUD–VASH case management capacity.
Veteran Disability Income.—The Committee urges HUD to con-
tinue the policy of excluding VA disability compensation when de-
termining initial eligibility for the HUD–VASH program, as incor-
porated in the Federal Register Notice ‘‘Section 8 Housing Choice
Vouchers: Revised Implementation of the HUD–Veterans Affairs
Supportive Housing Program,’’ published on August 13, 2024. The
Committee directs HUD, in consultation with the VA, to provide to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations the following
information within 180 days of enactment of this act: (1) the num-
ber of veterans who receive rental assistance under any program
administered by HUD; (2) the number HUD-assisted veterans who
also receive VA disability compensation; (3) an estimate of the
number of veterans who would be newly eligible for HUD rental as-
sistance if HUD did not include VA disability compensation as in-
come when determining initial eligibility for rental assistance; (4)
an estimate of the number or proportion of veterans who receive
VA disability compensation who live in high-cost areas and likely
face severe housing cost burden; and (5) an estimated cost of ex-
cluding all VA disability compensation from its definition of income
while, at minimum, preserving all existing rental subsidies to the

118
veteran and non-veteran households currently served by HUD rent-
al assistance programs.
Tribal HUD–VASH.—The Committee includes $10,000,000 for
the renewal of rental assistance and associated administrative
costs for Tribal HUD–VASH within the Native American Programs
account to improve alignment with program execution.
Family Unification Program [FUP].—The Committee includes
$30,000,000 for new FUP vouchers. To ensure that vouchers are
available where youth need assistance, the Committee directs the
Department to base the maximum number of vouchers that a PHA
may request in a Federal fiscal year on identified need and refer-
rals. To improve the accessibility of youth FUP vouchers, the Com-
mittee directs HUD in its training materials to encourage PHAs to
affirmatively amend their administrative plans to facilitate re-
questing youth FUP vouchers.
The Committee reminds the Department of the requirement in
Senate Report 118–70 on the FUP voucher request and reallocation
processes.
The Committee directs HUD to consult with PHAs participating
in FUP, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], ex-
perts on child welfare, and other stakeholders regarding any poten-
tial program challenges due to statutory time limits, statutory cri-
teria, policy definitions, or other operational aspects. The Com-
mittee directs HUD to report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations and respective authorizing committees within
180 days of enactment of this act on such consultation, and provide
its recommendations: (1) to improve program operations; (2) to as-
sist youth in navigating the housing search process and preventing
returns to homelessness after the subsidized rental assistance sun-
sets; and (3) on how Federal, State, and local stakeholders can best
support participants as they transition from foster care to success-
ful adulthood.
Special Purpose Vouchers.—The Committee understands that
populations served by section 811 mainstream, FUP, and foster
youth initiative vouchers face certain challenges to finding units
available for lease within the normal timeframes of the larger
voucher program. These difficulties increase the risk of these vul-
nerable groups experiencing homelessness and cause these vouch-
ers to be unused. Therefore, the bill continues to permit HUD to
waive or specify alternative requirements for certain waiting list
and timing requirements.
Project-Based Vouchers.—The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s efforts to improve its data on the number and percentage
of vouchers that are, or planned to be, project-based at each PHA
through the planned improvements to the housing information por-
tal [HIP], and directs the Department to expeditiously launch this
functionality. To support the implementation of the final rule re-
lated to project-based voucher changes made in HOTMA, the Com-
mittee directs HUD to provide training and direct technical assist-
ance, as appropriate, to clarify the categories of units excluded
from the 20 percent limitation and 10 percent exception. The Com-
mittee directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations and relevant authorizing committees
within 120 days of enactment of this act on: (1) the analysis of im-

119
pact required under 24 CFR 983.6(a) when a PHA project-bases 50
percent or more of its authorized voucher units; (2) what informa-
tion will be expected regarding local market constraints, needs, and
the PHA’s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to provide tenant-
based assistance to project-base assisted families that wish to
move; and (3) the potential benefits and policy considerations of
modifying existing waivers and amending limitation exceptions to
support rebuilding in disaster-impacted areas, particularly areas
with high rates of homelessness and low vacancy rates.
Homeownership.—The housing choice voucher homeownership
program allows assisted families to use their vouchers to buy a
home. However, PHA staff who administer rental programs may
not have the expertise to facilitate homeownership. The Committee
encourages the Department to support training and education op-
portunities for PHA staff on the mortgage and loan process and
best practices in the housing choice voucher homeownership pro-
gram. To the greatest extent possible, educational or training mate-
rial produced shall be publicly available on the HUD exchange
website.
Housing Choice Voucher Data Dashboard.—The Committee is ap-
preciative of the Department’s work to increase program trans-
parency though the development of the voucher data dashboard
tool. To better inform the identification of program challenges and
where additional policy and research considerations may be bene-
ficial, the Committee directs HUD to add PHA and special purpose
voucher-level data points on voucher success rates and to identify
the amount of reserves that HUD determines are appropriate for
prudent program management. The Committee underscores that
neither additional data point should be inherently viewed as a defi-
ciency of PHAs’ operations. Rather, such data can be instructive for
identifying broader issues such as a lack of available housing stock
at current fair market rents or a lack of landlord participation
where more targeted outreach may be beneficial.
HOUSING CERTIFICATE FUND
(INCLUDING RESCISSIONS)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Until fiscal year 2005, the housing certificate fund provided fund-
ing for both the project-based and tenant-based components of the
section 8 program. Project-based rental assistance and tenant-
based rental assistance are now separately funded accounts. The
housing certificate fund retains balances from previous years’ ap-
propriations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee has included language that will allow unobli-
gated balances from specific accounts to be used to renew or amend
project-based rental assistance contracts.
PUBLIC HOUSING FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $8,810,784,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,397,326,000

120
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for the payment of operating sub-
sidies, as well as modernization and capital expenses for approxi-
mately 3,000 PHAs (except tribally designated housing entities)
that manage approximately 900,000 public housing units.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $8,397,326,000
for the public housing fund, which is $413,458,000 less than the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level.
Operating Expenses.—The Committee recommendation includes
$4,873,326,000 for allocations to PHAs through the operating fund
formula and $214,000,000 to mitigate the risk of financial short-
falls among PHAs. Combined, these recommended funding levels
provide sufficient resources for every PHA to maintain current
service levels and have 4 months of operating reserves based on
current estimates.
Capital Expenses.—The Committee recommendation includes
$3,200,000,000 for allocations to PHAs through the capital fund
formula, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Receiverships and Troubled, Substandard or Otherwise At-Risk
PHAs.—The Committee recommendation includes $15,000,000 for
the cost of administrative and judicial receiverships and competi-
tive grants for PHAs in receivership, designated troubled or sub-
standard, or otherwise at risk to address capital needs.
The Committee directs the Department to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of
the enactment of this act, and on an annual basis thereafter no
later than March 1, on the status of PHAs under receivership, and
the factors that informed the receivership, such as physical and fi-
nancial scores, deficiencies with internal controls, and other infor-
mation demonstrating why HUD believes PHAs are unable to effec-
tively oversee their business operations. This report shall also in-
clude an identification of funding resources and technical assist-
ance provided to each PHA for the purpose of transitioning out of
receivership, and future steps HUD will take to address defi-
ciencies in an effort to return the respective PHAs to local control.
The Committee also directs the Department to promptly brief the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations if there are any
changes to the list of administrative and judicial receiverships.
Emergency and Safety and Security Grants.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $30,000,000 for emergency capital needs, of
which at least $10,000,000 is to be used for safety and security
measures in public housing in order to protect tenants. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to fund eligible safety and secu-
rity projects with a portion of these funds as quickly as possible.
Residential Health Hazards.—The Committee recommendation
includes $65,000,000 to help PHAs address lead-based paint and
other residential health hazards, including mold, carbon monoxide,
radon and fire, in public housing units. The Committee continues
to include prohibitions on the Department’s ability to preclude
funds from being awarded to any PHA that is under the direction
of a monitor or any PHA as ineligible to apply for or receive fund-

121
ing that has a violation or violations of the lead-safe housing or
lead disclosure rules, or from being used to carry out work to settle
an outstanding violation.
Flexibility for Operating Funds for Capital Needs.—The Com-
mittee is committed to addressing the physical needs of troubled
public housing properties and provides a new flexibility to allow
PHAs with one or more properties with low physical inspection
scores to use available operating funds and excess reserves for cap-
ital expenses.
Utility Allowance Schedule.—The Committee urges HUD to up-
date its regulations in 24 CFR 982.517 and 24 CFR 983.301(f), and
related policies and notices, to allow public housing authorities dis-
cretion to utilize project-by-project utility allowances based on more
accurate state or federally verified utility allowance calculators.
The Committee believes that by allowing more efficient and ex-
panded private financing of new and rehabilitated units, this
change will allow Federal affordable housing programs to operate
more cost effectively and lead to the production of additional afford-
able housing units.
Pet Retention.—The Committee is aware of incidences where the
conversion of public housing properties managed by PHAs through
the RAD program may impact pet ownership policies and undercut
resident support for RAD conversions. Existing research affirms
that the human-animal bond provides tangible health benefits.
Having a pet can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and
triglyceride levels, decrease feelings of loneliness, and increase op-
portunities for exercise and socialization. Residents of public hous-
ing are permitted to have one or more common household pets,
subject to reasonable restrictions, but when a project is converted
under RAD, those permissions under the public housing program
may not carryover. The Committee directs the Department to work
to align pet ownership policies for RAD conversion projects.
ASSISTED HOUSING INSPECTIONS AND ASSESSMENTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $50,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 50,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account supports financial, and health and safety inspec-
tions conducted by the REAC for over 2.4 million units of HUD-as-
sisted affordable housing. Prior to fiscal year 2024, funding for
such inspections were provided under the public housing fund and
multifamily housing accounts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $50,000,000 to support
ongoing physical and financial assessment activities performed by
REAC, including implementation of NSPIRE.
Health Hazards.—The implementation of the NSPIRE standards
and supporting systems has enabled a more comprehensive under-
standing of health hazards in HUD-assisted housing. The Secretary
shall provide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations within 120 days of enactment of this act on the cur-
rent state of data collection and analysis of health hazards in

122
HUD-assisted housing, including lead-based paint and service
pipes, as well as the presence, absence, and condition of automated
fire sprinkler systems.
Physical Property Inspection Coordination.—As discussed in the
front matter of this report, the Committee directs the Department
in coordination with other Federal partners to, within existing au-
thorities, take steps to minimize the need for duplicative inspec-
tions. The Committee reminds the Department that Senate Report
118–70 directed HUD to report to the House and Senate Commit-
tees on Appropriations on the extent to which the physical inspec-
tion alignment program [PIAP] is currently utilized, the number of
duplicative inspections and estimated costs that could eliminated if
the PIAP was maximized, and any identified limitations to pro-
viding this data. The Committee directs HUD to promote use of the
interagency housing alignment portal [IHAP], address data gaps in
IHAP, including the current exclusion of project-based vouchers,
and to ensure adequate staff are allocated to REAC to support stra-
tegic coordination efforts with other Federal agencies and external
stakeholders to reduce duplicative physical inspections.
CHOICE NEIGHBORHOODS INITIATIVE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $75,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The choice neighborhoods initiative provides competitive grants
to transform underserved distressed neighborhoods into sustain-
able, mixed-income neighborhoods with co-location of appropriate
services, schools, public assets, transportation options, and access
to jobs or job training. Choice neighborhoods grants fund the devel-
opment of comprehensive neighborhood transformation plans that
involve broad civic engagement from residents and the community
and the implementation of these plans through affordable housing
activities and supportive services for residents. Grantees include
PHAs, Tribes, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. For-
profit developers may also apply in partnership with another eligi-
ble grantee.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $40,000,000 for
the choice neighborhoods initiative. This amount is $35,000,000
less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee con-
tinues to direct the Secretary to give recipients of prior year plan-
ning grants priority consideration for implementation grant

SELF–SUFFICIENCY PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $195,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 211,400,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for self-sufficiency programs, in-
cluding the family self-sufficiency [FSS] and the resident opportu-

123
nities and self-sufficiency [ROSS] programs, and the jobs plus ini-
tiative [JPI]. FSS provides funding to PHAs for the salaries of FSS
coordinators to help section 8 and public housing residents achieve
self-sufficiency and economic independence. ROSS provides funding
to PHAs, public housing resident associations, Native American
Tribes, and nonprofit organizations to hire and maintain service co-
ordinators to connect residents of public housing and Indian hous-
ing with supportive services including employment and educational
opportunities. The JPI provides grants to PHAs, which are required
to partner with Department of Labor jobs centers, to assist public
housing residents with job placement and increasing earned in-
come.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$211,400,000 for self-sufficiency programs in fiscal year 2026,
which is $15,900,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
This includes $156,400,000 for the FSS program, $45,000,000 for
the ROSS program, and $10,000,000 for the JPI.
FSS Program.—The Committee strongly supports the FSS pro-
gram, which provides public housing and section 8 residents with
the tools to improve their economic stability and financial manage-
ment skills, and ultimately achieve self-sufficiency. Before award-
ing funding to new grantees, the Committee directs the Depart-
ment to first prioritize the renewal of all existing coordinators and
second prioritize funding additional coordinators for current grant-
ees whose program sizes qualify for additional coordinators.
JPI.—The bill includes a general provision that enables the JPI
financial and rent incentive expenses to be paid from housing as-
sistance source accounts to help reduce administrative burdens for
HUD and grantees. To ensure transparency, HUD is directed to
provide in its congressional justifications the actual total cost of the
JPI, including the financial and rent incentives provided to pro-
gram participants.
NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,344,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,354,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account funds the Indian housing block grant program
[IHBG], as authorized under title I of the Native American Hous-
ing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (Public Law
104–330), and the Indian community development block grant pro-
gram [ICDBG], authorized under title I of the Housing and Com-
munity Development Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–383). The IHBG
program provides a funding allocation on a formula basis to Indian
Tribes and their Tribally designated housing entities [TDHEs] to
help address the housing needs within their communities. The
ICDBG program provides Indian Tribes the opportunity to compete
for funding to address Tribal community development needs.

124
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommended funding level for Native American
programs is $1,354,000,000, which is $10,000,000 more than the
amount provided in fiscal year 2025. The table below provides
funding levels for activities within this account.

Total, Native American Programs................................................................................................... 1,354,000,000
IHBG Grants.—The IHBG program is a vital resource for Tribal
governments to address the dire housing conditions in Indian
Country, as the quality of and access to affordable housing remains
in a critical state for many Tribes across the country. To assist
Tribes with these daunting housing challenges, the Committee rec-
ommendation includes $1,111,000,000 in formula funding and
$100,000,000 in competitive funding in order to assist areas with
greater need.
In administering the competitive program, the Committee directs
HUD staff to review and score each application in its entirety. Ad-
ditionally, the fiscal year 2026 appropriation shall be administered
as a new stand-alone competition and may not be combined with
prior or future year appropriations, although any remaining bal-
ances from the fiscal year 2025 competition or prior competition
may be included in the fiscal year 2026 competition. Demonstrating
sufficient administrative capacity to administer these grants has
been, and remains, a critical consideration. Applicants should be
required to meet a threshold of capacity, but the competition
should not provide additional points for capacity above and beyond
what is needed to successfully administer these grants.
Tribal HUD–VASH.—The Committee recommendation includes
$10,000,000 for the renewal of rental assistance and associated ad-
ministrative costs for the Tribal HUD–VASH demonstration pro-
gram. The Committee continues to encourage HUD to use its exist-
ing reallocation authority where necessary to ensure this program
is utilized to the greatest extent possible.
Coordinated Environmental Reviews for Tribal Housing and Re-
lated Infrastructure.—Since fiscal year 2015, the Committee has di-
rected HUD to collaborate with its Federal agency partners to de-
velop a coordinated environmental review process to simplify and
streamline Tribal housing development and its related infrastruc-
ture needs. The Committee believes that eliminating unnecessary
Federal barriers to housing development is an essential component
to facilitate an effective use of Federal funding, while also bal-
ancing the need to ensure appropriate and necessary environ-
mental protections. The Committee supports HUD’s efforts to ad-
vance the Tribal Housing and Related Infrastructure Interagency

125
Task Force in order to identify opportunities for greater effi-
ciencies.
Technical Assistance.—Limited capacity hinders the ability of
many Tribes to effectively address their housing needs. The Com-
mittee recommendation includes $7,000,000 for technical assistance
needs in Indian Country to support the IHBG program, as well as
other HUD programs, in order to meet the needs of Native Amer-
ican families and Indian Country. The Committee expects HUD to
use the technical assistance funding provided to aid Tribes with ca-
pacity challenges, especially Tribes receiving small grant awards.
The funding should be used for training, contract expertise, and
other services necessary to improve data collection, increase
leveraging, and address other needs identified by Tribes. The Com-
mittee also expects that these technical assistance funds will be
provided to organizations with experience in providing technical as-
sistance that reflects the unique needs and culture of Native Amer-
icans.
Legislative Proposals.—The bill includes legislative proposals to:
(1) allow for mortgages to be guaranteed for up to 40 years in
length when seeking to modify a loan to avoid foreclosure to align
loss mitigation options with that of the FHA; and (2) to expand pro-
gram service areas to all Tribal members, regardless of where they
purchase a home; and (3) to correct implementation challenges
with the authority for Tribes to participate in the Continuum of
Care [CoC] program.

Appropriations, 2025....................................................................................................... $1,500,000 $1,800,000,000
Committee recommendation ........................................................................................... 1,400,000 1,200,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This program provides access to private financing for Indian fam-
ilies, Indian Tribes, and their TDHE’s that otherwise could not ac-
quire housing financing because of the unique status of Indian
trust land. HUD continues to be the largest single source of financ-
ing for housing in Tribal communities. This program makes it pos-
sible to promote sustainable reservation communities by providing
access to financing for higher income Native Americans to achieve
homeownership within their Native communities. As required by
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508), this
account includes the subsidy costs associated with the loan guaran-
tees authorized under this program.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,400,000 for
credit subsidy and administrative contract expenses to support a
loan level of $1,200,000,000. This appropriation is $100,000 less
than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Native Advantage.—The Committee directs the Department to
update the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations quar-

126
terly during fiscal year 2026 on its progress in both completing the
Native advantage system and resolving the Office of Inspector Gen-
eral’s open finding and recommendations.
Skilled Workers Loan Credit Subsidy.—The Committee notes
that there remains substantial carry over from fiscal year 2017 for
skilled workers credit loan subsidy which can generate meaningful
investments across Indian Country. The Committee strongly urges
the Department to significantly expand stakeholder outreach re-
garding the availability of these resources which will help develop
housing for the critical workforces that supports the education,
healthcare, law enforcement, emergency response, and construction
needs of Tribal communities.
NATIVE HAWAIIAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $22,300,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 22,300,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000 (Public
Law 106–568) created the Native Hawaiian housing block grant
program to provide grants to the State of Hawaii Department of
Hawaiian Home Lands [DHHL] for housing and housing-related
assistance, in order to develop, maintain, and operate affordable
housing for eligible low-income Native Hawaiian families. As one
of the United States’ indigenous people, Native Hawaiian people
have a unique relationship with the Federal Government.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $22,300,000 for
the Native Hawaiian housing block grant program, which is equal
to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee is encouraged to learn that DHHL intends to ad-
dress the needs of low-income Native Hawaiians through the devel-
opment of multifamily, affordable housing rental units, rent to own
options on Hawaiian homelands, and permanent supportive hous-
ing for Native Hawaiians experiencing homelessness. The expan-
sion of programmatic services beyond those that afford homeowner-
ship options will help to serve all Native Hawaiians on the waiting
list.

loans
Appropriation, 2025 ..................................................................................................................................... $28,000,000
Committee recommendation ........................................................................................................................ 28,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Native Hawaiian housing loan guarantee fund (section 184A
program) offers Native Hawaiian homeownership, property reha-
bilitation, and new construction opportunities on Hawaiian home
lands. The section 184A program expands the market for lenders
and ensures access to private-market mortgages for a traditionally

127
underserved population. Private financing is used to cover con-
struction or acquisitions costs, while Federal funding is used only
to guarantee payment in the event of a default. Eligible borrowers
include Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on the
Hawaiian home lands, DHHL, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and
organizations experienced in the planning and development of af-
fordable housing for Native Hawaiians.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation provides $28,000,000 in loan
guarantee commitment authority, including the authority to refi-
nance loans.
COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $505,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 529,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The housing opportunities for persons with AIDS [HOPWA] pro-
gram provides grants to States, localities, and nonprofits to devise
and deploy long-term, comprehensive strategies for meeting the
housing and supportive service needs of persons living with HIV/
AIDS and their families.
By statute, 90 percent of appropriated funds are distributed to
qualifying States and metropolitan areas on the basis of the num-
ber of living HIV and living AIDS cases, as well as poverty and
local housing cost factors. The remaining 10 percent of funds are
awarded through a national competition, with priority given to the
renewal of funding for expiring agreements consistent with appro-
priations act requirements.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $529,000,000 for the HOPWA pro-
gram, which is $24,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
Meeting the Current Needs of Communities.—It is critical that
people in every State have access to funding that supports low-in-
come persons living with HIV/AIDS. Accordingly, 10 percent of
nonformula funding provides an opportunity to States and units of
general local government that do not receive formula funding to
apply for competitive grants. The Committee continues to include
language requiring HUD to prioritize the renewal or replacement
of expiring agreements in a manner that preserves existing
HOPWA programs and allows active competitive grantees to mod-
ify and update their original activities to meet the current needs
of persons living with HIV/AIDS within their communities. The
Committee directs HUD to ensure competitive grantees are aware
of the opportunity to modify and update service models and any po-
tential benefits to doing so.
Formula Eligibility.—The Committee directs the Department to
continue to conduct outreach to all grantees with potential formula
changes in 2026, pursuant to the HOTMA, and to provide direct

128
technical assistance as needed. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions and the relevant authorizing committees with a quarterly sta-
tus update on its efforts to ensure adequate transition plans are in
place to minimize disruptions to housing assistance due to the pro-
jected 2026 formula changes.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,430,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,541,397,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1974 (Public Law 93–383), as amended, the Department is author-
ized to award block grants to units of general local government and
States for the funding of local community development programs.
A wide range of physical, economic, and social development activi-
ties are eligible, with spending priorities determined at the local
level. The law enumerates general objectives which the block
grants are designed to fulfill, including adequate housing, a suit-
able living environment, and expanded economic opportunities,
principally for persons of low- and moderate-income. Grant recipi-
ents are required to use at least 70 percent of their block grant
funds for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons.
Funds are distributed to eligible recipients for community devel-
opment purposes utilizing the higher of two objective formulas, one
of which gives somewhat greater weight to the age of housing
stock. Of the funds appropriated, 70 percent are distributed to enti-
tlement communities and 30 percent are distributed to non-entitle-
ment communities after deducting designated amounts for insular
areas.
Funding under this heading also accommodates investments au-
thorized under the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Pro-
motes Opioid Recovery and Treatment [SUPPORT] for Patients
and Communities Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–271), in order to
provide safe transitional housing for individuals recovering from
substance use disorders.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee provides $4,541,397,000 for the community devel-
opment fund, which is $1,111,397,000 above the fiscal year 2025
enacted level. Within this total, $3,100,000,000 is for CDBG,
$30,000,000 is for activities authorized under section 8071 of the
SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, $60,000,000 is for
grants to reduce barriers to affordable housing development, and
$1,351,397,000 is for economic development initiatives [EDIs].
The flexibility associated with CDBG funding enables State and
local governments to tailor solutions to effectively meet the unique
needs of their communities. As HUD works with communities to
determine eligible activities that meet the national objective of ben-
efiting low- and moderate-income persons, the Committee encour-
ages the Department to extend flexibility to rural communities
with less than 1,000 residents to use alternate sources of data
when American community survey data is considered by the CDBG

129
applicant to be unreliable. Additionally, to ensure accountability
and transparency, the Committee recommendation continues provi-
sions in this act that prohibit any community from selling its
CDBG award to another community, and that require any funding
provided to a for-profit entity for an economic development project
funded under this act to undergo appropriate underwriting.
Reducing Red Tape In Housing Production.—For decades, hous-
ing production across the country has not kept pace with popu-
lation and economic growth, resulting in a nation-wide housing
shortage. This is in part due to restrictive local zoning and land
use regulations as well as a lack of necessary housing-related infra-
structure. The Federal Government can support communities as
they remove barriers to the production and preservation of unsub-
sidized affordable housing in order to increase housing supply,
lower housing costs, and ensure families have an affordable place
to live, particularly in high-opportunity neighborhoods. The Com-
mittee includes $60,000,000 for the Pathways to Removing Obsta-
cles to Housing [PRO Housing] program to reward State, local, and
regional jurisdictions that have made significant progress in reduc-
ing red tape in housing production by enacting or implementing
less restrictive zoning, land use, or permitting laws and regulations
that the Secretary expects to preserve or produce new housing
units. Less restrictive laws and regulations shall include, but are
not limited to, increasing density, reducing minimum lot sizes, cre-
ating transit-oriented development zones, streamlining or short-
ening permitting processes and timelines, expanding by-right mul-
tifamily zoned areas, allowing accessory dwelling units [ADU] on
lots with single-family homes, eliminating or relaxing residential
property height limitations, eliminating or reducing off-street park-
ing requirements, and allowing the conversion of vacant retail and
office space into residential housing. Eligible grant activities shall
include new construction of housing, including mixed-income hous-
ing to the greatest extent possible, and addressing costs associated
with housing supply growth such as infrastructure for new housing
development. When making awards, the Committee encourages
HUD to ensure geographic diversity amongst grantees, including in
urban, suburban, and rural areas. Further, the Committee directs
HUD to continue to seek ways to permit a more streamlined appli-
cation process and to ensure grants are awarded in a timely man-
ner. Finally, the Committee emphasizes its expectation that grant
funds be used on outcome-focused activities that will unlock hous-
ing availability.
Accessory Dwelling Units.—As localities consider and pass new
laws and regulations to permit ADUs, more public data is needed
to examine how these changes impact the uptake and construction
of ADUs and what barriers remain in utilizing ADUs to increase
housing supply. The Committee directs the GAO to conduct a study
on localities with zoning laws permitting the construction of ADUs,
or casitas, in single-family residential areas. In its study, the GAO
should identify and describe zoning laws around the country that
permit the building of ADUs, analyze the effects of such laws on
housing availability, density, and property values, and identify bar-
riers to both financing ADU construction and the rental and man-
agement of ADUs. The GAO is directed to provide the results of

130
this study in a report to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations within 1 year of the enactment of this act.
Impact of New Housing on Municipal Finance.—When localities
are considering new housing construction, rehabilitation, and con-
version, concerns may arise that population growth will lead to an
expansion in municipal services and expenditures. However, popu-
lation growth can also lead to financial benefits for the munici-
pality from increased tax revenues from new housing, more eco-
nomic development, and higher average incomes from younger pop-
ulations with more earning potential. The Committee believes that
better data is needed to understand this financial impact. The
Committee directs the GAO to study and issue a report on the
long-term impacts of new housing construction, rehabilitation, and
conversions on municipal fiscal health and economic development.
The Committee directs the GAO to brief the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the proposed scope and timeline
of this report no later than 90 days after enactment of this act and
to submit the final report upon completion.
CDBG Formula Modernization.—The Committee notes that the
CDBG formula has not been updated since 1978 and appreciates
HUD’s updated report, entitled ‘‘An Evaluation of the CDBG For-
mula’s Targeting to Community Development Need,’’ in order to
analyze the current formula’s effectiveness in meeting the goals of
the CDBG program. This report offers considerations for updating
the current formula to better target community development needs,
and HUD is encouraged to work with the relevant congressional
committees on updating the formula and reauthorizing the pro-
gram.
CDBG Rulemaking.—The Committee commends HUD for pub-
lishing a proposed rulemaking for the CDBG program regulations,
working within the constraints of the existing statute. The Com-
mittee continues to direct HUD to work expeditiously towards a
final rule that will enhance grantees’ ability to use CDBG funds
while streamlining reporting requirements, and take steps in the
interim to use administrative authorities to reduce unnecessary
burdens.
Recovery Housing Program [RHP].—The Committee directs HUD
to provide a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations within 180 days of enactment of this act on the impact
of the RHP since it began receiving funding in 2020, lessons
learned from service delivery models, and recommendations for
modifications to the program’s formula that would modernize the
data utilized, reflect the widespread needs across the Nation, and
ensure appropriate allocations of funding.
EDIs.—The Committee recommends $1,351,397,000 for EDIs.
EDIs are CDS projects that support a variety of community devel-
opment and affordable housing needs and benefit low- and mod-
erate-income populations or meet an urgent need. The Committee
directs HUD to provide funding for the projects listed in the table
at the end of this report in the corresponding amounts and for the
corresponding recipient. The Committee continues to direct HUD to
provide semi-annual briefings to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on the implementation of EDIs and the Depart-
ment’s oversight of projects. The Committee continues to direct

131
HUD to prioritize timely outreach and responses to EDI grantees.
To support HUD in its efforts, the Committee recommendation in-
cludes increased funding for the Office of Community Planning and
Development above the budget request to help address the signifi-
cant workload associated with EDIs.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LOAN GUARANTEES PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Limitation on
guaranteed
loans
Appropriations, 2025.................................................................................................................................... $400,000,000
Committee recommendation ........................................................................................................................ 400,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1974 (Public Law 93–383), as amended, authorizes the Secretary to
issue Federal loan guarantees of private market loans used by
CDBG entitlement and non-entitlement communities, enabling
grantees to borrow up to five times their most recent CDBG alloca-
tion to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development,
housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation provides a loan level guarantee
of $400,000,000, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level. The Committee requires HUD to collect fees to offset credit
subsidy costs such that the program operates at a net zero credit
subsidy cost.
This program enables CDBG recipients to use their CDBG dol-
lars to leverage financing for economic development projects, com-
munity facilities, and housing rehabilitation programs.
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,250,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,250,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Title II of the National Affordable Housing Act (Public Law 101–
625), as amended, authorizes the HOME program. This program
provides assistance to States and local governments for the purpose
of expanding the supply and affordability of housing to low- and
very low-income people. Eligible activities include tenant-based
rental assistance, acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental
and ownership housing, and housing construction. To participate in
the HOME program, State and local governments must develop a
comprehensive housing affordability strategy. There is a 25 percent
matching requirement for participating jurisdictions, which can be
reduced or eliminated if they are experiencing fiscal distress.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $1,250,000,000 for the HOME pro-
gram, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

132
Affordable Housing Needs.—Communities across the country con-
tinue to face an affordable housing crisis as rents remain high na-
tionwide, low and moderate incomes have not kept pace with hous-
ing cost increases, and the production of affordable housing units
lags far behind the need. According to HUD’s most recent ‘‘Worst
Case Housing Needs: 2023 Report to Congress,’’ in 2021, only 57
affordable units were available for every 100 very low-income
renter households and only 36 units were available for every 100
extremely low-income renter households. The HOME program is an
essential tool to address the shortfall of affordable housing for rent
or homeownership and provides necessary public gap financing to
facilitate private sector investment in affordable housing, enabling
significant leverage capacity of public and private resources.
PRESERVATION AND REINVESTMENT INITIATIVE FOR COMMUNITY
ENHANCEMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $10,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 10,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The preservation and reinvestment initiative for community en-
hancement [PRICE] program provides competitive grants to pre-
serve and revitalize manufactured housing and eligible manufac-
tured housing communities. Grants support low- and moderate-in-
come homeowners with manufactured housing units and manufac-
tured housing communities with repairs, infrastructure improve-
ments, upgrades to increase resilience, services like eviction pre-
vention and housing counseling, and planning activities such as
those needed to transition to resident-managed and resident-owned
communities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $10,000,000 for
the PRICE program. This amount is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
SELF–HELP AND ASSISTED HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $60,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 70,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The self-help and assisted homeownership opportunity program
provides funding for a number programs, including the self-help
homeownership opportunity program [SHOP], which assists low-in-
come homebuyers who are willing to contribute ‘‘sweat equity’’ to-
ward the construction of their houses. These funds increase the
ability of nonprofit organizations to leverage funds from other
sources. This account also includes funding for the capacity build-
ing for community development and affordable housing program, as
well as assistance to rural communities, as authorized under sec-
tions 6301 through 6305 of Public Law 110–246. These programs
assist in the development of the capacity of nonprofit organizations

133
to carry out community development and affordable housing
projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $70,000,000 for the self-help and as-
sisted homeownership opportunity program, which is $10,000,000
more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $13,000,000 for SHOP, as authorized under
section 11 of the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of
1996 (Public Law 104–120); $49,000,000 for capacity building, as
authorized by section 4(a) of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993
(Public Law 104–120), of which not less than $5,000,000 is for rural
capacity building activities; and $8,000,000 to carry out the na-
tional capacity building activities in rural communities. The Com-
mittee notes that funding for technical assistance is being provided
in the research and technology account and directs that funds
available for the section 4 program be used solely for capacity
building activities.
Section 4 Capacity Building.—In administering the section 4 ca-
pacity building program, the Committee directs HUD to ensure
that funding is made available on a competitive basis to each of the
second, third, and fourth capacity building entities specified in sec-
tion 4(a) of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 9816
note). The Committee also directs HUD to brief the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of
this act on its plans to make this funding available to all eligible
grantees.
SHOP Per Unit Average Investment Cap.—SHOP funds can be
used to acquire land, purchase foreclosed or abandoned properties,
and improve the infrastructure of homes for first time, low-income
homeowners. The Committee recognizes these activities are some of
the most difficult activities for nonprofits to finance. The Com-
mittee notes that HUD increased the allowable average SHOP ex-
penditure for the combined cost of land acquisition and infrastruc-
ture improvements for the first time since 2004 in the fiscal year
2022 NOFO. The Committee directs HUD to use its existing au-
thorities to include an allowable average per SHOP unit cost in the
fiscal year 2026 NOFO that is greater than the historical cap of
$15,000 per SHOP unit.
Capacity Building to Address the Needs of Tribal Communities.—
American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native commu-
nities and populations face rising housing cost burdens and bar-
riers to homeownership, as well as disproportionate physical hous-
ing and capacity deficiencies. HUD is directed to ensure section 4
grantees collectively invest not less than $1,000,000 in targeted ca-
pacity building activities to benefit Native Hawaiian, American In-
dian, and Alaska Native communities and populations. This min-
imum investment is separate from the required investment for
rural capacity building activities of not less than $5,000,000.
Rural Capacity Building Program.—Funding for the rural capac-
ity building program for community development and affordable
housing is intended for truly national organizations. For the pur-
poses of the national rural capacity building NOFO, the Committee
directs HUD to define an eligible national organization as ‘‘a non-

134
profit entity, which has ongoing experience in rural housing, in-
cluding experience working with rural housing organizations, local
governments, and Indian Tribes, as evidenced by past and con-
tinuing work in one or more States in eight or more of HUD’s Fed-
eral regions.’’
Manufactured Housing.—More than 20 million people live in
manufactured housing across the country, and manufactured
homes represent approximately 10 percent of new single-family
home starts. The Committee encourages section 4 grantees to sup-
port manufactured housing communities, including resident-owned
cooperatives that are working to improve infrastructure, purchase
their communities, preserve housing affordability, and develop
more affordable homes.
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,051,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 4,530,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Homeless assistance grants assist localities in addressing the
housing and service needs of a wide variety of homeless popu-
lations while developing coordinated systems to help those who are
homeless attain housing and move toward self-sufficiency. These
grants provide funding for rental assistance, emergency shelter,
transitional and permanent housing, prevention, rapid re-housing,
and supportive services to homeless persons and families or those
at risk of homelessness. The emergency solutions grants [ESG] pro-
gram is a formula grant program, while the continuum of care
[CoC] and rural housing stability programs are competitive grants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,530,000,000
for homeless assistance grants in fiscal year 2026. This amount is
$479,000,000 above the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee recommendation rejects the budget request proposal to con-
solidate funding for the programs funded under this heading and
for housing opportunities for persons with AIDS into a modified
emergency solutions grant block grant, and instead includes
$4,023,000,000 to support the CoC program, including the renewal
of existing projects, and $290,000,000 for the ESG program.
Improving the Speed and Predictability of Funding.—In fiscal
year 2024, the Committee provided HUD the authority to utilize a
2-year NOFO for the CoC program. In doing so, the Committee rec-
ognized that an annual CoC competition is a significant adminis-
trative undertaking for both CoCs and HUD; one that strains lim-
ited resources and can lead to unnecessary delays in funding. Con-
sistent with that determination, the Committee recommendation
requires HUD to issue a 2-year NOFO for fiscal years 2026 and
2027, and establishes statutory deadlines for publishing the NOFO
and announcing fiscal year 2026 funding awards. This 2-year
NOFO will enable CoCs and HUD to redirect the thousands of
hours that would have been spent on the application process to di-
rect service delivery and working on program improvements.

135
Improving Access to Healthcare and Services.—Several studies
have demonstrated that interventions focused on social deter-
minants of health can help support housing permanency while also
reducing healthcare costs. Moreover, shelters and homeless assist-
ance programs across the country are seeing sharp increases in the
number of elderly individuals, many of whom have complex med-
ical conditions that necessitate coordination between housing and
healthcare services to help them become or remain stably housed.
The Committee continues to support coordination between HUD
and the HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, Adminis-
tration for Community Living and Assistant Secretary for Planning
and Evaluation to provide direct technical assistance to commu-
nities to improve coordination and cross-leveraging of programs,
such as Medicaid, to deliver more integrated and seamless services
to people experiencing homelessness. The Committee recommenda-
tion includes no less than $20,000,000 for technical assistance, of
which $5,000,000 is provided to support such direct, community-
specific technical assistance.
To ensure that service providers can offer competitive wages to
hire and retain qualified personnel, the Committee recommenda-
tion for the CoC program includes an estimate of $43,000,000 to
support reasonable cost of living adjustments for supportive service
line items, and directs the Secretary to provide such increases.
Permanent Supportive Housing.—The Committee recommenda-
tion includes $100,000,000 for grants to CoCs for the construction,
acquisition, or rehabilitation of new permanent supportive housing.
These funds are largely intended to be one-time grants, but up to
20 percent of a grant may be used for operational and supportive
costs which will be eligible for renewal within the context of the
overall CoC competition. The Committee encourages HUD and
CoCs to leverage these funds with other sources, such as tax cred-
its and project-based rental assistance, to maximize the amount of
housing that can be directed to meeting the needs of homeless indi-
viduals and families, especially those who are unsheltered or seek-
ing to exit emergency shelter.
Homelessness Among Older Adults.—For multiple years, this
Committee has noted its concern regarding the growing population
of seniors experiencing homelessness. With this national demo-
graphic shift, the homelessness response system needs to adapt to
an aging clientele with increased service needs. The Committee di-
rects HUD, in coordination with the United States Interagency
Council on Homelessness [USICH], to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 270 days
of enactment of this act that provides recommendation for addi-
tional flexibilities most needed by ESG and CoC grantees to better
serve seniors experiencing homelessness and whether legislative
changes are necessary to provide those flexibilities.
Addressing the Needs of Survivors of Domestic Violence.—The
Committee recommendation continues to provide no less than
$52,000,000 in CoC grants for rapid re-housing projects and sup-
portive service projects providing coordinated entry and other crit-
ical activities in order to assist survivors of domestic violence, dat-
ing violence, and stalking. As grants through the CoC program,

136
such projects are eligible for renewal and subject to the same terms
and conditions as other renewal applicants in the CoC program.
To further understand how to best meet the needs of survivors
of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking,
the Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this act that identifies: (1) how CoC and ESG re-
sources have been utilized to support this population over the last
three fiscal years, (2) recommendations for how CoCs can be inclu-
sive of, and effectively collaborate with, survivor housing and sup-
portive service providers, (3) measurable criteria that CoCs can use
to evaluate how well these programs serve survivors, and (4) rec-
ommendations, following consultation with victim service providers,
on how coordinated entry systems and initial intake procedures can
improve to ensure survivor safety and confidentiality, without in-
hibiting a client’s choice to secure housing and services. The Com-
mittee also encourages the Department to coordinate with the De-
partment of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women [OVW] on
opportunities to better coordinate CoC resources with OVW’s tran-
sitional housing grants to ensure that survivors of domestic vio-
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking have access to
safe and affordable housing and services.
Youth Homelessness.—The Committee recommendation includes
$107,000,000 to continue implementation of comprehensive ap-
proaches to serving homeless youth, of which up to $10,000,000
shall be used to provide technical assistance to grantees, and of
which up to $25,000,000 shall be for youth homelessness system
improvement [YHSI] grants. YHSI grants are intended to improve
youth homelessness systems on a local level and help implement
successful, evidence-based intervention methods for this population.
The Committee prohibits the use of YHSI funds for direct services
or housing. When determining YHSI funding allocations, the Com-
mittee expects the Department to adjust the funding level between
YHSI and additional projects serving youth based on the level of
interest in the next competition cycle for YHSI and the youth
homelessness demonstration program. The Committee directs HUD
to ensure that sufficient technical assistance resources and equal
consideration for YHSI grants are provided to rural areas. The
Committee further encourages HUD to coordinate with HHS on
project and system outcome measures for youth aged 25 and under,
including families headed by youth aged 25 or under, which should
include: (1) permanent connections; (2) education or employment;
and (3) stable housing.
Tribal Participation.—The Committee recommendation provides
additional flexibilities to Tribes and TDHEs to enable their in-
creased participation in homeless assistance programs, which was
made eligible by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public
Law 116–260), and directs HUD to continue to provide guidance or
trainings to support such participation.
Transitional Housing.—The Committee notes that successfully
meeting the needs of differing homeless subpopulations, improving
self-sufficiency, and reducing returns to homelessness requires
varying approaches. The Committee reminds HUD and service pro-
viders that well-designed transitional housing can be an effective

137
and successful housing strategy for homeless youth and individuals
in substance abuse treatment.
Homeless Management Information Systems [HMIS].—The Com-
mittee previously directed HUD to work with CoCs, people who
have experienced homelessness, vendors, and other stakeholders to
enable a standard report of all currently active individuals and key
program information that is available to CoCs to inform real-time
decisions, and to specify application programming interface re-
quirements and other specifications so CoCs can better share infor-
mation and ensure privacy and security for more effective real-time
program management. The Committee directs HUD to report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days
of enactment of this act on the result of this engagement, rec-
ommendations for future data standards and HUD system updates,
and how HUD intends to work with HMIS software vendors and
CoCs to address structural and financial barriers impeding CoCs’
ability to utilize their data to rehouse those experiencing homeless-
ness in their communities.
Point-in-Time Count.—The Committee reminds HUD that the
joint explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year 2023 ap-
propriations act directed the Department to report to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the viability of cre-
ating a digital point-in-time count data collection and analysis plat-
form for communities to use. As part of the report, HUD is directed
to also examine the opportunity for using such digital platform to
conduct multiple counts throughout the year (particularly for cold-
weather States) and better inform seasonable changes. Addition-
ally, the Committee directs HUD to continue to include data on the
population of homeless individuals and households who are elderly
and near elderly in its annual point-in-time estimates to improve
national understanding of the aging homeless population and the
implications for Federal policy. The Committee also directs HUD to
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
within 180 days of enactment of this act on the feasibility, merits
of, and recommendations, if warranted, on how to better distin-
guish and track the increased use of interim strategies, such as
safe parking and safe sleeping programs, to respond to unsheltered
homelessness in a service-based setting within the annual point-in-
time estimates.
Annual Homeless Assessment Report [AHAR].—The Committee
continues to direct HUD to incorporate additional Federal data on
homelessness, particularly as it relates to youth homelessness, into
the AHAR. This information is important to ensure that commu-
nities develop and implement policies that respond to local needs.
Disaster Preparedness and Coordination for Homeless Popu-
lations.—When disasters strike, the lowest-income survivors, in-
cluding people experiencing homelessness, are often the hardest hit
and are left with the longest, steepest paths to recovery. HUD’s
rapid unsheltered survivor housing [RUSH] aims to ‘‘help commu-
nities provide outreach, emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, and
other assistance to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness
who are in a disaster-affected area but who cannot access all serv-
ices provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA]
programs.’’ However, initial implementation of funds has been slow

138
and requires improvement. The Committee directs HUD, in coordi-
nation with FEMA, to brief the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations within 120 days of enactment of this act on the spe-
cific actions taken in fiscal year 2025 and planned for fiscal year
2026 to improve coordination and the deployment of assistance to
the homeless population when natural disasters strike, including
actions taken to address open recommendations from the GAO–23–
105379 report. This briefing shall include lessons learned from the
challenges recent disaster-impacted communities have faced in
quickly deploying RUSH funds, recommendations for how to im-
prove relationships between emergency management and homeless-
ness stakeholders, and ways to support better pre-disaster pre-
paredness.
HOUSING PROGRAMS
PROJECT–BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $16,890,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 17,804,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Section 8 project-based rental assistance provides a rental sub-
sidy to a private landlord that is tied to a specific housing unit, as
opposed to a voucher, which allows a recipient to seek a unit, sub-
ject primarily to certain rent caps. Amounts in this account include
funding for the renewal of and amendments to expiring section 8
project-based contracts, including section 8 moderate rehabilitation,
and single room occupancy housing. This account also provides
funds for contract administrators.
The section 8 project-based rental assistance [PBRA] program
supports approximately 17,700 contracts with private owners of
multifamily housing. Through this program, HUD and private sec-
tor partners support the preservation of safe, stable, and sanitary
housing for approximately 1.3 million low-income households.
Without PBRA, many affordable housing projects would convert to
market rates with large rent increases that current tenants would
be unable to afford.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of
$17,804,000,000 for annual PBRA contract renewals and related
activities, of which up to $509,000,000 is for the cost of contract ad-
ministrators. The recommended level of funding is $914,000,000
above the amount provided in fiscal year 2025.
Performance-Based Contract Administrators.—Performance-based
contract administrators [PBCAs] are PHAs, or their instrumental-
ities, and State housing finance agencies [HFAs], and are respon-
sible for conducting on-site management reviews of assisted prop-
erties; adjusting contract rents; and reviewing, processing, and pay-
ing monthly vouchers submitted by owners, among other tasks.
The Committee notes that PBCAs are integral to the Department’s
efforts to be more effective and efficient in the oversight and moni-
toring of this program in order to reduce improper payments, pro-
tect tenants, and ensure properties are well maintained. There are

139
current PBCAs that have demonstrated success in providing high
quality program services and have valuable experience in admin-
istering affordable housing resources in the States in which they
operate. The bill includes a general provision to help address the
challenges in a new competition and directs HUD to ensure that
any new arrangements result in improved and cost-effective over-
sight and monitoring of the PBRA program; quality services offered
to property owners and tenants in each State; and the maintenance
of safe, stable, and affordable housing for the approximately 1.3
million households living in PBRA properties across the country.
HUD is directed to continue to work with relevant stakeholders
and congressional committees on a permanent statutory framework
for PBCAs. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that tenants
can serve a valuable role in identifying potential problems with the
physical condition of a property. The Committee urges HUD to as-
sess the effectiveness of using resident surveys as a tool to help
PBCAs conduct effective oversight.
Managing Troubled Properties.—The Committee places a priority
on providing access to safe, sanitary, and affordable housing to
those most in need and holding HUD and owners accountable for
failing to upload those standards. The Committee remains con-
cerned for tenants enduring deplorable living conditions as a result
of delayed or inaccurate REAC inspections of troubled properties
and HUD’s inability to track property owners under litigation for
failure to maintain decent, safe, and sanitary housing. The Com-
mittee continues to include a general provision that (1) requires the
Secretary to take specific actions if an owner fails to maintain its
property, including imposing civil monetary penalties, securing a
different owner for the property, or transferring the section 8 con-
tract to another property and (2) requires HUD to report on prop-
erties with failing physical inspection scores of less than 60 or that
have received an unsatisfactory management and occupancy review
within the past 36 months to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations. For properties identified in this report, HUD shall
include the PBCA associated with its oversight. In addition, the
Committee continues to direct HUD to include in this report data
on project-based rental assistance program properties and units, in-
cluding the State in which the property is located, that have exited
the programs as a result of contract abatement from poor physical
conditions or for other reasons and to identify if the properties and
units are preserved through a transfer to other properties or are
lost.
Improving Properties with Health, Safety, or Operational Defi-
ciencies.—The Committee strongly supports preserving the PBRA
affordable housing stock. The Committee notes that HUD issued a
notice in February 2024 on the process for making the first round
of budget-based rent adjustments to PBRA contracts that have
been renewed through the mark-to-market [M2M] program fol-
lowing the statutory authority provided in fiscal year 2023. The
Committee directs HUD to provide a briefing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of enactment
of this act on the dollar amount and number of funding requests
received under this notice, as well as HUD’s property selection
process, and planned oversight of properties following the rent ad-

140
justments. Further, the Committee again reminds HUD of the di-
rective included in the fiscal year 2023 joint explanatory statement
to assess the needs amongst post-M2M properties and other PBRA
properties with health and safety deficiencies, and to provide the
results of this assessment to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations.
Survivors of Domestic Violence or Sexual Assault.—GAO issued a
report [GAO–24–106481] in July 2024 identifying opportunities for
HUD to improve its oversight of housing providers’ emergency
transfers for relocating victims of domestic violence or sexual as-
sault. Of the seven recommendations, three apply directly to PBRA
properties and involve HUD taking action to provide written in-
structions to PBRA property owners on implementing emergency
transfers, revising the management and occupancy review form,
and collecting data. HUD is directed to close these recommenda-
tions quickly to ensure compliance with the Violence Against
Women Act requirements, and to protect survivors in HUD-assisted
rental housing.
HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $931,400,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 972,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for housing for the elderly pursu-
ant to section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (Public Law 86–372).
Under this program, the Department provides capital grants to eli-
gible entities for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of
housing for seniors, as well as project-based rental assistance con-
tracts [PRACs] to support the operational costs of such units. Ten-
ants living in section 202 supportive housing units can access a va-
riety of community-based services in order to continue living inde-
pendently in their communities and effectively age in place.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $972,000,000 for
the section 202 program. This amount is $40,600,000 more than
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee’s recommenda-
tion includes: $842,000,000 for the costs associated with fully fund-
ing all annual PRAC renewals and amendments; $122,000,000 to
fund the renewal of existing for service coordinators and congregate
service grants; $4,000,000 to support preservation transactions of
housing for the elderly originally developed by a capital advance
and assisted by a project rental assistance contract; and $4,000,000
for contract services.
Service Coordinators.—The Committee recognizes that service co-
ordinators in the section 202 program serve an essential component
of housing-based care for seniors. To expedite the process of renew-
ing existing service coordinator grants, the bill includes authority
for HUD to renew these grants every 2 years, rather than annu-
ally.
In addition, the Committee directs HUD to review the distribu-
tion of section 202 service coordinators amongst States with the
oldest populations according Census Bureau data and the avail-

141
ability of eligible multifamily properties in those States that could
qualify for the service coordinator program. As part of this review,
HUD should assess if these areas are underserved by the service
coordinator program and if future program expansion funding
should be prioritized to these States. HUD is directed to provide
this review to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
within 1 year of enactment of this act.
HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $256,700,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 265,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This account provides funding for housing for persons with dis-
abilities pursuant to section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National
Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–625). Tradition-
ally, the section 811 program provided capital grants to eligible en-
tities for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of housing
for persons with disabilities, as well as PRACs to support the oper-
ational costs of such units. Since fiscal year 2012, HUD has
transitioned to providing project rental assistance to State housing
finance agencies or other appropriate entities, which act in partner-
ship with State health and human services agencies to provide sup-
portive services, as authorized by the Frank Melville Supportive
Housing Investment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–374).
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $265,000,000 for
the section 811 program. This amount is $8,300,000 more than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. This level of funding, in addition to
residual receipts, recaptures, and other unobligated balances, will
support all project-based renewals and amendments.
HOUSING COUNSELING ASSISTANCE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $57,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 57,500,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The housing counseling assistance program provides comprehen-
sive housing counseling services to eligible homeowners and ten-
ants through grants to non-profit intermediaries, State government
entities, and other local and national agencies. Eligible counseling
activities include: pre- and post-purchase education, personal finan-
cial management, reverse mortgage product education, foreclosure
prevention and mitigation, and rental counseling.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $57,500,000 for
housing counseling assistance, which is equal to the fiscal year
2025 enacted level. Of the amount provided, up to $4,500,000 is
available for administrative contract services. The Committee di-
rects HUD to use not less than $3,000,000 of the funds provided
for the housing counseling grant program specifically for housing

142
counseling agencies to partner with historically black colleges and
universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and other minority
serving institutions. In addition, up to $5,000,000 may be used for
a homeownership initiative that is targeted to historically under-
served communities. Outreach efforts may include culturally sen-
sitive and linguistically appropriate service delivery, materials, and
educational initiatives.
PAYMENT TO MANUFACTURED HOUSING FEES TRUST FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety
Standards Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–383), as amended by the
Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–
569), authorizes the Secretary to establish Federal standards for
the construction, design, safety, and performance of manufactured
homes. All manufactured homes are required to meet these Federal
standards, and fees are charged to producers to cover the costs of
administering the act.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $14,000,000 to support the manu-
factured housing standards programs, of which $14,000,000 is ex-
pected to be derived from fees collected and deposited into the man-
ufactured housing fees trust fund account. No direct appropriation
is provided. The total amount recommended is equal to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The FHA fund covers the mortgage and loan insurance activity
of HUD mortgage/loan insurance programs. These include the mu-
tual mortgage insurance [MMI] fund, cooperative management
housing insurance [CMHI] fund, general insurance [GI] fund, and
the special risk insurance [SRI] fund. For presentation and ac-
counting control purposes, these are divided into two sets of ac-
counts based on shared characteristics. The unsubsidized insurance

143
programs of the MMI fund and the CMHI fund constitute one set;
and the GI and SRI funds make up the other.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee has included the following amounts for the MMI
Program account: a limitation on guaranteed loans of
$400,000,000,000, a limitation on direct loans of $1,000,000, and
$160,000,000 for administrative contract expenses. This amount for
administrative contract expenses is $10,000,000 more than the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level. For the GI/SRI account, the Committee
recommends a limitation on guaranteed loans of $35,000,000,000
and a limitation on direct loans of $1,000,000.
Barriers to Innovation.—The Committee directs FHA to consult
with relevant stakeholders and conduct a review the regulatory
and sub-regulatory policies that may: (1) hinder the use of FHA
programs to support shared equity homeownership models, includ-
ing but not limited to restrictions on resale and conveyance, and
(2) limit the use of FHA multifamily programs for properties using
offsite construction and other nontraditional construction tech-
niques, and brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions on such review within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Institutional Investment in Single-Family Housing.—The Com-
mittee notes that in some local housing markets there are increas-
ing concentrations of institutional financial investment in single-
family housing, and that trend has the potential to affect local real
estate markets. The Committee directs HUD to continue to
prioritize the sale of HUD owned single-family homes to owner-oc-
cupants, HUD-approved nonprofits, and government entities to
mitigate any negative effects from institutional investors. The
Committee also urges the GAO to expeditiously complete the sec-
ond part of the report on institutional investment in single-family
housing as required in the joint explanatory statement accom-
panying Public Law 117–328.
Energy Audits.—The Committee notes that FHA’s single family
housing handbook 4000.1 requires the incorporation of energy au-
dits into home appraisals for special energy-related component that
affect the value of the property. The FHA is directed to brief the
House and Senate Committee on Appropriations within 180 days of
enactment of this act on the impact these energy audits can have
on home appraisal values.
Affordable Housing Finance.—The Committee is concerned about
the diminished supply of affordable housing across the country and
is supportive of efforts and initiatives that result in measurable in-
creases in that supply. The section 542(c) housing finance agency
risk-sharing initiative has been in place since 2021 and warrants
broader evaluation to understand the extent to which it has in-
creased housing supply. The Committee directs the GAO to review
this initiative and submit a report to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this act.
This review should include at a minimum: the number of loans
funded and geographic interest in this initiative; the underwriting
standards applicable through this initiative compared to other
similar FHA-insured loans outside of this initiative; the differences
between HUD’s multifamily accelerated processing guide [MAP

144
Guide] and the guidelines for a HFA-underwritten loan, including
an analysis of if MAP Guide results in higher costs and longer pro-
duction time when creating affordable housing when compared to
the requirements of an HFA-underwritten loan; if the lower bor-
rowing costs through this initiative results in lower rents to fami-
lies; the extent to which this initiative has resulted in the produc-
tion of more housing units rather than shifting production from one
sector to another; and the oversight requirements applicable under
this initiative compared to non-initiative financing.
FHA Mortgage Insurance for New Multifamily Construction.—
The United States is facing a severe housing shortage and needs
millions of new units to balance supply and demand. However, the
Federal Government currently provides very little assistance for
new multifamily construction. FHA’s 221(d)(4) program is the larg-
est Federal program that backstops loans for new multifamily
housing construction, but it endorsed fewer than 75 developments
in fiscal year 2024. The Committee directs GAO to study the effec-
tiveness of the 221(d)(4) program and recommend legislative and
regulatory programmatic improvements that would expand pro-
gram uptake.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Ginnie Mae, through the mortgage-backed securities pro-
gram, guarantees privately issued securities backed by pools of
Government-guaranteed mortgages. Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned
corporate instrumentality of the United States within the Depart-
ment. Its powers are prescribed generally by title III of the Na-
tional Housing Act (Public Law 73–479), as amended. Ginnie Mae
is authorized by section 306(g) of the National Housing Act to guar-
antee the timely payment of principal and interest on securities
that are based on and backed by a trust, or pool, composed of mort-
gages that are guaranteed and insured by FHA, the Rural Housing
Service, or the VA. Ginnie Mae’s guarantee of mortgage-backed se-
curities is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
This account also funds all salaries and benefits funding to support
Ginnie Mae.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a limitation on new commitments
on mortgage-backed securities of $550,000,000,000. This level is
equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The bill allows Ginnie
Mae to use $56,000,000 for salaries and expenses. This is
$2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Com-
mittee directs Ginnie Mae to submit quarterly data to the House

145
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on staffing levels, staff-
ing expenses, and other non-personnel expenses.
Nonbank Mortgage Companies.—Since 2008, the issuer landscape
of Ginnie Mae has shifted dramatically toward nonbank mortgage
companies, who now make up 73 percent of Ginnie Mae issuers and
service 85 percent of its portfolio. The Committee is concerned by
the risks this may pose and directs Ginnie Mae to provide a report,
within 180 days of enactment of this act, to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations detailing how it would react to
stress on nonbank mortgage companies, including liquidity stress,
protocols to identify viable servicers that could assume the portfolio
of a failed nonbank mortgage company, and actions Ginnie Mae
could take to prevent and minimize such risks. The Committee fur-
ther encourages Ginnie Mae to coordinate with the Federal Hous-
ing Finance Agency, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and
other relevant housing oversight bodies to develop this report.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $139,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 131,028,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Title V of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 (Pub-
lic Law 91–609), as amended, directs the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development to undertake programs
of research, evaluation, and reports relating to the Department’s
mission and programs. These functions are carried out internally
and through grants and contracts with industry, nonprofit research
organizations, educational institutions, and through agreements
with State and local governments and other Federal agencies. The
research programs seek ways to improve the efficiency, effective-
ness, and equity of HUD programs and to identify methods to
achieve cost reductions. Additionally, this appropriation is used to
support HUD evaluation and monitoring activities and to conduct
housing surveys.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $131,028,000 for
the research and technology account in fiscal year 2026. This level
is $7,972,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the Committee’s recommendations for fis-
cal year 2026:

Core Research and Technology.—The Committee recommenda-
tions includes not less than $72,900,000 for core research and tech-
nology. The Committee supports the use of these funds for coopera-
tive agreements and research partnerships with minority serving
institutions. The Committee recognizes the value that cooperative
agreements and research partnerships can provide to urban com-
munities and encourages the Department to award a cooperative
agreement to a minority serving institute located in an urban set-
ting to conduct research on matters related to economic oppor-
tunity, reducing homelessness, or other areas that improve the
long-term capacity of communities or otherwise address priorities
of the Department. Within the amounts for core research and tech-
nology, up to $4,900,000 is for building technology research.
Research, Evaluation, and Demonstration.—The Committee rec-
ommendation includes up to $3,128,000 research, evaluation, and
demonstration. Of this amount, up to $2,100,000 shall be for ongo-
ing research on moving to work [MTW] expansion, and the commu-
nity choice demonstration. The remaining $1,028,000 shall be for
HUD to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine [National Academies] as delineated under
the ‘‘Housing Data Infrastructure’’ heading in this report.
Housing Data Infrastructure.—Housing is a fundamental aspect
of people’s daily lives and well-being, but millions of Americans
face insecurity or displacement from their homes due to rapid rent
increases, evictions, foreclosures, increasing property taxes and in-
surance costs, and post-disaster upheavals. However, existing Fed-
eral housing data infrastructure lacks the timely local data needed
to adequately track housing market disruptions and effectively in-
form policies intended to address these problems. HUD is directed
to contract with the National Academies to convene an expert con-
sensus committee, including housing policy, economics, social
science, statistics, public policy, and survey methodology experts, to
consider the issues in a holistic fashion and provide solutions for
moving forward.
Such a consensus committee should review key uses and needs
for a modern housing data and statistics infrastructure designed to
track key aspects of the Nation’s housing conditions and inform de-
cision-making, such as: housing starts and completions, develop-
ment timelines, costs to build, hazard insurance costs, property
ownership, local changes to rent, evictions, foreclosures and
demolitions, homelessness, unique needs and data gaps relating to
Tribal areas and territories, and post-disaster impacts on housing
markets and households. Such a consensus committee should: (1)
review current sources of housing information; (2) identify short-
comings and strengths in these sources for key research and policy
uses; (3) hold open meetings to seek input from key stakeholders;
and (4) recommend strategies for modernizing the housing data in-
frastructure to inform Federal, State, and local policymaking in a
timely manner. The Committee directs the National Academies to
submit a report with its findings, conclusions, and recommenda-
tions no later than 2 years after the work has been contracted.
Disaster-Impacted Renters and Rental Markets.—The Committee
is concerned insufficient attention is being paid to renter household
needs and rental market forces following natural disasters. Recent

147
analysis shows that rents in disaster-impacted communities rise
and then remain higher than their original rates for years. These
impacts are amplified in already constrained rental markets, espe-
cially when communities are hit by successive disasters. Without
adequate and thoughtful intervention, these market impacts can
lead to secondary displacement of other vulnerable renter house-
holds who were not directly affected by the disaster. If funds are
available, HUD may, in coordination with and after consulting
FEMA, contract with NAPA, to study this issue. The study should
be overseen by a panel of experts, to examine in-depth how renters
and rental markets have recovered from recent major disasters,
with a special focus on disasters that involve long displacement
times for a large number of renter households. The study should
consider the roles of the insurance industry, FEMA, HUD, Small
Business Administration [SBA], and State and local governments
as they relate to: (1) addressing the temporary and long-term hous-
ing needs and the recovery of impacted renters; (2) how the dis-
aster and disaster response impacts other renters in the housing
market; and (3) the replacement of lost affordable rental housing
inventory. The expert panel should include the experience and ex-
pertise of former FEMA, HUD, and SBA leaders, expertise in re-
search and advocacy for displaced renters and impacted single-fam-
ily and multi-family rental property owners; insurance and reinsur-
ance industry; support services for those at risk of homelessness;
and State and local emergency management and long-term recov-
ery. From that review, NAPA should make recommendations on re-
forms to guide FEMA, HUD, and SBA that would, in coordination
with the insurance industry, facilitate affordable, faster, inclusive,
and resilient recovery for renters, and include guidance on improv-
ing how Federal, State and local governments monitor rental mar-
ket trends to inform disaster recovery policy decisions. NAPA
should communicate with the GAO and the National Academy of
Sciences over the course of its study and review previous studies
to prevent duplication of effort.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee recommendation includes
$40,000,000 for technical assistance, of which $5,000,000 is for the
distressed cities and persistent poverty technical assistance pro-
gram. The Committee directs HUD to assess how it can improve
technical assistance to State and local entities to access Federal
housing resources across the country and make recommendations
on best practices and the Federal support necessary to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of en-
actment of this act.
Institutional Investors.—The Committee remains interested in
the feasibility of HUD collecting data related to investor owned res-
idential rental housing units, and looks forward to receiving the as-
sessment required in Senate Report 118–70.
Fair Market Rents [FMRs].—The Committee continues to encour-
age HUD, to the extent permissible under current regulations, to
set FMRs at no lower than the previous year’s level for an FMR
area, unless the Department has sufficient local data to justify
such a change and encourages HUD to continue its progress toward
reforming the process of setting FMRs. Data limitations that result
in inadequate FMR levels for communities and families undercut

148
the mission of the voucher program, and these impacts are espe-
cially concerning in areas that lack the third-party data sources
HUD has identified to supplement its FMR data. In response to
these challenges and in addition to HUD’s on-going FMR improve-
ment efforts, the Committee directs the Department to consider
and assess the merits and potential operational concerns of permit-
ting state housing finance agencies to support calculations of FMR
levels. Additionally, this assessment should focus on the potential
of permitting this flexibility only where there is a lack of either
HUD or third-party data to make local FMR determinations. The
Committee directs HUD to report its finding to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of enactment of
this act. In addition, the Department shall report to the House and
Senate Committee on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment
of this act on strategies to improve data, to better forecast rents in
communities that are habitually miscalculated and decrease the
cost of private rental surveys.
Conversion of Office Buildings to Housing.—Office vacancies in
the United States are at an all-time high, while the country simul-
taneously searches for creative solutions to address its shortage of
millions of homes. Despite the interest in office-to-residential con-
versions, structural and legal limitations can make such conversion
to conventional apartments cost prohibitive. The Committee en-
courages the Department to support efforts to advance innovation
in the conversion of high-vacancy commercial buildings into resi-
dential use, including by investigating the availability and limita-
tions of existing waiver authorities to promote conversion and the
economic viability of co-living configurations, and identifying any
barriers to using Federal funds to support conversions. The Depart-
ment is directed to report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations within 270 days of enactment of this act on all Fed-
eral barriers to such conversions and potential changes to Federal
law that could further incentivize such conversions. In order to bet-
ter support communities in their adaptive reuse efforts, HUD is
also encouraged to help local jurisdictions with high housing costs
to develop a building inventory, in coordination with local planning
departments, to determine which commercial properties are most
suitable for residential conversion.
Master Leasing Models.—Master leasing models, where a home-
lessness services provider or a CoC leases a whole building or a
block of units from a property owner’s portfolio to provide housing
to persons experiencing homelessness, have been shown to remove
critical barriers to housing people. However, some existing HUD
regulations have made the model administratively burdensome to
operationalize. The Committee directs the Department to submit a
report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on
master leasing models across the country and provide an assess-
ment with recommendations on how the Department can adjust its
regulations to better accommodate this innovative model.
Off-Site Construction.—The Committee supports efforts to
incentivize the use of off-site construction through local adoption of
and improvements to off-site construction standards. Such con-
struction can help increase housing supply, affordability, and acces-
sibility. In addition, the Committee encourages HUD to conduct re-

149
search on the impact of regulatory inconsistencies in off-site con-
struction regulation across the United States.
Community Choice Demonstration Program.—The Committee an-
ticipates the completion of phase I and the published rapid cycle
evaluation report in 2025, and requests that HUD brief the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its findings related
to the outcomes of phase I of the demonstration.
Native and Tribal Housing Needs.—The Committee is aware of
the lack of data on the housing needs of Native Americans, which
are difficult to capture in aggregate housing surveys. In January
2017, HUD published an Assessment of American Indian, Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs, which has been the
most comprehensive analysis and source of information about hous-
ing needs in Indian Country and Native American communities.
The Committee directs the Department to update the Assessment
of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Housing Needs,
and to publish reports with these comprehensive updates by Janu-
ary 2029.
Share Equity Homeownership.—The Committee is aware of con-
cerns that certain HUD program certification barriers and resale
restriction requirements can impede non-profit shared equity
homeownership programs across the country. As such, HUD should
report on how its policy have supported or hindered nonprofit
shared equity homeownership, including the potential impact of
HUD and FHA policy changes in supporting nonprofit shared eq-
uity.
FAIR HOUSING AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
FAIR HOUSING ACTIVITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $86,355,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 86,355,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The fair housing activities appropriation includes funding for
both the fair housing assistance program [FHAP] and the fair
housing initiatives program [FHIP], among others.
FHAP assists State and local fair housing agencies with imple-
menting title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law 90–
284), as amended, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rent-
al, and financing of housing and in the provision of brokerage serv-
ices. The major objective of the program is to ensure prompt and
effective processing of title VIII complaints, with appropriate rem-
edies for complaints being provided by State and local fair housing
agencies.
FHIP is authorized by section 561 of the Housing and Commu-
nity Development Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–242), as amended,
and by section 905 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–550). This program provides support
to public and private organizations for the purpose of eliminating
or preventing discrimination in housing, and enhances fair housing
opportunities.

150
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $86,355,000 for the Office of Fair
Housing and Equal Opportunity, which is equal to the fiscal year
2025 enacted level. Of the amounts provided: (1) $26,355,000 is for
FHAP; (2) $56,000,000 is for FHIP, including not less than
$10,400,000 for education and outreach programs, not less than
$3,700,000 for fair housing organization initiatives, and up to
$40,500,000 for the private enforcement initiative; (3) $1,000,000 is
for the creation, promotion, and dissemination of translated mate-
rials that support the assistance of persons with limited English
proficiency; and (4) $3,000,000 is for the national fair housing
training academy.
Test Coordinator Training.—The Committee recognizes that test-
ing remains one of the most effective investigative tools and is fun-
damental to fair housing law enforcement. Those who coordinate
testing investigations need specialized training from skilled and ex-
perienced professionals in this field. HUD shall continue to imple-
ment a comprehensive test coordinator training program to provide
ongoing training, technical assistance, and resources to test coordi-
nators working in fair housing organizations throughout the coun-
try. HUD shall not merge existing test coordinator training with
other fair housing activities, including the national fair housing
training academy.
OFFICE OF LEAD HAZARD CONTROL AND HEALTHY HOMES
LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $295,600,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 295,600,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992
(Public Law 102–550) established the Residential Lead-Based Paint
Hazard Reduction Act, under which HUD is authorized to make
grants to States, localities, and Tribes in order to conduct lead-
based paint hazard remediation and abatement activities in pri-
vate, low-income housing. Lead is a significant environmental
health hazard, particularly for young children and pregnant
women, and exposure can result in neurological damage, learning
disabilities, and impaired growth. The healthy homes initiative,
which was authorized under sections 501 and 502 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1970 (Public Law 91–609), provides
grants to remediate hazards in housing that have been scientif-
ically shown to negatively impact occupant health and safety.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $295,600,000 for the lead hazard re-
duction account, which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level.
Unobligated Balances.—The Committee acknowledges the signifi-
cant progress HUD has made in recent years to reduce unobligated
balances for lead hazard reduction grants, and does not accept the

151
budget proposal to eliminate funding for the program in fiscal year
2026. The Committee continues to direct the Department to pro-
vide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with up-
dated reports on all unobligated balances for each program fol-
lowing each funding competition award announcement.
Lead Hazard Reduction Grants.—The Committee recommenda-
tion provides $155,600,000 for lead hazard reduction grants. With-
in this amount, $105,000,000 is set aside for jurisdictions with the
highest lead-based paint abatement needs, which is equal to the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The Committee directs the Department to continue to conduct
outreach and improve the NOFOs to encourage more grantees to
apply and make efficient use of lead hazard reduction grant funds.
The Committee directs the Department to include in such outreach
smaller and rural communities, and nonprofit organizations and
community development financial institutions [CDFIs] interested in
being co-applicants. The Committee directs the Department to brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 180
days of enactment of this act on such outreach, major participation
barriers identified, whether those barriers are administrative or
statutory in nature, and how CDFI lending capabilities can be le-
veraged to increase the pace at which low-income communities can
address lead paint hazards in high-risk communities. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to provide maximum flexibility within
statutory limits to extend grant periods of performance to allow
grantees more time to reach lead hazard reduction grant bench-
marks and to make more housing lead-safe.
Lead Interagency Coordination.—The Committee reminds HUD
of an outstanding requirement from Senate Report 118–70 to brief
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its data
sharing needs with the Environmental Protection Agency related to
lead service line inventories.
Lead Risk Assessment.—The Committee reminds Office of Lead
Hazard Control and Healthy Homes and Office of Public and In-
dian Housing of the outstanding requirement from Public Law
118–42 to jointly engage with PHAs and other stakeholders to un-
derstand why so few applications were submitted for the lead risk
assessment demonstration and brief the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations on the findings of this engagement.
Aging-in-Place.—The Committee recommendation includes
$30,000,000 within the healthy homes initiative for aging-in-place
home modification grants in order to enable low-income seniors
(persons who are 62 years of age or older) to remain in their homes
through low-cost, high-impact home modifications. The intended
beneficiaries of these grants are low-income seniors living in homes
that are not receiving project-based rental assistance, and HUD
shall ensure the use of funds appropriated will reflect that intent.
The Committee recommendation includes language to streamline
the environmental review process for these low-cost interventions
and directs HUD to take several other common-sense actions to im-
prove the impact of these grants. HUD is directed to adjust the
current $5,000 cap on the cost of home modifications per housing
unit to account for annual changes in the cost of labor, materials
and supplies. In designing the NOFO for this program, the Com-

152
mittee continues to encourage the use of successful models of low-
barrier, participant-led, holistic approaches to aging-in-place. How-
ever, the Committee is concerned that the Department’s required
use of occupational therapists in the program services model is not
practical nor necessary for all communities, and excludes other suc-
cessful models that have helped form the Committee’s appreciation
for the value of these investments, including the State of Maine’s
community aging-in-place grant program. Thus, the Committee di-
rects the Department to accept without additional justification al-
ternative program services models that do not require occupational
therapists for grants awarded with fiscal year 2026 funds or bal-
ances remaining from prior years. Applicants that propose an alter-
native model shall not be disadvantaged during the application and
selection process on that basis. The Committee continues to direct
HUD to track the outcomes of seniors whose homes have been
modified in order to better understand the effectiveness of this
funding in reducing at-home falls, hospitalizations, and emergency
response calls, as well as improving independence and tenure in
home over time. The Committee also encourages HUD to support
research and technical studies on housing technologies that enable
aging-in-place strategies within the amounts available for healthy
homes technical studies.
Weatherization Assistance Program.—The Committee reminds
the Department of its responsibility to continue collecting informa-
tion on how many units benefit from this coordinated execution of
HUD lead-based paint hazard control grants and the Department
of Energy weatherization assistance program, to quantify how this
coordination has reduced costs for hardware and labor, and to pro-
vide this information to the House and Senate Committees on Ap-
propriations after the end of each grant cycle. The Committee looks
forward to receiving the first such report in the near future and en-
courages the Department to highlight best practices in coordination
that can be integrated into grant management practices.
Streamlining Environmental Review Processes.—The Committee
has provided limited flexibilities related to environmental reviews
for the aging-in-place home modification grant program. To more
comprehensively examine the costs and benefits of current environ-
mental review processes for the programs funded in this account,
the Committee directs HUD to conduct an analysis and provide a
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
within 120 days of enactment of this act that examines the history
of grants awarded under this section in order to provide rec-
ommendations for statutory authority to ease some of the environ-
mental review requirements of these programs, including but not
limited to considerations of coastal zone management, endangered
species protection, farmland protection, flood plain management,
radon, noise control, off-site contamination, wetlands for existing
structures, and public comment and objection periods, to improve
project delivery and eliminate administrative burdens that are not
cost effective.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $152,924,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 146,000,000

153
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Inspector General conducts independent investiga-
tions, audits, and evaluations not only to prevent and detect fraud,
waste, and abuse, but also to promote efficiency and effectiveness
in the programs and operations of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. This appropriation will finance all salaries
and related expenses associated with the operation of the Office of
Inspector General.

The Committee recommends an appropriation of $146,000,000 for
the Office of Inspector General, which is $6,924,000 less than the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
Audit Reports.—The Committee expects the Office of Inspector
General to continue providing copies of all audit reports to the
Committee immediately after they are issued and to make the
Committee aware immediately of any review which recommends
significant budgetary savings.
Contracting Audits of Annual Financial Statements.—The Com-
mittee directs the Office of the Inspector General to continue to
procure and rely upon the services of an independent external
auditor, or auditors, to audit the financial statements of the De-
partment, including the financial statements of the FHA and
Ginnie Mae.
REAC Inspections.—The Committee directs the Office of Inspec-
tor General to conduct a review of all HUD-assisted properties with
REAC scores of 60–70 over the past year, including how many had
exigent health and safety deficiencies, how those properties com-
pare to those with failing scores, the adequacy of HUD oversight
and management of those inspections and properties, and the im-
pact of HUD staffing reductions and contract cancellations on the
oversight of these properties. The Committee directs the Office of
Inspector General to provide this report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of the enactment of
this act.

SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $9,955,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 9,955,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Access Board is responsible for developing design guidelines
for the build environment, transit vehicles, information commu-
nications technology, and medical diagnostic equipment under the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–336) and
other laws. The Access Board also enforces the Architectural Bar-
riers Act, ensuring accessibility to a wide range of federally funded
facilities, including national parks, post offices, social security of-
fices, and prisons. In addition, the Access Board provides training
and technical assistance on its guidelines and standards to Federal
agencies, public and private organizations, individuals, and busi-
nesses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $9,955,000 for the operations of the
Access Board. This level of funding is equal to the fiscal year 2025
enacted level.
FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $40,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 40,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Federal Maritime Commission [FMC] is an independent reg-
ulatory agency, which administers the Shipping Act of 1984 (Public
Law 98–237), as amended by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of
1998 (Public Law 105–258); section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920 (41 Stat. 998); the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988
(Public Law 100–418); Public Law 89–777; and the Ocean Shipping
Reform Act of 2022 (OSRA 2022, Public Law 117–146).
The FMC’s mission is to foster a fair, efficient, and reliable inter-
national ocean transportation system and to protect the public from
unfair and deceptive practices. To accomplish this mission, the
FMC regulates the international waterborne commerce of the
United States. In addition, the FMC has responsibility for licensing
(157)

158
and bonding ocean transportation intermediaries and for ensuring
that vessel owners or operators establish financial responsibility to
pay judgments for death or injury to passengers, or nonperform-
ance of a cruise, on voyages from United States ports.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $40,000,000 for the salaries and ex-
penses of the FMC for fiscal year 2026, which is equal to the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level.
NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $29,240,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 29,240,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Inspector General for Amtrak was created by the
Inspector General Act Amendment of 1988 (Public Law 100–504).
The act recognized Amtrak as a ‘‘designated Federal entity’’ and re-
quired the railroad to establish an independent and objective unit
to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the
programs and operations of Amtrak; recommend policies designed
to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Amtrak, and
prevent and detect fraud and abuse; and to provide a means for
keeping the Amtrak leadership and the Congress fully informed
about problems in Amtrak operations and the corporation’s
progress in taking corrective action.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommendation includes $29,240,000 for the
Amtrak Office of Inspector General. This funding level is equal to
the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee retains language
that requires the Amtrak Office of Inspector General to submit a
budget request in similar format and substance to those submitted
by other executive agencies in the Federal Government.
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $145,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 145,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Initially established along with the Department of Transpor-
tation, the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] com-
menced operations on April 1, 1967, as an independent Federal
agency. The Board is charged by Congress with investigating every
civil aviation accident in the United States, as well as significant
accidents in the other modes of transportation—railroad, highway,
marine, and pipeline—and issuing safety recommendations aimed
at preventing future accidents. Although it has always operated

159
independently, NTSB relied on the DOT for funding and adminis-
trative support until the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974
(Public Law 93–633) severed all ties between the two organizations
starting in 1975.
In addition to its investigatory duties, NTSB is responsible for
maintaining the Government’s database of civil aviation accidents
and also conducts special studies of transportation safety issues of
national significance. Furthermore, in accordance with the provi-
sions of international treaties, NTSB supplies investigators to serve
as U.S. accredited representatives for aviation accidents overseas
involving U.S. registered aircraft, or involving aircraft or major
components of U.S. manufacture. NTSB also serves as the ‘‘court
of appeals’’ for any airman, mechanic, or mariner whenever certifi-
cate action is taken by the FAA or the U.S. Coast Guard Com-
mandant, or when civil penalties are assessed by the FAA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $145,000,000 for the NTSB, which
is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee re-
mains concerned with private companies that have voluntarily
signed a party agreement with the NTSB, who have the privilege
of receiving investigative information (as defined in 59 CFR 831.13)
from the NTSB during the investigation, but have repeatedly vio-
lated the terms of such agreement. The Committee fully supports
the use of the party system in NTSB’s investigations, and directs
the NTSB to notify other entities party to an investigation if any
entity with party status violates the terms of the party agreement.
NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION
PAYMENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $158,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 158,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation was created by the
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act (Title VI of the Hous-
ing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, Public Law
95–557) and operates under the trade name ‘‘NeighborWorks Amer-
ica’’. NeighborWorks provides financial, technical, and training as-
sistance to community-based organizations that work in partner-
ship with community residents, the private sector, and local gov-
ernments to promote community revitalization and affordable hous-
ing opportunities. These partnership-based organizations are inde-
pendent, tax-exempt, non-profit entities, collectively known as the
‘‘NeighborWorks Network.’’ The NeighborWorks Network consists
of nearly 250 local and regional organizations that serve individ-
uals, families, and communities in every State, the District of Co-
lumbia, and Puerto Rico.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $158,000,000 for NeighborWorks,
which is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted level. The Committee
directs NeighborWorks to provide at least three days’ advance no-

160
tice to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior
to the announcement of any grant exceeding $50,000 that is award-
ed to a NeighborWorks Network organization. The Committee
notes that awarding formula grant funds in multiple installments,
as NeighborWorks has done in fiscal year 2025, adds inefficiency
and delays to what are intended to be flexible funds. As such, the
Committee directs NeighborWorks to notify network organizations
of their full formula grant award no later than the latter of 60 days
after enactment of this act or March 1, 2026 and to expeditiously
disburse those amounts.
Rural Areas.—The Committee commends NeighborWorks’ efforts
to build capacity in rural areas and urges NeighborWorks to con-
tinue those initiatives.
Multilingual Training Courses.—NeighborWorks is encouraged to
continue to develop and offer new professional development and
certification training courses and translated materials to meet the
needs of the Network and support its work on minority homeown-
ership.
Shared Equity Homeownership.—The Committee directs
NeighborWorks to work with affiliated organizations with extensive
experience in offering shared equity homeownership opportunities
as technical assistance providers and to continue to develop and en-
hance professional development offerings around shared equity
housing.
Policies and Procedures.—The Committee acknowledges that, as
of January 2025, all 10 of the recommendations from the GAO–23–
105944 report have been closed, which includes enhancing policies,
procedures, and internal controls related to procurement, whistle-
blowers, conflicts of interest, and audits, among others. The Com-
mittee stresses the importance of implementing these recommenda-
tions to ensure any future reports of wrongdoing are managed with
objectivity and independence, and appreciates that NeighborWorks
has committed the resources and staff needed to maintain these
policies and procedures.
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriation Cred c it o in ll g e c o ti f o f n se s t ting
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................. $47,452,000 $1,250,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................... 40,799,000 1,250,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Surface Transportation Board [STB] was created by the
Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (Public
Law 104–88). The Board is a five-member, bipartisan, decisionally
independent adjudicatory body responsible for the regulation of the
rail and pipeline industries and certain non-licensing regulations of
motor carriers and water carriers.
The STB’s rail oversight activities include rate reasonableness,
car service and interchange, mergers, line acquisitions, line con-
structions, and abandonments. The STB’s jurisdiction also includes

161
certain oversight of the intercity bus industry, non-energy and non-
water pipelines, intercity passenger rail, rate regulation of non-
contiguous domestic water transportation, and household goods
carriers.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a total appropriation of $40,799,000.
This funding level is $6,653,000 less than the fiscal year 2025 en-
acted level. Included in the recommendation is $1,250,000 in fees,
which will offset the appropriated funding, resulting in a final ap-
propriation from the general fund estimated at no more than
$39,549,000
Regulatory Proceedings.—There remains a number of pending
regulatory proceedings that would reform existing regulations at
the STB. The Committee continues to encourage the STB to facili-
tate a timely and decisive regulatory process. For example, EP 704
‘‘Review of Commodity, Boxcar, and TOFC/COFC Exemptions,’’ was
first issued as a proposed rulemaking in 2016. The Committee di-
rects the STB to provide an update in writing to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of the EP 704
proceeding within 120 days of the enactment of this act. Further,
the Committee notes a board member vacancy exists and urges the
administration to nominate the full complement of board members
to the STB as soon as possible.
Rail Rate Evaluation.—In 2015, the Transportation Research
Board of the National Academy of Sciences issued a report titled
‘‘Modernizing Freight Rail Regulation,’’ as authorized in section
9007 of Public Law 109–59. The report raised concerns with the
methodology used to identify unusually high rail rates. Since then,
the STB has taken steps to improve rate reasonableness. In 2020,
the Board commissioned a study, issued in March 2022, which ana-
lyzed and evaluated alternatives to its current economic model. In
December 2022, the Board issued two final rules establishing new
rate reasonableness procedures which provide two streamlined ap-
proaches for shippers and railroads to resolve smaller rate dis-
putes: final offer rate review and voluntary arbitration. However,
the STB was forced to remove the final offer rate review rule in
May 2025 following a decision by the Eighth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals vacating it. The Committee directs the STB to evaluate the
need to construct a new economic model of rail rates, the appro-
priate method for constructing such a model, and the authorization
and resources that would be required to construct the model. The
Committee directs the STB to provide this evaluation in writing to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 1 year
of enactment of this act.
Reorganization.—The Committee appreciates the STB submitting
a request to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
for approval of a reorganization plan. The proposal would reorga-
nize its staff offices by combining the Office of Proceedings and the
Office of the General Counsel into one legal office, as well as by
executing the Passenger Rail program as a Passenger Rail Flex
Team rather than as an office separate from other function-based
offices. Based on additional information provided by the STB, the
Committee understands that executing the Passenger Rail program

162
as a Passenger Rail Flex Team as proposed will still ensure the
STB can meet its passenger rail responsibilities and requirements
under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008
(division B of Public Law 110–432) and section 22309 of the IIJA.
Therefore, the Committee approves the reprogramming request as
submitted.
UNITED STATES INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS
OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,300,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 2,000,000
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness is an
independent agency created by the McKinney-Vento Homeless As-
sistance Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–77) to coordinate the Federal
response to homelessness. USICH was authorized to review Fed-
eral programs that assist homeless persons, to take necessary ac-
tions to reduce duplication, and to recommend improvements in
programs and activities conducted by Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments, as well as local volunteer organizations. USICH consists
of the heads of 19 Federal agencies, including the Departments of
Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services,
Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education,
Labor, and Transportation, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and other entities as deemed appropriate.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,000,000 for
USICH. This funding level is sufficient to sustain statutory staffing
levels as well as operational and reporting functions. The Com-
mittee directs USICH to brief the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act on how
it will staff the organization to carry out its statutory responsibil-
ities under 42 U.S.C. 11313.
Documentation Barriers for People Experiencing Homelessness.—
As noted in a 2024 GAO report [GAO–24–105435], documentation
requirements can often act as a barrier to assistance, especially
when homeless individuals are attempting to access assistance
across multiple agencies to exit homelessness, but strategies exist
to overcome those barriers. The Committee reminds USICH of the
requirement in Senate Report 118–70 to brief the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations on the actions taken in fiscal
years 2024 and 2025 to streamline eligibility and documentation
requirements that can often act as a barrier to assistance and any
actions planned for fiscal year 2026 to reduce barriers or promote
best practices.
Implementation of Best Practices.—To prevent USICH from mis-
using Federal funds through sharing inaccurate or misleading data
with Federal partners, community practitioners, and other stake-
holders, the Committee continues to direct USICH to ensure best
practices and evidence-based conclusions are central to any tech-
nical assistance and recommendations released by the agency.

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term congressionally
directed spending item means a provision or report language in-
cluded primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.
For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification
that neither the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has
a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending
item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website
of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (https://
www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-
requests). Following is a list of congressionally directed spending
items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this ex-
planatory statement, along with the name of each Senator who
submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item
so identified. Neither the Committee recommendation nor this re-
port contains any limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as
defined in rule XLIV.
