COMBATING CCP LABOR ABUSES ACT OF 2025
JULY28, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 580]
[Including cost estimte of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 580) to require the Secretary of
Commerce to provide training and guidance relating to human
rights abuses, including such abuses perpetrated against the
Uyghur population by the Government of the People’s Republic of
China, and for other purposes, having considered the same, reports
favorably thereon without amendment and recommends that the
bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 580 is to require the Secretary of Commerce
to provide training and guidance relating to human rights abuses,
including such abuses perpetrated against the Uyghur population
by the Government of the People’s Republic of China.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has repeatedly perpetrated
human rights abuses—including in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region—against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious mi-
nority groups. Since 2017, the CCP has imprisoned more than 1
million Muslims, predominantly Uyghur Muslims, in reeducation
camps and subjected millions more to intense surveillance, forced

labor, involuntary sterilization, and other human rights abuses.1
As a result, in 2021, the Secretary of State determined that the
People’s Republic of China, ‘‘under direction and control’’ of the
CCP, had ‘‘committed genocide against predominantly Muslim
Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups.’’2
The U.S. Department of Commerce provides many services for
U.S. businesses, including export counseling and identifying risks
of forced labor in supply chains. The Bureau of Industry and Secu-
rity, within the U.S. Department of Commerce, has taken singular
action and joint action with interagency partners in response to the
repression of the Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority
groups in Xinjiang. On July 13, 2021, the U.S. Department of Com-
merce, and five other agencies issued an updated Xinjiang Supply
Chain Business Advisory to highlight the heightened risks for busi-
nesses with supply chain and investment links to Xinjiang.3 On
September 26, 2023, the agencies issued an addendum to call at-
tention to the CCP’s ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity
in Xinjiang.4 S. 580 would build on existing human rights training
for Department of Commerce staff by ensuring its workforce is in-
formed about emerging trends and issues involving human rights
abuses in Xinjiang.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 580 would require:
• The Secretary of Commerce to provide training for Department
of Commerce employees pertaining to human rights issues per-
petrated by the Government of the People’s Republic of China,
including the use of forced labor against Uyghurs and other
ethnic minority populations in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region.
• The required training to be offered and updated at such times
as the Secretary considers appropriate.
• The Secretary of Commerce to offer guidance on human rights
issues to U.S. businesses engaged in interstate commerce or
foreign direct investment, including businesses considering
transactions with entities that may be subject to jurisdictions
where significant human rights abuses have occurred, such as
the People’s Republic of China.
• The guidance to include information about emerging trends
and issues involving human rights abuses and the potential

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 580, Combating CCP Labor Abuses Act of 2025, was intro-
duced on February 13, 2025, by Senator Peters (for himself and
Senators Lummis and Curtis) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On April
30, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by
voice vote, ordered S. 580 reported favorably without amendment.
118th Congress
S. 484, the Combating Human Rights Abuses Act of 2023, was
introduced on February 16, 2023, by Senator Peters (for himself
and Senator Lummis) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On July 27,
2023, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice
vote, ordered S. 484 reported favorably without amendment. On
December 19, 2023, S. 484 passed the Senate with an amendment
by unanimous consent.
117th Congress
S. 4101, the Combating Human Rights Abuses Act of 2022, was
introduced on April 27, 2022, by Senator Peters (for himself and
Senator Lummis) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On May 25, 2022, the
Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, or-
dered S. 4101 reported favorably without amendment.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

S. 580 would require the Department of Commerce to periodi-
cally train employees who provide counseling services to businesses
engaged in interstate commerce or foreign direct investment on
global human rights abuses perpetrated against the Uyghurs and
other ethnic minorities by the government of the People’s Republic
of China. The bill also would direct the agency to provide guidance
to such businesses, including ways to avoid doing business with
countries implicated in human rights abuses.
CBO expects that the department would conduct training and
update guidance once every three years starting in 2026. Using in-
formation from the department, CBO estimates that implementing
S. 580 would cost $2 million over the 2025–2030 period for tem-
porary staff, contracts for online courses, and printed guides. Any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Margot Berman. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.

Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 580 would cover some individuals employed by the Depart-
ment of Commerce who would receive training pertaining to human
rights issues perpetrated by the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China. It would also cover businesses engaged in interstate

ering transactions with entities that may be subject to jurisdictions
where significant human rights abuses have occurred, that volun-
tarily choose to use the guidance offered by the Secretary of Com-
merce on human rights issues.
Economic Impact
S. 580 is not expected to have an adverse impact on the Nation’s
economy.
Privacy
S. 580 would have no impact on the personal privacy of individ-
uals.
Paperwork
S. 580 would not increase paperwork requirements for private in-
dividuals or businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING

Section 3:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 4:
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Combating CCP Labor Abuses Act of 2025’’.

Section 5:
Section 2. Training for employees of the Department of Commerce
relating to awareness of human rights abuses.
This section would require the Secretary of Commerce to provide
training to Department of Commerce employees who counsel U.S.
businesses engaged in interstate commerce or foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI). This section would also require that the training be de-
signed to raise awareness about emerging trends and issues with
respect to human rights abuses perpetrated by the Government of
the People’s Republic of China against Uyghurs, and that it be in-
corporated into existing training provided by the Department to the
greatest extent possible.

Section 6:
Section 3. Guidance for United States businesses relating to aware-
ness of human rights abuses.
This section would require the Secretary of Commerce to offer

FDI, including businesses that are, or are considering, conducting
transactions with entities subject to the control or influence of ju-
risdictions where significant human rights abuses have occurred,
such as the People’s Republic of China.
This section would also require the Secretary to incorporate this
guidance into any counseling services provided by the Department
to U.S. businesses. It would require the guidance to provide infor-
mation about emerging trends and issues involving human rights
abuses perpetrated by the Government of the People’s Republic of
China consisting of the use of forced labor against Uyghurs and
ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Lastly, this section would clarify that such guidance is for advisory
purposes only.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.

transactions with entities subject to the control or influence of ju-
risdictions where significant human rights abuses have occurred,
such as the People’s Republic of China.
This section would also require the Secretary to incorporate this
guidance into any counseling services provided by the Department
to U.S. businesses. It would require the guidance to provide infor-
mation about emerging trends and issues involving human rights
abuses perpetrated by the Government of the People’s Republic of
China consisting of the use of forced labor against Uyghurs and
ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Lastly, this section would clarify that such guidance is for advisory
purposes only.
