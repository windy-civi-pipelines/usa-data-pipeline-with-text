PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on January 16, 2025, by Representative Barr, H.R.
478, the Promoting New Bank Formation Act, would provide for a
3-year phase-in period for de novo financial institutions to meet
federal capital requirements; would lower the Community Bank Le-
verage Ratio (CBLR) for rural community banks to 8 percent from
8.5 percent during the first three years of operation; would require
the Federal Banking Agencies to set rules further reducing the
CBLR for the initial two years of operation to allow for a phase-
in period; would remove certain restrictions to allow federal sav-
ings associations to deal in agricultural loans; and would require
the Federal banking agencies to conduct a joint study on trends in
de novo financial institutions.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The banking industry faces increasing challenges due to regu-
latory and compliance burdens, particularly in the formation of
new banks, or de novo banks. According to the Federal Deposit In-
surance Corporation (FDIC), only 60 new banks have been char-
tered in the last decade, a sharp decline from over 2,000 new banks
formed between 1990 and 2008. This shortage of new community
banks exacerbates the issues caused by the consolidation and clo-
sure of financial institutions in recent years. By incentivizing de
novo bank formation, H.R. 478 seeks to address the gap in commu-
nity banking services, fostering greater competition and improving
access to financial services for families, small businesses, and local
communities.

nancial institutions to meet federal capital requirements; low-
ers the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) for rural

atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a

SEC. 5. FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—In order to provide thrift institutions for the
deposit of funds and for the extension of credit for homes and other
goods and services, the Comptroller of the Currency is authorized,
under such regulations as the Comptroller of the Currency may
prescribe—
(1) to provide for the organization, incorporation, examina-
tion, operation, and regulation of associations to be known as
Federal savings associations (including Federal savings banks),
and
(2) to issue charters therefor,
giving primary consideration of the best practices of thrift institu-
tions in the United States. The lending and investment powers con-
ferred by this section are intended to encourage such institutions
to provide credit for housing safely and soundly.
(b) DEPOSITS AND RELATED POWERS.—
(1) DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS.—
(A) Subject to the terms of its charter and regulations of
the Comptroller of the Currency, a Federal savings asso-
ciation may—
(i) raise funds through such deposit, share, or other
accounts, including demand deposit accounts (here-
after in this section referred to as ‘‘accounts’’); and
(ii) issue passbooks, certificates, or other evidence of
accounts.
(B) A Federal savings association may not permit any
overdraft (including an intraday overdraft) on behalf of an
affiliate, or incur any such overdraft in such savings asso-
ciation’s account at a Federal reserve bank or Federal
home loan bank on behalf of an affiliate.
All savings accounts and demand accounts shall have the
same priority upon liquidation. Holders of accounts and
obligors of a Federal savings association shall, to such ex-
tent as may be provided by its charter or by regulations
of the Comptroller of the Currency, be members of the sav-
ings association, and shall have such voting rights and
such other rights as are thereby provided.
(C) A Federal savings association may require not less
than 14 days notice prior to payment of savings accounts
if the charter of the savings association or the regulations
of the Comptroller of the Currency so provide.
(D) If a Federal savings association does not pay all
withdrawals in full (subject to the right of the association,

where applicable, to require notice), the payment of with-
drawals from accounts shall be subject to such rules and
procedures as may be prescribed by the savings associa-
tion’s charter or by regulation of the Comptroller of the
Currency. Except as authorized in writing by the Comp-
troller of the Currency, any Federal savings association
that fails to make full payment of any withdrawal when
due shall be deemed to be in an unsafe or unsound condi-
tion.
(E) Accounts may be subject to check or to withdrawal
or transfer on negotiable or transferable or other order or
authorization to the Federal savings association, as the
Comptroller of the Currency may by regulation provide.
(F) A Federal savings association may establish remote
service units for the purpose of crediting savings or de-
mand accounts, debiting such accounts, crediting payments
on loans, and the disposition of related financial trans-
actions, as provided in regulations prescribed by the
Comptroller of the Currency.
(2) OTHER LIABILITIES.—To such extent as the Comptroller of
the Currency may authorize in writing, a Federal savings asso-
ciation may borrow, may give security, may be surety as de-
fined by the Comptroller of the Currency and may issue such
notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations, or other securi-
ties, including capital stock.
(3) LOANS FROM STATE HOUSING FINANCE AGENCIES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to regulation by the Comp-
troller of the Currency but without regard to any other
provision of this subsection, any Federal savings associa-
tion that is in compliance with the capital standards in ef-
fect under subsection (t) may borrow funds from a State
mortgage finance agency of the State in which the head of-
fice of such savings association is situated to the same ex-
tent as State law authorizes a savings association orga-
nized under the laws of such State to borrow from the
State mortgage finance agency.
(B) INTEREST RATE.—A Federal savings association may
not make any loan of funds borrowed under subparagraph
(A) at an interest rate which exceeds by more than 13⁄
4
percent per annum the interest rate paid to the State
mortgage finance agency on the obligations issued to ob-
tain the funds so borrowed.
(4) MUTUAL CAPITAL CERTIFICATES.—In accordance with reg-
ulations issued by the Comptroller of the Currency, mutual
capital certificates may be issued and sold directly to sub-
scribers or through underwriters. Such certificates may be in-
cluded in calculating capital for the purpose of subsection (t)
to the extent permitted by the Comptroller of the Currency.
The issuance of certificates under this paragraph does not con-
stitute a change of control or ownership under this Act or any
other law unless there is in fact a change in control or reorga-
nization. Regulations relating to the issuance and sale of mu-
tual capital certificates shall provide that such certificates—
(A) are subordinate to all savings accounts, savings cer-
tificates, and debt obligations;

compliance therewith. Witnesses subpoenaed under this
section shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are
paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States.

connection with this section shall be considered as non-
administrative expenses. Any court having jurisdiction of

conversion, the members or shareholders of the savings as-
sociation will share on a mutual basis in the assets of the
association in exact proportion to their relative share or
account credits;
(v) when a stock savings association is dissolved after
conversion, the stockholders will share on an equitable
basis in the assets of the association; and
(vi) such conversion shall be effective upon the date that
all the provisions of this Act shall have been fully complied
with and upon the issuance of a new charter by the State

when designated for that purpose by such instrumentality, includ-
ing services in connection with the collection of taxes and other ob-
ligations owed the United States, and the Secretary of the Treasury

sharing plan which qualifies or qualified for specific tax treatment
under section 401(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and to

in such Federal savings association or in obligations or securities
issued by such Federal savings association. All funds held in such
fiduciary capacity by any Federal savings association may be com-
mingled for appropriate purposes of investment, but individual
records shall be kept by the fiduciary for each participant and shall
show in proper detail all transactions engaged in under this para-
graph.
(m) BRANCHING.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—
(A) No savings association incorporated under the laws
of the District of Columbia or organized in the District or
doing business in the District shall establish any branch or

27
(1) PERMITS.—The Comptroller may grant by special permit
to a Federal savings association applying therefor the right to
act as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or in any
other fiduciary capacity in which State banks, trust companies,
or other corporations which compete with Federal savings asso-
ciations are permitted to act under the laws of the State in
which the Federal savings association is located. Subject to the
regulations of the Comptroller, service corporations may invest
in State or federally chartered corporations which are located
in the State in which the home office of the Federal savings
association is located and which are engaged in trust activities.
(2) SEGREGATION OF ASSETS.—A Federal savings association
exercising any or all of the powers enumerated in this section
shall segregate all assets held in any fiduciary capacity from
the general assets of the association and shall keep a separate
set of books and records showing in proper detail all trans-
actions engaged in under this subsection. The State banking
authority involved may have access to reports of examination
made by the Comptroller insofar as such reports relate to the
trust department of such association but nothing in this sub-
section shall be construed as authorizing such State banking
authority to examine the books, records, and assets of such as-
sociations.
(3) PROHIBITIONS.—No Federal savings association shall re-
ceive in its trust department deposits of current funds subject
to check or the deposit of checks, drafts, bills of exchange, or
other items for collection or exchange purposes. Funds depos-
ited or held in trust by the association awaiting investment
shall be carried in a separate account and shall not be used by
the association in the conduct of its business unless it shall
first set aside in the trust department United States bonds or
other securities approved by the Comptroller.
(4) SEPARATE LIEN.—In the event of the failure of a Federal
savings association, the owners of the funds held in trust for
investment shall have a lien on the bonds or other securities
so set apart in addition to their claim against the estate of the
association.
(5) DEPOSITS.—Whenever the laws of a State require cor-
porations acting in a fiduciary capacity to deposit securities
with the State authorities for the protection of private or court
trusts, Federal savings associations so acting shall be required
to make similar deposits. Securities so deposited shall be held
for the protection of private or court trusts, as provided by the
State law. Federal savings associations in such cases shall not
be required to execute the bond usually required of individuals
if State corporations under similar circumstances are exempt
from this requirement. Federal savings associations shall have
power to execute such bond when so required by the laws of
the State involved.
(6) OATHS AND AFFIDAVITS.—In any case in which the laws
of a State require that a corporation acting as trustee, execu-
tor, administrator, or in any capacity specified in this section,
shall take an oath or make an affidavit, the president, vice
president, cashier, or trust officer of such association may take
the necessary oath or execute the necessary affidavit.

(7) CERTAIN LOANS PROHIBITED.—It shall be unlawful for any
Federal savings association to lend any officer, director, or em-
ployee any funds held in trust under the powers conferred by
this section. Any officer, director, or employee making such
loan, or to whom such loan is made, may be fined not more
than $50,000 or twice the amount of that person’s gain from
the loan, whichever is greater, or may be imprisoned not more
than 5 years, or may be both fined and imprisoned, in the dis-
cretion of the court.
(8) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.—In reviewing applications
for permission to exercise the powers enumerated in this sec-
tion, the Comptroller may consider—
(A) the amount of capital of the applying Federal savings
association,
(B) whether or not such capital is sufficient under the
circumstances of the case,
(C) the needs of the community to be served, and
(D) any other facts and circumstances that seem to it
proper.
The Comptroller may grant or refuse the application accord-
ingly, except that no permit shall be issued to any association
having capital less than the capital required by State law of
State banks, trust companies, and corporations exercising such
powers.
(9) SURRENDER OF CHARTER.—(A) Any Federal savings asso-
ciation may surrender its right to exercise the powers granted
under this subsection, and have returned to it any securities
which it may have deposited with the State authorities, by fil-
ing with the Comptroller a certified copy of a resolution of its
board of directors indicating its intention to surrender its right.
(B) Upon receipt of such resolution, the Comptroller, if satis-
fied that such Federal savings association has been relieved in
accordance with State law of all duties as trustee, executor, ad-
ministrator, guardian or other fiduciary, may in the Director’s
discretion, issue to such association a certificate that such as-
sociation is no longer authorized to exercise the powers granted
by this subsection.
(C) Upon the issuance of such a certificate by the Comp-
troller, such Federal savings association (i) shall no longer be
subject to the provisions of this section or the regulations of
the Comptroller made pursuant thereto, (ii) shall be entitled to
have returned to it any securities which it may have deposited
with State authorities, and (iii) shall not exercise thereafter
any of the powers granted by this section without first apply-
ing for and obtaining a new permit to exercise such powers
pursuant to the provisions of this section.
(D) The Comptroller may prescribe regulations necessary to
enforce compliance with the provisions of this subsection.
(10) REVOCATION.—(A) In addition to the authority conferred
by other law, if, in the opinion of the Comptroller, a Federal
savings association is unlawfully or unsoundly exercising, or
has unlawfully or unsoundly exercised, or has failed for a pe-
riod of 5 consecutive years to exercise, the powers granted by
this subsection or otherwise fails or has failed to comply with
the requirements of this subsection, the Comptroller may issue

and serve upon the association a notice of intent to revoke the
authority of the association to exercise the powers granted by
this subsection. The notice shall contain a statement of the
facts constituting the alleged unlawful or unsound exercise of
powers, or failure to exercise powers, or failure to comply, and
shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to
determine whether an order revoking authority to exercise
such powers should issue against the association.
(B) Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (d)(1)(B), and subject to judicial review
as therein provided, and shall be fixed for a date not earlier
than 30 days and not later than 60 days after service of such
notice unless the Comptroller sets an earlier or later date at
the request of any Federal savings association so served.
(C) Unless the Federal savings association so served shall
appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it
shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the rev-
ocation order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the
record made at any such hearing, the Comptroller shall find
that any allegation specified in the notice of charges has been
established, the Comptroller may issue and serve upon the as-
sociation an order prohibiting it from accepting any new or ad-
ditional trust accounts and revoking authority to exercise any
and all powers granted by this subsection, except that such
order shall permit the association to continue to service all pre-
viously accepted trust accounts pending their expeditious di-
vestiture or termination.
(D) A revocation order shall become effective not earlier than
the expiration of 30 days after service of such order upon the
association so served (except in the case of a revocation order
issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time
specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable,
except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or
set aside by action of the Comptroller or a reviewing court.
(o) CONVERSION OF STATE SAVINGS BANKS.—(1) Subject to the
provisions of this subsection and under regulations of the Comp-
troller, the Comptroller may authorize the conversion of a State-
chartered savings bank into a Federal savings bank, if such conver-
sion is not in contravention of State law, and provide for the orga-
nization, incorporation, operation, examination, and regulation of
such institution.
(2)(A) Any Federal savings bank chartered pursuant to this sub-
section shall continue to be insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund.
(B) The Comptroller shall notify the Corporation of any applica-
tion under this Act for conversion to a Federal charter by an insti-
tution insured by the Corporation, shall consult with the Corpora-
tion before disposing of the application, and shall notify the Cor-
poration of the determination of the Comptroller with respect to
such application.
(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Corpora-
tion determines that conversion into a Federal stock savings bank
or the chartering of a Federal stock savings bank is necessary to
prevent the default of a savings bank it insures or to reopen a sav-
ings bank in default that it insured, or if the Corporation deter-
mines, with the concurrence of the Comptroller, that severe finan-

cial conditions exist that threaten the stability of a savings bank
insured by the Corporation and that such a conversion or charter
is likely to improve the financial condition of such savings bank,
the Corporation shall provide the Comptroller with a certificate of
such determination, the reasons therefor in conformance with the
requirements of this Act, and the bank shall be converted or char-
tered by the Comptroller, pursuant to the regulations thereof, from
the time the Corporation issues the certificate.
(D) A bank may be converted under subparagraph (C) only if the
board of trustees of the bank—
(i) has specified in writing that the bank is in danger of clos-
ing or is closed, or that severe financial conditions exist that
threaten the stability of the bank and a conversion is likely to
improve the financial condition of the bank; and
(ii) has requested in writing that the Corporation use the au-
thority of subparagraph (C).
(E)(i) Before making a determination under subparagraph (D),
the Corporation shall consult the State bank supervisor of the
State in which the bank in danger of closing is chartered. The
State bank supervisor shall be given a reasonable opportunity, and
in no event less than 48 hours, to object to the use of the provisions
of subparagraph (D).
(ii) If the State supervisor objects during such period, the Cor-
poration may use the authority of subparagraph (D) only by an af-
firmative vote of three-fourths of the Board of Directors. The Board
of Directors shall provide the State supervisor, as soon as prac-
ticable, with a written certification of its determination.
(3) A Federal savings bank chartered under this subsection shall
have the same authority with respect to investments, operations,
and activities, and shall be subject to the same restrictions, includ-
ing those applicable to branching and discrimination, as would
apply to it if it were chartered as a Federal savings bank under
any other provision of this Act.
(p) CONVERSIONS.—(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, and consistent with the purposes of this Act, the Comptroller
may authorize (or in the case of a Federal savings association, re-
quire) the conversion of any mutual savings association or Federal
mutual savings bank that is insured by the Corporation into a Fed-
eral stock savings association or Federal stock savings bank, or
charter a Federal stock savings association or Federal stock sav-
ings bank to acquire the assets of, or merge with such a mutual
institution under the regulations of the Comptroller.
(2) Authorizations under this subsection may be made only—
(A) if the Comptroller has determined that severe financial
conditions exist which threaten the stability of an association
and that such authorization is likely to improve the financial
condition of the association,
(B) when the Corporation has contracted to provide assist-
ance to such association under section 13 of the Federal De-
posit Insurance Act, or
(C) to assist an institution in receivership.
(3) A Federal savings bank chartered under this subsection shall
have the same authority with respect to investments, operations
and activities, and shall be subject to the same restrictions, includ-
ing those applicable to branching and discrimination, as would

any other provision of this Act, and may engage in any investment,
activity, or operation that the institution it acquired was engaged
in if that institution was a Federal savings bank, or would have
been authorized to engage in had that institution converted to a
Federal charter.
(q) TYING ARRANGEMENTS.—(1) A savings association may not in
any manner extend credit, lease, or sell property of any kind, or
furnish any service, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the
foregoing, on the condition or requirement—
(A) that the customer shall obtain additional credit, property,
or service from such savings association, or from any service
corporation or affiliate of such association, other than a loan,
discount, deposit, or trust service;
(B) that the customer provide additional credit, property, or
service to such association, or to any service corporation or af-
filiate of such association, other than those related to and usu-
ally provided in connection with a similar loan, discount, de-
posit, or trust service; and
(C) that the customer shall not obtain some other credit,
property, or service from a competitor of such association, or
from a competitor of any service corporation or affiliate of such
association, other than a condition or requirement that such
association shall reasonably impose in connection with credit
transactions to assure the soundness of credit.
(2)(A) Any person may sue for and have injunctive relief, in any
court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties,
against threatened loss or damage by reason of a violation of para-
graph (1), under the same conditions and principles as injunctive
relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is
granted by courts of equity and under the rules governing such
proceedings.
(B) Upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an in-
junction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger of
irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction
may issue.
(3) Any person injured by a violation of paragraph (1) may bring
an action in any district court of the United States in which the
defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without regard to
the amount in controversy, or in any other court of competent juris-
diction, and shall be entitled to recover three times the amount of
the damages sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable
attorney’s fee. Any such action shall be brought within 4 years
from the date of the occurrence of the violation.
(4) Nothing contained in this subsection affects in any manner
the right of the United States or any other party to bring an action
under any other law of the United States or of any State, including
any right which may exist in addition to specific statutory author-
ity, challenging the legality of any act or practice which may be
proscribed by this subsection. No regulation or order issued by the
Board under this subsection shall in any manner constitute a de-
fense to such action.

(6) EXCEPTIONS.—The Board may, by regulation or order,
permit such exceptions to the prohibitions of this subsection as
the Board in consultation with the Comptroller and the Cor-
poration, considers will not be contrary to the purposes of this
subsection and which conform to exceptions granted by the
Board pursuant to section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act Amendments of 1970.
(r) OUT-OF-STATE BRANCHES.—(1) No Federal savings association
may establish, retain, or operate a branch outside the State in
which the Federal savings association has its home office, unless
the association qualifies as a domestic building and loan associa-
tion under section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
or meets the asset composition test imposed by subparagraph (C)
of that section on institutions seeking so to qualify, or qualifies as
a qualified thrift lender, as determined under section 10(m) of this
Act. No out-of-State branch so established shall be retained or op-
erated unless the total assets of the Federal savings association at-
tributable to all branches of the Federal savings association in that
State would qualify the branches as a whole, were they otherwise
eligible, for treatment as a domestic building and loan association
under section 7701(a)(19) or as a qualified thrift lender, as deter-
mined under section 10(m) of this Act, as applicable.
(2) The limitations of paragraph (1) shall not apply if—
(A) the branch results from a transaction authorized under
section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;
(B) the branch was authorized for the Federal savings asso-
ciation prior to October 15, 1982;
(C) the law of the State where the branch is located, or is
to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the
association was a savings association or savings bank char-
tered by the State in which its home office is located; or
(D) the branch was operated lawfully as a branch under
State law prior to the association’s conversion to a Federal
charter.
(3) The Comptroller of the Currency, for good cause shown, may
allow Federal savings associations up to 2 years to comply with the
requirements of this subsection.
(s) MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Consistent with the purposes of section 908
of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 and the
capital requirements established pursuant to such section by
the appropriate Federal banking agencies (as defined in section
903(1) of such Act), the Comptroller of the Currency shall re-
quire all savings associations to achieve and maintain ade-
quate capital by—
(A) establishing minimum levels of capital for savings
associations; and
(B) using such other methods as the Comptroller of the
Currency determines to be appropriate.
(2) MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS MAY BE DETERMINED BY DIREC-
TOR CASE-BY-CASE.—The Comptroller of the Currency may, con-
sistent with subsection (t), establish the minimum level of cap-
ital for a savings association at such amount or at such ratio
of capital-to-assets as the Comptroller of the Currency deter-

mines to be necessary or appropriate for such association in
light of the particular circumstances of the association.
(3) UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE.—In the discretion of the
appropriate Federal banking agency, the appropriate Federal
banking agency, may treat the failure of any savings associa-
tion to maintain capital at or above the minimum level re-
quired by the Comptroller under this subsection or subsection
(t) as an unsafe or unsound practice.
(4) DIRECTIVE TO INCREASE CAPITAL.—
(A) PLAN MAY BE REQUIRED.—In addition to any other
action authorized by law, including paragraph (3), the ap-
propriate Federal banking agency may issue a directive re-
quiring any savings association which fails to maintain
capital at or above the minimum level required by the ap-
propriate Federal banking agency to submit and adhere to
a plan for increasing capital which is acceptable to the ap-
propriate Federal banking agency.
(B) ENFORCEMENT OF PLAN.—Any directive issued and
plan approved under subparagraph (A) shall be enforce-
able under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
to the same extent and in the same manner as an out-
standing order which was issued under section 8 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act and has become final.
(5) PLAN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS.—The
appropriate Federal banking agency may—
(A) consider a savings association’s progress in adhering
to any plan required under paragraph (4) whenever such
association or any affiliate of such association (including
any company which controls such association) seeks the
approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for
any proposal which would have the effect of diverting
earnings, diminishing capital, or otherwise impeding such
association’s progress in meeting the minimum level of
capital required by the appropriate Federal banking agen-
cy; and
(B) disapprove any proposal referred to in subparagraph
(A) if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines
that the proposal would adversely affect the ability of the
association to comply with such plan.
(t) CAPITAL STANDARDS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—

tion, prescribe and maintain uniformly applicable capital

ital requirement prescribed under paragraph (1) shall re-
quire a savings association to maintain tangible capital in

standing paragraph (1)(C), the risk-based capital require-
ment prescribed under paragraph (1) may deviate from the
risk-based capital standards applicable to national banks
to reflect interest-rate risk or other risks, but such devi-
ations shall not, in the aggregate, result in materially
lower levels of capital being required of savings associa-
tions under the risk-based capital requirement than would
be required under the risk-based capital standards applica-
ble to national banks.
(5) SEPARATE CAPITALIZATION REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN SUB-
SIDIARIES.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—In determining compliance with cap-
ital standards prescribed under paragraph (1), all of a sav-

ciation’s capital.

of safety and soundness, this subparagraph should cease to
apply to that subsidiary.

tivities.

pensation, as the appropriate Federal banking agency
determines to be appropriate).

of the appropriate Federal banking agency;
(ii) any increase in assets is accompanied by an in-
crease in tangible capital in an amount not less than

existence of policies and procedures within the savings as-

cooperated with law enforcement authorities with respect
to the investigation of the money laundering offense of

nity in having adequate deposit and credit services avail-
able would be threatened by the forfeiture of the franchise.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would allow new banks, referred to as de novo banks,
and their holding companies to have lower capital requirements
than they otherwise should have for their first three years, with
additional capital reductions for rural de novo community banks by
allowing them to be subject to below 8% Community Bank Lever-
age Ratio (CBLR) in their first two years before reaching 8% in
their third year (currently, community banks must have 9% CBLR
to be exempt from other capital requirements1). The bill also limits
regulatory review of revised business plans for de novo banks and
their holding companies to 30 days, otherwise they are automati-
cally approved. Finally, it eliminates a cap on agricultural loans
made by thrift banks that was established following the Savings &
Loan Crisis in the 1980s and 1990s.2 Of note, there are no reforms
to support de novo credit union formation. The bill also appears to
allow any large bank holding company to establish a small de novo
bank subsidiary, and then their holding company would be subject
to reduced capital requirements phased in over 3 years and expe-
dited business plan reviews, which would further reduce safety and
soundness of the banking system. The Committee passed a similar
bill by a party-line 24–22 vote in the last Congress.3
In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, de novo bank
charters hit record lows, and in 2014 and 2016, there were no de
novo charters at all.4 Research suggests that new charter activity
is typically cyclical,5 following trends in the economy, which aligns
with the Fed’s research which found that nearly 80% of the decline
in new charter activity between 2009 and 2013 was not a result of
regulatory requirements, but rather economic factors like the low
interest rate environment.6 Indeed, experts have identified a strong
correlation between the Federal Funds Rate set by the Federal Re-
serve and the number of de novo banks formed in a given year
going back to at least the 1950s.7
Experts have raised several concerns with the approach outlined
by H.R. 758, including safety and soundness concerns relating to
1See CRS, Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR): Background and Analysis of Bank Data
(May 11, 2020). Regulators temporarily reduced CBLR to 8% during the pandemic before raising
it back to 9% by 2022, where it was originally set.
2Currently, Section 5(c) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act stipulates that savings associations
(i.e. thrift banks) have a cap where the combined amount of agricultural, commercial, corporate,
and business loans may not exceed more than 20% of their total assets.

allowing new banks to have less capital and quickly shifting busi-
ness plans since many de novos tend to fail in their first few years.
As Renita Marcelin from Americans for Financial Reform explained
in testimony, ‘‘a 2016 FDIC study concluded that most de novo
banks do not fail during their early years when they are required
to have high capital cushions relative to established banks but in-
stead fail when their capital requirements are similar to that of
other banks. This only underscores the role capital requirements
play in creating resilient banks. All banks, especially new ones,
must have an adequate capital cushion to absorb their losses dur-
ing times of stress to avoid failing and potentially causing con-
tagion.’’8
Committee Democrats support reasonable proposals that will
support the creation of new banks and credit unions and previously
held hearings discussing barriers that community financial institu-
tions face, including consolidation, needed technology updates, and
access to capital and liquidity.9 There also has been a troubling de-
cline of roughly one-third of all minority depository institutions
(MDIs) and more than half of Black-owned banks since the 2008
financial crisis. Democrats advanced through the House a series of
bipartisan legislative proposals to strengthen community develop-
ment financial institutions (CDFIs) and MDIs, building on the bi-
partisan work during the pandemic to provide $12 billion in capital
investments and grants to improve CDFIs and MDIs ability to pro-
vide financial access to underserved communities.10 This includes
H.R. 4590 (117th Cong.), the Promoting New and Diverse Deposi-
tory Institutions Act, which the House passed three times, includ-
ing by voice vote as a standalone bill. Instead of taking a deregula-
tory approach as provided by H.R. 478, the Promoting New and Di-
verse Depository Institutions Act would require Federal regulators
to conduct a study examining the challenges that prospective de
novo banks and credit unions face and to develop a first of its kind
coordinated strategic plan based on that study to promote the cre-
ation of newly chartered institutions. Ranking Member Waters of-
fered a substitute amendment with language similar to H.R. 4590
(117th Cong.), however Republicans rejected the amendment and it
failed on a voice vote.
This bill is opposed by Americans for Financial Reform, Center
for Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of America, Na-
tional Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income clients),
and Public Citizen.
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 478.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
