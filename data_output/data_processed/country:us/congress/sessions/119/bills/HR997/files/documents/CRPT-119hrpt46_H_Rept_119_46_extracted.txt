I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 997, the ‘‘National Taxpayer Advocate Enhance-
ment Act of 2025,’’ as amended, was ordered favorably reported by
the Committee on Ways and Means on February 12, 2025.
The provision specifically authorizes the National Taxpayer Ad-
vocate (‘‘NTA’’) to appoint counsel in the Office of the Taxpayer Ad-
vocate to report directly to the NTA.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (‘‘TAS’’) is an independent office
within the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) that is tasked with
helping taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS, identifying ad-
ministrative and legislative causes of those problems, and making
recommendations to the IRS and Congress on how to mitigate the
problems.1 The NTA leads the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate and
is responsible for providing Congress with an annual report on the
objectives of their office, which must identify areas of the tax law
that impose significant compliance burdens on taxpayers or the
IRS, including specific recommendations for remedying these prob-
lems.2 The NTA’s yearly compilation of legislative recommenda-
tions to strengthen taxpayer rights and improve tax administration
is known as the Purple Book.3
In the 2025 Purple Book, the NTA recommended that Congress
‘‘clarify that the National Taxpayer Advocate may hire legal coun-
1IRC §7803(c)(2).
2IRC §7803(c)(2)(B)(ii).

sel to enable her to advocate more effectively for taxpayers.’’4 NTA
points out that there is currently no law specifically authorizing
the NTA to hire and supervise their own attorneys. From 2004 to
2015, the Commissioner of the IRS allowed the TAS to hire and
employ attorney-advisors to allow the NTA to develop perspectives
independent of the IRS as the law intends. Beginning in 2015, the
IRS denied what was once a routine request from the TAS to back-
fill attorney positions due to attrition.
Given the Committee on Ways and Means’ commitment to im-
proving taxpayers’ experience with the IRS and the important role
that the NTA plays in helping taxpayers resolve problems with the
IRS, it is of vital importance that Congress strengthens the inde-
pendent nature of the NTA by allowing her to hire independent
counsel that reports directly to her.
C. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
Background
H.R. 997 was introduced on February 5, 2025, and was referred
to the Committee on Ways and Means.
Committee Hearings
On February 11, 2025, the Committee on Ways and Means held
a hearing titled, ‘‘IRS Return on Investment and the Need for Mod-
ernization’’.
Committee Action
The Committee on Ways and Means marked up H.R. 997, on
February 12, 2025, and order the bill, as amended, favorably re-
ported (with a quorum being present).
D. DESIGNATED HEARING
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII, the following hearing was
used to develop and consider H.R. 997:
‘‘IRS Return on Investment and the Need for Modernization’’
on February 11, 2025.
II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
A. AUTHORITY OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATE TO APPOINT COUNSEL (SEC.
2 OF THE BILL AND SEC. 7803(c) OF THE CODE)
PRESENT LAW
The Office of the Taxpayer Advocate is expected to represent tax-
payer interests independently in disputes with the Internal Rev-
enue Service (‘‘IRS’’).5
The Office of the Taxpayer Advocate has four principal func-
tions:6

Section 3:
1. to assist taxpayers in resolving problems with the IRS;

Section 4:
2. to identify areas in which taxpayers have problems in
dealing with the IRS;

Section 5:
3. to propose changes in the administrative practices of the
IRS to mitigate problems identified in (2); and

Section 6:
4. to identify potential legislative changes which may be ap-
propriate to mitigate such problems.
The National Taxpayer Advocate (‘‘NTA’’) supervises and directs
the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate. The NTA is appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury (‘‘Secretary’’) in consultation with the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue (‘‘Commissioner’’) and the Over-
sight Board and reports directly to the Commissioner. The NTA
has the responsibility and authority (1) to appoint local taxpayer
advocates and make available at least one such advocate for each
State, and (2) to evaluate and take personnel actions (including dis-
missal) with respect to any employee of any local office of a tax-
payer advocate.7 The NTA may also consult with the appropriate
supervisory personnel of the IRS in carrying out the NTA’s respon-
sibilities.8 The office is one of several authorized by the Internal
Revenue Code and reporting directly to the Commissioner, who is
appointed by the President. The Chief Counsel, who serves as the
chief law officer for the IRS, is also appointed by the President, and
answers to both the Commissioner and the General Counsel for the
Secretary.9
No law specifically authorizes or forbids the NTA to hire and su-
pervise attorneys.10
REASONS FOR CHANGE
Under present law, the Division Counsel/Associate Chief Counsel
(National Taxpayer Advocate Program) manages and coordinates
the IRS Office of Chief Counsel (‘‘OCC’’) support for the NTA. How-
ever, the position reports to the OCC. Furthermore, the Office of
the Taxpayer Advocate may employ attorneys to develop analysis
and provide counsel to the NTA. However, they do not offer formal
legal advice or represent the agency. The provision authorizes the
NTA to appoint independent counsel reporting directly to the NTA,
thereby enhancing the potential effectiveness and independence of
the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
The provision specifically authorizes the NTA to appoint counsel
in the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate to report directly to the
NTA.
EFFECTIVE DATE
The proposal applies as if included in the enactment of section
1102 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform
Act of 1998.11

C. COST ESTIMATE PREPARED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET

The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, stipulates
that revenue estimates provided by the staff of the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation (‘‘JCT’’) will be the official estimates for all tax

ommendations that are reflected in this report.
B. STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the bill does
not authorize funding, so no statement of general performance

C. APPLICABILITY OF HOUSE RULE XXI, CLAUSE 5(B)
Rule XXI 5(b) of the Rules of the House of Representatives pro-
vides, in part, that ‘‘A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or con-

increase.

This information is provided in accordance with section 423 of
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. No. 104–4).

Federal mandates on the private sector. The Committee has deter-
mined that the bill does not impose a Federal intergovernmental
mandate on State, local, or tribal governments.
E. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND
LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-

Section 7:
Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Reform and Re-
structuring Act of 1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the Inter-
nal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a
tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all
legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the
House Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of con-
ference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indi-
rectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has widespread ap-
plicability to individuals or small businesses.

that there are no provisions that are of widespread applicability to
individuals or small businesses.

I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 997, the ‘‘National Taxpayer Advocate Enhance-
ment Act of 2025,’’ as amended, was ordered favorably reported by
the Committee on Ways and Means on February 12, 2025.
The provision specifically authorizes the National Taxpayer Ad-
vocate (‘‘NTA’’) to appoint counsel in the Office of the Taxpayer Ad-
vocate to report directly to the NTA.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (‘‘TAS’’) is an independent office
within the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) that is tasked with
helping taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS, identifying ad-
ministrative and legislative causes of those problems, and making
recommendations to the IRS and Congress on how to mitigate the
problems.1 The NTA leads the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate and
is responsible for providing Congress with an annual report on the
objectives of their office, which must identify areas of the tax law
that impose significant compliance burdens on taxpayers or the
IRS, including specific recommendations for remedying these prob-
lems.2 The NTA’s yearly compilation of legislative recommenda-
tions to strengthen taxpayer rights and improve tax administration
is known as the Purple Book.3
In the 2025 Purple Book, the NTA recommended that Congress
‘‘clarify that the National Taxpayer Advocate may hire legal coun-
1IRC §7803(c)(2).
2IRC §7803(c)(2)(B)(ii).

sel to enable her to advocate more effectively for taxpayers.’’4 NTA
points out that there is currently no law specifically authorizing
the NTA to hire and supervise their own attorneys. From 2004 to
2015, the Commissioner of the IRS allowed the TAS to hire and
employ attorney-advisors to allow the NTA to develop perspectives
independent of the IRS as the law intends. Beginning in 2015, the
IRS denied what was once a routine request from the TAS to back-
fill attorney positions due to attrition.
Given the Committee on Ways and Means’ commitment to im-
proving taxpayers’ experience with the IRS and the important role
that the NTA plays in helping taxpayers resolve problems with the
IRS, it is of vital importance that Congress strengthens the inde-
pendent nature of the NTA by allowing her to hire independent
counsel that reports directly to her.

II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
A. AUTHORITY OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATE TO APPOINT COUNSEL (SEC.
2 OF THE BILL AND SEC. 7803(c) OF THE CODE)
PRESENT LAW
The Office of the Taxpayer Advocate is expected to represent tax-
payer interests independently in disputes with the Internal Rev-
enue Service (‘‘IRS’’).5
The Office of the Taxpayer Advocate has four principal func-
tions:6
1. to assist taxpayers in resolving problems with the IRS;

2. to identify areas in which taxpayers have problems in
dealing with the IRS;
3. to propose changes in the administrative practices of the
IRS to mitigate problems identified in (2); and
4. to identify potential legislative changes which may be ap-
propriate to mitigate such problems.
The National Taxpayer Advocate (‘‘NTA’’) supervises and directs
the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate. The NTA is appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury (‘‘Secretary’’) in consultation with the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue (‘‘Commissioner’’) and the Over-
sight Board and reports directly to the Commissioner. The NTA
has the responsibility and authority (1) to appoint local taxpayer
advocates and make available at least one such advocate for each
State, and (2) to evaluate and take personnel actions (including dis-
missal) with respect to any employee of any local office of a tax-
payer advocate.7 The NTA may also consult with the appropriate
supervisory personnel of the IRS in carrying out the NTA’s respon-
sibilities.8 The office is one of several authorized by the Internal
Revenue Code and reporting directly to the Commissioner, who is
appointed by the President. The Chief Counsel, who serves as the
chief law officer for the IRS, is also appointed by the President, and
answers to both the Commissioner and the General Counsel for the
Secretary.9
No law specifically authorizes or forbids the NTA to hire and su-
pervise attorneys.10
REASONS FOR CHANGE
Under present law, the Division Counsel/Associate Chief Counsel
(National Taxpayer Advocate Program) manages and coordinates
the IRS Office of Chief Counsel (‘‘OCC’’) support for the NTA. How-
ever, the position reports to the OCC. Furthermore, the Office of
the Taxpayer Advocate may employ attorneys to develop analysis
and provide counsel to the NTA. However, they do not offer formal
legal advice or represent the agency. The provision authorizes the
NTA to appoint independent counsel reporting directly to the NTA,
thereby enhancing the potential effectiveness and independence of
the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
The provision specifically authorizes the NTA to appoint counsel
in the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate to report directly to the
NTA.

Act of 1998.11

nal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a

ference if the legislation includes a provision that directly or indi-
rectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has widespread ap-
