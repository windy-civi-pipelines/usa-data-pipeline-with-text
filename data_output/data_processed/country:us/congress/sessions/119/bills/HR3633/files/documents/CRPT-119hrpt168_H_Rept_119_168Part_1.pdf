‘‘(b) MATURITYCRITERIA.—
‘‘(1) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the Congress that protecting in-
vestors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital
formation necessitates establishing clear criteria for blockchain systems to be
deemed mature, as well as enabling the Commission to develop, without preju-
dice to any such criteria codified in statute, alternative criteria by which
blockchain systems may be considered not to be controlled by any person or
group of persons under common control in order to accommodate changes in
markets and technology.
‘‘(2) IN GENERAL.—The Commission may issue rules identifying conditions by
which a blockchain system, together with its related digital commodity, shall be
considered a mature blockchain system, consistent with the protection of inves-
tors, maintenance of fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and the facilitation of
capital formation.
‘‘(3) RULESOFCONSTRUCTION.—

the Commission’s ability to identify alternative conditions and criteria by
which a blockchain system may be considered a mature blockchain system.
‘‘(c) DEEMEDMATURE.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subsection (b), for the purposes of sub-
section (a), a digital commodity issuer, digital commodity related person, digital
commodity affiliated person, or decentralized governance system of the

authority any person, other than a digital commodity issuer, digital
commodity related person, or digital commodity affiliated person from
engaging in the activities the blockchain system is intended to provide,
including the activities described in subparagraph (B).
‘‘(D) PROGRAMMATIC SYSTEM.—The blockchain system operates, executes,
and enforces its operations and transactions based solely on pre-estab-
lished, transparent rules encoded directly within the source code of the
blockchain system.

sensus or agreement of the blockchain system or its related digital com-
modity; or
‘‘(ii) has the unilateral authority to direct the voting, in the aggre-
gate, of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting power of such
blockchain system by means of a related digital commodity, nodes or
validators, a decentralized governance system, or otherwise, in a
blockchain system which can be altered by a voting system.
‘‘(F) IMPARTIAL SYSTEM.—No person or group of persons under common
control possesses a unique permission or privilege to alter the functionality,

‘‘(C) at least 50 percent of the units of the digital commodity related to
the blockchain system are held by persons other than the digital commodity
issuer, a digital commodity related person, or a digital commodity affiliated
person.
‘‘(d) DECENTRALIZEDGOVERNANCESYSTEM.—
‘‘(1) For the purposes of this section, a decentralized governance system is not
a ‘person’ or a ‘group of persons under common control’.

TITLE V—INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
IMPROVEMENTS
SEC. 501. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
(1) Entrepreneurs and innovators are building and deploying this next gen-
eration of the internet.
(2) Digital commodity networks represent a new way for people to join to-
gether and cooperate with one another to undertake certain activities.
(3) Digital commodities have the potential to be the foundational building
blocks of these systems, aligning the economic incentive for individuals to co-
operate with one another to achieve a common purpose.

the use of technology to manage activities, allocate resources, and facilitate deci-
sion making.
(5) Blockchain systems and the digital commodities they empower provide
control, enhance transparency, reduce transaction costs, and increase efficiency
if proper protections are put in place for investors, consumers, our financial sys-
tem, and our national security.
(6) Blockchain technology facilitates new types of network participation which
businesses in the United States may utilize in innovative ways.
(7) Other digital commodity companies are setting up their operations outside
of the United States, where countries are establishing frameworks to embrace
the potential of blockchain technology and digital commodities and provide safe-
guards for consumers.
(8) Digital commodities, despite the purported anonymity, provide law en-
forcement with an exceptional tracing tool to identify illicit activity and bring
criminals to justice.
(9) The Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives has
held multiple hearings highlighting various risks that digital commodities can
pose to the financial markets, consumers, and investors that must be addressed
as we seek to harness the benefits of these innovations.
(b) SENSEOFCONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States should seek to prioritize understanding the potential op-
portunities of the next generation of the internet;
(2) the United States should seek to foster advances in technology that have
robust evidence indicating they can improve our financial system and create
more fair and equitable access to financial services for everyday Americans
while protecting our financial system, investors, and consumers;
(3) the United States must support the responsible development of digital
commodities and the underlying technology in the United States or risk the
shifting of the development of such assets and technology outside of the United
States, to less regulated countries;
(4) Congress should consult with public and private sector stakeholders to un-
derstand how to enact a functional framework tailored to the specific risks and
unique benefits of different digital commodity-related activities, distributed
ledger technology, distributed networks, and mature blockchain systems;
(5) Congress should enact a functional framework tailored to the specific risks
of different digital commodity-related activities and unique benefits of distrib-
uted ledger technology, distributed networks, and mature blockchain systems;
and
(6) consumers and market participants will benefit from a framework for dig-
ital commodities consistent with longstanding investor protections in securities
and commodities markets, yet tailored to the unique benefits and risks of the
digital commodity ecosystem.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on May 29, 2025, by Chairman French Hill (AR–02),
H.R. 3633, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, pro-
vides the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with ju-
risdiction over digital commodities and clarifies the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction over investment con-
tracts involving digital commodities. Additionally, the bill clarifies
the regulatory treatment of secondary market trading of digital
commodities that were initially offered as part of an investment

contract. Finally, the bill imposes robust customer protections on
all entities required to be registered with the CFTC and the SEC.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 3633, as reported, establishes a digital asset market struc-
ture framework that is consistent with existing regulatory financial
market requirements and recognizes the unique characteristics of
digital assets. This functional framework provides digital asset
firms with regulatory certainty, establishes clear jurisdictional
lines between the SEC and CFTC, and ensures Americans have
comparable protections in digital asset markets to those in the tra-
ditional financial system. The reported legislation will ensure the
United States sets the global standard for the future of innovation.
INNOVATION
Digital assets and blockchain technology have the potential to
make our financial system more efficient and accessible to con-
sumers. At a May 6, 2025, Joint Roundtable of the House Com-
mittee on Financial Services (HFSC) Subcommittee on Digital As-
sets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence and the
House Committee on Agriculture (HAC) Subcommittee on Com-
modity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development (May 2025
Joint Roundtable), James Rathmell, General Counsel of Haun Ven-
tures, explained, ‘‘With crypto, we believe money, assets, and mar-
kets will become like everything else on the internet: transferable
at the speed of information, accessible, programmable, transparent,
and auditable.’’
Because digital assets can be accessed from anywhere, at any
time, by anyone with an internet connection, digital assets solve
some of the accessibility constraints associated with traditional fi-
nancial services. At an April 9, 2025, hearing before the HFSC
Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artifi-
cial Intelligence (April 2025 HFSC Hearing), Jacob Werrett, Chief
Legal Officer of Polygon Labs, testified, ‘‘Unlike traditional finan-
cial services, blockchains do not typically require users to meet spe-
cific eligibility criteria such as credit checks, geographic restric-
tions, or minimum financial thresholds. Whether for saving, invest-
ing, or borrowing, blockchains offer the opportunity for greater fi-
nancial freedom and access, particularly in regions where tradi-
tional banking infrastructure is lacking or unavailable.’’
At a February 11, 2025, hearing before the Subcommittee on Dig-
ital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, (Feb-
ruary 2025 HFSC Hearing), Ji Hun Kim, President and Acting
CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, testified, ‘‘We are in the
early innings of increased traditional finance adoption of digital
asset and blockchain technologies to enhance the efficiency, trans-
parency, and security of market infrastructure.’’ At the same hear-
ing, former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad, who currently
serves as a Research Fellow and Director of the Digital Assets Pol-
icy Project at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Uni-
versity, provided an explanation for traditional firms staying on the
sidelines of the digital asset ecosystem. He explained, ‘‘the absence
of a clear regulatory framework has caused some institutions to re-
frain from making investments that might lead to applications of

greater utility.’’ Mr. Kim further emphasized the need for regu-
latory and legislative clarity to preserve digital asset innovation in
the United States, emphasizing ‘‘It is important for the U.S. to
build upon the progress made during the 118th Congress and en-
sure U.S. leadership in digital assets at the global level . . . in-
creased clarity regarding regulatory expectations will unleash fur-
ther innovation and ensure that American markets remain the
envy of the world.’’
Mark Tague, Co-Founder and Chief Revenue Officer of
CattleProof Verified LLC, testified at an April 9 HAC Sub-
committee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural De-
velopment hearing (April 2025 HAC Hearing) stating, ‘‘other juris-
dictions are actively creating regulatory certainty for digital assets
and blockchain technology. The U.S. risks falling behind if it does
not foster an environment that encourages and supports innovation
in this space.’’ At the same hearing, Mike Horton, Project Creator
at the GEODNET Foundation, testified that ‘‘it is imperative that
future innovators have absolute clarity around how digital assets
are to be regulated. A lack of clarity stifles innovation and discour-
ages investment in the U.S.’’
At a June 4, 2025, hearing before the HAC (June 2025 HAC
Hearing), Dr. Avery Ching, the CEO and Co-Founder of blockchain
developer Aptos Labs, also spoke on the importance of supporting
innovation:
‘‘Just as the internet rewired everyday life, decentralized
networks will form the core infrastructure of the coming
digital economy—delivering systems that are transparent,
interoperable, designed for innovation, and will redefine
how we engage with the world around us.
‘‘Tokens serve a vital role in every application built on
a blockchain. For blockchain innovation to expand respon-
sibly in the U.S., developers need clear regulatory guid-
ance around token issuance and distributions. We’re ready
to help realize that mission, and we’re grateful for the
Committee’s leadership in making it possible.
‘‘Market structure legislation and well-defined, con-
sistent rules around token issuance and distribution will
ensure that networks like Aptos can function as designed,
U.S. builders can innovate while staying compliant and
competitive, and regulators can enforce meaningful con-
sumer protections.
‘‘The infrastructure is ready. Regulatory clarity will en-
sure U.S. leadership in the next era of the internet.’’
ECONOMIC IMPACT
The lack of a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for
digital assets incentivizes digital asset innovators to move offshore
to pursue development overseas, at the expense of U.S. economic
growth. Other countries have built frameworks and become devel-
opmental hubs for the digital asset ecosystem. Currently, the larg-
est trading platform and the largest stablecoin issuer are based
outside of the United States.
Many jurisdictions are successfully building digital asset regu-
latory frameworks and incorporating distributed ledger technology

into their financial systems. For example, the European Union ap-
proved its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, and the
United Kingdom has worked toward its own digital asset regu-
latory framework.
At the February 2025 HFSC Hearing, Coy Garrison, Partner at
Steptoe LLP and former counsel to SEC Commissioner Hester
Peirce, testified, ‘‘On the global stage, the U.S. ceded leadership in
this technology to other jurisdictions as entrepreneurs and capital
flew to jurisdictions willing to provide regulatory certainty for the
industry, including the European Union, United Arab Emirates,
and Hong Kong.’’ During the May 2025 Joint Roundtable, Greg
Tusar, Vice President of Institutional Product of Coinbase Global,
Inc., further emphasized the competitive disadvantage the United
States faces in the absence of market structure legislation:
‘‘While Singapore, Switzerland, and the European Union
have adopted unified frameworks that attract talent and
capital, the fragmented U.S. regulatory landscape coupled
by an enforcement-first approach has pushed innovators
overseas. Without a clear, consistent roadmap for compli-
ance across all states, developers and businesses find
themselves focusing on jurisdictions where regulations are
predictable and accessible, leaving the United States at a
competitive disadvantage.’’
During the April 2025 HAC Hearing, Bill Hughes, Senior Coun-
sel and Director of Global Regulatory Matters of Consensys Soft-
ware Inc., highlighted the potential of blockchain projects, empha-
sizing, ‘‘new computer networks like Ethereum have enticed mean-
ingful computer engineering talent to migrate to the blockchain
space to build the apps that will impact our future. What we see
with Ethereum is the building of a new world computer.’’ He
added, ‘‘Blockchain unlocks a software application frontier that can
meaningfully impact the real world in ways the current internet
simply cannot.’’
CONSUMER PROTECTION
The current regulatory framework for digital assets fails to pro-
vide adequate consumer protection. At a June 4, 2025, hearing be-
fore the HFSC (June 2025 HFSC Hearing), former CFTC Chairman
Rostin Behnam, who currently serves as a Distinguished Fellow at
the Psaros Center for Financial Markets & Policy at Georgetown
University, explained, ‘‘for far too long, the vast majority of the dig-
ital asset market [has been] unregulated and American investors
vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.’’ Digital commodities, as de-
fined in the CLARITY Act, account for roughly 70 percent of the
total market capitalization on digital assets traded today. Because
there is no direct federal oversight of the digital commodity mar-
ketplace, there are no federally mandated customer protections, in-
cluding requirements pertaining to customer disclosures, segrega-
tion of customer funds, and conflicts of interest. Additionally, with-
out registration and oversight of digital commodity intermediaries
and trading platforms, customers are unable to discern the rep-
utable firms from the disreputable. Consequently, customers face
significant risks with respect to the digital commodities they pur-
chase, how they purchase those digital commodities, how an inter-

mediary or trading platform custodies their cash, securities, and
digital commodities, and their ability to access those digital com-
modities, especially if the intermediary or trading platform holding
their digital commodities dissolves.
At the February 2025 HFSC Hearing, Coy Garrison outlined how
the lack of a comprehensive market structure framework for digital
assets has impacted consumers: ‘‘Americans who hold and trade
digital assets are left unprotected with no regulatory framework
imposing baseline protections.’’ During the June 2025 HFSC Hear-
ing, Vivek Raman, Co-Founder and CEO of Etherealize, testified,
‘‘the lack of clarity harms the very investors we aim to protect. A
prime example is the collapse of offshore exchanges or issuers that
were not subject to robust oversight and U.S. regulatory standards.
Regulatory clarity will raise the bar for conduct in this industry by
bringing serious players into compliance and weeding out bad ac-
tors.’’
At the June 2025 HFSC Hearing, Katherine Minarik, Chief
Legal Officer at Uniswap Labs, explained why all Americans—even
those that are crypto skeptics—should want comprehensive digital
asset legislation stating ‘‘If you are deeply skeptical of crypto, then
you should want this legislation even more. Because without it, we
are not protecting the public, we are abandoning them.’’
Daniel J. Davis, former General Counsel at the CFTC, partici-
pating in the May 2025 Joint Roundtable, stated that ‘‘there are
significant rules [at the CFTC] regarding the segregation and pro-
tection of customer funds.’’ He added that ‘‘[t]he CFTC also has ex-
tensive rules to protect retail customers engaging in certain foreign
exchange transactions.’’ Chelsea Pizzola, Partner at Willkie Farr &
Gallagher LLP, highlighted at the June 2025 HAC Hearing how
CFTC oversight provides necessary consumer protections in her
testimony:
‘‘The CFTC’s oversight of digital asset markets is not
only long-running but also battle-tested: in the 2022 fail-
ure of digital asset exchange operator FTX, while other
FTX trading platforms revealed a total $8.9 billion short-
fall in customer funds and went into bankruptcy, FTX’s
CFTC-regulated DCM, swap execution facility (‘‘SEF’’), and
[derivatives clearing organization] survived without any
loss of customer assets and remain in operation today
under new ownership.’’
Ryne Miller, Partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Former
General Counsel of FTX US, illustrated the vital nature of a com-
prehensive market structure framework to consumer protection at
the June 2025 HAC Hearing:
‘‘Had the regulatory structure provided for in the bill
currently being considered by this Committee and ulti-
mately Congress applied to FTX, the story I just told
would almost certainly have a much different ending. Ex-
aminations, governance requirements, audits, reporting,
recordkeeping, and customer asset segregation require-
ments directly address the shortfalls that have allowed
various digital asset industry failures and thefts to occur.’’

REGULATORY GAP
Currently, there is no comprehensive federal regulatory regime
for the cash or spot digital commodity markets. The Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA) and the CFTC regulations promulgated there-
under provide a comprehensive regulatory regime for the trading of
commodity derivatives, including digital commodity derivatives
(e.g., buying or selling Bitcoin futures contracts). This includes reg-
istration and regulatory requirements for exchanges and inter-
mediaries. Under the CEA, the CFTC also has ‘‘after-the- fact’’ en-
forcement jurisdiction over fraud and manipulation in the cash or
spot commodity markets (e.g., buying or selling a commodity, in-
cluding digital commodities, like Bitcoin). However, the CFTC has
no power to impose registration and regulatory requirements for
exchanges or intermediaries, or on market participants in the cash
or spot digital commodity markets. This lack of a comprehensive
federal regulatory framework for digital commodity cash or spot
transactions is referred to as the ‘‘spot market regulatory gap.’’
Daniel J. Davis, former General Counsel at the CFTC, explained
at the May 2025 Joint Roundtable that ‘‘neither the CFTC nor any
other federal regulator has plenary regulatory authority over the
trading of digital assets that qualify as commodities . . . there ap-
pears to be a significant gap at the federal level in the regulation
of spot digital assets.’’ At the June 2025 HAC Hearing, Mrs.
Pizzola, Partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, shared this
view, testifying ‘‘[t]hough the CFTC currently does not have ple-
nary regulatory authority over spot commodity markets, it has
anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority over such markets.’’
During the June 2025 HFSC Hearing, former CFTC Chairman
Behnam testified about the longstanding nature of the spot market
gap and its detrimental impact:
‘‘The principal objective of market structure legislation
. . . should be to provide regulatory oversight of the spot
market for digital asset tokens that are not securities.
That structural gap in our regulatory framework has led
to the high degree of fraud, manipulation and lack of in-
vestor protection, as well as rampant speculation, that has
characterized the digital asset sector to date. I have spo-
ken about this gap since shortly after I became chairman
of the [CFTC] in 2014 and we declared bitcoin to be a com-
modity.’’
COMMODITY VS. SECURITY
Under the Biden Administration, former SEC Chairman Gary
Gensler opined on numerous occasions that the ‘‘test to determine
whether a crypto asset is a security is clear.’’ However, SEC Com-
missioner Hester Peirce and former SEC Commissioner and Acting
Chairman Elad Roisman disagreed, citing requests the SEC re-
ceived for clarity and the consistent outreach to the Commission
staff for no-action and other relief. During Chairman Gensler’s ten-
ure at the SEC, Commissioner Peirce repeatedly emphasized her
concerns with the SEC’s enforcement-centric approach and high-
lighted the importance of regulatory clarity for the digital asset
markets.

Under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), the SEC has full regu-
latory authority over the offer, sale, and the trading of securities,
including investment contracts, and many security derivatives.
Under the federal securities laws, every offer and sale of securities
must be either registered with the SEC or conducted pursuant to
an exemption to registration.
Both the term ‘‘security’’ and the term ‘‘commodity’’ are broadly
defined in statute. The federal securities laws define the term ‘‘se-
curity’’ to include not only specific types of financial instruments,
such as stocks and bonds, but also several undefined terms, notably
‘‘investment contract.’’ The term ‘‘investment contract’’ captures
unique or novel instruments and arrangements, including many
utilized by digital asset projects which raised funds.
The CEA defines ‘‘commodity’’ broadly to include all ‘‘goods and
articles and all services, rights, and interests . . . in which con-
tracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.’’
In 2015, during the Obama Administration, the CFTC clarified
that bitcoin and certain other virtual currencies are commodities
under the CEA.
Because these legal definitions are broad and overlapping, the
boundary between a security and commodity can be unclear, and
it can be difficult to determine whether a digital asset is offered as
part of an investment contract or falls under the definition of com-
modity in the CEA. As Tiffany Smith, Partner at WilmerHale,
pointed out during the April 2025 HFSC Hearing, the SEC’s broad
interpretation of its authority has made determining the legal clas-
sification of digital asset difficult:
‘‘The term ‘digital assets’ has broadly been used by the
SEC to refer to ‘an asset that is issued and transferred
using distributed ledger or blockchain technology’ and in-
cludes virtual currency, coins, and tokens. The SEC also
used the term ‘crypto asset security’ to refer to digital as-
sets that meet the definition of ‘security’ under the federal
securities laws and that rely on cryptographic protocols.
Importantly, these broad terms combined with the expan-
sive past views of SEC officials that most digital assets are
offered and sold as securities, failed to distinguish between
different types of digital assets, including those that are
intended to be offered and sold as securities, like tokenized
securities and security tokens, versus assets that were not
intended to be offered and sold as securities, like many
other types of crypto assets.’’
Until there is a consistent, clear framework in place, market par-
ticipants, consumers, and investors will continue to seek regulatory
clarity given the requirements that stem from the classification of
a particular digital asset. This is a reality reiterated by Greg
Tusar, Vice President of Institutional Product of Coinbase Global,
Inc., during the May 2025 Joint Roundtable:
‘‘The root of the current regulatory confusion is token
classification . . . current frameworks fail to offer objective
criteria for determining how assets should be classified,
forcing developers and market participants to operate in
regulatory gray areas . . . the need for Congress to ad-

dress the issue of token classification is absolutely critical
to the healthy functioning of markets. The United States
needs a consistent framework for token classification that
reflects the unique qualities of digital assets whose value
and functionality is derived from a blockchain network,
and Congress has a critical role in bringing this about.’’
Similarly, Dr. Chris Brummer’s, Sesquicentennial Professor of Fi-
nancial Technology at Georgetown University Law Center, testi-
mony at the April 2025 HAC hearing echoed the need for a com-
prehensive digital asset market framework from Congress to define
jurisdiction:
‘‘In the course of my research, I asked the SEC on many
occasions to rethink and modernize its approach, like
many of you today. And I hoped and waited for the CFTC
to be empowered legislatively to do what it does best—to
innovate. But the SEC’s leadership had no interest, and
the CFTC was left wanting for basic powers over spot mar-
kets to be able to deliver on its end.’’
At the June 2025 HAC Hearing, Mrs. Pizzola, Partner at Willkie
Farr & Gallagher LLP, affirmed the CFTC’s experience and exper-
tise are best suited to fill this void:
‘‘The [CLARITY Act] applies many of the same remedies
that cured the problem in 2000, including a core principles
framework for digital commodity exchanges and a self-cer-
tification listing process. This flexible, adaptable frame-
work is particularly well-suited for the relatively novel and
constantly evolving nature of digital asset markets. There
is no better agency to implement such a regulatory frame-
work in furtherance of responsible innovation than the one
that has done so for the last twenty-five years, allowing
the markets under its jurisdiction to become by far the
largest, and the most vibrant and robust, of their kind in
the world.’’
INCOMPATIBILITY OF SECURITIES LAWS
Under the Biden Administration, many digital asset brokers and
dealers, and issuers, asserted that the SEC did not provide a viable
path for the registration of digital asset intermediaries and the of-
fering of securities. Moreover, the SEC’s regulations are heavily de-
pendent on the roles of intermediaries and therefore directly at
odds with transactions based on decentralized blockchain tech-
nology.
At the June 2025 HFSC Hearing, Elad Roisman, Partner at
Cravath and a former Commissioner and Acting Chairman of the
SEC, explained:
‘‘The primary challenge in regulating digital assets is
the reality that the existing federal securities statutory
and regulatory framework does not, in many cases, square-
ly address whether the many types of digital assets—with
varying characteristics—should be covered . . . As digital
assets have evolved, it has become clear that many of
these assets are unlike the traditional assets for which the

69
existing statutory and SEC regulatory frameworks were
designed.’’
Roisman further testified that ‘‘clarity has been sparse regarding
the status of market intermediaries and their ability to hold, trans-
act in, and act as custodian of digital asset securities.’’
During the May 2025 Joint Roundtable, Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro
Systems PBC, described his company’s experience attempt to raise
capital through one of the exempt offering pathways at the SEC:
‘‘We approached the SEC with the intention of com-
plying with the federal securities laws. To date, we have
spent well more than $15 million dollars on the offering
process, compliance with the reporting regime, and our de-
fense against an unwarranted investigation triggered by
our attempts to work with the Staff. That amount rep-
resents more than the entire amount raised through the
offering. Though we walked willingly into the SEC’s doors,
we were in many ways left with a competitive disadvan-
tage relative to other projects, especially those based out-
side the U.S. Based on our experience, I believe that there
is limited efficacy for existing registration and qualifica-
tion processes as a mechanism for a tailored disclosure re-
gime without significant substantive amendments.’’
At the April 2025 HFSC Hearing, Rodrigo Seira, Special Counsel
at Cooley LLP, highlighted the incompatibility of the SEC’s exist-
ing disclosure regime with digital assets and blockchain technology
testifying, ‘‘the current securities disclosure forms focus on irrele-
vant corporate and financial information while ignoring critical
crypto-specific aspects like governance mechanisms, network de-
sign, token omics, cybersecurity, and the network utility of the as-
sets. As a result, forcing crypto into the traditional securities dis-
closure regime is harmful to the very public securities laws are in-
tended to protect because it fails to provide purchasers with the
material information they need to determine the value and risks of
their crypto holdings.’’
At the same hearing, Ms. Smith, highlighted additional areas of
incompatibility between the digital asset ecosystem and the U.S.
securities laws:
‘‘My comments are focused on crypto assets that were
not initially offered and sold as securities. With respect to
these assets, there are many complex challenges to com-
plying with the federal securities laws, and I want to high-
light a few . . . securities intermediaries cannot offer or
sell crypto assets that were not sold in compliance with the
Securities Act, market structure for crypto differs from tra-
ditional securities, and custody practices for crypto assets
differ from traditional securities’’
Coy Garrison, former counsel to SEC Commissioner Hester
Peirce, testified at the April 2025 HAC Hearing, underscoring the
novel and contested application of current securities laws to the
digital asset marketplace perpetuated by the Biden Administration
SEC:
‘‘The SEC under Gary Gensler adopted a broad and
shifting interpretation suggesting that a digital asset em-

bodies an ‘investment contract’ in secondary market trans-
actions and went so far as to coin the term ‘crypto asset
security’ in court filings alleging that major centralized
spot market exchanges were operating as unregistered se-
curities exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies.
Multiple district courts reprimanded the agency for its
legal imprecision, with one court describing the label ‘‘un-
clear at best and confusing at worst.’’
Michael S. Piwowar, former SEC Commissioner and Acting
Chairman testified at the June 2025 HAC Hearing on the merits
of the CLARITY Act complementing existing securities laws while
tailoring them to digital assets:
‘‘The SEC’s experience striking the right balance of dis-
closures for investors, giving them just what they need—
not too much, not too little—to make informed investment
decisions to buy, sell, or hold securities, is exactly what is
needed in the digital asset markets. A similar consider-
ation for striking the right balance for issuers of securi-
ties—not too burdensome, not too sparse—is also what is
needed for capital-raising issuers of digital assets that fall
under the SEC’s jurisdiction.’’
The CLARITY Act establishes a critical role for the SEC to pro-
vide transparency for new digital commodity issuances. Like pri-
mary offerings of public companies, the SEC will ensure that inves-
tors have helpful information about primary offerings of digital as-
sets to make informed decisions. The CLARITY Act also recognizes
that meaningful information about the digital commodity issuer
changes over the maturation of the blockchain system. It provides
for a ratcheting down of disclosure requirements as the digital com-
modity issuer is no longer in control of the blockchain system and
eventually no longer a meaningful part of the development proc-
ess.’’
LASTING REGULATORY CLARITY
At the June 2025 HFSC Hearing, Katherine Minarik, Chief
Legal Officer at Uniswap Labs, underscored the need to change the
United States’ current approach to digital assets by enacting legis-
lation:
‘‘The absence of an initial legislative framework for dig-
ital asset and blockchain technology from Congress has al-
ready led to irreparable harm to America’s digital asset
and blockchain industry. What began as attempts to
stretch existing authority conferred to regulators to their
limits evolved quickly into conflicting interpretations of
those laws, refusals by some regulators to share their in-
terpretations of those laws before launching enforcement
actions, and even at times misrepresentations by regu-
latory agency lawyers in court leading to sanctions.
Against this backdrop of expansive enforcement investiga-
tion and actions against multiple American companies
building in good faith, other regulators took steps to cut off
these companies’ access to basic operational banking serv-
ices. It is no surprise that courts called for help from Con-

gress. And now Congressional action is necessary to put an
end to this chapter.’’
While the SEC has changed its approach under the current
Trump Administration, creating a Crypto Task Force, rescinding
and reviewing many of the previous rulemakings and guidance,
and changing its approach to enforcement, comprehensive market
structure legislation is needed to solve the most pressing issues fac-
ing the ecosystem.
At the April 2025 HFSC Hearing, Tiffany Smith, Partner at
WilmerHale, underscored the need for legislation to provide lasting
clarity to the digital asset ecosystem:
‘‘Because the jurisdiction of the SEC and other federal
agencies is limited, congressional intervention is necessary
to create a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework
for digital assets. In addition, Congress should consider
codifying guidance of the SEC and other agencies to create
regulatory certainty. As seen through recent actions, guid-
ance issued by agencies can be proposed and rescinded,
thus congressional action could provide more regulatory
certainty and consistency.
During the April 2025 HAC Hearing, Bill Hughes, Senior Coun-
sel and Director of Global Regulatory Matters of Consensys Soft-
ware Inc., emphasized that ‘‘durable clarity on the law is what we
need today to ensure we can capture the opportunities presented
by blockchain technology. What we can build is limited only by our
imagination and the law.’’
At the June 2025 HAC Hearing Ryne Miller, Partner at
Lowenstein Sandler LLP and former General Counsel of FTX US,
echoed these benefits of legislative clarity saying, ‘‘[a] federal
framework, especially one that preempts duplicative state regula-
tion, would level the playing field and bring clarity to innovators
and investors alike. It would allow regulators to concentrate exper-
tise and resources where they are most needed.’’
Under the Biden Administration, the SEC pursued enforcement
actions against entities in the digital asset market while failing to
develop comprehensive regulations that would bring digital asset
intermediaries under their jurisdiction. This approach led many en-
trepreneurs to warn against doing business in the United States
and advocate for digital asset companies to move offshore. Congress
must act to ensure that consumers have adequate protections and
developers can build and innovate in the United States for the fore-
seeable future.
THE COMMITTEE-REPORTED LEGISLATION
The House Agriculture Committee (HAC) and House Financial
Services Committee (HFSC) have worked toward establishing a
workable framework for digital assets over several congresses by
introducing bills, holding hearings and roundtables, and engaging
industry and federal agencies. In the 118th Congress, the HAC and
HFSC began a strong partnership to further their work and craft
comprehensive digital asset market structure legislation.
The Committees worked together throughout the 118th Congress
to draft legislation that sought to address some of the most press-
ing issues facing digital asset markets. The HFSC held three hear-

72
ings, and the HAC held two hearings. The Committees also held
a historic joint hearing. On July 20, 2023, HAC Chairman Thomp-
son introduced H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology
for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), with Representatives French Hill,
Dusty Johnson, Warren Davidson, and Tom Emmer as original co-
sponsors. The bill passed through both the HAC and HFSC and
passed the House Floor on a bipartisan basis by a recorded vote of
279–136.
Since the House passage of FIT21 during the 118th Congress,
the Committees have worked to refine and update the legislation.
At the start of the 119th Congress, HAC Chairman Thompson and
HFSC Chairman Hill published a blueprint for digital asset market
structure legislation, reaffirming their commitment to working to-
gether to provide clarity to the digital asset markets. The Commit-
tees received feedback from a range of stakeholders and worked to
refine and simplify FIT21. This work included two hearings in the
HAC and four hearings in the HFSC on digital asset market struc-
ture, as well as a joint public roundtable, to examine regulatory
gaps with respect to digital assets.
In the 119th Congress, the Committees have received testimony
regarding digital asset market structure from former CFTC Chair-
men Rostin Behnam and Timothy Massad, former SEC Commis-
sioners and Acting Chairmen Michael S. Piwowar and Elad
Roisman, other former government officials, legal experts in com-
modities and securities laws, and various digital asset ecosystem
participants, including trading platforms, digital asset projects, and
blockchain developers. Almost all witnesses testified that there is
a regulatory gap over the digital asset spot market and significant
ambiguity as to where digital assets fall between the SEC’s juris-
diction over securities and the CFTC’s jurisdiction over commodity
derivatives that must be addressed through legislation. Indeed,
rather than hiding from regulation, market participants called on
Congress to resolve the regulatory gap.
During the June 2025 HAC Hearing, Mr. Ryne Miller, Partner
at Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Former General Counsel of FTX
US, urged Congress to act, saying ‘‘[o]n the legislative side, I am
confident in suggesting to this Committee that the Digital Asset
Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act is good to go; it is ready. A decade
of legislative inaction in pursuit of perfection has already wrought
its damage.’’
The work of both Committees culminated in the release of a dis-
cussion draft of digital asset market structure legislation on May
5, 2025. The Committees revised the bill to address feedback from
federal agencies, market participants, and Members of Congress on
both sides of the aisle. The CLARITY Act was introduced on May
29, 2025. Finally, changes were made to the bill through amend-
ments, including comprehensive amendments in the nature of a
substitute, during each markup, which are reflected in this Report.
The Committee-reported bill addresses the issues that have
plagued the digital asset ecosystem and answers the calls for regu-
lation from various agencies and stakeholders by establishing a
comprehensive regulatory framework for the United States’s digital
asset markets.

of regulation of the offer and sale of digital commodities by the
SEC and the CFTC.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3633. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director

Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII and section 402 of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974, a cost estimate was not made available to the
Committee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of
the Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Con-
gressional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the

ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
TITLE I—DEFINITIONS; RULEMAKING; PROVISIONAL REGISTRATION
Sec. 101. Definitions under the Securities Act of 1933
Section 101 provides for definitions under the Securities Act of
1933.
Sec. 102. Definitions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 102 provides for definitions under the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934.
Sec. 103. Definitions under the Commodity Exchange Act

change Act.

Section 104 provides for definitions under the Act.
Sec. 105. Rulemakings
Section 105 provides for several rulemakings by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Ex-
change Commission (SEC), including joint rulemakings related to
defining key terms in the Act; the process to delist an asset for
trading under section 106 of the Act; mixed digital asset trans-
actions; and the process for considering relief for portfolio mar-
gining activities. It also requires the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to develop capital require-
ments for financial institutions that address netting agreements.
Section 105 also affirms the right for U.S. individuals to lawfully
custody and transact with their own digital assets.
Sec. 106. Provisional registration for digital commodity exchanges,
brokers, and dealers
Section 106 allows an entity seeking to become a digital com-
modity exchange, broker, or dealer to file a statement of provisional
registration with the CFTC. The entity filing the statement must
submit management and operating information and keep its books
and records open to the CFTC. Such entities must also maintain

membership in a registered futures association and comply with
rules regarding disclosures to customers and the treatment of cus-
tomer assets. Provisionally registered entities would be required to
implement requirements promulgated by the Commission as they
are finalized. After the CFTC has finalized its rules for digital com-
modity exchanges, digital commodity brokers, and digital com-
modity dealers, entities can no longer file a statement of provi-
sional registration. Finally, this section clarifies that the CFTC’s
exclusive jurisdiction over entities that are registered with the
Commission also extends to entities that are provisionally reg-
istered.
Sec. 107. Commodity Exchange Act and securities laws savings pro-
visions
Section 107 states that nothing in this Act shall apply to any
agreement, contract, or transaction that is subject to regulation
under the Commodity Exchange Act (including a futures contract,
options on a futures contract, swaps, securities futures products,
and certain leveraged transactions) or the securities laws as a secu-
rity-based swap, security futures product, or option on a security.
It also clarifies that registration as a digital commodity exchange,
digital commodity broker, or digital commodity dealer does not au-
thorize a person to engage in the aforementioned activities.
Sec. 108. Administrative requirements
Section 108 expands the provisions in the Commodity Exchange
Act regarding the improper use of nonpublic information by govern-
ment employees to include the trading of digital commodities.
Sec. 109. International cooperation
Section 109 requires the CFTC and SEC to coordinate with for-
eign regulators to promote consistent international standards for
digital asset market regulation. It also allows the agencies to enter
into information-sharing arrangements with foreign counterparts,
as appropriate, in the public interest or to protect investors, cus-
tomers, and users of digital assets.
Sec. 110 Treatment of certain non-controlling blockchain developers
Section 110 exempts non-controlling blockchain developers and
blockchain service providers from being treated as money transmit-
ters or engaged in money transmission or being subject to obliga-
tions substantially similar to those applicable to money transmit-
ters solely on the basis of providing certain infrastructure or serv-
ices.
Sec. 111. Application of the Bank Secrecy Act
Section 111 treats digital commodity brokers and dealers, as well
as exchanges that permit direct customer access, as ‘‘financial insti-
tutions’’ under the Bank Secrecy Act.
Sec. 112. Implementation
Section 112 requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate all
rules required by the Act no later than 360 days after enactment
of the Act.

TITLE II—OFFERS AND SALES OF DIGITAL COMMODITIES
Sec. 201. Treatment of investment contract assets
Section 201 excludes digital commodities sold pursuant to an in-
vestment contract from being considered investment contracts
themselves.
Sec. 202. Exempted primary transactions in digital commodities
Section 202 provides an exemption for a digital commodity
issuer’s offer or sale of an investment contract involving digital
commodities that meets certain conditions related to the blockchain
system and the sale and satisfies disclosure requirements. Issuers
are required to file disclosures until a defined period after the
blockchain system is certified as mature, as well as other disclo-
sures where the issuer is engaged in certain material activities
after the blockchain system is certified as mature. While creating
a new exemption, this section does not prohibit the SEC from cre-
ating other exemptions or modifying existing exemptions. Section
202 requires the SEC to issue rules applying certain comparable
disclosures to digital commodity issuers that relied on exemptions
to offer or sell investment contracts involving digital commodities
prior to the act, as well as relying on other exemptions following
the enactment of the act.
Sec. 203. Treatment of secondary transactions in digital commod-
ities that originally involved Investment Contracts
Section 203 provides that secondary market transactions in dig-
ital commodities originally issued as part of an investment contract
shall not be considered part of the original investment contract
transaction under securities laws.
Sec. 204. Requirements for offers and sales of digital commodities
by digital commodity related persons and digital commodity af-
filiated persons
Section 204 establishes requirements for project insiders to sell
their digital commodities. Those requirements taper down after
blockchain system of the digital commodity is certified as mature.
The requirements include lockup periods and limitations on sales
volumes. The SEC is provided with rulemaking authority related to
reporting obligations of insiders with respect to transactions in dig-
ital commodities. Section 204 also clarifies the treatment of sec-
ondary market sales by insiders who acquired digital commodities
prior to the enactment of the act.
Sec. 205. Mature blockchain system requirements
Section 205 provides a process for a digital commodity issuer, re-
lated person, affiliated person, or decentralized governance system
to certify to the SEC that the blockchain system relating to a dig-
ital commodity is mature. The SEC may issue rules identifying con-
ditions by which a blockchain system can be considered mature.
Section 205 also sets out statutory conditions blockchain system
can meet to be deemed mature.

Sec. 206. Effective date
Section 206 provides that the provisions under this Title will
take effect 360 days after enactment or, in the case of rulemakings
under the Title, the later of 360 days after enactment or 60 days
after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.
TITLE III—REGISTRATION FOR INTERMEDIARIES AT THE SEC
Sec. 301. Treatment of digital commodities and permitted payment
stablecoins
Section 301 excludes digital commodities and permitted payment
stablecoins from the definition of a security under the securities
laws.
Sec. 302. Anti-fraud authority over permitted payment stablecoins
and certain digital commodity transactions
Section 302 provides the SEC with anti-fraud and anti-manipula-
tion authority over transactions with or involving permitted pay-
ment stablecoins and digital commodities that occur on or with an
SEC registered entity. It also provides the SEC with limited au-
thority over transactions in permitted payment stablecoins when
transacted by or through an entity registered with the SEC.
Sec. 303. Eligibility of alternative trading systems
Section 303 prevents the SEC from blocking a trading platform
from operating under an exemption solely because it trades digital
commodities or permitted payment stablecoins and securities. The
section also provides that an alternative trading system (ATS) pri-
marily facilitating the trading of digital commodities, permitted
payment stablecoins, or both is not to be considered a facility of a
national securities exchange.
Sec. 304. Operation of alternative trading systems
Section 304 gives the SEC jurisdiction over digital commodity ac-
tivities by SEC registered broker-dealers and alternative trading
systems (ATS), including where such an ATS is operated by a na-
tional securities exchange or affiliate thereof, where such reg-
istrants are exempt from registration with the CFTC.
Section 304 directs the SEC to revise existing regulations to
allow national securities exchanges, or affiliates thereof, and
broker-dealers that are exempt from registration with the CFTC to
operate ATSs for digital commodities and permitted payment
stablecoins. The SEC may establish additional rules for such sys-
tems.
Sec. 305. Modernization of recordkeeping requirements
Section 305 clarifies that brokers, dealers, transfer agents, in-
vestment advisers, investment companies, and national securities
exchanges under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may consider
blockchains for purposes of books and records requirements. The
section also requires the SEC to issue and revise its rules in ac-
cordance with this section within 180 days of enactment.

Sec. 306. Exemptive authority
Section 306 amends the Securities Act of 1933 allowing flexibility
for the SEC to utilize its existing exemptive authorities.
Sec. 307. Additional registrations with the commodity futures trad-
ing commission
Section 307 permits a SEC registered broker or dealer to main-
tain a registration with the CFTC as a digital commodity broker
or dealer in order to list or trade contracts of sale for digital com-
modities.
Sec. 308. Exempting digital commodities from state securities laws
Section 308 adds digital commodities to ‘‘covered securities,’’
which are exempt from state blue sky law registration require-
ments.
Sec. 309. Exclusion for decentralized finance activities
Section 309 exempts certain decentralized finance activities re-
lated to the operation and maintenance of blockchain networks
from SEC regulation, although not from the Commission’s anti-
fraud or anti-manipulation enforcement authorities. Decentralized
finance activities include validating or providing incidental services
with respect to a digital asset, providing user-interfaces for a
blockchain network, publishing and updating software, or devel-
oping wallets for blockchain networks.
Sec. 310. Treatment of custody activities by banking institutions
Section 310 prevents federal regulators from imposing require-
ments on financial institutions to include customers’ assets as li-
abilities on their balance sheets or from holding additional capital
against these assets, except as necessary to mitigate against oper-
ational risks as determined by the appropriate federal or state reg-
ulator.
Sec. 311. Broker and dealer disclosures regarding the treatment of
assets
Section 311 requires the SEC to adopt rules for mandating clear,
written disclosures from brokers and dealers about the treatment
of digital commodities, permitted payment stablecoins, or invest-
ment contracts involving digital commodities in the event of an in-
solvency, resolution, or liquidation.
Sec. 312. Digital commodity activities that are financial in nature
Section 312 narrowly amends the Bank Holding Company Act to
allow non-bank subsidiaries of holding companies (e.g., digital com-
modity brokers or dealers) to engage in digital commodity activities
by adding such activities to the list of those that are financial in
nature. It also allows national banks to use digital assets or
blockchain systems to conduct activities that they are already le-
gally authorized to perform and clarifies that using such technology
does not exempt national banks from any existing regulatory re-
quirements that apply regardless of the technology used. For pur-
poses of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, digital asset and
blockchain system activities authorized for national banks that are

principal activities are permissible for insured state banks and
their subsidiaries.
Sec. 313. Effective Date; administration
Section 313 provides that the provisions under Title III will take
effect 360 days after enactment or, in the case of rulemakings
under the Title, the later of 360 days after enactment or 60 days
after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.
Sec. 314. Studies on foreign adversary participation
Section 314 requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in consulta-
tion with the CFTC and the SEC, to conduct a study and submit
a report to the relevant congressional committees within a year of
enactment on the involvement of governments of foreign adver-
saries in digital commodity markets and digital commodity reg-
istrants. The Comptroller General is required to conduct the same
study and submit the same report to the relevant congressional
committees.
TITLE IV—REGISTRATION FOR DIGITAL COMMODITY INTERMEDIARIES
AT THE CFTC
Sec. 401. Commission jurisdiction over digital commodity trans-
actions
Section 401 sets out the new authority of the CFTC over certain
transactions in digital assets. Specifically, the section provides the
Commission with exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over digital com-
modity cash or spot markets that occur on or with new CFTC reg-
istered entities created in this Act: Digital Commodity Exchanges,
Digital Commodity Dealers, and Digital Commodity Brokers. This
new authority complements the Commission’s existing anti-fraud
and anti-manipulation authority over all cash or spot market com-
modity transactions, including cash or spot market transactions in
digital assets. This section also permits digital commodity brokers
to engage in financing agreements for digital commodities with
their customers.
Lastly, this section provides the CFTC with authority over trans-
actions with or involving a permitted payment stablecoin that oc-
curs on or with a CFTC registered entity. Section 401 prohibits the
CFTC from implementing a rule or regulation, imposing a require-
ment or obligation on a registered entity or other entity registered
with the CFTC, or imposing a requirement or obligation on a per-
mitted payment stablecoin issuer regarding the operation of a per-
mitted payment stablecoin issuer or a permitted payment
stablecoin.
Sec. 402. Requiring futures commission merchants to use qualified
digital asset custodians
Section 402 requires futures commission merchants to hold cus-
tomers’ digital assets in a qualified digital asset custodian.
Sec. 403. Trading certification and approval for digital commodities
Section 403 establishes the process by which a registered entity
may determine that digital commodities are eligible to be traded on
or through entities registered with the CFTC. The process requires

a registered entity to submit a certification to the CFTC that the
digital commodity meets the requirements of the Commodity Ex-
change Act, including the listing requirements under section 404 of
this Act. The CFTC then has up to 80 days to review the certifi-
cation for its accuracy, completeness, and veracity.
Section 403 also provides that a digital commodity exchange,
broker, or dealer applying for CFTC registration may seek prior ap-
proval to list or offer certain digital commodities when registered
with the CFTC.
Sec. 404. Registration of digital commodity exchanges
Section 404 provides for the registration and regulation of digital
commodity exchanges. Registered digital commodity exchanges
must comply with core principles that include listing standards,
trade surveillance, capital, conflicts of interest, reporting, and sys-
tem safeguards. Subject to the core principles, digital commodity
exchanges are allowed to list only those digital commodities for
which the issuer is in compliance with the disclosure requirements
and for which they have made public disclosures regarding source
code, transaction history, and digital asset economics.
Digital commodity exchanges are also subject to comprehensive
requirements to segregate customer funds, provide risk-appropriate
disclosures to retail customers, designate a chief compliance officer,
be members of a registered futures association if they hold cus-
tomer funds, and comply with any rules the registered futures as-
sociation imposes.
Digital commodity exchanges that accept customer funds are re-
quired to hold those funds in a qualified digital asset custodian.
No digital commodity exchange or affiliate of the exchange is per-
mitted to act as a counterparty to any transaction on the exchange,
except in limited circumstances. And finally, a digital commodity
exchange customer may elect, in writing, to participate in any
blockchain services facilitated by the exchange, such as staking,
subject to the requirements and limitations imposed by the CFTC.
A customer’s access to the exchange is not permitted to be condi-
tioned on the customer’s election to participate in blockchain serv-
ices.
Sec. 405. Qualified digital asset custodians
Section 405 sets out the requirements for qualified digital asset
custodians. Qualified digital asset custodians are subject to ade-
quate supervision and appropriate regulation by certain federal,
state, or foreign authorities. Section 405 provides the CFTC author-
ity to further define minimum standards for adequate supervision
and appropriate regulation and to provide rules for CFTC reg-
istered entities to custody digital assets.
Sec. 406. Registration and regulation of digital commodity brokers
and dealers
Section 406 creates a comprehensive federal regulatory frame-
work under the Commodity Exchange Act for the registration, over-
sight, and supervision of digital commodity brokers and dealers. It
requires these firms to register with the CFTC, meet capital and
risk management requirements, and comply with recordkeeping,
reporting, business conduct, and customer protection standards.

Firms engaged in financing agreements must meet additional re-
quirements including capital, disclosure, recordkeeping, and super-
vision of employees and agents in connection with such financing
agreements.
Customer funds held by a digital commodity broker or dealer are
subject to comprehensive segregation and commingling restrictions.
They are also required to be held in a qualified digital asset custo-
dian. A customer of a digital commodity broker or dealer may elect,
in writing, to participate in any blockchain services facilitated by
the broker or dealer, such as staking, subject to the requirements
and limitations imposed by the CFTC. A digital commodity broker
or dealer may not condition a customer’s access to their services on
the customer’s election to participate in blockchain services. In ad-
dition, digital commodity brokers and dealers are required to be
members of a registered futures association and comply with any
additional rules they impose.
Sec. 407. Registration of associated persons
Section 407 requires associated persons of digital commodity bro-
kers and dealers to register with the CFTC and makes it unlawful
for digital commodity brokers and dealers to permit persons to be-
come or remain an associated person if the broker-dealer knew or
should have known that the person was not registered with the
CFTC or their registration was expired, suspended, or revoked.
Sec. 408. Registration of commodity pool operators and commodity
trading advisors
Section 408 codifies the treatment of certain commodity pool op-
erators (CPOs) dually registered with the SEC as investment advi-
sors to match the statutory treatment granted to certain dually
registered commodity trading advisors. Section 408 also requires
the CFTC to issue rules providing exemptions for CPOs and com-
modity trading advisors to provide relief from duplicative, con-
flicting, or unduly burdensome requirements or to promote innova-
tion, if those exemptions foster the development of fair and orderly
markets, are in the public interest, and are consistent with the pro-

Sec. 409. Exclusion for decentralized finance activities

fraud or anti-manipulation enforcement authorities. Exempted ac-
tivities include validating or providing incidental services with re-
spect to a digital commodity, providing user-interfaces for a

this section sunset after four fiscal years.
Sec. 411. Digital commodity activities by SEC-registered entities
Section 411 creates an exemption from CFTC registration for cer-
tain SEC-regulated entities engaged in limited digital commodity
activities. Specifically, alternative trading systems and registered
brokers or dealers can avoid duplicative CFTC registration by sub-
mitting a notice, operating within defined trading or revenue lim-
its, and complying with applicable SEC regulations.
Sec. 412. Requirements related to control persons

defined as any individual or group with unilateral control over the
system’s rules or with significant voting power.
Sec. 413. Effective date
Section 413 provides that the provisions under this Title will
take effect 360 days after enactment or, in the case of rulemakings

digital commodity, on any spot market.
TITLE V—INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS
Sec. 501. Findings; sense of Congress
Section 501 expresses support for U.S. leadership in digital as-
sets and reaffirms that Congress should establish a functional

as an information source for the CFTC on financial technology
(FinTech) innovation. It will ensure the CFTC is more accessible to
FinTech innovators and bolster the CFTC’s understanding of new

(DeFi), which will include an analysis of the size, scope, role, na-
ture, and use of DeFi protocols; the benefits and risks of DeFi; how
DeFi has integrated into the traditional financial markets, includ-
ing the risks of DeFi integration; and the levels and types of illicit
activities in DeFi compared to traditional financial markets. The
agencies must submit a report to Congress one year after enact-
ment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall also con-
duct a report on DeFi and submit it to Congress one year after en-
actment.

gage in financial transactions in a self-directed manner such that
no third-party intermediary effectuates such transactions or takes
custody of a user’s digital assets during any part of such trans-
action.

The agencies must submit the report to Congress one year after en-
actment.

SEC. 3. (a) When used in this title, unless the context otherwise
requires—
(1) The term ‘‘exchange’’ means any organization, associa-
tion, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincor-
porated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market
place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers
of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securi-
ties the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as
that term is generally understood, and includes the market
place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.
(2) The term ‘‘facility’’ when used with respect to an ex-
change includes its premises, tangible or intangible property
whether on the premises or not, any right to the use of such
premises or property or any service thereof for the purpose of
effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange (including,
among other things, any system of communication to or from
the exchange, by ticker or otherwise, maintained by or with
the consent of the exchange), and any right of the exchange to
the use of any property or service. An alternative trading sys-
tem primarily facilitating the trading of digital commodities,
permitted payment stablecoins, or both, is not a ‘‘facility’’ of an
exchange.

security, or to report any such transaction, unless such exchange
(1) is registered as a national securities exchange under section 6
of this title, or (2) is exempted from such registration upon applica-

rule by the exchange and that are designed to protect
dissenting limited partners;

est in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited

the exchange, except that for purposes of an exchange or ten-
der offer, such person shall file an objection in writing under
the rules of the exchange during the period during which the

(10)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit any member that
is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under sec-

uncontested election of a member of the board of directors of
any investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b–1 et seq.).
(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit
a national securities exchange from prohibiting a member that
is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under sec-
tion 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connection
with a shareholder vote not described in subparagraph (A).
(c)(1) A national securities exchange shall deny membership to

Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors shall, deny mem-
bership to any registered broker or dealer or natural person associ-
ated with a registered broker or dealer, and bar from becoming as-
sociated with a member any person, who is subject to a statutory
disqualification. A national securities exchange shall file notice
with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting
any person to membership or permitting any person to become as-
sociated with a member, if the exchange knew, or in the exercise
of reasonable care should have known, that such person was sub-
ject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form
and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may pre-
scribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors.
(3)(A) A national securities exchange may deny membership to,
or condition the membership of, a registered broker or dealer if (i)
such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of financial re-
sponsibility or operational capability or such broker or dealer or
any natural person associated with such broker or dealer does not
meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are
prescribed by the rules of the exchange or (ii) such broker or dealer
or person associated with such broker or dealer has engaged and
there is a reasonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or
practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A
national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifica-
tions of an applicant to become a member and the natural persons
associated with such an applicant in accordance with procedures
established by the rules of the exchange.
(B) A national securities exchange may bar a natural person
from becoming a member or associated with a member, or condition
the membership of a natural person or association of a natural per-
son with a member, if such natural person (i) does not meet such
standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed
by the rules of the exchange or (ii) has engaged and there is a rea-
sonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or practices incon-
sistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A national secu-
rities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an ap-
plicant to become a person associated with a member in accordance
with procedures established by the rules of the exchange and re-
quire any person associated with a member, or any class of such

cedures so established.
(C) A national securities exchange may bar any person from be-
coming associated with a member if such person does not agree (i)
to supply the exchange with such information with respect to its
relationship and dealings with the member as may be specified in
the rules of the exchange and (ii) to permit the examination of its
books and records to verify the accuracy of any information so sup-
plied.
(4) A national securities exchange may limit (A) the number of
members of the exchange and (B) the number of members and des-
ignated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions
on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person
acting as broker: Provided, however, That no national securities ex-
change shall have the authority to decrease the number of member-
ships in such exchange, or the number of members and designated
representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of such exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, below such number in effect on May 1, 1975, or the date
such exchange was registered with the Commission, whichever is
later: And provided further, That the Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of section 19(c) of this title, may amend the
rules of any national securities exchange to increase (but not to de-
crease) or to remove any limitation on the number of memberships
in such exchange or the number of members or designated rep-
resentatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, if the Commission finds that such limitation imposes a
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of this title.
(d)(1) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to de-
termine whether a member or person associated with a member
should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant
to paragraph (3) of this subsection), the exchange shall bring spe-
cific charges, notify such member or person of, and give him an op-
portunity to defend against, such charges, and keep a record. A de-
termination by the exchange to impose a disciplinary sanction shall
be supported by a statement setting forth—
(A) any act or practice in which such member or person asso-
ciated with a member has been found to have engaged, or
which such member or person has been found to have omitted;
(B) the specific provision of this title, the rules or regulations
thereunder, or the rules of the exchange which any such act or
practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and
(C) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.
(2) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to deter-
mine whether a person shall be denied membership, barred from
becoming associated with a member, or prohibited or limited with
respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member
thereof (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to paragraph
(3) of this subsection), the exchange shall notify such person of, and
give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for
denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation under consideration and
keep a record. A determination by the exchange to deny member-
ship, bar a person from becoming associated with a member, or

prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services offered
by the exchange or a member thereof shall be supported by a state-
ment setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial, bar, or
prohibition or limitation is based.
(3) A national securities exchange may summarily (A) suspend a
member or person associated with a member who has been and is
expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization or
barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any
self-regulatory organization, (B) suspend a member who is in such
financial or operating difficulty that the exchange determines and
so notifies the Commission that the member cannot be permitted
to continue to do business as a member with safety to investors,
creditors, other members, or the exchange, or (C) limit or prohibit
any person with respect to access to services offered by the ex-
change if subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph is applicable
to such person or, in the case of a person who is not a member,
if the exchange determines that such person does not meet the
qualification requirements or other prerequisites for such access
and such person cannot be permitted to continue to have such ac-
cess with safety to investors, creditors, members, or the exchange.
Any person aggrieved by any such summary action shall be
promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the exchange in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this sub-
section. The Commission, by order, may stay any such summary
action on its own motion or upon application by any person ag-
grieved thereby, if the Commission determines summarily or after
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist sole-
ly of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments)
that such stay is consistent with the public interest and the protec-
tion of investors.
(e)(1) On and after the date of enactment of the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1975, no national securities exchange may impose
any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or
other fees to be charged by its members: Provided, however, That
until May 1, 1976, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall
not prohibit any such exchange from imposing or fixing any sched-
ule of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be
charged by its members for acting as broker on the floor of the ex-
change or as odd-lot dealer: And provided further, That the Com-
mission, in accordance with the provisions of section 19(b) of this
title as modified by the provisions of paragraph (3) of this sub-
section, may—
(A) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose
a reasonable schedule or fix reasonable rates of commissions,
allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its mem-
bers for effecting transactions on such exchange prior to No-
vember 1, 1976, if the Commission finds that such schedule or
fixed rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees
are in the public interest; and
(B) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose
a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts,
or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting trans-
actions on such exchange after November 1, 1976, if the Com-
mission finds that such schedule or fixed rates of commissions,
allowances, discounts, or other fees (i) are reasonable in rela-

are charged (and the Commission publishes the standards em-
ployed in adjudging reasonableness) and (ii) do not impose any
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in further-
ance of the purposes of this title, taking into consideration the
competitive effects of permitting such schedule or fixed rates
weighed against the competitive effects of other lawful actions
which the Commission is authorized to take under this title.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19(c) of this title,
the Commission, by rule, may abrogate any exchange rule which
imposes a schedule or fixes rates of commissions, allowances, dis-
counts, or other fees, if the Commission determines that such
schedule or fixed rates are no longer reasonable, in the public in-
terest, or necessary to accomplish the purposes of this title.
(3)(A) Before approving or disapproving any proposed rule change
submitted by a national securities exchange which would impose a
schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other
fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such
exchange, the Commission shall afford interested persons (i) an op-
portunity for oral presentation of data, views, and arguments and
(ii) with respect to any such rule concerning transactions effected
after November 1, 1976, if the Commission determines there are
disputed issues of material fact, to present such rebuttal submis-
sions and to conduct (or have conducted under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph) such cross-examination as the Commission deter-
mines to be appropriate and required for full disclosure and proper
resolution of such disputed issues of material fact.
(B) The Commission shall prescribe rules and make rulings con-
cerning any proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph designed to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such rules
or rulings may (i) impose reasonable time limits on each interested
person’s oral presentations, and (ii) require any cross-examination
to which a person may be entitled under subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph to be conducted by the Commission on behalf of that
person in such manner as the Commission determines to be appro-
priate and required for full disclosure and proper resolution of dis-
puted issues of material fact.
(C)(i) If any class of persons, the members of which are entitled
to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination under subpara-
graphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph and which have, in the view
of the Commission, the same or similar interests in the proceeding,
cannot agree upon a single representative of such interests for pur-
poses of cross-examination, the Commission may make rules and
rulings specifying the manner in which such interests shall be rep-
resented and such cross-examination conducted.
(ii) No member of any class of persons with respect to which the
Commission has specified the manner in which its interests shall
be represented pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be
denied, pursuant to such clause (i), the opportunity to conduct (or
have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting his par-
ticular interests if he satisfies the Commission that he has made
a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement upon group
representation and there are substantial and relevant issues which
would not be presented adequately by group representation.

SEC. 12. (a) It shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or deal-
er to effect any transaction in any security (other than an exempt-
ed security) on a national securities exchange unless a registration

of a security futures product traded on a national securities ex-
change.

change by the issuer filing an application with the exchange (and
filing with the Commission such duplicate originals thereof as the
Commission may require), which application shall contain—
(1) Such information, in such detail, as to the issuer and any
person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or
under direct or indirect common control with, the issuer, and
any guarantor of the security as to principal or interest or
both, as the Commission may by rules and regulations require,
as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the

(A) the organization, financial structures, and nature of
the business;
(B) the terms, position, rights, and privileges of the dif-
ferent classes of securities outstanding;

fiscal years, certified if required by the rules and regula-
tions of the Commission by a registered public accounting
firm;
(K) profit and loss statements for not more than the
three preceding fiscal years, certified if required by the
rules and regulations of the Commission by a registered
public accounting firm; and
(L) any further financial statements which the Commis-
sion may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection

issuer as the Commission may require as necessary or appro-
priate for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair
dealing in the security.
(3) Such copies of material contracts, referred to in para-
graph (1)(I) above, as the Commission may require as nec-
essary or appropriate for the proper protection of investors and
to insure fair dealing in the security.
(c) If in the judgment of the Commission any information re-
quired under subsection (b) of this section is inapplicable to any
specified class or classes of issuers, the Commission shall require
in lieu thereof the submission of such other information of com-
parable character as it may deem applicable to such class of

security has been approved by the exchange for listing and reg-
istration, the registration shall become effective thirty days after
the receipt of such certification by the Commission or within such
shorter period of time as the Commission may determine. A secu-
rity registered with a national securities exchange may be with-
drawn or stricken from listing and registration in accordance with
the rules of the exchange and, upon such terms as the Commission
may deem necessary to impose for the protection of investors, upon
application by the issuer or the exchange to the Commission;
whereupon the issuer shall be relieved from further compliance
with the provisions of this section and section 13 of this title and
any rules or regulations under such sections as to the securities so
withdrawn or stricken. An unissued security may be registered
only in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commis-
sion may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public inter-
est or for the protection of investors.

comes effective, to be registered for a period ending not later than
July 1, 1935, without complying with the provisions of this section.
(f)(1)(A) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this sec-
tion, any national securities exchange, in accordance with the re-
quirements of this subsection and the rules hereunder, may extend
unlisted trading privileges to—
(i) any security that is listed and registered on a national se-
curities exchange, subject to subparagraph (B); and
(ii) any security that is otherwise registered pursuant to this
section, or that would be required to be so registered except for
the exemption from registration provided in subparagraph (B)
or (G) of subsection (g)(2), subject to subparagraph (E) of this
paragraph.
(B) A national securities exchange may not extend unlisted trad-
ing privileges to a security described in subparagraph (A)(i) during
such interval, if any, after the commencement of an initial public
offering of such security, as is or may be required pursuant to sub-
paragraph (C).
(C) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the
Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994, the Commission shall pre-
scribe, by rule or regulation, the duration of the interval referred
to in subparagraph (B), if any, as the Commission determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, or oth-
erwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. Until the earlier
of the effective date of such rule or regulation or 240 days after
such date of enactment, such interval shall begin at the opening of
trading on the day on which such security commences trading on
the national securities exchange with which such security is reg-
istered and end at the conclusion of the next day of trading.
(D) The Commission may prescribe, by rule or regulation such
additional procedures or requirements for extending unlisted trad-
ing privileges to any security as the Commission deems necessary
or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the
protection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(E) No extension of unlisted trading privileges to securities de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(ii) may occur except pursuant to a
rule, regulation, or order of the Commission approving such exten-
sion or extensions. In promulgating such rule or regulation or in
issuing such order, the Commission—
(i) shall find that such extension or extensions of unlisted
trading privileges is consistent with the maintenance of fair
and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public
interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title;
(ii) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
securities, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such securities, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to extend
unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule of such
national securities exchange would unreasonably impair the

ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such secu-
rities for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict com-
petition among dealers in such securities or between such deal-
ers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists
and such dealers who are not specialists.
(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and
the subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for eligi-
bility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations
issued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that
unlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities
which had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964,
notwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If un-
listed trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to
this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that secu-
rity, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.
(G) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a security is the subject of an initial public offering if—
(I) the offering of the subject security is registered under
the Securities Act of 1933; and
(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to filing
the registration statement with respect to the offering, was
not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or
15(d) of this title; and
(ii) an initial public offering of such security commences at
the opening of trading on the day on which such security com-
mences trading on the national securities exchange with which
such security is registered.
(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading
on an exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privi-
leges, the Commission may summarily suspend such unlisted trad-
ing privileges on the exchange. Such suspension shall not be re-
viewable under section 25 of this title and shall not be deemed to
be a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code. Upon such suspension—
(i) the exchange shall cease trading in the security by the
close of business on the date of such suspension, or at such
time as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order for the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of this title; and
(ii) if the exchange seeks to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges to the security, the exchange shall file an application to
reinstate its ability to do so with the Commission pursuant to
such procedures as the Commission may prescribe by rule or
order for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the pro-
tection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(B) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect
until the Commission, by order, grants approval of an application
to reinstate, as described in subparagraph (A)(ii).
(C) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall not affect the va-
lidity or force of an extension of unlisted trading privileges in effect
prior to such suspension.

(D) The Commission shall not approve an application by a na-
tional securities exchange to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted
trading privileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted
trading privileges pursuant to such application is consistent with
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of this title. If the application is made to reinstate un-
listed trading privileges to a security described in paragraph
(1)(A)(ii), the Commission—
(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
security, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such a security, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the na-
tional securities exchange making application under this sub-
section would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to so-
licit or effect transactions in such security for its own account,
or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in
such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of
marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers who are
not specialists.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Commission shall by
rules and regulations suspend unlisted trading privileges in whole
or in part for any or all classes of securities for a period not exceed-
ing twelve months, if it deems such suspension necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or to
prevent evasion of the purposes of this title.
(4) On the application of the issuer of any security for which un-
listed trading privileges on any exchange have been continued or
extended pursuant to this subsection, or of any broker or dealer
who makes or creates a market for such security, or of any other
person having a bona fide interest in the question of termination
or suspension of such unlisted trading privileges, or on its own mo-
tion, the Commission shall by order terminate, or suspend for a pe-
riod not exceeding twelve months, such unlisted trading privileges
for such security if the Commission finds, after appropriate notice
and opportunity for hearing, that such termination or suspension
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors.
(5) In any proceeding under this subsection in which appropriate
notice and opportunity for hearing are required, notice of not less
than ten days to the applicant in such proceeding, to the issuer of
the security involved, to the exchange which is seeking to continue
or extend or has continued or extended unlisted trading privileges
for such security, and to the exchange, if any, on which such secu-
rity is listed and registered, shall be deemed adequate notice, and
any broker or dealer who makes or creates a market for such secu-
rity, and any other person having a bona fide interest in such pro-
ceeding, shall upon application be entitled to be heard.
(6) Any security for which unlisted trading privileges are contin-
ued or extended pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be
registered on a national securities exchange within the meaning of

this title. The powers and duties of the Commission under this title
shall be applicable to the rules of an exchange in respect to any
such security. The Commission may, by such rules and regulations
as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors, either unconditionally or upon specified
terms and conditions, or for stated periods, exempt such securities
from the operation of any provision of section 13, 14, or 16 of this
title.
(g)(1) Every issuer which is engaged in interstate commerce, or
in a business affecting interstate commerce, or whose securities are
traded by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce shall—
(A) within 120 days after the last day of its first fiscal year
ended on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by either—
(i) 2,000 persons, or
(ii) 500 persons who are not accredited investors (as such
term is defined by the Commission), and
(B) in the case of an issuer that is a bank, a savings and
loan holding company (as defined in section 10 of the Home
Owners’ Loan Act), or a bank holding company, as such term
is defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), not later than 120 days after the last
day of its first fiscal year ended after the effective date of this
subsection, on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons,
register such security by filing with the Commission a registration
statement (and such copies thereof as the Commission may require)
with respect to such security containing such information and docu-
ments as the Commission may specify comparable to that which is
required in an application to register a security pursuant to sub-
section (b) of this section. Each such registration statement shall
become effective sixty days after filing with the Commission or
within such shorter period as the Commission may direct. Until
such registration statement becomes effective it shall not be
deemed filed for the purposes of section 18 of this title. Any issuer
may register any class of equity security not required to be reg-
istered by filing a registration statement pursuant to the provisions
of this paragraph. The Commission is authorized to extend the date
upon which any issuer or class of issuers is required to register a
security pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in respect
of—
(A) any security listed and registered on a national securities
exchange.
(B) any security issued by an investment company registered
pursuant to section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
(C) any security, other than permanent stock, guaranty
stock, permanent reserve stock, or any similar certificate evi-
dencing nonwithdrawable capital, issued by a savings and loan

purposes than cooperative associations so defined.
(F) any security issued by a mutual or cooperative organiza-
tion which supplies a commodity or service primarily for the

sons who purchase commodities or services from the issuer, the
security is transferable only to a successor in interest or occu-
pancy of premises serviced or to be served by the issuer, and
no dividends are payable to the holder of the security.
(G) any security issued by an insurance company if all of the
following conditions are met:
(i) Such insurance company is required to and does file
an annual statement with the Commissioner of Insurance
(or other officer or agency performing a similar function)
of its domiciliary State, and such annual statement con-
forms to that prescribed by the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners or in the determination of such
State commissioner, officer or agency substantially con-
forms to that so prescribed.
(ii) Such insurance company is subject to regulation by
its domiciliary State of proxies, consents, or authorizations
in respect of securities issued by such company and such
regulation conforms to that prescribed by the National As-
sociation of Insurance Commissioners.
(iii) After July 1, 1966, the purchase and sales of securi-
ties issued by such insurance company by beneficial own-
ers, directors, or officers of such company are subject to

(3) The Commission may by rules or regulations or, on its own
motion, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, exempt
from this subsection any security of a foreign issuer, including any
certificate of deposit for such a security, if the Commission finds
that such exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors.
(4) Registration of any class of security pursuant to this sub-
section shall be terminated ninety days, or such shorter period as
the Commission may determine, after the issuer files a certification
with the Commission that the number of holders of record of such
class of security is reduced to less than 300 persons, or, in the case
of a bank, a savings and loan holding company (as defined in sec-
tion 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act), or a bank holding com-
pany, as such term is defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), 1,200 persons persons. The
Commission shall after notice and opportunity for hearing deny ter-
mination of registration if it finds that the certification is untrue.
Termination of registration shall be deferred pending final deter-
mination on the question of denial.
(5) For the purposes of this subsection the term ‘‘class’’ shall in-
clude all securities of an issuer which are of substantially similar
character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar
rights and privileges. The Commission may for the purpose of this
subsection define by rules and regulations the terms ‘‘total assets’’
and ‘‘held of record’’ as it deems necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors in order to prevent
circumvention of the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of
this subsection, a security futures product shall not be considered
a class of equity security of the issuer of the securities underlying
the security futures product. For purposes of determining whether
an issuer is required to register a security with the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (1), the definition of ‘‘held of record’’ shall
not include securities held by persons who received the securities
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions ex-
empted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Secu-
rities Act of 1933.

curities Act of 1933 from the provisions of this subsection.
(h) The Commission may by rules and regulations, or upon appli-
cation of an interested person, by order, after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, exempt in whole or in part any issuer or class
of issuers from the provisions of subsection (g) of this section or
from section 13, 14, or 15(d) or may exempt from section 16 any
officer, director, or beneficial owner of securities of any issuer, any
security of which is required to be registered pursuant to sub-
section (g) hereof, upon such terms and conditions and for such pe-
riod as it deems necessary or appropriate, if the Commission finds,
by reason of the number of public investors, amount of trading in-
terest in the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of
the issuer, income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, that such
action is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection
of investors. The Commission may, for the purposes of any of the

ciations the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the powers, functions, and duties
vested in the Commission to administer and enforce sections
10A(m), 12, 13, 14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f), and 16 of this Act, and sec-

Oxley Act of 2002, (1) with respect to national banks and Federal
savings associations, the accounts of which are insured by the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation are vested in the Comptroller
of the Currency, (2) with respect to all other member banks of the
Federal Reserve System are vested in the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, and (3) with respect to all other in-
sured banks and State savings associations, the accounts of which
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are
vested in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Comp-
troller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall
have the power to make such rules and regulations as may be nec-
essary for the execution of the functions vested in them as provided
in this subsection. In carrying out their responsibilities under this
subsection, the agencies named in the first sentence of this sub-
section shall issue substantially similar regulations to regulations
and rules issued by the Commission under sections 10A(m), 12, 13,
14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f) and 16 of this Act, and sections 302, 303,
304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, unless they find that implementation of substantially similar
regulations with respect to insured banks and insured institutions
are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for protec-
tion of investors, and publish such findings, and the detailed rea-
sons therefor, in the Federal Register. Such regulations of the
above-named agencies, or the reasons for failure to publish such
substantially similar regulations to those of the Commission, shall
be published in the Federal Register within 120 days of the date
of enactment of this subsection, and, thereafter, within 60 days of
any changes made by the Commission in its relevant regulations
and rules.
(j) The Commission is authorized, by order, as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors to deny, to suspend
the effective date of, to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve
months, or to revoke the registration of a security, if the Commis-
sion finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of such security has failed to comply with any provi-
sion of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder. No mem-
ber of a national securities exchange, broker, or dealer shall make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate com-
merce to effect any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale
of, any security the registration of which has been and is sus-
pended or revoked pursuant to the preceding sentence.

curities exchange or otherwise, in securities other than ex-
empted securities, for a period not exceeding 90 calendar

(3) TERMINATION OF EMERGENCY ACTIONS BY PRESIDENT.—
The President may direct that action taken by the Commission

any security in contravention of an order of the Commission
under this subsection unless such order has been stayed, modi-
fied, or set aside as provided in paragraph (5) of this sub-
section or has ceased to be effective upon direction of the Presi-
dent as provided in paragraph (3).
(5) LIMITATIONS ON REVIEW OF ORDERS.—An order of the
Commission pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to re-
view only as provided in section 25(a) of this title. Review shall
be based on an examination of all the information before the
Commission at the time such order was issued. The reviewing
court shall not enter a stay, writ of mandamus, or similar re-
lief unless the court finds, after notice and hearing before a
panel of the court, that the Commission’s action is arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord-
ance with law.
(6) CONSULTATION.—Prior to taking any action described in
paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall consult with and con-
sider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, unless such consultation is im-
practicable in light of the emergency.
(7) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this subsection, the term

REGISTRATION AND REGULATION OF BROKERS AND DEALERS
SEC. 15. (a)(1) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer which
is either a person other than a natural person or a natural person
not associated with a broker or dealer which is a person other than
a natural person (other than such a broker or dealer whose busi-
ness is exclusively intrastate and who does not make use of any fa-
cility of a national securities exchange) to make use of the mails
or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect
any transactions in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase
or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or com-
mercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) unless
such broker or dealer is registered in accordance with subsection
(b) of this section.
(2) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems consistent with
the public interest and the protection of investors, may condi-
tionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (1) of this sub-
section any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified
in such rule or order.
(b)(1) A broker or dealer may be registered by filing with the
Commission an application for registration in such form and con-
taining such information and documents concerning such broker or
dealer and any persons associated with such broker or dealer as
the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Within
forty-five days of the date of the filing of such application (or with-
in such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Com-
mission shall—
(A) by order grant registration, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration
should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the
grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for
hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty
days of the date of the filing of the application for registration.
At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Commission, by
order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission
may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up
to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and
publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as
to which the applicant consents.

The Commission shall grant such registration if the Commission
finds that the requirements of this section are satisfied. The order
granting registration shall not be effective until such broker or
dealer has become a member of a registered securities association,
or until such broker or dealer has become a member of a national
securities exchange, if such broker or dealer effects transactions
solely on that exchange, unless the Commission has exempted such
broker or dealer, by rule or order, from such membership. The
Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such
a finding or if it finds that if the applicant were so registered, its
registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under
paragraph (4) of this subsection.
(2)(A) An application for registration of a broker or dealer to be
formed or organized may be made by a broker or dealer to which
the broker or dealer to be formed or organized is to be the suc-
cessor. Such application, in such form as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe, shall contain such information and documents con-
cerning the applicant, the successor, and any persons associated
with the applicant or the successor, as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors. The grant or denial of registration
to such an applicant shall be in accordance with the procedures set
forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the Commission grants
such registration, the registration shall terminate on the forty-fifth
day after the effective date thereof, unless prior thereto the suc-
cessor shall, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe, adopt the application for registration
as its own.
(B) Any person who is a broker or dealer solely by reason of act-
ing as a municipal securities dealer or municipal securities broker,
who so acts through a separately identifiable department or divi-
sion, and who so acted in such a manner on the date of enactment
of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, may, in accordance
with such terms and conditions as the Commission, by rule, pre-
scribes as necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for
the protection of investors, register such separately identifiable de-
partment or division in accordance with this subsection. If any such
department or division is so registered, the department or division
and not such person himself shall be the broker or dealer for pur-
poses of this title.
(C) Within six months of the date of the granting of registration
to a broker or dealer, the Commission, or upon the authorization
and direction of the Commission, a registered securities association
or national securities exchange of which such broker or dealer is
a member, shall conduct an inspection of the broker or dealer to
determine whether it is operating in conformity with the provisions
of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder: Provided,
however, That the Commission may delay such inspection of any
class of brokers or dealers for a period not to exceed six months.
(3) Any provision of this title (other than section 5 and sub-
section (a) of this section) which prohibits any act, practice, or
course of business if the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce is used in connection therewith shall also pro-
hibit any such act, practice, or course of business by any registered
broker or dealer or any person acting on behalf of such a broker

(4) The Commission, by order, shall censure, place limitations on
the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not
exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of any broker
or dealer if it finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for
hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or
revocation is in the public interest and that such broker or dealer,
whether prior or subsequent to becoming such, or any person asso-
ciated with such broker or dealer, whether prior or subsequent to
becoming so associated—

laws or regulations that prohibit fraudulent, manipulative,
or deceptive conduct.
(5) Pending final determination whether any registration under
this subsection shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may
suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Com-

order or finding, enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H),

sion may, by rule or regulation, define such term to include other
activities, and may, by rule, regulation, or order, exempt any per-
son or class of persons, in whole or in part, conditionally or uncon-
ditionally, from such term.

or dealer registered pursuant to subsection (b)(1) and also reg-
istered as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section
4f(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, in a portfolio mar-
gining account carried as a futures account subject to section

tions thereunder, pursuant to a portfolio margining program
approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and

ing Commission to adopt rules to ensure that such transactions

tent practicable for similar products.

hearing, that any person subject to the provisions of section 12, 13,
14, or subsection (d) of section 15 of this title or any rule or regula-
tion thereunder has failed to comply with any such provision, rule,
or regulation in any material respect, the Commission may publish
its findings and issue an order requiring such person, and any per-
son who was a cause of the failure to comply due to an act or omis-
sion the person knew or should have known would contribute to
the failure to comply, to comply, or to take steps to effect compli-
ance, with such provision or such rule or regulation thereunder

mission may specify in such order.

such specified and appropriate standards with respect to dealing as
the Commission, by rule, shall prescribe as necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to

travention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall

ment of securities transactions, with respect to the time and meth-
od of, and the form and format of documents used in connection

subsection shall also be automatically suspended as to any fis-
cal year, other than the fiscal year within which such registra-
tion statement became effective, if, at the beginning of such fis-
cal year, the securities of each class, other than any class of

lates are held of record by less than 300 persons, or, in the
case of a bank, a savings and loan holding company (as defined

ing company, as such term is defined in section 2 of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), 1,200 persons

or dealer shall provide notice to its customer that the broker or
dealer may receive compensation in connection with lending the
customer’s securities. The Commission, by rule, as it deems nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection
of investors, may prescribe the form, content, time, and manner of
delivery of any notice required under this paragraph.

(j) RULEMAKING TO EXTEND REQUIREMENTS TO NEW HYBRID
PRODUCTS.—
(1) CONSULTATION.—Prior to commencing a rulemaking
under this subsection, the Commission shall consult with and
seek the concurrence of the Board concerning the imposition of
broker or dealer registration requirements with respect to any
new hybrid product. In developing and promulgating rules
under this subsection, the Commission shall consider the views
of the Board, including views with respect to the nature of the
new hybrid product; the history, purpose, extent, and appro-
priateness of the regulation of the new product under the Fed-
eral banking laws; and the impact of the proposed rule on the
banking industry.
(2) LIMITATION.—The Commission shall not—
(A) require a bank to register as a broker or dealer
under this section because the bank engages in any trans-
action in, or buys or sells, a new hybrid product; or
(B) bring an action against a bank for a failure to com-
ply with a requirement described in subparagraph (A),
unless the Commission has imposed such requirement by rule
or regulation issued in accordance with this section.
(3) CRITERIA FOR RULEMAKING.—The Commission shall not
impose a requirement under paragraph (2) of this subsection
with respect to any new hybrid product unless the Commission
determines that—
(A) the new hybrid product is a security; and
(B) imposing such requirement is necessary and appro-
priate in the public interest and for the protection of inves-
tors.

(4) CONSIDERATIONS.—In making a determination under
paragraph (3), the Commission shall consider—
(A) the nature of the new hybrid product; and

the regulation of the new hybrid product under the Fed-
eral securities laws and under the Federal banking laws.
(5) OBJECTION TO COMMISSION REGULATION.—
(A) FILING OF PETITION FOR REVIEW.—The Board may ob-
tain review of any final regulation described in paragraph
(2) in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit by filing in such court, not later than
60 days after the date of publication of the final regula-
tion, a written petition requesting that the regulation be
set aside. Any proceeding to challenge any such rule shall
be expedited by the Court of Appeals.
(B) TRANSMITTAL OF PETITION AND RECORD.—A copy of a
petition described in subparagraph (A) shall be trans-
mitted as soon as possible by the Clerk of the Court to an
officer or employee of the Commission designated for that
purpose. Upon receipt of the petition, the Commission
shall file with the court the regulation under review and
any documents referred to therein, and any other relevant
materials prescribed by the court.
(C) EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.—On the date of the filing
of the petition under subparagraph (A), the court has juris-
diction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the mate-
rials set forth in subparagraph (B), to affirm and enforce
or to set aside the regulation at issue.
(D) STANDARD OF REVIEW.—The court shall determine to
affirm and enforce or set aside a regulation of the Commis-
sion under this subsection, based on the determination of
the court as to whether—
(i) the subject product is a new hybrid product, as
defined in this subsection;
(ii) the subject product is a security; and
(iii) imposing a requirement to register as a broker
or dealer for banks engaging in transactions in such
product is appropriate in light of the history, purpose,
and extent of regulation under the Federal securities
laws and under the Federal banking laws, giving def-
erence neither to the views of the Commission nor the
Board.
(E) JUDICIAL STAY.—The filing of a petition by the Board
pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall operate as a judicial
stay, until the date on which the determination of the
court is final (including any appeal of such determination).

(k) REGISTRATION OR SUCCESSION TO A UNITED STATES BROKER
OR DEALER.—In determining whether to permit a foreign person or
an affiliate of a foreign person to register as a United States broker
or dealer, or succeed to the registration of a United States broker
or dealer, the Commission may consider whether, for a foreign per-
son, or an affiliate of a foreign person that presents a risk to the
stability of the United States financial system, the home country
of the foreign person has adopted, or made demonstrable progress
toward adopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation to
mitigate such risk.

mines that the home country of the foreign person has not adopted,
or made demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate
system of financial regulation to mitigate such risk.
(k) STANDARD OF CONDUCT.—

this Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Commis-
sion may promulgate rules to provide that, with respect to a
broker or dealer, when providing personalized investment ad-
vice about securities to a retail customer (and such other cus-
tomers as the Commission may by rule provide), the standard
of conduct for such broker or dealer with respect to such cus-
tomer shall be the same as the standard of conduct applicable
to an investment adviser under section 211 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. The receipt of compensation based on
commission or other standard compensation for the sale of se-
curities shall not, in and of itself, be considered a violation of
such standard applied to a broker or dealer. Nothing in this
section shall require a broker or dealer or registered represent-
ative to have a continuing duty of care or loyalty to the cus-
tomer after providing personalized investment advice about se-
curities.
(2) DISCLOSURE OF RANGE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED.—Where a
broker or dealer sells only proprietary or other limited range

ited range of products by a broker or dealer shall not, in and
of itself, be considered a violation of the standard set forth in
paragraph (1).
(l) OTHER MATTERS.—The Commission shall—
(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear disclosures to
investors regarding the terms of their relationships with bro-
kers, dealers, and investment advisers, including any material
conflicts of interest; and
(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules pro-
hibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of inter-
est, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and in-
vestment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the
public interest and the protection of investors.
(m) HARMONIZATION OF ENFORCEMENT.—The enforcement au-
thority of the Commission with respect to violations of the standard
of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized
investment advice about securities to a retail customer shall in-
clude—
(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with re-
spect to such violations provided under this Act; and
(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with re-
spect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to an
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
including the authority to impose sanctions for such violations,
and
the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of
the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail cus-
tomer under this Act to same extent as the Commission prosecutes
and sanctions violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an
investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

gated under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) be in a summary format; and
(B) contain clear and concise information about—

and
(ii) any compensation or other financial incentive re-
ceived by a broker, dealer, or other intermediary in
connection with the purchase of retail investment
products.

(A) IN GENERAL.—Any blockchain system that relates to
a digital commodity for which a certification has been
made under paragraph (1) shall be considered a mature
blockchain system 60 days after the date on which the
Commission receives a certification under paragraph (1),
unless the Commission notifies the person who made the

prejudice to any such criteria codified in statute, alternative cri-
teria by which blockchain systems may be considered not to be
controlled by any person or group of persons under common

control in order to accommodate changes in markets and tech-
nology.
(2) IN GENERAL.—The Commission may issue rules identi-
fying conditions by which a blockchain system, together with its
related digital commodity, shall be considered a mature
blockchain system, consistent with the protection of investors,
maintenance of fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and the fa-
cilitation of capital formation.
(3) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.—
(A) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to per-
mit the Commission to impose additional criteria to the cri-
teria in subsection (c) for certifying that a blockchain sys-
tem is a mature blockchain system pursuant to subsection
(c).
(B) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (c) may be
construed to limit the Commission’s ability to identify alter-
native conditions and criteria by which a blockchain sys-
tem may be considered a mature blockchain system.
(c) DEEMED MATURE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subsection (b), for the pur-
poses of subsection (a), a digital commodity issuer, digital com-
modity related person, digital commodity affiliated person, or
decentralized governance system of the blockchain system may
establish that a blockchain system, together with its related dig-
ital commodity, is not controlled by any person or group of per-
sons under common control, if the blockchain system, together
with its related digital asset, meets the requirements described
in paragraph (2) or (3).
(2) CRITERIA FOR ANY BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM.—The require-
ments described in this paragraph are the following:
(A) SYSTEM VALUE.—
(i) MARKET VALUE.—The digital commodity has a
value that is substantially derived from the use and
functioning of the blockchain system.

TIALLY COMPLETED.—Where the digital commodity
issuer has made public a development plan describing
how the digital commodity’s value is reasonably ex-
pected to be derived from the programmatic func-
tioning of the blockchain system, the development of
such mechanisms has been substantially completed.
(B) FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM.—The blockchain system allows
network participants to engage in the activities the
blockchain system is intended to provide, including—
(i) using, transmitting, or storing value, or otherwise
executing transactions, on the blockchain system;
(ii) deploying, executing, or accessing software or
services, or otherwise offering or participating in serv-
ices, deployed on or integrated with the blockchain sys-
tem;

(iv) operating any client, node, validator, or other
form of computational infrastructure with respect to
the blockchain system.
(C) OPEN AND INTEROPERABLE SYSTEM.—The blockchain
system—
(i) is composed of source code that is open source;
and
(ii) does not restrict or prohibit based on the exercise
of unilateral authority any person, other than a digital
commodity issuer, digital commodity related person, or
digital commodity affiliated person from engaging in
the activities the blockchain system is intended to pro-
vide, including the activities described in subpara-
graph (B).
(D) PROGRAMMATIC SYSTEM.—The blockchain system op-
erates, executes, and enforces its operations and trans-
actions based solely on pre-established, transparent rules
encoded directly within the source code of the blockchain
system.
(E) SYSTEM GOVERNANCE.—No person or group of per-
sons under common control—
(i) has the unilateral authority, directly or indirectly,
through any contract, arrangement, understanding, re-
lationship, or otherwise, to control or materially alter
the functionality, operation, or rules of consensus or
agreement of the blockchain system or its related dig-
ital commodity; or

any underlying security, option on such security or option
on a group or index including such securities; and
(III) Such group or index of securities shall not con-
stitute a narrow-based security index.
(iii) If, in its discretion, the Commission determines that a
stock index futures contract, notwithstanding its conformance
with the requirements in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, can
reasonably be used as a surrogate for trading a security (in-
cluding a security futures product), it may, by order, require
such contract and any option thereon be traded and regulated
as security futures products as defined in section 3(a)(56) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and section 1a of this Act
subject to all rules and regulations applicable to security fu-
tures products under this Act and the securities laws as de-
fined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
(iv) No person shall offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm
the execution of any contract of sale (or option on such con-
tract) for future delivery of any security, or interest therein or

effect on the date of enactment of the Futures Trading Act of
1982 (other than any municipal security as defined in section
3(a)(29) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on the date of

in or based on the value thereof.
(v)(I) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any
contract market in a stock index futures contract (or option
thereon) other than a security futures product, or any deriva-
tives transaction execution facility on which such contract or
option is traded, shall file with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System any rule establishing or changing the
levels of margin (initial and maintenance) for such stock index
futures contract (or option thereon) other than security futures
products.
(II) The Board may at any time request any contract market
or derivatives transaction execution facility to set the margin
for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon), other
than for any security futures product, at such levels as the
Board in its judgment determines are appropriate to preserve
the financial integrity of the contract market or derivatives
transaction execution facility, or its clearing system, or to pre-
vent systemic risk. If the contract market or derivatives trans-
action execution facility fails to do so within the time specified
by the Board in its request, the Board may direct the contract
market or derivatives transaction execution facility to alter or
supplement the rules of the contract market or derivatives
transaction execution facility as specified in the request.
(III) Subject to such conditions as the Board may determine,
the Board may delegate any or all of its authority, relating to
margin for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon),
other than security futures products, under this clause to the
Commission.

tures product unless such activities comply with the regula-
tions prescribed pursuant to section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

thority granted to the Commission in section 8a(9) to direct a
contract market or registered derivatives transaction execution
facility, on finding an emergency to exist, to raise temporary
margin levels on any futures contract, or option on the contract
covered by this clause, or on any security futures product.

acting under the delegation of authority under subclause III,

plement a contract market rule shall be subject to review only
in the Court of Appeals where the party seeking review resides
or has its principal place of business, or in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The re-
view shall be based on the examination of all information be-
fore the Board or the Commission, as the case may be, at the
time the determination was made. The court reviewing the ac-
tion of the Board or the Commission shall not enter a stay or
order of mandamus unless the court has determined, after no-
tice and a hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency
action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of dis-
cretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

rities and Exchange Commission shall have jurisdiction and au-
thority over security futures as defined in section 3(a)(55) of the Se-

tion facility is not enforcing or has not enforced its rules of govern-
ment, made a condition of its designation or registration as set
forth in sections 5 through 5b or section 5f, or that the contract
market or derivatives transaction execution facility or electronic
trading facility, or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof,
otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this

ing been afforded to such person for a hearing, or infringes the
Constitution of the United States, or is beyond the jurisdiction of
the Commission.

For purposes of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, this
subsection shall be considered a statute described in subsection

mined is not in excess of the higher of market value or asset

tions or orders, permit any security to be carried at cost, if it shall
determine that such procedure is consistent with the general intent
and purposes of this title. For purposes of sections 5 and 12, in lieu
of values determined as provided in clause (A) above, the Commis-
sion shall by rules and regulations permit valuation of securities at
cost or other basis in cases where it may be more convenient for
such company to make its computations on such basis by reason of

of any State in which the securities of such company may be quali-
fied for sale.

the Commission with respect to the reports, information, and docu-
ments to be filed with the Commission by any registered company,
or with respect to the accounting policies and principles to be fol-
lowing by any such company, as provided in sections 8, 30, and 31.

conditions specified in such paragraph or in any order or regu-
lation issued by the Board under such paragraph: Provided,
That a company covered in 1970 may also engage in those ac-
tivities in which directly or through a subsidiary (i) it was law-
fully engaged on June 30, 1968 (or on a date subsequent to
June 30, 1968 in the case of activities carried on as the result
of the acquisition by such company or subsidiary, pursuant to
a binding written contract entered into on or before June 30,
1968, of another company engaged in such activities at the
time of the acquisition), and (ii) it has been continuously en-
gaged since June 30, 1968 (or such subsequent date). The
Board by order, after opportunity for hearing, may terminate
the authority conferred by the preceding proviso on any com-
pany to engage directly or through a subsidiary in any activity
otherwise permitted by that proviso if it determines, having
due regard to the purposes of this Act, that such action is nec-
essary to prevent undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices; and in the case of any such company controlling a
bank having bank assets in excess of $60,000,000 on or after
the date of enactment of the Bank Holding Company Act
Amendments of 1970 the Board shall determine, within two
years after such date (or, if later, within two years after the
date on which the bank assets first exceed $60,000,000),
whether the authority conferred by the preceding proviso with
respect to such company should be terminated as provided in
this sentence. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
authorize any bank holding company referred to in the pre-
ceding proviso, or any subsidiary thereof, to engage in activi-
ties authorized by that proviso through the acquisition, pursu-
ant to a contract entered into after June 30, 1968, of any inter-
est in or the assets of a going concern engaged in such activi-
ties. Any company which is authorized to engage in any activ-
ity pursuant to the preceding proviso or subsection (d) of this
section but, as a result of action of the Board, is required to
terminate such activity may (notwithstanding any otherwise
applicable time limit prescribed in this paragraph) retain the
ownership or control of shares in any company carrying on
such activity for a period of ten years from the date on which
its authority was so terminated by the Board. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this paragraph, if any company that be-
came a bank holding company as a result of the enactment of
the Competitive Equality Amendments of 1987 acquired, be-
tween March 5, 1987, and the date of the enactment of such
Amendments, an institution that became a bank as a result of
the enactment of such Amendments, that company shall, upon
the enactment of such Amendments, immediately come into
compliance with the requirements of this Act.
The Board is authorized, upon application by a bank holding com-
pany, to extend the two-year period referred to in paragraph (2)
above from time to time as to such bank holding company for not
more than one year at a time, if, in its judgment, such an extension
would not be detrimental to the public interest, but no such exten-
sions shall in the aggregate exceed three years. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Act, the period ending December 31,

1980, referred to in paragraph (2) above, may be extended by the
Board of Governors to December 31, 1984, but only for the divesti-
ture by a bank holding company of real estate or interests in real
estate lawfully acquired for investment or development. In making
its decision whether to grant such extension, the Board shall con-
sider whether the company has made a good faith effort to divest
such interests and whether such extension is necessary to avert
substantial loss to the company.
(b) After two years from the date of enactment of this Act, no cer-
tificate evidencing shares of any bank holding company shall bear
any statement purporting to represent shares of any other company
except a bank or a bank holding company, nor shall the ownership,
sale, or transfer of shares of any bank holding company be condi-
tioned in any manner whatsoever upon the ownership, sale, or
transfer of shares of any other company except a bank or a bank
holding company.
(c) The prohibitions in this section shall not apply to (i) any com-
pany that was on January 4, 1977, both a bank holding company
and a labor, agricultural, or horticultural organization exempt from
taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
or to any labor, agricultural, or horticultural organization to which
all or substantially all of the assets of such company are hereafter
transferred, or (ii) a company covered in 1970 more than 85 per
centum of the voting stock of which was collectively owned on June
30, 1968, and continuously thereafter, directly or indirectly, by or
for members of the same family, or their spouses, who are lineal
descendants of common ancestors; and such prohibitions shall not,
with respect to any other bank holding company, apply to—
(1) shares of any company engaged or to be engaged solely
in one or more of the following activities: (A) holding or oper-
ating properties used wholly or substantially by any banking
subsidiary of such bank holding company in the operations of
such banking subsidiary or acquired for such future use; or (B)
conducting a safe deposit business; or (C) furnishing services
to or performing services for such bank holding company or its
banking subsidiaries; or (D) liquidating assets acquired from
such bank holding company or its banking subsidiaries or ac-
quired from any other source prior to May 9, 1956, or the date
on which such company became a bank holding company,
whichever is later;
(2) shares acquired by a bank holding company or any of its
subsidiaries in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in
good faith, but such shares shall be disposed of within a period
of two years from the date on which they were acquired, except
that the Board is authorized upon application by such bank
holding company to extend such period of two years from time
to time as to such holding company if, in its judgment, such
an extension would not be detrimental to the public interest,
and, in the case of a bank holding company which has not dis-
posed of such shares within 5 years after the date on which
such shares were acquired, the Board may, upon the applica-
tion of such company, grant additional exemptions if, in the
judgment of the Board, such extension would not be detri-
mental to the public interest and, either the bank holding com-
pany has made a good faith attempt to dispose of such shares

during such 5-year period, or the disposal of such shares dur-
ing such 5-year period would have been detrimental to the
company, except that the aggregate duration of such exten-
sions shall not extend beyond 10 years after the date on which
such shares were acquired;
(3) shares acquired by such bank holding company from any
of its subsidiaries which subsidiary has been requested to dis-
pose of such shares by any Federal or State authority having
statutory power to examine such subsidiary, but such bank
holding company shall dispose of such shares within a period
of two years from the date on which they were acquired;
(4) shares held or acquired by a bank in good faith in a fidu-
ciary capacity, except where such shares are held under a trust
that constitutes a company as defined in section 2(b) and ex-
cept as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 2(g);
(5) shares which are of the kinds and amounts eligible for in-
vestment by national banking associations under the provi-

(8) shares of any company the activities of which had been
determined by the Board by regulation or order under this
paragraph as of the day before the date of the enactment of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to be so closely related to banking as
to be a proper incident thereto (subject to such terms and con-
ditions contained in such regulation or order, unless modified
by the Board);
(9) shares held or activities conducted by any company orga-
nized under the laws of a foreign country the greater part of
whose business is conducted outside the United States, if the
Board by regulation or order determines that, under the cir-
cumstances and subject to the conditions set forth in the regu-
lation or order, the exemption would not be substantially at
variance with the purposes of this Act and would be in the
public interest;
(10) shares lawfully acquired and owned prior to May 9,
1956, by a bank which is a bank holding company, or by any
of its wholly owned subsidiaries;

pany whose acquisition (including each acquisition of shares)
or formation by a bank holding company has not been dis-
approved by the Board pursuant to this paragraph, except that
such investments, whether direct or indirect, in such shares
shall not exceed 5 per centum of the bank holding company’s
consolidated capital and surplus.
(A)(i) No bank holding company shall invest in an export
trading company under this paragraph unless the Board
has been given sixty days’ prior written notice of such pro-
posed investment and within such period has not issued a
notice disapproving the proposed investment or extending
for up to another thirty days the period during which such
disapproval may be issued.
(ii) The period for disapproval may be extended for such
additional thirty-day period only if the Board determines
that a bank holding company proposing to invest in an ex-
port trading company has not furnished all the informa-
tion required to be submitted or that in the Board’s judg-
ment any material information submitted is substantially
inaccurate.
(iii) The notice required to be filed by a bank holding
company shall contain such relevant information as the
Board shall require by regulation or by specific request in
connection with any particular notice.
(iv) The Board may disapprove any proposed investment
only if—
(I) such disapproval is necessary to prevent unsafe
or unsound banking practices, undue concentration of
resources, decreased or unfair competition, or conflicts
of interest;

fect the financial or managerial resources of a bank
holding company to an extent which is likely to have
a materially adverse effect on the safety and sound-

ness of any subsidiary bank of such bank holding com-
pany, or
(III) the bank holding company fails to furnish the
information required under clause (iii).
(v) LEVERAGE.—The Board may not disapprove any pro-
posed investment solely on the basis of the anticipated or
proposed asset-to-equity ratio of the export trading com-
pany with respect to which such investment is proposed,
unless the anticipated or proposed annual average asset-
to-equity ratio is greater than 20-to-1.
(vi) Within three days after a decision to disapprove an
investment, the Board shall notify the bank holding com-
pany in writing of the disapproval and shall provide a
written statement of the basis for the disapproval.
(vii) A proposed investment may be made prior to the ex-
piration of the disapproval period if the Board issues writ-
ten notice of its intent not to disapprove the investment.
(B)(i) The total amount of extensions of credit by a bank
holding company which invests in an export trading com-
pany, when combined with all such extensions of credit by
all the subsidiaries of such bank holding company, to an
export trading company shall not exceed at any one time
10 per centum of the bank holding company’s consolidated
capital and surplus. For purposes of the preceding sen-
tence, an extension of credit shall not be deemed to include
any amount invested by a bank holding company in the
shares of an export trading company.
(ii) No provision of any other Federal law in effect on Oc-
tober 1, 1982, relating specifically to collateral require-
ments shall apply with respect to any such extension of
credit.
(iii) No bank holding company or subsidiary of such com-
pany which invests in an export trading company may ex-
tend credit to such export trading company or to customers
of such export trading company on terms more favorable
than those afforded similar borrowers in similar cir-
cumstances, and such extension of credit shall not involve
more than the normal risk of repayment or present other
unfavorable features.
(C) For purposes of this paragraph, an export trading
company—
(i) may engage in or hold shares of a company en-
gaged in the business of underwriting, selling, or dis-
tributing securities in the United States only to the
extent that any bank holding company which invests
in such export trading company may do so under ap-
plicable Federal and State banking laws and regula-
tions; and
(ii) may not engage in agricultural production activi-
ties or in manufacturing, except for such incidental
product modification including repackaging, reassem-
bling or extracting byproducts, as is necessary to en-
able United States goods or services to conform with
requirements of a foreign country and to facilitate
their sale in foreign countries.

(D) A bank holding company which invests in an export
trading company may be required, by the Board, to termi-
nate its investment or may be made subject to such limita-
tions or conditions as may be imposed by the Board, if the
Board determines that the export trading company has
taken positions in commodities or commodity contracts, in
securities, or in foreign exchange, other than as may be
necessary in the course of the export trading company’s
business operations.
(E) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an Edge
Act corporation, organized under section 25(a) of the Fed-
eral Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 611–631), which is a sub-
sidiary of a bank holding company, or an agreement cor-
poration, operating subject to section 25 of the Federal Re-
serve Act (12 U.S.C. 601–604(a)), which is a subsidiary of
a bank holding company, may invest directly and indi-
rectly in the aggregate up to 5 per centum of its consoli-
dated capital and surplus (25 per centum in the case of a
corporation not engaged in banking) in the voting stock of
other evidences of ownership in one or more export trading
companies.
(F) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) the term ‘‘export trading company’’ means a com-
pany which does business under the laws of the
United States or any State, which is exclusively en-
gaged in activities related to international trade, and
which is organized and operated principally for pur-
poses of exporting goods or services produced in the
United States or for purposes of facilitating the expor-
tation of goods or services produced in the United
States by unaffiliated persons by providing one or
more export trade services.
(ii) the term ‘‘export trade services’’ includes, but is
not limited to, consulting, international market re-
search, advertising, marketing, insurance (other than
acting as principal, agent or broker in the sale of in-
surance on risks resident or located, or activities per-
formed, in the United States, except for insurance cov-
ering the transportation of cargo from any point of ori-
gin in the United States to a point of final destination
outside the United States), product research and de-
sign, legal assistance, transportation, including trade
documentation and freight forwarding, communication
and processing of foreign orders to and for exporters
and foreign purchasers, warehousing, foreign ex-
change, financing, and taking title to goods, when pro-
vided in order to facilitate the export of goods or serv-
ices produced in the United States;
(iii) the term ‘‘bank holding company’’ shall include
a bank which (I) is organized solely to do business
with other banks and their officers, directors, or em-
ployees; (II) is owned primarily by the banks with
which it does business; and (III) does not do business
with the general public. No such other bank, owning
stock in a bank described in this clause that invests

in an export trading company, shall extend credit to
an export trading company in an amount exceeding at
any one time 10 per centum of such other bank’s cap-
ital and surplus; and
(iv) the term ‘‘extension of credit’’ shall have the
same meaning given such term in the fourth para-
graph of section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(G) DETERMINATION OF STATUS AS EXPORT TRADING COM-
PANY.—
(i) TIME PERIOD REQUIREMENTS.—For purposes of de-
termining whether an export trading company is oper-
ated principally for the purposes described in subpara-
graph (F)(i)—
(I) the operations of such company during the 2-
year period beginning on the date such company
commences operations shall not be taken into ac-
count in making any such determination; and
(II) not less than 4 consecutive years of oper-
ations of such company (not including any portion
of the period referred to in subclause (I)) shall be
taken into account in making any such determina-
tion.
(ii) EXPORT REVENUE REQUIREMENTS.—A company
shall not be treated as operated principally for the
purposes described in subparagraph (F)(i) unless—
(I) the revenues of such company from the ex-
port, or facilitating the export, of goods or services
produced in the United States exceed the reve-
nues of such company from the import, or facili-
tating the import, into the United States of goods
or services produced outside the United States;
and
(II) at least 1⁄
3
of such company’s total revenues
are revenues from the export, or facilitating the
export, of goods or services produced in the United
States by persons not affiliated with such com-
pany.
(H) INVENTORY.—
(i) NO GENERAL LIMITATION.—The Board may not
prescribe by regulation any maximum dollar amount
limitation on the value of goods which an export trad-
ing company may maintain in inventory at any time.
(ii) SPECIFIC LIMITATION BY ORDER.—Notwith-
standing clause (i), the Board may issue an order es-
tablishing a maximum dollar amount limitation on the
value of goods which a particular export trading com-
pany may maintain in inventory at any time (after
such company has been operating for a reasonable pe-
riod of time) if the Board finds that, under the facts
and circumstances, such limitation is necessary to pre-
vent risks that would affect the financial or manage-
rial resources of an investor bank holding company to
an extent which would be likely to have a materially
adverse effect on the safety and soundness of any sub-
sidiary bank of such bank holding company.

The Board shall include in its annual report to the Congress a de-
scription and a statement of the reasons for approval of each activ-
ity approved by it by order or regulation under such paragraph
during the period covered by the report.
(d) To the extent that such action would not be substantially at
variance with the purposes of this Act and subject to such condi-
tions as it considers necessary to protect the public interest, the
Board by order, after opportunity for hearing, may grant exemp-
tions from the provisions of this section to any bank holding com-
pany which controlled one bank prior to July 1, 1968, and has not
thereafter acquired the control of any other bank in order (1) to
avoid disrupting business relationships that have existed over a
long period of years without adversely affecting the banks or com-
munities involved, or (2) to avoid forced sales of small locally
owned banks to purchasers not similarly representative of commu-
nity interests, or (3) to allow retention of banks that are so small
in relation to the holding company’s total interests and so small in
relation to the banking market to be served as to minimize the
likelihood that the bank’s powers to grant or deny credit may be
influenced by a desire to further the holding company’s other inter-
ests.
(e) With respect to shares which were not subject to the prohibi-
tions of this section as originally enacted by reason of any exemp-
tion with respect thereto but which were made subject to such pro-
hibitions by the subsequent repeal of such exemption, no bank
holding company shall retain direct or indirect ownership or control
of such shares after five years from the date of the repeal of such
exemption, except as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (a).
Any bank holding company subject to such five-year limitation on
the retention of nonbanking assets shall endeavor to divest itself
of such shares promptly and such bank holding company shall re-
port its progress in such divestiture to the Board two years after
repeal of the exemption applicable to it and annually thereafter.
(f) CERTAIN COMPANIES NOT TREATED AS BANK HOLDING COMPA-
NIES.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (9), any
company which—
(A) on March 5, 1987, controlled an institution which be-
came a bank as a result of the enactment of the Competi-
tive Equality Amendments of 1987; and
(B) was not a bank holding company on the day before
the date of the enactment of the Competitive Equality
Amendments of 1987,
shall not be treated as a bank holding company for purposes
of this Act solely by virtue of such company’s control of such
institution.
(2) LOSS OF EXEMPTION.—Subject to paragraph (3), a com-
pany described in paragraph (1) shall no longer qualify for the
exemption provided under that paragraph if—
(A) such company directly or indirectly—
(i) acquires control of an additional bank or an in-
sured institution (other than an insured institution de-
scribed in paragraph (10) or (12) of this subsection)
after March 5, 1987; or

tension will not be detrimental to the public inter-
est;
(VIII) shares or assets of a savings association
described in paragraph (10) or (12) of this sub-
section;

insurance company, as defined in section 2(a)(17)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, except as
provided in paragraph (11);

under section 10(q) of the Home Owners’ Loan
Act; and
(XI) assets that are derived from, or incidental
to, activities in which institutions described in
subparagraph (F) or (H) of section 2(c)(2) are per-
mitted to engage;

ing power of a savings association;

of a bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve
System.

graph (2), such exemption shall cease to apply to such company
and such company shall divest control of each bank it controls

caused the company to fail to continue to qualify for
the exemption; or

ests, unsound banking practices, or risk to the stability of
the United States banking or financial system.

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 3633, the crypto market structure bill Democrats call the
‘‘CALAMITY Act,’’ would legitimize the numerous crypto scams of
President Trump and his family. The bill also creates new loop-
holes of other crypto companies not owned by the President to
avoid investor protections and national security guardrails. Nota-
bly, this legislation impedes, blocks or restricts oversight, funding,
and resources to enforce provisions related to national security,
conflict of interests, and fraud. The CALAMITY Act would also
threaten overall financial stability, as exemptions in the bill are
broad enough to create loopholes for participants to migrate from
our securities markets to this new crypto one.
Throughout the 2024 campaign trail, President Trump promised
to make America the ‘‘crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin
superpower of the world.’’1 What he didn’t mention was that he
and his family were also planning to create several new crypto
companies and offer crypto products directly to the public, includ-
ing foreign governments. For example, in the days before his inau-
guration and during his Presidency, the President and his family
launched a decentralized finance (defi) platform,2 memecoins,3 a
stablecoin,4 a Bitcoin mining company,5 a Bitcoin treasury,6 Bitcoin
ETF,7 and more.8 Purchases of Trump’s crypto products have also
enabled access to the President, and have been used by foreign gov-
ernments to facilitate commercial deals, all generating Trump and
his family more than a billion dollars. Separately, Trump has as-
serted unprecedented control over what were formerly understood
to be independent financial regulators, by firing Commissioners
and Directors, and asserting approval over the rulewriting process.
And notably, President Trump has directed Republicans in Con-
gress9 to pass stablecoin and crypto market structure legislation

before August recess, even as he and his family roll out new crypto
products.10
It is in this context that on May 5, 2025, Chair Hill released a
revised version of crypto market structure legislation, H.R. 3633. In
his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Tim-
othy Massad, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) Chairman and current Research Fellow and Director of the
Digital Assets Policy Project at Harvard University, summarized
major challenges facing the bill:
With over 200 pages of detailed, complicated provisions,
the implications of which are difficult to assess, I fear the
Clarity Act is likely to have two principal effects: first, it
will guarantee its own obsolescence, because the tech-
nology will evolve and the particulars of provisions will be-
come outdated or not relevant. Second, and of far greater
danger . . . it will generate massive exploitation of its pro-
visions and regulatory arbitrage.11
The loopholes in this bill coupled with a self-profiteering Presi-
dent, captured agencies, and non-existent enforcement of current
law under the Trump Administration, would allow fraud to pro-
liferate and result in devastating losses for not just crypto con-
sumers, but also for non-crypto investors who are trying to save for
college, home ownership, retirement, or other milestones. Passing
this bill into law would make Congress complicit in Trump’s nu-
merous crypto scams and cause lasting harm to the American econ-
omy and public.
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S CRYPTO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The CALAMITY Act would not just enable large-scale conflicts of
interest from Trump and his family, it would send a message that
Congress approves and validates the way he is selling access to the
White House, both domestically and abroad. Existing executive
branch ethics requirements contain loopholes and gaps that can be
easily exploited, and certain conflicts of interest laws exempt the
President and Vice President. This has paved the way for unprece-
dented corruption and unchecked self-profiteering. For example, ac-
cording to ethics and anti-corruption experts, Democracy Defenders
Action:
If President Trump were subject to the same criminal
conflict of interest statute, 18 U.S.C. 208, that applies to
other executive branch employees, he would have been
prohibited from signing the March 23 Executive Order

utive branch employee who may have interests in

tion that would be viewed as a particular matter . . .12
The Trump family’s high-profile conflicts of interest were ele-
vated a few days before the presidential inauguration. President
Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched their own
memecoins ($TRUMP and $MELANIA), with $TRUMP earning a
staggering $350 million in the three weeks after it was launched,
from sales and fees alone.13 While early, likely inside investors
profited off of the memecoins, most investors lost a staggering $2
billion as the coins value plummeted.14 Later on, Trump announced
that the 220 largest holders would be invited to an exclusive
memecoin dinner at his luxury golf resort on May 22nd, for which
attendees, including foreign investors, spent millions of dollars to
secure a seat.15 The CALAMITY Act exempts memecoins from reg-
ulation, leaving them, including Trump’s memecoin, to operate
with no oversight at all. One Committee hearing witness, Professor
Timothy Massad, raised a critical point during his testimony:
In the words of Vitalik Buterin, [memecoins] are vehicles
for ‘unlimited political bribery,’ because those seeking to
curry favor with the Administration—whether they be in-
dividuals, companies or countries—may purchase the
coins, knowing the President will profit from their actions,
while they can still deny that seeking government favor-
itism was their purpose. Instead, they can claim they were
merely speculating on a digital asset.16
In addition to dropping or pausing ongoing enforcement cases
against Trump’s donors and crypto investors,17 the SEC has also
issued statements declaring that certain digital assets, which in-
clude crypto products issued or backed by the Trump family, are
not subject to SEC oversight.18 More recently, on June 13, the SEC
approved the Trump Media and Technology Group’s (Trump Media)
$2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal, one of the largest Bitcoin treas-
ury deals for a public company.19 On Monday, June 16, President
Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, also filed a registra-
tion form with the SEC to launch a dual exchange-traded fund
(ETF) for Bitcoin and Ether.20

Not only is Trump and his family, personally and financially in-
volved in the crypto space through their numerous crypto busi-
nesses, the President also stands to be the largest direct competitor
in the ecosystem. In addition to flouting ethics standards, Trump
has continued to undermine the independence of the historically bi-
partisan independent federal financial agencies. Trump has tar-
geted Democratic appointees who are protected from removal by
the president and can only be terminated for cause and fired the
Democratic Directors of the National Credit Union Administration,
and Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission. In her testi-
mony before the House Financial Services Committee, Amanda
Fischer, Policy Director and COO at Better Markets, discussed this
issue:
Federal financial regulatory agencies are under siege in
the current Administration. Democratic commissioners,
dually nominated by the President and confirmed by the
Senate, have been fired without cause, with the Supreme
Court in a two-page decision declining to place an injunc-
tion on the firings. [Soon], the CFTC will only have one
Commissioner, with no further Commissioner nominations
on the horizon. Absent a nomination by the President, the
SEC is separately set to have a three-member Republican-
only commission by the end of 2025, despite the statutory
requirement and long history of being bipartisan.21
This represents an attack on critical democratic safeguards and
sends a message to both Democratic and Republican leaders at two
regulators overseeing this market, the SEC and CFTC.
President Trump also released an executive order stating that
rules drafted by Federal financial regulators must be reviewed and
approved by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
(OIRA) within the White House’s Office of Management and Budg-
et (OMB).22 Financial agencies like the Federal Reserve (Fed), Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Associa-
tion (NCUA), the SEC, and the CFTC have traditionally issued reg-
ulations independent of the political influence of the White House.
However, when conducting these reviews, OIRA must now run an
interagency review process to allow other agencies to provide feed-
back as well.23 As a result, Trump and others in his Administra-
tion would also have a direct hand in reviewing and modifying the
rules implementing the CALAMITY Act to maximize profits for the
crypto companies they own. The CALAMITY Act does nothing to
address these massive conflicts of interest, allowing the President
and his family, along with others in his Administration, to gain
from their government positions, ensuring the new regulatory
framework works best for their digital assets, if not outright under-
mining competing digital asset products. Testifying before the Com-
mittee, one panelist, Bartlett Naylor, a Financial Policy Advocate

at Public Citizen, urged Congress to ‘‘not abdicate any powers to
hold Trump accountable. Without conflict-of-interest guardrails, ap-
proving these bills effectively endorses Trump’s conflicts. The bills
will integrate crypto into mainstream banking, serving to fatten his
grift.’’24
INCREASED INVESTOR HARM
The CALAMITY Act includes several sections that will increase
and create new harm to investors. A few of these provisions in-
clude:
1. Section 106 creates a provisional registration process that
would allow entities to escape regulation and oversight while
the rules of the bill are written. To make matters worse, the
provisional registration process is silent on whether the SEC
or state regulators may bring enforcement actions against an
entity that has filed a statement of provisional registration, so
harmed investors would have little recourse from these enti-
ties.
2. Section 202 would bring unprecedented risk to investors
through a new exemption at the SEC, labeled the 4(a)(8) ex-
emption. It would allow crypto firms to raise $75 million per
year for four years, if they intend to become a ‘‘mature
blockchain system’’ (which is explained below). This exemption
allows firms to engage in general solicitation of retail inves-
tors, which means that everyday investors could be peddled se-
curities, which would not include audited financials or issuer
obligations to continually disclose material facts about the
project. Non-accredited investors (i.e., retail investors) would
be able to purchase crypto assets up to all of their net worth
or annual income, which is a stark contrast to the Regulation
A (‘‘Reg A’’) exemption, which limits non-accredited investors to
investing up to 10% of their income or net worth.25 Firms tak-
ing advantage of Reg A must provide audited financials,26 a
business description, material risk factors, use of proceeds, and
other disclosures.27 They also are subject to ongoing reporting
requirements28 and SEC approval29 for the offering.30 Most
worryingly, state securities regulators are explicitly barred
from regulating this new exempt offering even though the SEC
rarely brings enforcement actions when harms are small. And
inexplicably, there are no requirements that the funds raised
by a crypto company must go towards developing the crypto
business or its blockchain, as is required of other securities of-
ferings.
3. Section 205 creates a mechanism for ‘‘digital commodity
issuer, digital commodity related person, digital commodity af-

filiated person, or decentralized governance system of the
blockchain system’’ to escape SEC oversight by self-certifying
that their blockchain is a ‘‘mature blockchain.’’ Section 205 de-
fines a ‘‘mature blockchain system’’ as—among other criteria
related to its functions—a blockchain that ‘‘is not controlled by
any person or group of persons under common control.’’31 How-
ever, this threshold raises various issues. According to testi-
mony from Lee Reiners, a Lecturing Fellow at Duke Univer-
sity, ‘‘There have been several examples of venture capital
firms controlling less than 20% of governance tokens and still
exerting considerable influence over a digital asset.’’32 This
section also allows a loophole for unilateral control to carry out
‘‘regular maintenance’’ and ‘‘cyber security.’’ Furthermore,
there is an exemption for ‘‘preexisting blockchains’’’ that ex-
isted before the enactment of the bill, where ‘‘at least 50 per-
cent of the units of the digital commodity related to the
blockchain system are held by persons other than the digital
commodity issuer, a digital commodity related person, or a dig-
ital commodity affiliated person.’’ Once an entity self-certifies
to the SEC that its blockchain is mature, the SEC only has 60
days to stay this self-certification (there being no proper over-
sight mechanisms for the SEC to be able to confirm that infor-
mation in the self-certification application is materially true).
If the SEC is unable to institute a stay, the blockchain is
deemed as ‘‘mature’’ and any existing assets issued on that
blockchain, or future assets, would not be subject to SEC’s
rules. Finally, SEC’s resources are not what they used to be:
the Trump Administration’s SEC Budget request for FY2026 is
lower than Biden Administration’s enacted FY2024 levels and
the SEC has already suffered an unprecedented level of exodus
of seasoned staff (by some estimates, over 15% of its workforce
has left the Commission)33 and so its engagement with poten-
tially hundreds of entities rushing to submit their self-certifi-
cations would be impracticable.
4. Section 404 and Section 406 allow customers to waive seg-
regation requirements, related to how the entity must hold the
assets of multiple customers, for participating in certain
blockchain services. If this waiver is not clarified, it could be
buried in small print terms and conditions, where investors
would waive their protections without fully understanding how
their assets could be put at risk.
Additionally, there are no criminal penalties for violations of the
new prohibitions included in the bill or a private right of action for
harmed individuals to recover losses. Without incentives to comply
with the bill, innovation in this space may not move towards pro-
ductive use cases but towards memecoins, rug pulls, and pump and
dump schemes.34 To make matters worse, under Section 302, the
31Section 205, ANS to H.R. 3633.

SEC’s ability to proactively address investor protection concerns
would be limited to responding to fraud after it happens. In fact,
the SEC is prohibited from issuing reporting requirements, proce-
dures, or standards to prevent fraud, manipulation, or insider trad-
ing.
NATIONAL SECURITY
The CALAMITY Act endangers our country’s national security
and ignores Trump’s elimination of important defenses against
criminal activity facilitated by crypto. Since taking office, Trump
has undone Congress’ decades-long crime-fighting laws and enforce-
ment rules, effectively removing the resources and examiners that
serve our national security but which could also check presidents’
self-profiteering.35 Trump has fired examiners, Inspector Generals,
gutted the Corporate Transparency Act, frozen enforcement of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and disbanded the Department of
Justice (DOJ) National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.36 Fur-
ther, in line with Trump’s executive orders, the SEC and other
agencies are rescinding regulations and intentionally failing to
carry out critical enforcement actions, including suspending several
cases for Trump donors and Trump’s crypto investors.37
Exacerbating the harm done by this bill and despite repeated
warnings to the contrary, the text fails to include authorization for
an increase in the CFTC examiners corps. This is despite the con-
siderable number that would be required to adequately enforce the
bill’s provisions, especially given the projected flood of registra-
tions; Republicans have chosen to send this segment of the crypto
industry to an agency that they know cannot sufficiently manage
the workload and have refused to provide additional resources to
do so. Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, de-
scribed the CFTC’s resource challenges in her testimony:
The CFTC is widely regarded to be the crypto industry’s
preferred regulator. It is a much smaller agency with a
much smaller budget than the SEC, and unlike the SEC,
it has no statutory investor protection mandate and lim-
ited experience regulating retail-dominated markets.38
The bill is also devoid of any meaningful national security provi-
sions. Timothy Massad, emphasized this during his testimony, stat-
ing, ‘‘it is surprising to me how little is said about the risks of illicit
finance in the Clarity Act.’’39 And separately, Carole House, Senior

Fellow, Atlantic Council, GeoEconomics Center echoed these con-
cerns at the Democratic Minority Day Hearing, highlighting that:
There is limited discussion of either illicit finance or cy-
bersecurity in the Clarity Act—many more pages are
honed on establishing large regulatory carve-outs than on
establishing expectations, driving needed industry stand-
ards or sponsoring research and development, or appro-
priating necessary resources to ensure appropriately scaled
and timely enforcement of these critical requirements. Also
important to note, especially in light of recent changes in
enforcement posture—beyond just creating the policy
framework, the government and industry must work to
apply and enforce the framework. A policy that isn’t en-
forced or implemented does nothing to benefit consumers
nor U.S. firms . . .40
The CALAMITY Act does say that the new category of entities
would be ‘‘financial institutions’’ (FIs) for the Bank Secrecy Act
(BSA), but that is simply stating the status quo: these entities are
already regulated under the BSA as FIs. Democrats pointed out
that there are many FIs under the BSA that have little or no com-
pliance requirements, thus adding specificity to ensure that they’re
expected to comply at least to the same level as other FIs under
the CFTC would be warranted (i.e., at a higher level than they are
currently regulated), yet that was rejected. Given the criminal ac-
tivity facilitated by digital assets,41 (such as ransomware, pig
butchering, investment scams, etc.), as crypto adoption increases,
so will the prevalence of those crimes; unfortunately, Republicans
also rejected any provisions that would bolster related trans-
parency, guidance, investigations, and even victim support, and
thus, these obvious threat vectors are effectively ignored. Section
110 of the CALAMITY Act prevents blockchain developers and
other providers from being classified as ‘‘money transmitters’’ thus
stopping any application of the BSA56 among other laws and regu-
lations. This includes not only individual software developers, but
also companies that are already supporting billions of dollars in
crypto activity each year, using ‘‘defi’’ applications on the
blockchain. Along with the bill’s broad exemption for the entirety
of the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, found in Sections 309
and 409, this is alarming.42 In addition to affecting the application
of economic and trade sanctions, it could prevent tax, consumer
protection, disclosure, whistleblower, anti-corruption and other
laws or regulations from applying. It is effectively a permanent
safe harbor allowing them to avoid liabilities from future law or
regulation, no matter how the blockchain and blockchain services
change.

STATE PREEMPTION
This legislation also takes the state securities regulators off the
frontlines of fighting fraud. The CALAMITY Act is silent on wheth-
er state securities regulators have antifraud, investigation, and ex-
amination authorities, as well as the authority to regulate the bro-
kerage and investment advisory industries.
At best, states would be forced to spend enormous resources liti-
gating and proving in courts that the states still have these au-
thorities to help prevent and fight fraud.43 The CALAMITY Act’s
silence could also result in multiple de facto regulatory gaps that
foster fraud and leave victims without recourse. For example, the
U.S. federal government almost never takes on cases where the
harmed investor’s losses are small. By contrast, state securities
regulators regularly pursue cases under $1 million to help the vic-
tim recover what may amount to their entire lifesavings.
ANTICOMPETITIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES
Anticompetitive business practices restrict competition in the
market and can lead to monopolies or dominant firms that leave
smaller businesses with high barriers to entry. This bill bakes in
the harmful practices by dominant crypto firms, allowing them to
consolidate power within one company, known as vertical integra-
tion. The CALAMITY Act would allow the same entity, and affili-
ates it controls, to comingle the following functions, that are sepa-
rate under today’s securities laws to avoid clear conflicts of inter-
est: running an exchange facility; operating an alternative trading
system; conducting broker-dealer activity; settling and clearing
trades; custodying assets; and offering wallet services. This legisla-
tion also does not include best execution requirements, which re-
quire brokers to carry out customer orders under the most favor-
able conditions to customers.44 Under this bill, exchanges would
also not have to post the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO), which
is a stock quote available market wide that represents the highest
buy price and the lowest sell price for a security trading on various
exchanges.45 The NBBO was created by the SEC to ensure cus-
tomers get the best available price at the time of a trade, no matter
where they execute their trade.46
Additionally, the biggest traditional finance entities, including
the big banks, will be empowered by the complexities of this bill
because they will be the best equipped to game the loopholes cre-
ated by this bill and ensure all of their activity comes under the
light touch regulation the bill provides. This means less investment
for crypto entrepreneurs. This bill would also codify the dominance
of the largest crypto firms, at the expense of startups in the space.
Democrats offered over 27 amendments aimed at addressing the
deficiencies with the CALAMITY Act, all of which were rejected by
Republicans or withdrawn:47

CFTC from finalizing joint rulemakings required under the bill
unless the agencies can meet quorum (i.e., 3 confirmed com-
missioners) and there is representation from both political par-
ties.
• The Ranking Member’s amendment (#3) establishes a
crypto investors and consumers bill of rights.
• The Ranking Member’s amendment (#2) ensures states
maintain power to address fraud in the crypto industry.
• Rep. Sherman’s amendment (#1) prevents federal bailouts
if a stablecoin or crypto issuer fails or goes bankrupt.
• Rep. Sherman’s amendment (#2) prevents the federal gov-
ernment and the Federal Reserve Banks from purchasing
crypto and Trump from enriching himself through the crypto
strategic reserve.
• Rep. Sherman’s amendment (#3) bans digital assets from
being used in campaign contributions.
• Rep. Sherman’s amendment (#4) ensures wallets comply
with Anti-Money Laundering requirements, including Know
Your Customer rules.
• Rep. Lynch’s amendment (#2) reconstitutes the Depart-
ment of Justice’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team
and calls on them to investigate Trump’s crypto companies.
• Rep. Foster’s amendment (#2) requires the SEC and CFTC
to establish a Senior Scam Hotline to provide assistance to
older Americans in avoiding fraud, scams, and other abuse re-
lated to digital assets. This amendment would also require all
Bitcoin ATMs to clearly display information about the Senior
Scam Hotline on the Bitcoin ATM.
• Rep. Garcia’s amendment (#1) ensures parity with tradi-
tional financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act. It cre-
ates a clear, enforceable obligation for custodians to monitor
and report illicit financing. This approach helps to bridge the
gap that the bill provides by bringing cross-border digital asset
flows back under the same scrutiny that the traditional bank-
ing system must adhere to.
• Rep. Pressley’s amendment requires that the U.S. Govern-
ment Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a study on the finan-
cial abuse and exploitation of vulnerable populations, including
elderly individuals and individuals who are victims of domestic
violence.
• Rep Casten’s amendment (#2) directs the Treasury’s Fi-
nancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to finalize its
rule on cryptocurrency mixers within one year of enactment of
the CALAMITY Act. A mixer is an anonymity enhancing serv-
ice that obfuscates transactional information that would other-
wise be visible on a public blockchain. For example, while

• Rep. Tlaib’s amendment prohibits crypto issued by a com-
pany owned, affiliated, or controlled by the President or their
family members from being required to be used to conduct
transactions with the government.
• Rep. Lynch’s amendment (#1) requires the Inspector Gen-
erals of the Treasury and the SEC to conduct an annual report
on any presidential crypto holdings.
• Rep. Lynch’s amendment (#2) amends the Patriot Act and
permits financial institutions to share information about cyber-
enabled financial crime and fraud. This would allow financial
institutions to identify and report to the federal government
activities that may involve money laundering or terrorist ac-
tivities.
• Rep. Lynch’s amendment (#4) strikes language in the bill
that adds innovation to the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion’s mission. Adding an innovation mandate is unnecessary
because the SEC’s long-held mission to protect investors, main-
tain fair, orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital
formation already has innovation built in.
• Rep. Himes amendment (#1) prohibits federally elected of-
ficials from issuing any digital assets or owning a financial
stake in an issuer.
• Rep. Himes’ amendment (#2) strikes the provision which
creates a new exemption for crypto issuers to raise capital from
retail investors without needing to provide them with reliable
financial disclosures or even requiring the proceeds to be used
to develop the blockchain project.
• Rep. Himes’ amendment (#3) this amendment would strike
a paragraph in Section 205 of the bill, the unworkable review
process by the SEC to determine the maturity of a blockchain.
This amendment would then authorize the SEC to receive the
necessary information to determine whether a blockchain is
mature.
• Rep. Foster’s amendment (#3) establishes a joint Financial
Influencer Task Force between the SEC and CFTC to consult
with the Federal Trade Commission, financial influencers, and
social media firms to oversee online financial advice, track
complaints, educate investors, and coordinate global standards.
• Rep. Garcia’s amendment (#2) ensures blockchain systems
follow the same recordkeeping rules as traditional systems,
supporting the Bank Secrecy Act’s Travel Rule, with basic
standards for collecting and keeping records.

fering digital commodities or related investment contracts to
