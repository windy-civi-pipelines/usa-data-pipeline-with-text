icit Control Act of 1985 or to conform to any change in appropriations for the pur-
poses of such section 1.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE RESOLUTION
Pursuant to House rule X, clause 6, the Committee on House Ad-
ministration (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Committee’’) reports
an omnibus, biennial ‘‘primary expense resolution’’ to cover the ex-
penses of each standing, permanent select, and select committee of
the House, except the Committee on Appropriations.
On March 11, 2025, by voice vote, the Committee agreed to a mo-
tion to report H. Res. 198, as amended, favorably to the House. The
resolution authorizes the aggregate amount of funding for stand-
ing, select and permanent select committees for the 119th Con-
gress.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
During the first three months of each new Congress, House rule
X, clause 7, authorizes House committees to continue operations
based on their funding authorization from the preceding session.
The continuing authorization allows committees to organize, adopt
legislative and oversight agendas, and seek spending authority
through the adoption of a primary expense resolution by the House.
The funding process begins after a House standing or select com-
mittee determines its biennial funding needs, and introduces a
House resolution seeking those funds. Under House rule X, clause
6, all funding resolutions are referred to the Committee on House
Administration. The Committee used these specific requests from
individual committees to create an omnibus expense resolution, in-
troduced by Chairman Steil and Ranking Member Morelle, to au-
thorize funding for all the committees.
After requesting and reviewing committee budget submissions,
the Committee recommends an appropriate allocation of funds.
Since this funding process merely authorizes the expenditure of
funds already provided (or to be provided) in appropriations acts,
the funding measure takes the form of a simple House resolution,
which does not require Senate or presidential approval.
119th Congress proceedings
To gather the information necessary to create the omnibus pri-
mary expense resolution, the Committee required the standing,
permanent select committees, and select committees (with the ex-
ception of the Committee on Appropriations, pursuant to the Rules
of the House of Representatives) to submit estimates for expected
expenses for both sessions of the 119th Congress. The Committee

required that committees provide line-item estimates for the fol-
lowing expenses: personnel compensation (including salaries and
lump sum payments), travel, communications, printing and repro-
duction, other services, supplies and materials, and equipment and
software costs.
To further gather the information necessary to create the omni-
bus primary expense resolution, the Committee convened a hearing
to provide the Chairs and Ranking Members of the standing, per-
manent select, and select committees with an opportunity to
present and share their views on their respective budget requests
for the 119th Congress.
During the hearing, Members of the Committee asked the Chairs
and Ranking Members about how their budget request would im-
pact their ability to conduct oversight or pursue their legislative
goals. Members of the Committee asked whether the committee
plans to hold field hearings and conduct oversight trips this Con-
gress and, if so, what additional resources are needed on a com-
mittee level and what resources would be helpful for the House to
provide as committees endeavor to take Congress to the people.
In addition, Members of the Committee asked for feedback on
programs that were implemented in the 119th Congress. Commit-
tees were asked if they utilized the eDiscovery Program, which pro-
vides committee staff with access and support services to Rel-
ativity, a leading eDiscovery software platform which allows the
handling of electronic documents in discovery and investigations.
This software automates common discovery steps such as data in-
gestion, file indexing, virus scanning and more, preparing docu-
ments to be reviewed and produced more efficiently.
Committees were also asked about the usage of House support
services such as the Deconflict Tool, which was created to assist
committees in scheduling hearings and meetings; the eForms appli-
cation, a new tool to submit payroll transactions online; and
MyExpenses, an app that allows Members and staff to submit re-
ceipts for reimbursement from their cell phone. In addition, com-
mittees were asked if they received adequate support and services
from the House to effectively carry out their legislative responsibil-
ities to hold hearings and markups.
Members of the Committee also asked the Chairs and Ranking
Members how they were managing and will manage their resources
with equity and prudence. Since the 104th Congress, House major-
ity leadership and the Chair and Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee have encouraged Chairs of the standing, permanent select,
and select committees to provide the minority with no less than
one-third of committee staff and/or resources, as determined by
each committee. These exchanges indicated that all of the commit-
tees appear to be in compliance with the traditional ‘‘two-thirds/
one-third’’ distribution of funds among the majority and minority.
In reporting out this resolution, the Committee is recommending
to the House an authorization to expend approximately
$194,352,356 in the first session, and $198,946,864 in the second
session, exclusive of the reserve fund for unanticipated expenses.
The resolution includes such a reserve fund for unanticipated ex-
penses of $2,000,000 for each session.

Authorization and oversight plans
The Committee expects the funding allocated for each committee
to be appropriately assigned by each committee to its subcommit-
tees to ensure that the committees are able to accomplish their
goals, as outlined by each committee’s authorization and oversight
plans as required by House rule X, clause 2(d)(1).
SUMMARY OF THE RESOLUTION
Section 1 adjusts the aggregate amount paid out of the applicable
accounts of the House of Representatives with respect to the 119th

Section 2 adjusts the amount provided for the expenses of each
standing, permanent select, and select committee of the House (ex-
cept the Committee on Appropriations) for expenses incurred dur-
ing the first session of the 119th Congress (the period beginning on
January 3, 2025, and ending on January 2, 2026).
