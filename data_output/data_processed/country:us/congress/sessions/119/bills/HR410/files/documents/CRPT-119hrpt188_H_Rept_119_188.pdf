119THCONGRESS REPORT
1st Session " HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ! 119–188
ALASKA NATIVE VIETNAM ERA VETERANS LAND
ALLOTMENT EXTENSION ACT OF 2025
JULY10, 2025.—Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 410]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 410) to extend the Alaska Native Vietnam era veterans
land allotment program, and for other purposes, having considered
the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and rec-
ommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 410 is to extend the Alaska Native Vietnam
era veterans land allotment program, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 410 would extend the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans
Land Allotment Program five years to end on December 29, 2030,
rather than the current end date of December 29, 2025. This exten-
sion would enable the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to con-
tinue outreach to the estimated 150 Alaska Native Vietnam vet-
erans that do not have addresses on file with BLM and who are
eligible for up to 160 acres of federal land in Alaska. With Presi-
dent Trump’s 2021 rescission of several Alaska-specific Public Land
Orders (PLOs), more federal land may be available to fulfill se-
lected allotments by eligible Alaska Native veterans, necessitating
more time to complete the program.1

When Congress passed the General Allotment Act2 in 1887, it
was unclear if it applied to Alaska Natives. To clarify, Congress
passed the Alaska Native Allotment Act (ANAA) in 1906, which al-
lowed the Secretary of the Interior to allot up to 160 acres of non-
mineral federal land in Alaska to any Alaska Native who was at
least twenty-one years old.3 This allotted land was to remain with
the allottee and their family in perpetuity.4
The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)5 was en-
acted in 1971 to settle the aboriginal land claims of Alaska Na-
tives, which had gone unresolved for more than 100 years since the
U.S. purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867.6 At the
time of ANCSA’s enactment, the Department of the Interior (DOI)
held a backlog of at least 7,000 applications for allotments under
the ANAA.7 Because ANCSA repealed the ANAA, eligible Alaska
Natives were encouraged to apply for an allotment of land before
the ANAA was repealed.8 This push was largely successful, as
10,000 individuals applied for an allotment.9 However, many Alas-
ka Natives serving overseas in the U.S. Armed Forces during the
Vietnam War were unable to submit an application for an allot-
ment or were unaware of the imminent repeal, which resulted in
many Alaska Native veterans being unable to select an allot-
ment.10
In 1998, Congress attempted to rectify this unintended con-
sequence by passing legislation that included a provision in which
Alaska Natives, or their heirs, who were eligible under ANAA and
served during the Vietnam War (serving between January 1, 1969,
and June 2, 1971), or were enlisted or drafted before December 17,
1971, to apply for an allotment of land.11 The opportunities for al-
lotted land came from vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved par-
cels.12 These restrictions proved challenging to navigate, and out of
the 3,000 eligible service members, only 500 applied.13 Noting the
need to address the lack of success following the 1998 legislation,

quire applicants to prove they had used and occupied the parcel for at least five years to qualify
for an allotment, but it also expanded the allotment eligibility to include national forest land
as long as the applicant could prove the necessary occupancy and use. See Alaska Native Lands

Congress amended the law in 2000 and again in 2004.14 Despite
these changes, approximately 2,800 eligible Alaska Natives had yet
to receive their allotment.15
In the 116th Congress, Congress passed the John D. Dingell, Jr.
Conservation Management, and Recreation Act, which included a
provision establishing the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans
Land Allotment Program.16 The provision authorized eligible Alas-
ka Native Vietnam veterans, or their heirs, to select an allotment
of up to 160 acres from certain federal land. To be eligible, the ap-
plicant (or their heir) must show proof of service between August
5, 1964, and December 31, 1971, and have not previously received
an allotment. This provision authorized an application period of
five years beginning after final regulations were issued, which cur-
rently is from December 28, 2020, to December 29, 2025.17
In January 2021, under President Trump, then-Secretary of the
Interior David Bernhardt signed the revocation of 11 Public Land
Orders (PLOs) initially put in place in 1972 and 1973 for the ben-
efit of Alaska Native Corporations under ANCSA.18 Then-Secretary
Bernhardt’s action opened up 28 million acres of BLM land which
could be used for allotment purposes.19 However, in February 2021,
the Biden Administration postponed the revocation, prompting a
battle that waged throughout the Biden Administration’s term.20
In February 2024, Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan ex-
pressed concerns that then-Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland’s
ordering of further environmental impact statements was unneces-
sarily delaying the allotment program.21 The senators also high-
lighted that over the three years the program had been up and
running, only 18 of the more than 2,000 eligible Alaska Native vet-
erans had received their allotments.22 On February 26, 2024, the
BLM website for the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Al-
lotment Program showed that only 15 applications had been certifi-
cated or completed during the three years the program operated.23
BLM data through January 24, 2025, indicated that 41 applications
have been certificated, with 378 applications in process. It was also
noted that the BLM still needs addresses for 150 eligible vet-

erans.24 Considering how slow the process has been for BLM to re-
view and certify applications, it is unlikely that all eligible Alaska
Native Vietnam veterans would receive their promised allotments
without extending the program.
On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive
Order (EO) titled Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Po-
tential in which Public Land Order No. 7899, 7900, 7901, 7902, and
7903 were reinstated as originally issued on January 11, 2021.25
This EO also required the Department of the Interior to review all
PLOs to ensure that Interior’s actions are consistent with several
Alaska related statutes, including the Alaska Native Vietnam-era
Veterans Land Allotment Program.26
H.R. 410 would extend the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans
Land Allotment Program for five more years beyond its current ex-
piration of December 29, 2025.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 410 was introduced on January 15, 2025, by Representative
Nicholas Begich (R–AK). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee
on Indian and Insular Affairs. On February 5, 2025, the Sub-
committee on Indian and Insular Affairs held a hearing on the bill.
On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural Resources met to con-
sider the bill. The Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs was
discharged from further consideration of H.R. 410 by unanimous
consent. The bill was ordered favorably reported to the House of
Representatives by unanimous consent.
