This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Agricultural Risk Review Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ON THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN
INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(8) INCLUSION OF THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.—The Secretary of Agri-
culture shall be a member of the Committee with respect to a covered trans-
action that involves—
‘‘(A) agricultural land;
‘‘(B) agriculture biotechnology; or
‘‘(C) the agriculture industry, including agricultural transportation, stor-
age, and processing.’’.
SEC. 3. CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL LAND TRANSACTIONS.
Section 721(b)(1) of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565(b)(1)) is
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(I) CONSIDERATIONOFCERTAINAGRICULTURALLANDTRANSACTIONS.—
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—After receiving notification from the Secretary of
Agriculture of a reportable agricultural land transaction, the Com-
mittee shall determine—
‘‘(I) whether the transaction is a covered transaction; and
‘‘(II) if the Committee determines that the transaction is a cov-
ered transaction, whether the Committee should initiate a review
pursuant to subparagraph (D), or take another action authorized
under this section, with respect to the reportable agricultural land
transaction.
‘‘(ii) REPORTABLE AGRICULTURAL LAND TRANSACTION.—In this sub-
paragraph, the term ‘reportable agricultural land transaction’ means a
transaction—
‘‘(I) that the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe is a
covered transaction, based on information from or in cooperation
with the intelligence community;
‘‘(II) that involves the acquisition of an interest in agricultural
land by a foreign person of the People’s Republic of China, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, or
the Islamic Republic of Iran; and

port to the Secretary of Agriculture under section 2(a) of the Agri-
cultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978.
‘‘(iii) SUNSET.—The requirements under this subparagraph shall ter-
minate, with respect to a foreign person of the respective foreign coun-
try, on the date that the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, or the Islamic Re-
public of Iran, as the case may be, is removed from the list of foreign
adversaries in section 791.4 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations.’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 27, 2025, by Representative Frank Lucas
(OK–03), H.R. 1713, the Agricultural Risk Review Act of 2025,
would formally add the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture
to the Committee on Foreign Investment of the United States
(CFIUS) for the purposes of covered transactions related to agri-
culture. The bill would also require CFIUS to examine transactions
referred to it by the Secretary of Agriculture that involve acquisi-
tions by foreign persons from China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Secretary of Agriculture is an official CFIUS member for ag-
ricultural transactions, but the Secretary’s status is established
under an annual appropriations rider. H.R. 1713 would make this
participation a permanent statutory requirement. It would also es-
tablish new coordination between CFIUS and the Department of

Agriculture, which already monitors foreign land purchases under
the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act. This will allow
CFIUS to obtain a greater understanding of covered transactions
and respond more effectively to purchases involving countries of
concern.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1713 is to increase CFIUS
scrutiny of covered transactions related to agriculture, and specifi-
cally to examine transactions referred to it by the Secretary of Ag-
riculture that involve acquisitions by foreign persons from China,
Russia, North Korea, or Iran.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1713. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344 (as amended
by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104–4), the Committee adopts as its own the cost esti-
mate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget and Im-
poundment Control Act of 1974.

H.R. 1713 would require the Department of Agriculture (USDA)
to notify the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (CFIUS) of any agricultural land purchased by a foreign in-
vestor that may raise national security concerns. CFIUS, an inter-
agency committee, reviews potential national security threats of
foreign investment in the United States. The committee would de-
termine whether the transactions qualify as covered transactions
under its authority and take appropriate action based on that de-
termination. The bill also would add USDA to CFIUS.
Under current law, foreign investors are required to disclose to
USDA their acquisition or disposal of agricultural land. Although
USDA does not currently assess land transactions for national se-
curity risks, it does provide agencies in the intelligence community
with information on land purchased by investors from certain coun-
tries. Using information from USDA and CFIUS about staffing re-
quirements for similar notification and review activities, CBO esti-
mates that implementing H.R. 1713 would cost $10 million over the
2025–2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the
availability of appropriated funds.
USDA currently participates in CFIUS investigations related to
agricultural investment upon request. Therefore, CBO estimates
that the costs to add USDA to the committee would not be signifi-
cant over the 2025–2030 period.
CBO has not reviewed H.R. 1713 for intergovernmental or pri-
vate-sector mandates. Section4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act excludes from the application of that act any legislative provi-
sions that are necessary for national security. CBO has determined
that the provisions of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
amended by the bill, would fall under that exclusion.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Caroline Dorminey
and Matthew Pickford (for federal costs) and Brandon Lever (for
mandates). The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.

EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or

gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

than any entity of the intelligence community, shall, on be-
half of the Committee, ensure that the requirements of
subparagraph (A) with respect to any covered transaction
that is subject to such subparagraph are met.
(6) NEGOTIATION, MODIFICATION, MONITORING, AND ENFORCE-
MENT.—
(A) DESIGNATION OF LEAD AGENCY.—The lead agency
shall negotiate, modify, monitor, and enforce, on behalf of
the Committee, any agreement entered into or condition
imposed under paragraph (3) with respect to a covered
transaction, based on the expertise with and knowledge of
the issues related to such transaction on the part of the
designated department or agency. The lead agency may, at
its discretion, seek and receive the assistance of other de-
partments or agencies in carrying out the purposes of this
paragraph.
(B) REPORTING BY DESIGNATED AGENCY.—The lead agen-
cy in connection with any agreement entered into or condi-
tion imposed with respect to a covered transaction shall—
(i) provide periodic reports to the Committee on any
material modification to any such agreement or condi-
tion imposed with respect to the transaction; and

agency that may have a material interest in such
modification.

(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a covered transaction
with respect to which an agreement is entered into

keep updated a plan for monitoring compliance with
the agreement.
(ii) ELEMENTS.—Each plan required by clause (i)
with respect to an agreement entered into under para-
graph (3)(A) shall include an explanation of—
(I) which member of the Committee will have
primary responsibility for monitoring compliance
with the agreement;

(III) how frequently compliance reviews will be
conducted;
(IV) whether an independent entity will be uti-
lized under subparagraph (E) to conduct compli-
ance reviews; and
(V) what actions will be taken if the parties fail
to cooperate regarding monitoring compliance
with the agreement.
(D) EFFECT OF LACK OF COMPLIANCE.—If, at any time
after a mitigation agreement or condition is entered into or
imposed under paragraph (3)(A), the Committee or lead
agency, as the case may be, determines that a party or
parties to the agreement or condition are not in compliance
with the terms of the agreement or condition, the Com-
mittee or lead agency may, in addition to the authority of
the Committee to impose penalties pursuant to subsection
(h)(3) and to unilaterally initiate a review of any covered
transaction under subsection (b)(1)(D)(iii)—
(i) negotiate a plan of action for the party or parties
to remediate the lack of compliance, with failure to
abide by the plan or otherwise remediate the lack of
compliance serving as the basis for the Committee to
find a material breach of the agreement or condition;
(ii) require that the party or parties submit a writ-
ten notice under clause (i) of subsection (b)(1)(C) or a
declaration under clause (v) of that subsection with re-
spect to a covered transaction initiated after the date
of the determination of noncompliance and before the
date that is 5 years after the date of the determination
to the Committee to initiate a review of the trans-
action under subsection (b); or
(iii) seek injunctive relief.
(E) USE OF INDEPENDENT ENTITIES TO MONITOR COMPLI-
ANCE.—If the parties to an agreement entered into under
paragraph (3)(A) enter into a contract with an independent
entity from outside the United States Government for the
purpose of monitoring compliance with the agreement, the
Committee shall take such action as is necessary to pre-
vent a conflict of interest from arising by ensuring that the
independent entity owes no fiduciary duty to the parties.
(F) SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.—Any agreement or condi-
tion entered into or imposed under paragraph (3)(A) shall
be considered binding on all successors and assigns unless
and until the agreement or condition terminates on its own
terms or is otherwise terminated by the Committee in its
sole discretion.
(G) ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE MEASURES.—Subject to sub-
paragraphs (A) through (F), the Committee shall develop
and agree upon methods for evaluating compliance with
any agreement entered into or condition imposed with re-
spect to a covered transaction that will allow the Com-
mittee to adequately ensure compliance without unneces-
sarily diverting Committee resources from assessing any
new covered transaction for which a written notice under
clause (i) of subsection (b)(1)(C) or declaration under clause
