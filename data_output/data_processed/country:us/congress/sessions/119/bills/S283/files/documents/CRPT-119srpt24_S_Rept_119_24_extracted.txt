ILLEGAL RED SNAPPER AND TUNA ENFORCEMENT ACT
MAY21, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 283]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 283) to require the Under Secretary
of Commerce for Standards and Technology and the Administrator
of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop a
standard methodology for identifying the country of origin of sea-
food to support enforcement against illegal, unreported, and un-
regulated fishing, and for other purposes, having considered the
same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and rec-
ommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 283, the Illegal Red Snapper and Tuna En-
forcement Act, is to mandate the Under Secretary of Commerce for
Standards and Technology, along with the Administrator of the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to estab-
lish a standardized method for determining the country of origin of
seafood. This will aid in combating illegal, unreported, and unregu-
lated (IUU) fishing, among other related objectives.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
IUU fishing activities violate national and international fishing
regulations. IUU fishing is a global issue that threatens sustain-
able fisheries and ocean ecosystems. It also threatens U.S. eco-

nomic security and puts law-abiding fishermen and seafood pro-
ducers at a significant disadvantage.1
Red snapper is among the most regulated and profitable fish in
the Gulf of America.2 It is consistently being poached by Mexican
fishermen who come into U.S. waters and then return to Mexico
with their catch. These fish are then sold in Mexico or exported
back to the United States.
One way to combat the Mexican export of poached red snapper
back into the United States is to identify the country of origin of
the fish when they are being imported into the United States at
the border. By developing a field test kit that accurately identifies
where in the Gulf of America the fish were caught, Federal and
State law enforcement officers will be able to identify the origin of
the fish and confiscate the illegally caught red snapper.
The tuna fishing industry also faces significant challenges, in-
cluding frequent mislabeling of bluefin tuna, a highly prized and
regulated species. International fishermen try to pass off foreign
tuna for high-quality ahi caught by Hawaii fishermen.3 Seafood
fraud is a widespread issue at various points along the supply
chain.
SUMMARY OF MAJOR PROVISION
S. 283 would authorize the development of a chemical analysis
that law enforcement agencies can use to determine the country of
origin from which a red snapper or tuna originated.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 283, Illegal Red Snapper and Tuna Enforcement Act, was in-
troduced on January 28, 2025, by Senator Cruz (for himself and
Senators Schatz, Britt, and Tuberville) and was referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive
Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 283 reported favorably with-
out amendment.
118th Congress
S. 3879, the Illegal Red Snapper Enforcement Act, was intro-
duced on March 6, 2024, by Senator Cruz (for himself and Senators
Tuberville and Britt) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On July 31,
2024, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice
vote, ordered S. 3879 reported favorably with an amendment (in
the nature of a substitute).

116th Congress
The Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement Act,4 which
became public law on December 20, 2019, establishes a whole-of-
government approach to counter IUU fishing and related threats to
maritime security, such as transnational organized crime, traf-
ficking, and forced labor.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 283 would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA) and National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), in consultation with Customs and Border Pro-
tection, to develop a field kit to identify the country of origin of sea-
food to enforce regulations against illegal fishing. The bill would re-
quire the agencies to conduct pilot studies to develop a method-
ology for identifying red snapper and tuna and report those find-
ings to the Congress. The bill also would authorize the Department
of Defense to provide technical assistance to help other countries
deter illegal fishing.
Under current law, NIST conducts related research on the chem-
ical differences between farmed and wild caught salmon and
shrimp. In 2024, NIST also allocated $300,000 to develop methods
using isotope ratio analysis to determine the origins of oysters.
Based on information from NIST, CBO expects that the agency
would need $2 million up front to purchase and upgrade equip-
ment, two full-time equivalent employees at an average annual cost
of $600,000, and $80,000 a year for other equipment and supplies.
CBO expects the costs incurred by NOAA would be insignificant.
4The Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement Act was enacted as part of S. 1790, the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020; Public Law 116–92, codified in 16
U.S.C. 8001 et seq.

After accounting for anticipated inflation, CBO estimates that
implementing the bill would cost $6 million over the 2025–2030 pe-
riod; any related spending would be subject to the availability of
appropriated funds.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 283 will have a limited increase effect on the number or types
of individuals and businesses regulated.
Economic Impact
S. 283 is expected to have minimal economic impact.
Privacy
S. 283 would not have a significant impact on the privacy rights
of individuals.
Paperwork
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work due to the passage of this legislation. The required report is
aimed at better operationalizing the developed methodology.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 5:
Section 2. Methodology for identifying the country of origin of sea-
food.
This section would define the terms ‘‘Administrator’’, ‘‘appro-
priate committees of Congress’’, ‘‘key agency leadership’’, ‘‘red snap-
per’’, ‘‘tuna’’, and ‘‘Under Secretary’’. It would also charge the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology and NOAA to develop
a method for identifying the country of origin of red snapper and
tuna. The method would be operationalized in the form of a simple
field kit that law enforcement officers could use to sample both spe-
cies and determine the country of origin of the fish in minimal
time.
This section would also require a report to the appropriate com-
mittees of Congress 2 years after the Act is enacted sharing the
methodology and the operational plan.

Section 6:
Section 3. Technical assistance for IUU fishing enforcement.
This section would allow the Secretary of Defense, in coordina-
tion with the Coast Guard, to use Department of Defense funds to
provide technical assistance to other nations’ maritime forces to
combat IUU fishing and transnational crime. Assistance may in-
clude deploying personnel, remote sensing, data analysis, and oper-
ational intelligence consistent with U.S. law. The authority would
extend to the Coast Guard and partner nation personnel operating
aboard U.S., partner, or international vessels to enhance global
maritime security.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
