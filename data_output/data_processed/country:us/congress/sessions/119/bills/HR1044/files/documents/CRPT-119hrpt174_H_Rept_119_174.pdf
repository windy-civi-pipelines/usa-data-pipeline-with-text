JUNE30, 2025.—Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 1044]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 1044) to amend Public Law 99–338 with respect to
Kaweah Project permits, having considered the same, reports fa-
vorably thereon without amendment and recommends that the bill
do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 1044 is to amend Public Law 99–338 with
respect to Kaweah Project permits.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International,
is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, serving
roughly 15 million people over a 50,000-square-mile area in Cen-
tral, Coastal, and Southern California.1 Since 1899, Southern Cali-
fornia Edison has operated the Kaweah Hydroelectric Project
(Project) on the Kaweah and East Fore Kaweah Rivers, located
near the community of Three Rivers in Tulare County.2 The
Kaweah Project has a generating capacity of 8.85 megawatts and
is split into three developments.3
In 1943, Congress expanded the boundaries of Sequoia National
Park and, in so doing, acquired lands that contained part of the

Project.4 As a result, Kaweah #3 has diversion dams and 4.4 miles
of flow line in the national park.5 From 1943 to 1986, Congress au-
thorized the Secretary of the Interior to extend Southern California
Edison’s special use permit to use these lands for the continued op-
eration of the project.6 Congress subsequently reauthorized the ex-
tension of this permit for ten years and provided the option to
renew for ten additional years. The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2005 allowed for two additional renewals, expiring in 2026.7
H.R. 1044, led by Representative David Valadao (R–CA–22),
would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue four addi-
tional renewals, extending the project for 40 years. Without a re-
newal, Southern California Edison would be forced to remove their
infrastructure from the area, a significant cost for the company’s
ratepayers. Extending the special use permit will allow Southern
California Edison to continue supplying reliable and affordable en-
ergy to this region.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 1044 was introduced on February 6, 2025, by Representa-
tive David Valadao (R–CA). The bill was referred to the Committee
on Natural Resources. On February 12, 2025, the Committee on
Natural Resources met to consider the bill. The bill was ordered fa-
vorably reported to the House of Representatives by unanimous
consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing in the 118th Congress by the Subcommittee on Federal Lands
held on September 18, 2024.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Amendment to Kaweah Project provision
Section 1 amends Public Law 99–338 to allow the Secretary of
the Interior to issue four 10-year renewals of an existing hydro-
electric project within Sequoia National Park. Section 1 also strikes
‘‘Southern California Edison Company,’’ allowing the project to con-
tinue in the event of a sale or name change of the company.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
