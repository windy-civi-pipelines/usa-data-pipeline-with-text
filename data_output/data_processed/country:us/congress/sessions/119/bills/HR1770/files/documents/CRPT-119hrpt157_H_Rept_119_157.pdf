mittee on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 1770 directs the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to establish a pilot program to
explore the use of artificial intelligence in support of the mission
of the CPSC and to direct the Secretary of Commerce and the Fed-
eral Trade Commission (FTC) to study and report on the use of
blockchain technology and tokens, respectively.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The CPSC is charged with protecting the public from unreason-
able risks of injury or death associated with the use of the thou-
sands of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction.1 The
CPSC has various tools to support its consumer product safety mis-
sion but faces growing challenges. The CPSC has jurisdiction over
more than 15,000 consumer products used in and around the home,
in recreation, in schools, and more.2 In addition, international
trade and technological advances have further expanded the range
of products in the market, making overseeing and regulating con-
sumer products even more complex.3 Changing consumer trends,
including the rise of online shopping, requires the CPSC to increase
its efforts to protect consumers from unsafe e-commerce shipments
entering the United States.4
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a subset of AI,
have vast potential benefits. It is important that the United States
act to secure itself as the global leader in AI. H.R. 1770 ensures
that the CPSC studies AI and related technologies, pilots their use
in the agency’s day-today functions, and understands the way AI
tools could be used to protect the public against unreasonable risk
of injury or death from consumer products.
Blockchain technology and tokens are two closely related emerg-
ing technologies with new benefits and risks for consumers. For ex-
ample, blockchain has the potential to benefit many industries
through its ability to track transactions accurately, securely, and
efficiently.5 It is important for agencies to understand how these
properties could be used in new ways to protect consumers from
fraud and other unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
H.R. 1770 is needed to help ensure our consumer protection
agencies stay up to date with emerging technologies and to encour-
age the use of emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain in
support of product safety and consumer protection.

TITLE I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
Title I requires the CPSC to establish a pilot program to explore
the use of artificial intelligence by the CPSC. The pilot program
must use artificial intelligence for tracking trends with respect to
injuries involving consumer products, identifying consumer product
hazards, monitoring the retail marketplace for the sale of recalled
consumer products, or identifying consumer products to be refused
entry by United States customs. Title I also requires the CPSC to
consult with cyber security experts, the retail industry, consumer
product manufacturers, and consumer product safety organizations
when establishing the program and to report to Congress no later
than 1 year after the conclusion of the pilot program on the find-
ings and data derived from the program.
TITLE II. BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION
Title II requires the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with
the FTC, and any other federal agency it deems appropriate, to
study the possible uses of blockchain technology for consumer pro-
tection purposes. In conducting the study, the Secretary must ex-
amine existing and emerging uses of blockchain technology to pro-
tect consumers, trends in commercial use and investment in
blockchain technology to help prevent fraud, best practices in facili-
tating public-private partnerships in blockchain technology to pre-
vent fraud, and potential benefits and risks related to the use of
blockchain technology to prevent fraud. The Secretary must provide
an opportunity for public comment and submit a report to Congress
that contains the results of the study.
TITLE III. TOKEN TAXONOMY
Title III includes Congressional findings and a requirement that
the FTC submit a report to Congress on the actions taken by the
FTC related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in transactions
relating to tokens, any efforts to prevent unfair or deceptive acts
or practices related to tokens, and any recommendations for legisla-
tion that would improve the ability of the FTC and other relevant
agencies to further protect consumers from unfair and deceptive
acts or practices in the token marketplace.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
