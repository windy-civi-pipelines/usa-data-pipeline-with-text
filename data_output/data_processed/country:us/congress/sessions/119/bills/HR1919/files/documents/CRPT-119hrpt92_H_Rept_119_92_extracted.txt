PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on March 6, 2025, by Representative Emmer, H.R.
1919, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, would amend Section
16 of the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit the Federal Reserve
Banks from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), or
any substantially similar digital asset. Additionally, the bill would
prohibit the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market
Committee from using a CBDC to implement monetary policy. The

bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System currently does not have the
authority to issue a U.S. CBDC.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
A CBDC is a digital representation of fiat currency issued by a
central bank. It uses an electronic record or digital ‘‘token’’ to rep-
resent fiat currency, denominated in the national unit of account.
To date, the Federal Reserve’s analysis states a U.S. CBDC ‘‘would
best serve the needs of the United States by being privacy-pro-
tected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified.’’1
Under a potential intermediated retail model, consumers would
hold a U.S. CBDC in an account at a financial institution respon-
sible for providing traditional consumer banking services or at a
non-bank fintech firm to manage holdings and payments. In con-
trast to a retail CBDC, a wholesale CBDC would be used only by
financial institutions for interbank settlement.
On November 15, 2021, Committee Republicans issued principles
to use to evaluate a U.S. CBDC. These principles held that any po-
tential Federal Reserve-issued digital currency must: (1) maintain
the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and the preeminence of
the U.S. payment system; (2) not impede ongoing development of
stablecoins; (3) promote private sector innovation and foster com-
petition; and (4) address privacy and security protections. Collec-
tively, these principles ensure that any proposal does not allow the
Federal Reserve or any other government agency to monopolize or
weaponize a CBDC. Further, these principles ensure policymakers
thoroughly weigh the risks of a U.S. CBDC.
In January 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System released a paper, ‘‘Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar
in the Age of Digital Transformation.’’2 In the paper, the Board
sought to facilitate a conversation around potential design configu-
rations for a U.S. CBDC. Around the same time, the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology had an initiative to test the performance and scalability of
a U.S. CBDC. This activity indicates that the Federal Reserve was
expending significant resources in furtherance of a U.S. CBDC.
Moreover, a review of the Federal Reserve Act suggests the Fed-
eral Reserve does not have the legal authority to issue a CBDC to
individuals absent authorizing legislation from Congress. The Su-
preme Court has also recognized Congress’ power to coin money
and regulate the value thereof, confirming Congress’ authority to
regulate each phase of currency.
During a Humphrey-Hawkins hearing in June 2023, Federal Re-
serve Chair Powell emphasized that there would be financial pri-
vacy risks for Americans if the Federal Reserve were to issue a
CBDC directly to individuals. Chair Powell explained that the
United States is a long way away from a CBDC but ‘‘if we were
to support at some point in the future a CBDC, it would be one

than $10,000,000,000 in total assets. The members of the Board
shall devote their entire time to the business of the Board and
shall each receive an annual salary of $15,000, payable monthly,
together with actual necessary traveling expenses.
The members of the Board shall be ineligible during the time
they are in office and for two years thereafter to hold any office,
position, or employment in any member bank, except that this re-
striction shall not apply to a member who has served the full term
for which he was appointed. Upon the expiration of the term of any
appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board in office on the
date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, the President shall
fix the term of the successor to such member at not to exceed four-
teen years, as designated by the President at the time of nomina-

term of not more than one member in any two-year period, and
thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen
years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless
sooner removed for cause by the President. Of the persons thus ap-

man for Supervision shall develop policy recommendations for the
Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institu-
tion holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the
Board, and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such
firms. The chairman of the Board, subject to its supervision, shall
be its active executive officer. Each member of the Board shall
within fifteen days after notice of appointment make and subscribe
to the oath of office. Upon the expiration of their terms of office,
members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors
are appointed and have qualified. Any person appointed as a mem-
ber of the Board after the date of enactment of the Banking Act
of 1935 shall not be eligible for reappointment as such member
after he shall have served a full term of fourteen years.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
have power to levy semiannually upon the Federal reserve banks,
in proportion to their capital stock and surplus, an assessment suf-
ficient to pay its estimated expenses and the salaries of its mem-
bers and employees for the half year succeeding the levying of such
assessment, together with any deficit carried forward from the pre-
ceding half year, and such assessments may include amounts suffi-
cient to provide for the acquisition by the Board in its own name
of such site or building in the District of Columbia as in its judg-
ment alone shall be necessary for the purpose of providing suitable
and adequate quarters for the performance of its functions. After
September 1, 2000, the Board may also use such assessments to ac-
quire, in its own name, a site or building (in addition to the facili-
ties existing on such date) to provide for the performance of the
functions of the Board. After approving such plans, estimates, and
specifications as it shall have caused to be prepared, the Board
may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, cause to be con-
structed on any site so acquired by it a building or buildings suit-
able and adequate in its judgment for its purposes and proceed to
take all such steps as it may deem necessary or appropriate in con-
nection with the construction, equipment, and furnishing of such
building or buildings. The Board may maintain, enlarge, or re-
model any building or buildings so acquired or constructed and
shall have sole control of such building or buildings and space
therein.
The principal offices of the Board shall be in the District of Co-
lumbia. At meetings of the Board the chairman shall preside, and,
in his absence, the vice chairman shall preside. In the absence of
the chairman and the vice chairman, the Board shall elect a mem-
ber to act as chairman pro tempore. The Board shall determine and
prescribe the manner in which its obligations shall be incurred and
its disbursements and expenses allowed and paid, and may leave
on deposit in the Federal Reserve banks the proceeds of assess-
ments levied upon them to defray its estimated expenses and the
salaries of its members and employees, whose employment, com-
pensation, leave, and expenses shall be governed solely by the pro-
visions of this Act, specific amendments thereof, and rules and reg-
ulations of the Board not inconsistent therewith; and funds derived
from such assessments shall not be construed to be Government
funds or appropriated moneys. No member of the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System shall be an officer or director

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System he shall certify
under oath that he has complied with this requirement, and such
certification shall be filed with the secretary of the Board. When-
ever a vacancy shall occur, other than by expiration of term, among
the six members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System appointed by the President as above provided, a successor
shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, to fill such vacancy, and when appointed he
shall hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor.
The President shall have power to fill all vacancies that may
happen on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
during the recess of the Senate by granting commissions which
shall expire with the next session of the Senate.
Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed as taking away
any powers heretofore vested by law in the Secretary of the Treas-
ury which relate to the supervision, management, and control of
the Treasury Department and bureaus under such department, and
wherever any power vested by this Act in the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal reserve agent ap-

such powers shall be exercised subject to the supervision and con-
trol of the Secretary.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall an-
nually make a full report of its operations to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, who shall cause the same to be printed

paragraph shall include the reports required under section 707 of
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, section 18(f)(7) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act, section 114 of the Truth in Lending Act,
and the tenth undesignated paragraph of this section.
No Federal Reserve bank may authorize the acquisition or con-
struction of any branch building, or enter into any contract or other
obligation for the acquisition or construction of any branch build-

keep a complete record of the action taken by the Board and by the
Federal Open Market Committee upon all questions of policy relat-
ing to open-market operations and shall record therein the votes
taken in connection with the determination of open-market policies
and the reasons underlying the action of the Board and the Com-
mittee in each instance. The Board shall keep a similar record with
respect to all questions of policy determined by the Board, and
shall include in its annual report to the Congress a full account of
the action so taken during the preceding year with respect to open-
market policies and operations and with respect to the policies de-
termined by it and shall include in such report a copy of the
records required to be kept under the provisions of this paragraph.

NOTE ISSUES.
SEC. 16. Federal Reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the pur-
pose of making advances to Federal Reserve banks through the
Federal reserve agents as hereinafter set forth and for no other
purpose, are hereby authorized. The said notes shall be obligations
of the United States and shall be receivable by all national and
member banks and Federal Reserve banks and for all taxes, cus-
toms, and other public dues. They shall be redeemed in lawful
money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United
States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any
Federal Reserve bank.
Any Federal Reserve bank may make application to the local
Federal Reserve agent for such amount of the Federal Reserve
notes hereinbefore provided for as it may require. Such application
shall be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal Reserve
agent of collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal Re-
serve notes thus applied for and issued pursuant to such applica-
tion. The collateral security thus offered shall be notes, drafts, bills
of exchange, or acceptances acquired under section 10A, 10B, 13,
or 13A of this Act, or bills of exchange endorsed by a member bank
of any Federal Reserve district and purchased under the provisions
of section 14 of this Act, or bankers’ acceptances purchased under
the provisions of said section 14, or gold certificates, or Special
Drawing Right certificates, or any obligations which are direct obli-

gations of, or are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the United States or any agency thereof, or assets that Federal Re-
serve banks may purchase or hold under section 14 of this Act or
any other asset of a Federal reserve bank. In no event shall such
collateral security be less than the amount of Federal Reserve
notes applied for. The Federal Reserve agent shall each day notify
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of all issues
and withdrawals of Federal Reserve notes to and by the Federal
Reserve bank to which he is accredited. The said Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System may at any time call upon
a Federal Reserve bank for additional security to protect the Fed-
eral Reserve notes issued to it. Collateral shall not be required for
Federal Reserve notes which are held in the vaults of, or are other-
wise held by or on behalf of, Federal Reserve banks.
Federal Reserve notes shall bear upon their faces a distinctive
letter and serial number which shall be assigned by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System to each Federal Reserve
bank. Federal Reserve notes unfit for circulation shall be canceled,
destroyed, and accounted for under procedures prescribed and at
locations designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Upon de-
struction of such notes, credit with respect thereto shall be appor-
tioned among the twelve Federal Reserve banks as determined by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
have the right, acting through the Federal Reserve agent, to grant
in whole or in part, or to reject entirely the application of any Fed-
eral Reserve bank for Federal Reserve notes; but to the extent that
such applicaton may be granted the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System shall, through its local Federal Reserve agent,
supply Federal Reserve notes to the banks so applying, and such
bank shall be charged with the amount of the notes issued to it and
shall pay such rate of interest as may be established by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on only that amount
of such notes which equals the total amount of its outstanding Fed-
eral Reserve notes less the amount of gold certificates held by the
Federal Reserve agent as collateral security. Federal Reserve notes
issued to any such bank shall, upon delivery, together with such
notes of such Federal Reserve bank as may be issued under section
18 of this Act upon security of United States 2 per centum Govern-
ment bonds, become a first and paramount lien on all the assets
of such bank.
Any Federal Reserve bank may at any time reduce its liability
for outstanding Federal Reserve notes by depositing with the Fed-
eral Reserve agent its Federal Reserve notes, gold certificates, Spe-
cial Drawing Right certificates, or lawful money of the United
States. Federal Reserve notes so deposited shall not be reissued,
except upon compliance with the conditions of an original issue.
The liability of a Federal Reserve bank with respect to its out-
standing Federal Reserve notes shall be reduced by any amount
paid by such bank to the Secretary of the Treasury under section
4 of the Old Series Currency Adjustment Act.
Any Federal Reserve bank may at its discretion withdraw collat-
eral deposited with the local Federal Reserve agent for the protec-
tion of its Federal Reserve notes issued to it and shall at the same
time substitute therefor other collateral of equal amont with the

approval of the Federal Reserve agent under regulations to be pre-
scribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Any Federal Reserve bank may retire any of its Federal Reserve
notes by depositing them with the Federal Reserve agent or with
the Treasurer of the United States, and such Federal Reserve bank
shall thereupon be entitled to receive back the collateral deposited
with the Federal Reserve agent for the security of such notes. Any
Federal Reserve bank shall further be entitled to receive back the
collateral deposited with the Federal Reserve agent for the security
of any notes with respect to which such bank has made payment
to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 4 of the Old Series
Currency Adjustment Act. Federal Reserve notes so deposited shall
not be reissued except upon compliance with the conditions of an
original issue.
All Federal Reserve notes and all gold certificates, Special Draw-
ing Right certificates, and lawful money issued to or deposited with
any Federal Reserve agent under the provisions of the Federal Re-
serve Act shall hereafter be held for such agent, under such rules
and regulations as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System may prescribe, in the joint custody of himself and the Fed-
eral Reserve bank to which he is accredited. Such agent and such
Federal Reserve bank shall be jointly liable for the safekeeping of
such Federal Reserve notes, gold certificates, Special Drawing
Right certificates, and lawful money. Nothing herein contained,
however, shall be construed to prohibit a Federal Reserve agent
from depositing gold certificates and Special Drawing Right certifi-
cates with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
to be held by such Board subject to his order, or with the Treasurer
of the United States for the purposes authorized by law.
In order to furnish suitable notes for circulation as Federal re-
serve notes, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause plates and
dies to be engraved in the best manner to guard against counter-
feits and fraudulent alterations, and shall have printed therefrom
and numbered such quantities of such notes of the denominations
of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 as
may be required to supply the Federal reserve banks. Such notes
shall be in form and tenor as directed by the Secretary of the
Treasury under the provisions of this Act and shall bear the dis-
tinctive numbers of the several Federal reserve banks through
which they are issued.
When such notes have been prepared, the notes shall be de-
livered to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem subject to the order of the Secretary of the Treasury for
the delivery of such notes in accordance with this Act.
The plates and dies to be procured by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury for the printing of such circulating notes shall remain under
his control and direction, and the expenses necessarily incurred in
executing the laws relating to the procuring of such notes, and all
other expenses incidental to their issue and retirement, shall be
paid by the Federal reserve banks, and the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System shall include in its estimate of ex-
penses levied against the Federal reserve banks a sufficient
amount to cover the expenses herein provided for.

printing of national-bank notes or notes provided for by the Act of
May thirtieth, nineteen hundred and eight, and any distinctive
paper that may be on hand at the time of the passage of this Act
may be used in the discretion of the Secretary for the purposes of
this Act, and should the appropriations heretofore made be insuffi-
cient to meet the requirements of this Act in addition to circulating
notes provided for by existing law, the Secretary is hereby author-
ized to use so much of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise ap-
propriated for the purpose of furnishing the notes aforesaid: Pro-
vided, however, That nothing in this section contained shall be con-
strued as exempting national banks or Federal reserve banks from
their liability to reimburse the United States for any expenses in-
curred in printing and issuing circulating notes. (Omitted from
U.S. Code)
Every Federal reserve bank shall receive on deposit at par from
depository institutions or from Federal reserve banks checks and
other items, including negotiable orders of withdrawal and share
drafts and drafts drawn upon any of its depositors, and when re-

ing negotiable orders of withdrawal and share drafts and drafts
drawn by any depositor in any other Federal reserve bank or de-
pository institution upon funds to the credit of said depositor in
said reserve bank or depository institution. Nothing herein con-
tained shall be construed as prohibiting a depository institution
from charging its actual expense incurred in collecting and remit-
ting funds, or for exchange sold to its patrons. The Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System shall, by rule, fix the charges
to be collected by the depository institutions from its patrons whose
checks and other items, including negotiable orders of withdrawal
and share drafts are cleared through the Federal reserve Bank and
the charge which may be imposed for the service of clearing or col-
lection rendered by the Federal reserve bank.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
make and promulgate from time to time regulations governing the
transfer of funds and charges therefor among Federal reserve

a clearing house for depository institutions.
The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed

Special Drawing Right certificates, on the order of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System to any Federal Reserve

chairman, or such other officers or members as the Board may by
regulation prescribe. The form of such order shall be approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.
The expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out these provi-

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 1919 would immediately halt and prohibit the United
States from exploring the potential benefits of a central bank dig-
ital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital currency that is issued
by a country’s central bank and the value of which is pegged to the
national currency. The two more prominent types of CBDCs are
‘‘retail CBDCs’’ and ‘‘wholesale CBDCs.’’ Retail CBDCs are made
available to consumers, either directly from the Fed (‘‘direct
CBDC’’) or through a bank or other financial institution (‘‘inter-
mediated or indirect CBDC’’).1 A wholesale CBDC would not be
available to the public but rather would only be available to banks
and potentially other financial institutions, and likely would be
used for interbank settlement or large cross-border payments.
H.R. 1919 would prohibit the Federal Reserve (Fed), particularly
their 12 Federal Reserve Banks, from offering products or services
directly to individuals; maintaining an account for individuals; or
researching, testing, or issuing a retail CBDC, including indirectly
through a financial institution or other intermediary. The bill’s
sweeping ban fails to accurately distinguish between retail and
wholesale CBDCs. For example, while some of the bill’s provisions
focus on prohibiting a retail CBDC, the bill’s new sense of Congress
that the Fed lacks authority to issue any kind of CBDC, including
wholesale CBDCs, would undermine opportunities to research, test,
and issue wholesale CBDCs that could drastically reduce the costs
of cross-border payments. For example, one study from JPMorgan
Chase and Oliver Wyman found that global companies make more
than $23 trillion in cross-border payments, roughly about 25% of
global GDP. They estimate a wholesale CBDC network could save
$100 billion a year, reducing the transaction costs from $120 billion
to facilitate those cross-border payments to about $20 billion.2
Furthermore, H.R. 1919 would effectively prohibit the issuance of
a CBDC in the U.S. before the U.S. has even had a chance to fully
explore the benefits, challenges, and design options. As of April
2025, there are 134 countries and currency unions, representing
98% of global GDP, that are exploring a CBDC, which is up from
35 countries in May 2020.3 As other countries race ahead and com-
pete to develop and implement CBDCs to harness what could prove
to be critical in the evolving global financial landscape, this bill
would keep the U.S. behind the starting line.
To the extent that cryptocurrencies offer certain benefits, a
CBDC could also offer those same benefits while having a greater
potential to gain broad public trust and utilization (especially after
numerous digital assets have been used to defraud Americans),
overcome challenges with regard to interchangeability, avoid vola-

tility in value, and prioritize financial inclusion and consumer pro-
tection. CBDCs may also have the potential to provide faster pay-
ment transactions and lower transaction fees for consumers and
small businesses.
During the 118th Congress in a March 2023 full Committee
hearing, when asked whether the Fed would need Congressional
authorization to issue a CBDC, Fed Chair Jerome Powell distin-
guished between retail and wholesale CBDCs.4 He stated, ‘‘we’ve
always been talking about retail CBDC and [that’s] something we
would certainly need congressional approval for’’ yet potential
forms of wholesale CBDCs would be ‘‘less clear.’’5 Around this
time, Rep. Emmer introduced H.R. 5403—an earlier version of this
bill (H.R. 1919). H.R. 5403 passed the House last Congress by a
vote of 216–192.
Shortly after being inaugurated, on January 23rd President
Trump issued an executive order on digital assets (EO).6 This EO
prohibits CBDCs, including a restriction on any agency activity re-
lated to the creation of CBDCs. The EO utilizes similar language
to the version of this bill from the 118th Congress.7 The EO bans
any ‘‘form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the
national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central
bank.’’8 When read broadly, this could have sweeping ramifications
for existing Fed programs, like FedNow.
H.R. 1919 is opposed by the following groups: Public Citizen,
Americas for Financial Reform, Rau´l Carrillo (Academic Fellow, Co-
lumbia Law School), Rohan Grey (Assistant Professor of Law, Wil-
lamette University College of Law).
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 1919.

rency, or any digital asset that is substantially similar under any other name or
label, and will not have such authority unless Congress grants it under Congress’s
Article 1 Section 8 powers.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on March 6, 2025, by Representative Emmer, H.R.
1919, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, would amend Section
16 of the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit the Federal Reserve
Banks from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), or
any substantially similar digital asset. Additionally, the bill would
prohibit the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market
Committee from using a CBDC to implement monetary policy. The

bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System currently does not have the
authority to issue a U.S. CBDC.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
A CBDC is a digital representation of fiat currency issued by a
central bank. It uses an electronic record or digital ‘‘token’’ to rep-
resent fiat currency, denominated in the national unit of account.
To date, the Federal Reserve’s analysis states a U.S. CBDC ‘‘would
best serve the needs of the United States by being privacy-pro-
tected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified.’’1
Under a potential intermediated retail model, consumers would
hold a U.S. CBDC in an account at a financial institution respon-
sible for providing traditional consumer banking services or at a
non-bank fintech firm to manage holdings and payments. In con-
trast to a retail CBDC, a wholesale CBDC would be used only by
financial institutions for interbank settlement.
On November 15, 2021, Committee Republicans issued principles
to use to evaluate a U.S. CBDC. These principles held that any po-
tential Federal Reserve-issued digital currency must: (1) maintain
the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and the preeminence of
the U.S. payment system; (2) not impede ongoing development of
stablecoins; (3) promote private sector innovation and foster com-
petition; and (4) address privacy and security protections. Collec-
tively, these principles ensure that any proposal does not allow the
Federal Reserve or any other government agency to monopolize or
weaponize a CBDC. Further, these principles ensure policymakers
thoroughly weigh the risks of a U.S. CBDC.
In January 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System released a paper, ‘‘Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar
in the Age of Digital Transformation.’’2 In the paper, the Board
sought to facilitate a conversation around potential design configu-
rations for a U.S. CBDC. Around the same time, the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology had an initiative to test the performance and scalability of
a U.S. CBDC. This activity indicates that the Federal Reserve was
expending significant resources in furtherance of a U.S. CBDC.
Moreover, a review of the Federal Reserve Act suggests the Fed-
eral Reserve does not have the legal authority to issue a CBDC to
individuals absent authorizing legislation from Congress. The Su-
preme Court has also recognized Congress’ power to coin money
and regulate the value thereof, confirming Congress’ authority to
regulate each phase of currency.
During a Humphrey-Hawkins hearing in June 2023, Federal Re-
serve Chair Powell emphasized that there would be financial pri-
vacy risks for Americans if the Federal Reserve were to issue a
CBDC directly to individuals. Chair Powell explained that the
United States is a long way away from a CBDC but ‘‘if we were
to support at some point in the future a CBDC, it would be one

dent shall appoint at least 1 member with demonstrated primary
experience working in or supervising community banks having less
than $10,000,000,000 in total assets. The members of the Board
shall devote their entire time to the business of the Board and
shall each receive an annual salary of $15,000, payable monthly,
together with actual necessary traveling expenses.
The members of the Board shall be ineligible during the time
they are in office and for two years thereafter to hold any office,
position, or employment in any member bank, except that this re-
striction shall not apply to a member who has served the full term
for which he was appointed. Upon the expiration of the term of any
appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board in office on the
date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, the President shall
fix the term of the successor to such member at not to exceed four-
teen years, as designated by the President at the time of nomina-
tion, but in such manner as to provide for the expiration of the
term of not more than one member in any two-year period, and
thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen
years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless
sooner removed for cause by the President. Of the persons thus ap-
pointed, 1 shall be designated by the President, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, to serve as Chairman of the
Board for a term of 4 years, and 2 shall be designated by the Presi-
dent, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve
as Vice Chairmen of the Board, each for a term of 4 years, 1 of
whom shall serve in the absence of the Chairman, as provided in
the fourth undesignated paragraph of this section, and 1 of whom

shall be designated Vice Chairman for Supervision. The Vice Chair-
man for Supervision shall develop policy recommendations for the
Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institu-
tion holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the
Board, and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such
firms. The chairman of the Board, subject to its supervision, shall
be its active executive officer. Each member of the Board shall
within fifteen days after notice of appointment make and subscribe
to the oath of office. Upon the expiration of their terms of office,
members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors
are appointed and have qualified. Any person appointed as a mem-
ber of the Board after the date of enactment of the Banking Act
of 1935 shall not be eligible for reappointment as such member
after he shall have served a full term of fourteen years.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
have power to levy semiannually upon the Federal reserve banks,
in proportion to their capital stock and surplus, an assessment suf-
ficient to pay its estimated expenses and the salaries of its mem-
bers and employees for the half year succeeding the levying of such
assessment, together with any deficit carried forward from the pre-
ceding half year, and such assessments may include amounts suffi-
cient to provide for the acquisition by the Board in its own name
of such site or building in the District of Columbia as in its judg-
ment alone shall be necessary for the purpose of providing suitable
and adequate quarters for the performance of its functions. After
September 1, 2000, the Board may also use such assessments to ac-
quire, in its own name, a site or building (in addition to the facili-
ties existing on such date) to provide for the performance of the
functions of the Board. After approving such plans, estimates, and
specifications as it shall have caused to be prepared, the Board
may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, cause to be con-
structed on any site so acquired by it a building or buildings suit-
able and adequate in its judgment for its purposes and proceed to
take all such steps as it may deem necessary or appropriate in con-
nection with the construction, equipment, and furnishing of such
building or buildings. The Board may maintain, enlarge, or re-
model any building or buildings so acquired or constructed and
shall have sole control of such building or buildings and space
therein.
The principal offices of the Board shall be in the District of Co-
lumbia. At meetings of the Board the chairman shall preside, and,
in his absence, the vice chairman shall preside. In the absence of
the chairman and the vice chairman, the Board shall elect a mem-
ber to act as chairman pro tempore. The Board shall determine and
prescribe the manner in which its obligations shall be incurred and
its disbursements and expenses allowed and paid, and may leave
on deposit in the Federal Reserve banks the proceeds of assess-
ments levied upon them to defray its estimated expenses and the
salaries of its members and employees, whose employment, com-
pensation, leave, and expenses shall be governed solely by the pro-
visions of this Act, specific amendments thereof, and rules and reg-
ulations of the Board not inconsistent therewith; and funds derived
from such assessments shall not be construed to be Government
funds or appropriated moneys. No member of the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System shall be an officer or director

company; and before entering upon his duties as a member of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System he shall certify
under oath that he has complied with this requirement, and such
certification shall be filed with the secretary of the Board. When-
ever a vacancy shall occur, other than by expiration of term, among
the six members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System appointed by the President as above provided, a successor
shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, to fill such vacancy, and when appointed he
shall hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor.
The President shall have power to fill all vacancies that may
happen on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
during the recess of the Senate by granting commissions which
shall expire with the next session of the Senate.
Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed as taking away
any powers heretofore vested by law in the Secretary of the Treas-
ury which relate to the supervision, management, and control of
the Treasury Department and bureaus under such department, and
wherever any power vested by this Act in the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal reserve agent ap-
pears to conflict with the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury,
such powers shall be exercised subject to the supervision and con-
trol of the Secretary.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall an-
nually make a full report of its operations to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, who shall cause the same to be printed
for the information of the Congress. The report required under this
paragraph shall include the reports required under section 707 of
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, section 18(f)(7) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act, section 114 of the Truth in Lending Act,
and the tenth undesignated paragraph of this section.
No Federal Reserve bank may authorize the acquisition or con-
struction of any branch building, or enter into any contract or other
obligation for the acquisition or construction of any branch build-
ing, without the approval of the Board.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
keep a complete record of the action taken by the Board and by the
Federal Open Market Committee upon all questions of policy relat-
ing to open-market operations and shall record therein the votes
taken in connection with the determination of open-market policies
and the reasons underlying the action of the Board and the Com-
mittee in each instance. The Board shall keep a similar record with
respect to all questions of policy determined by the Board, and
shall include in its annual report to the Congress a full account of
the action so taken during the preceding year with respect to open-
market policies and operations and with respect to the policies de-
termined by it and shall include in such report a copy of the
records required to be kept under the provisions of this paragraph.

NOTE ISSUES.
SEC. 16. Federal Reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the pur-
pose of making advances to Federal Reserve banks through the
Federal reserve agents as hereinafter set forth and for no other
purpose, are hereby authorized. The said notes shall be obligations
of the United States and shall be receivable by all national and
member banks and Federal Reserve banks and for all taxes, cus-
toms, and other public dues. They shall be redeemed in lawful
money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United
States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any
Federal Reserve bank.
Any Federal Reserve bank may make application to the local
Federal Reserve agent for such amount of the Federal Reserve
notes hereinbefore provided for as it may require. Such application
shall be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal Reserve
agent of collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal Re-
serve notes thus applied for and issued pursuant to such applica-
tion. The collateral security thus offered shall be notes, drafts, bills
of exchange, or acceptances acquired under section 10A, 10B, 13,
or 13A of this Act, or bills of exchange endorsed by a member bank
of any Federal Reserve district and purchased under the provisions
of section 14 of this Act, or bankers’ acceptances purchased under
the provisions of said section 14, or gold certificates, or Special
Drawing Right certificates, or any obligations which are direct obli-

gations of, or are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the United States or any agency thereof, or assets that Federal Re-
serve banks may purchase or hold under section 14 of this Act or
any other asset of a Federal reserve bank. In no event shall such
collateral security be less than the amount of Federal Reserve
notes applied for. The Federal Reserve agent shall each day notify
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of all issues
and withdrawals of Federal Reserve notes to and by the Federal
Reserve bank to which he is accredited. The said Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System may at any time call upon
a Federal Reserve bank for additional security to protect the Fed-
eral Reserve notes issued to it. Collateral shall not be required for
Federal Reserve notes which are held in the vaults of, or are other-
wise held by or on behalf of, Federal Reserve banks.
Federal Reserve notes shall bear upon their faces a distinctive
letter and serial number which shall be assigned by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System to each Federal Reserve
bank. Federal Reserve notes unfit for circulation shall be canceled,
destroyed, and accounted for under procedures prescribed and at
locations designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Upon de-
struction of such notes, credit with respect thereto shall be appor-
tioned among the twelve Federal Reserve banks as determined by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
have the right, acting through the Federal Reserve agent, to grant
in whole or in part, or to reject entirely the application of any Fed-
eral Reserve bank for Federal Reserve notes; but to the extent that
such applicaton may be granted the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System shall, through its local Federal Reserve agent,
supply Federal Reserve notes to the banks so applying, and such
bank shall be charged with the amount of the notes issued to it and
shall pay such rate of interest as may be established by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on only that amount
of such notes which equals the total amount of its outstanding Fed-
eral Reserve notes less the amount of gold certificates held by the
Federal Reserve agent as collateral security. Federal Reserve notes
issued to any such bank shall, upon delivery, together with such
notes of such Federal Reserve bank as may be issued under section
18 of this Act upon security of United States 2 per centum Govern-
ment bonds, become a first and paramount lien on all the assets
of such bank.
Any Federal Reserve bank may at any time reduce its liability
for outstanding Federal Reserve notes by depositing with the Fed-
eral Reserve agent its Federal Reserve notes, gold certificates, Spe-
cial Drawing Right certificates, or lawful money of the United
States. Federal Reserve notes so deposited shall not be reissued,
except upon compliance with the conditions of an original issue.
The liability of a Federal Reserve bank with respect to its out-
standing Federal Reserve notes shall be reduced by any amount
paid by such bank to the Secretary of the Treasury under section
4 of the Old Series Currency Adjustment Act.
Any Federal Reserve bank may at its discretion withdraw collat-
eral deposited with the local Federal Reserve agent for the protec-
tion of its Federal Reserve notes issued to it and shall at the same
time substitute therefor other collateral of equal amont with the

approval of the Federal Reserve agent under regulations to be pre-
scribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Any Federal Reserve bank may retire any of its Federal Reserve
notes by depositing them with the Federal Reserve agent or with
the Treasurer of the United States, and such Federal Reserve bank
shall thereupon be entitled to receive back the collateral deposited
with the Federal Reserve agent for the security of such notes. Any
Federal Reserve bank shall further be entitled to receive back the
collateral deposited with the Federal Reserve agent for the security
of any notes with respect to which such bank has made payment
to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 4 of the Old Series
Currency Adjustment Act. Federal Reserve notes so deposited shall
not be reissued except upon compliance with the conditions of an
original issue.
All Federal Reserve notes and all gold certificates, Special Draw-
ing Right certificates, and lawful money issued to or deposited with
any Federal Reserve agent under the provisions of the Federal Re-
serve Act shall hereafter be held for such agent, under such rules
and regulations as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System may prescribe, in the joint custody of himself and the Fed-
eral Reserve bank to which he is accredited. Such agent and such
Federal Reserve bank shall be jointly liable for the safekeeping of
such Federal Reserve notes, gold certificates, Special Drawing
Right certificates, and lawful money. Nothing herein contained,
however, shall be construed to prohibit a Federal Reserve agent
from depositing gold certificates and Special Drawing Right certifi-
cates with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
to be held by such Board subject to his order, or with the Treasurer
of the United States for the purposes authorized by law.
In order to furnish suitable notes for circulation as Federal re-
serve notes, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause plates and
dies to be engraved in the best manner to guard against counter-
feits and fraudulent alterations, and shall have printed therefrom
and numbered such quantities of such notes of the denominations
of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 as
may be required to supply the Federal reserve banks. Such notes
shall be in form and tenor as directed by the Secretary of the
Treasury under the provisions of this Act and shall bear the dis-
tinctive numbers of the several Federal reserve banks through
which they are issued.
When such notes have been prepared, the notes shall be de-
livered to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem subject to the order of the Secretary of the Treasury for
the delivery of such notes in accordance with this Act.
The plates and dies to be procured by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury for the printing of such circulating notes shall remain under
his control and direction, and the expenses necessarily incurred in
executing the laws relating to the procuring of such notes, and all
other expenses incidental to their issue and retirement, shall be
paid by the Federal reserve banks, and the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System shall include in its estimate of ex-
penses levied against the Federal reserve banks a sufficient
amount to cover the expenses herein provided for.

May thirtieth, nineteen hundred and eight, and any distinctive
paper that may be on hand at the time of the passage of this Act
may be used in the discretion of the Secretary for the purposes of
this Act, and should the appropriations heretofore made be insuffi-
cient to meet the requirements of this Act in addition to circulating
notes provided for by existing law, the Secretary is hereby author-
ized to use so much of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise ap-
propriated for the purpose of furnishing the notes aforesaid: Pro-
vided, however, That nothing in this section contained shall be con-
strued as exempting national banks or Federal reserve banks from
their liability to reimburse the United States for any expenses in-
curred in printing and issuing circulating notes. (Omitted from
U.S. Code)
Every Federal reserve bank shall receive on deposit at par from
depository institutions or from Federal reserve banks checks and
other items, including negotiable orders of withdrawal and share
drafts and drafts drawn upon any of its depositors, and when re-

ing negotiable orders of withdrawal and share drafts and drafts
drawn by any depositor in any other Federal reserve bank or de-
pository institution upon funds to the credit of said depositor in
said reserve bank or depository institution. Nothing herein con-
tained shall be construed as prohibiting a depository institution
from charging its actual expense incurred in collecting and remit-
ting funds, or for exchange sold to its patrons. The Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System shall, by rule, fix the charges
to be collected by the depository institutions from its patrons whose
checks and other items, including negotiable orders of withdrawal
and share drafts are cleared through the Federal reserve Bank and
the charge which may be imposed for the service of clearing or col-
lection rendered by the Federal reserve bank.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
make and promulgate from time to time regulations governing the
transfer of funds and charges therefor among Federal reserve
banks and their branches, and may at its discretion exercise the
functions of a clearing house for such Federal reserve banks, or
may designate a Federal reserve bank to exercise such functions,
and may also require each such bank to exercise the functions of
a clearing house for depository institutions.
The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed
to receive deposits of gold or of gold certificates or of Special Draw-

of gold or gold certificates shall be payable in gold certificates, and
deposits of Special Drawing Right certificates shall be payable in
Special Drawing Right certificates, on the order of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System to any Federal Reserve
bank or Federal Reserve agent at the Treasury or at the sub-

Federal Reserve bank or such Federal Reserve agent. The order
used by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in
making such payments shall be signed by the chairman or vice
chairman, or such other officers or members as the Board may by
regulation prescribe. The form of such order shall be approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.
The expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out these provi-

posits received, and all expenses incident to the handling of such
deposits shall be paid by the Board of governors of the Federal Re-

Federal reserve banks.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as amending section

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 1919 would immediately halt and prohibit the United
States from exploring the potential benefits of a central bank dig-
ital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital currency that is issued
by a country’s central bank and the value of which is pegged to the
national currency. The two more prominent types of CBDCs are
‘‘retail CBDCs’’ and ‘‘wholesale CBDCs.’’ Retail CBDCs are made
available to consumers, either directly from the Fed (‘‘direct
CBDC’’) or through a bank or other financial institution (‘‘inter-
mediated or indirect CBDC’’).1 A wholesale CBDC would not be
available to the public but rather would only be available to banks
and potentially other financial institutions, and likely would be
used for interbank settlement or large cross-border payments.
H.R. 1919 would prohibit the Federal Reserve (Fed), particularly
their 12 Federal Reserve Banks, from offering products or services
directly to individuals; maintaining an account for individuals; or
researching, testing, or issuing a retail CBDC, including indirectly
through a financial institution or other intermediary. The bill’s
sweeping ban fails to accurately distinguish between retail and
wholesale CBDCs. For example, while some of the bill’s provisions
focus on prohibiting a retail CBDC, the bill’s new sense of Congress
that the Fed lacks authority to issue any kind of CBDC, including
wholesale CBDCs, would undermine opportunities to research, test,
and issue wholesale CBDCs that could drastically reduce the costs
of cross-border payments. For example, one study from JPMorgan
Chase and Oliver Wyman found that global companies make more
than $23 trillion in cross-border payments, roughly about 25% of
global GDP. They estimate a wholesale CBDC network could save
$100 billion a year, reducing the transaction costs from $120 billion
to facilitate those cross-border payments to about $20 billion.2
Furthermore, H.R. 1919 would effectively prohibit the issuance of
a CBDC in the U.S. before the U.S. has even had a chance to fully
explore the benefits, challenges, and design options. As of April
2025, there are 134 countries and currency unions, representing
98% of global GDP, that are exploring a CBDC, which is up from
35 countries in May 2020.3 As other countries race ahead and com-
pete to develop and implement CBDCs to harness what could prove
to be critical in the evolving global financial landscape, this bill
would keep the U.S. behind the starting line.
To the extent that cryptocurrencies offer certain benefits, a
CBDC could also offer those same benefits while having a greater
potential to gain broad public trust and utilization (especially after
numerous digital assets have been used to defraud Americans),
overcome challenges with regard to interchangeability, avoid vola-

tility in value, and prioritize financial inclusion and consumer pro-
tection. CBDCs may also have the potential to provide faster pay-
ment transactions and lower transaction fees for consumers and
small businesses.
During the 118th Congress in a March 2023 full Committee
hearing, when asked whether the Fed would need Congressional
authorization to issue a CBDC, Fed Chair Jerome Powell distin-
guished between retail and wholesale CBDCs.4 He stated, ‘‘we’ve
always been talking about retail CBDC and [that’s] something we
would certainly need congressional approval for’’ yet potential
forms of wholesale CBDCs would be ‘‘less clear.’’5 Around this
time, Rep. Emmer introduced H.R. 5403—an earlier version of this
bill (H.R. 1919). H.R. 5403 passed the House last Congress by a
vote of 216–192.
Shortly after being inaugurated, on January 23rd President
Trump issued an executive order on digital assets (EO).6 This EO
prohibits CBDCs, including a restriction on any agency activity re-
lated to the creation of CBDCs. The EO utilizes similar language
to the version of this bill from the 118th Congress.7 The EO bans
any ‘‘form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the
national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central
bank.’’8 When read broadly, this could have sweeping ramifications
for existing Fed programs, like FedNow.
H.R. 1919 is opposed by the following groups: Public Citizen,
Americas for Financial Reform, Rau´l Carrillo (Academic Fellow, Co-
lumbia Law School), Rohan Grey (Assistant Professor of Law, Wil-
lamette University College of Law).
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 1919.
