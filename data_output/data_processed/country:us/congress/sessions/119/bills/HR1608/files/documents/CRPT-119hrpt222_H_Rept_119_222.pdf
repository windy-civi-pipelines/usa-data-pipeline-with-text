SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Vehicular Ter-
rorism Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) On January 1, 2025, a devastating vehicular terrorist attack occurred on
Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, when an assailant inspired by the
Islamic State drove a vehicle into a crowd and engaged in a shootout with law
enforcement. This tragic incident resulted in the loss of 14 lives and injuries
to at least thirty-five others, including two police officers.
(2) Vehicle-ramming attacks and other vehicular terrorist incidents represent
an enduring and evolving threat to public safety in the United States and
around the world, targeting innocent civilians and first responders.
(3) These attacks, carried out by both organized terrorist groups and indi-
vidual actors, often aim to exploit high-density public gatherings, critical infra-
structure, and key transportation hubs, causing mass casualties and widespread
disruption.
(4) Emerging automotive technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, Ad-
vanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) capabilities, and ride-sharing plat-
forms, create new vulnerabilities that could be leveraged by malicious actors to
conduct sophisticated vehicle-based attacks.
(5) The Department of Homeland Security, through agencies like the Trans-
portation Security Administration and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Se-
curity Agency, plays a vital role in detecting, assessing, and mitigating the risks
associated with vehicle-based threats.
(6) Strengthened coordination between Federal, State, local, Tribal, territorial,
and private sector stakeholders is essential to enhance prevention, prepared-
ness, and response efforts, ensuring the safety of communities across the nation.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1608, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Vehicular Ter-
rorism Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2025,’’ requires the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to produce a comprehensive report on
the Department’s efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to threats
associated with vehicular terrorism. This report, due within 180
days of enactment, is to be developed in coordination with the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
The legislation requires the Department to assess current and
emerging threats posed by vehicle-ramming attacks and the poten-
tial exploitation of advanced automotive technologies, including au-
tonomous and connected vehicles. It also mandates a review of
high-risk locations vulnerable to such attacks, an analysis of secu-
rity countermeasures, coordination practices with law enforcement
and industry, and recommendations for deploying advanced tech-
nologies and protective infrastructure.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
On January 1, 2025, a deadly vehicular terrorist attack occurred
on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, when an assailant
inspired by the Islamic State drove a vehicle into a crowded area
before engaging in a shootout with law enforcement.1 The attack
resulted in the deaths of 14 individuals and injuries to at least doz-
ens of others.2 This tragedy underscores the growing threat posed
by vehicle-ramming attacks, particularly at public events and soft-
target locations.
Vehicular terrorism has emerged as a tactic of choice among both
foreign terrorist organizations and homegrown violent extremists

due to its simplicity, accessibility, and devastating impact.3 High-
profile terrorist groups such, as ISIS and al-Qaeda, have repeatedly
encouraged followers to use vehicles as weapons, citing the ease
with which such attacks can be carried out with minimal training
or resources.4 This tactic has been deployed across major global cit-
ies, often targeting pedestrian zones, transit hubs, and celebratory
events.5
The threat landscape is further complicated by technological ad-
vancements in the automotive sector. The increasing availability of
autonomous vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS),
and connected vehicle platforms introduces new vulnerabilities that
could be exploited by malicious actors. These systems may be sub-
ject to manipulation or cyber intrusion, creating opportunities for
more sophisticated or large-scale vehicular attacks.
Despite the evolving nature of this threat, Federal coordination
remains uneven and fragmented. While the Department plays a
central role in safeguarding critical infrastructure and public gath-
erings, there is a growing need for a more strategic and integrated
Federal response. This includes improving threat assessments, ac-
celerating the deployment of countermeasures, and strengthening
partnerships with state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) entities,
and private sector stakeholders, particularly in the transportation,
rideshare, and automotive manufacturing industries.
H.R. 1608 addresses this gap by requiring the Department to de-
velop a timely and detailed threat assessment that evaluates both
current and emerging risks related to vehicular terrorism. The re-
port will inform Congress and security stakeholders about defen-
sive strategies, vehicle-disabling technologies, infrastructure protec-
tions, coordination mechanisms, public awareness efforts, and pri-
vacy considerations. With major domestic mass gatherings and
global events on the horizon, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup
and 2028 Summer Olympics, this legislation will ensure the Fed-
eral government is proactively addressing the vehicular terrorism
threat to protect the American public and international visitors.
HEARINGS
The Committee held the following hearing in the 119th Congress
that informed H.R. 1608:
On Tuesday, April 8, 2025, the Subcommittee on Transportation
and Maritime Security held a hearing entitled, ‘‘America on the
Global Stage: Examining Efforts to Secure and Improve the U.S.
Travel System for Significant International Events.’’ The Sub-
committee received testimony from the following witnesses: Mr.
Geoff Freeman, President and Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Travel
Association; Mr. Jon Gruen, Chief Executive Officer, Fortem Tech-
nologies; and Dr. Everett Kelley, National President, American
Federation of Government Employees.

Section 2. Findings
This section outlines Congress’s findings regarding the persistent
and evolving threat of vehicular terrorism. It references the Janu-
ary 1, 2025, attack in New Orleans and highlights the vulnerability
of soft targets, the influence of terrorist propaganda, and the emer-
gence of risks related to autonomous vehicles, ride-sharing plat-
forms, and cybersecurity. The section emphasizes DHS’s critical
role in countering these threats and the need for collaboration
across all levels of government and the private sector.
Section 3. Report on emerging threats and countermeasures related
to vehicular terrorism
This section requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in co-
ordination with the TSA Administrator and the CISA Director, to
submit a comprehensive report to the appropriate congressional
committees within 180 days of enactment. The report must provide
a detailed assessment of the Department’s efforts to detect, pre-
vent, and respond to threats associated with vehicular terrorism.
Specifically, the report must evaluate current and emerging
threats, including tactics and motivations used by perpetrators,
and examine how advanced vehicle technologies, such as autono-
mous vehicles, connected platforms, and ADAS-equipped systems,
could be exploited by malicious actors. It must also identify high-
risk locations and events that are vulnerable to vehicular attacks,
such as critical infrastructure sites, large public gatherings, and
pedestrian-heavy urban areas, and describe the measures being
taken to mitigate these risks.
The report must include a summary of actions taken by the De-
partment and its components to deploy protective infrastructure,
geofencing tools, and surveillance systems, as well as the Depart-
ment’s coordination with state, local, tribal, and territorial govern-
ments and private sector partners to develop and implement deter-
rent strategies. Additionally, it must review the Department’s en-
gagement with industry stakeholders, such as rental car compa-
nies, ride-sharing platforms, and vehicle manufacturers, to estab-
lish security protocols and prevent misuse of vehicles for nefarious
purposes. The report must also describe ongoing efforts to train law
enforcement and first responders, conduct joint exercises, and pro-
vide resources to jurisdictions of varying capacities to improve pre-
paredness.
Further, the report is required to present recommendations for
the development and deployment of advanced technologies, includ-
ing vehicle disablement tools, predictive analytics, artificial intel-
ligence-enabled monitoring systems, and cybersecurity safeguards
