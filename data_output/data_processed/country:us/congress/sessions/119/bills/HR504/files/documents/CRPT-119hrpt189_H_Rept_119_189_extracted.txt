1st Session " HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ! Part 1
MICCOSUKEE RESERVED AREA AMENDMENTS ACT
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 504]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 504) to amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act to au-
thorize the expansion of the Miccosukee Reserved Area and to
carry out activities to protect structures within the Osceola Camp
from flooding, and for other purposes, having considered the same,
reports favorably thereon without amendment and recommends
that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 504 is to amend the Miccosukee Reserved
Area Act to authorize the expansion of the Miccosukee Reserved
Area and to carry out activities to protect structures within the
Osceola Camp from flooding, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 504 would amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act to in-
clude the Osceola Camp tribal village as part of the Miccosukee Re-
served Area and would direct the Secretary of the Interior to con-
sult with the tribe and then take appropriate actions to protect the
structures within the village from flooding.
The Miccosukee Tribe is currently located in the Greater Ever-
glades in southern Florida. The oral history of the Miccosukee
Tribe claims originality in the northern part of Florida,1 and that
the tribe’s ancestors used land stretching from the Appalachians to

the Florida Keys.2 After the Indian Removal Act of 1830 was imple-
mented, many Miccosukee and other Indian peoples hid in the Ev-
erglades and subsequently fought in the second and third Seminole
Wars.3 The tribe eventually settled and lived in what became Ever-
glades National Park, but were moved further north when the park
was officially created. Following the tribe’s federal recognition in
1962, the villages the tribe occupied in the northernmost area with-
in the park along the Tamiami Trail were managed as a special
use permit from 1964 until 1998.4 As the tribe grew, however, the
need for more land became apparent.5
Congress passed the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act (MRAA) in
1998, replacing the special use permit with a permanent frame-
work for the tribe’s occupancy in the Everglades. The MRAA au-
thorized the tribe’s use of the area, declaring it the Miccosukee Re-
serve Area (MRA) and noting it as ‘‘Indian Country.’’6 The MRAA
maintained that the federal government had the right to engage in
restoration and protection activities in the area and that any costs
associated with those activities fell to the federal government.7
The MRAA did not include the area known as the Osceola Camp,
a residential tribal village within the Everglades National Park.
The village has a residential community and associated infrastruc-
ture, including wastewater treatment and water supply systems.
Chairman Cypress identified the Osceola Camp as ‘‘one of the only
remaining Tribal tree islands inhabited by a substantial residential
community.’’8 Tree islands, formed by sediment caught in roots,
within the Everglades provided sanctuary to the Miccosukee and
Seminole ancestors during and after the Seminole Wars.9 The
Osceola Camp is currently subject to a special use permit renewal
by the National Park.10
The National Park Service is already working with the
Miccosukee Tribe to protect the Osceola Camp from flooding caused
by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the Cen-
tral Everglades Planning Project.11 By incorporating the Osceola
Camp into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, the tribe will have au-
thority over the village area and will work with the Department of
the Interior to elevate the area to prevent flooding, preserve village

119THCONGRESS REPT. 119–189
1st Session " HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ! Part 1
MICCOSUKEE RESERVED AREA AMENDMENTS ACT
JULY10, 2025.—Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany H.R. 504]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 504) to amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act to au-
thorize the expansion of the Miccosukee Reserved Area and to
carry out activities to protect structures within the Osceola Camp
from flooding, and for other purposes, having considered the same,
reports favorably thereon without amendment and recommends
that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 504 is to amend the Miccosukee Reserved
Area Act to authorize the expansion of the Miccosukee Reserved
Area and to carry out activities to protect structures within the
Osceola Camp from flooding, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 504 would amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act to in-
clude the Osceola Camp tribal village as part of the Miccosukee Re-
served Area and would direct the Secretary of the Interior to con-
sult with the tribe and then take appropriate actions to protect the
structures within the village from flooding.
The Miccosukee Tribe is currently located in the Greater Ever-
glades in southern Florida. The oral history of the Miccosukee
Tribe claims originality in the northern part of Florida,1 and that
the tribe’s ancestors used land stretching from the Appalachians to

the Florida Keys.2 After the Indian Removal Act of 1830 was imple-
mented, many Miccosukee and other Indian peoples hid in the Ev-
erglades and subsequently fought in the second and third Seminole
Wars.3 The tribe eventually settled and lived in what became Ever-
glades National Park, but were moved further north when the park
was officially created. Following the tribe’s federal recognition in
1962, the villages the tribe occupied in the northernmost area with-
in the park along the Tamiami Trail were managed as a special
use permit from 1964 until 1998.4 As the tribe grew, however, the
need for more land became apparent.5
Congress passed the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act (MRAA) in
1998, replacing the special use permit with a permanent frame-
work for the tribe’s occupancy in the Everglades. The MRAA au-
thorized the tribe’s use of the area, declaring it the Miccosukee Re-
serve Area (MRA) and noting it as ‘‘Indian Country.’’6 The MRAA
maintained that the federal government had the right to engage in
restoration and protection activities in the area and that any costs
associated with those activities fell to the federal government.7
The MRAA did not include the area known as the Osceola Camp,
a residential tribal village within the Everglades National Park.
The village has a residential community and associated infrastruc-
ture, including wastewater treatment and water supply systems.
Chairman Cypress identified the Osceola Camp as ‘‘one of the only
remaining Tribal tree islands inhabited by a substantial residential
community.’’8 Tree islands, formed by sediment caught in roots,
within the Everglades provided sanctuary to the Miccosukee and
Seminole ancestors during and after the Seminole Wars.9 The
Osceola Camp is currently subject to a special use permit renewal
by the National Park.10
The National Park Service is already working with the
Miccosukee Tribe to protect the Osceola Camp from flooding caused
by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the Cen-
tral Everglades Planning Project.11 By incorporating the Osceola
Camp into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, the tribe will have au-
thority over the village area and will work with the Department of
the Interior to elevate the area to prevent flooding, preserve village
