The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Encouraging Local Emerging Ventures and Eco-
nomic Growth Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘ELEVATE Act of 2025’’.
SEC. 2. REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.
Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l(b)) is amend-
ed—
(1) in paragraph (1)(K), by striking ‘‘years,’’ and inserting ‘‘years (or, in the
case of an emerging growth company, not more than the two preceding years),’’;
and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘Any issuer may confidentially submit to the Commission a draft registration state-
ment for confidential nonpublic review by the staff of the Commission prior to public
filing, provided that the initial confidential submission and all amendments thereto
shall be publicly filed with the Commission not later than 10 days before listing on
a national securities exchange. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the
Commission shall not be compelled to disclose any information provided to or ob-
tained by the Commission pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of section 552
of title 5, this subsection shall be considered a statute described in subsection
(b)(3)(B) of such section 552. Information described in or obtained pursuant to this
subsection shall be deemed to constitute confidential information for purposes of sec-
tion 24.’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3301, the ‘‘Encouraging Local Emerging Ventures and Eco-
nomic Growth Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘ELEVATE Act of 2025,’’ was in-
troduced on May 8, 2025, by Representative Zachary Nunn (IA–03).
H.R. 3301 updates the emerging growth company (EGC) financial
statement requirements to clarify that an EGC may present two
years, rather than three years, of audited financial statements in
both IPOs and spin-off transactions. The bill allows a spin-off of an
EGC to benefit from the two-year financial statement accommoda-
tion, which is currently only available during an IPO.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
To address the decades-long decline of small IPOs in U.S. public
markets, Title I of the JOBS Act established a new category of
issuers known as ‘‘Emerging Growth Companies.’’ These companies
are given an ‘‘on ramp’’ of up to five years to comply with certain
regulatory requirements prior to, throughout, and immediately
after the company’s IPO.1 One of these accommodations defined in
Title I provides to EGCs is the ability to go public with scaled fi-
nancial disclosure requirements, specifically providing two years of
audited financial statements rather than three years. Within the
first two years of enactment, 65 percent of EGCs used Title I’s
scaled financial statement obligations when going public.2 From
2012–2024, more than 80 percent of all U.S. IPO pricings were by
companies that qualify as EGCs.3
Currently, the spinoff of an EGC does not benefit from the two-
year financial statement accommodation, which applies only to IPO

registration. The EGC financial statement requirements should be
comparable for both an IPO and a spin-off. Equalizing the require-
ments in both scenarios as this bill does, promotes efficiency and
capital formation by reducing regulatory compliance costs for com-
panies engaging in spin-offs without sacrificing significant investor
protections.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
117TH CONGRESS
On December 2, 2022, Representative Patrick McHenry (R–NC)

ments with the Securities and Exchange Commission for confiden-
tial review, and for other purposes, with Representative Janelle
Bynum (D–OR) as an original cosponsor. The bill was referred sole-

to Capital Across America.’’
On May 20, 2025, the Committee met in open session to consider,

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

an EGC to benefit from the two-year financial statement accommo-
dation, which is currently only available during an IPO.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3301. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII and section 402 of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974, a cost estimate was not made available to the
Committee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of
the Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Con-
gressional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the Act may be cited as the ‘‘Encouraging
Local Emerging Ventures and Economic Growth Act of 2025’’ or the
‘‘ELEVATE Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Registration statements
Section 2 amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow
EGCs to present two years of audited financial statements in both
an initial public offering and spin-off transactions and permits
issuers to file draft registration statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for confidential review provided that the ini-
tial confidential submission and all amendments are publicly filed
with the Commission not later than 10 days before the issuer’s re-
quested date of effectiveness of the registration statement.

ments of, and voting trust agreements with respect to, the
issuer and any person directly or indirectly controlling or con-
trolled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the
issuer as the Commission may require as necessary or appro-
priate for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair
dealing in the security.
(3) Such copies of material contracts, referred to in para-
graph (1)(I) above, as the Commission may require as nec-
essary or appropriate for the proper protection of investors and
to insure fair dealing in the security.
Any issuer may confidentially submit to the Commission a draft
registration statement for confidential nonpublic review by the staff
of the Commission prior to public filing, provided that the initial
confidential submission and all amendments thereto shall be pub-
licly filed with the Commission not later than 10 days before listing
on a national securities exchange. Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of this title, the Commission shall not be compelled to disclose
any information provided to or obtained by the Commission pursu-
ant to this subsection. For purposes of section 552 of title 5, this
subsection shall be considered a statute described in subsection
(b)(3)(B) of such section 552. Information described in or obtained
pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to constitute confiden-
tial information for purposes of section 24.

specified class or classes of issuers, the Commission shall require
in lieu thereof the submission of such other information of com-
parable character as it may deem applicable to such class of
issuers.

security has been approved by the exchange for listing and reg-
istration, the registration shall become effective thirty days after
the receipt of such certification by the Commission or within such
shorter period of time as the Commission may determine. A secu-
rity registered with a national securities exchange may be with-
drawn or stricken from listing and registration in accordance with
the rules of the exchange and, upon such terms as the Commission
may deem necessary to impose for the protection of investors, upon
application by the issuer or the exchange to the Commission;
whereupon the issuer shall be relieved from further compliance
with the provisions of this section and section 13 of this title and
any rules or regulations under such sections as to the securities so
withdrawn or stricken. An unissued security may be registered
only in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commis-
sion may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public inter-
est or for the protection of investors.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the
Commission may by such rules and regulations as it deems nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors permit securities listed on any exchange at the time the
registration of such exchange as a national securities exchange be-
comes effective, to be registered for a period ending not later than
July 1, 1935, without complying with the provisions of this section.

(f)(1)(A) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this sec-
tion, any national securities exchange, in accordance with the re-
quirements of this subsection and the rules hereunder, may extend
unlisted trading privileges to—
(i) any security that is listed and registered on a national se-
curities exchange, subject to subparagraph (B); and
(ii) any security that is otherwise registered pursuant to this
section, or that would be required to be so registered except for
the exemption from registration provided in subparagraph (B)
or (G) of subsection (g)(2), subject to subparagraph (E) of this
paragraph.
(B) A national securities exchange may not extend unlisted trad-
ing privileges to a security described in subparagraph (A)(i) during
such interval, if any, after the commencement of an initial public
offering of such security, as is or may be required pursuant to sub-
paragraph (C).
(C) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the
Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994, the Commission shall pre-
scribe, by rule or regulation, the duration of the interval referred
to in subparagraph (B), if any, as the Commission determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, or oth-
erwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. Until the earlier
of the effective date of such rule or regulation or 240 days after
such date of enactment, such interval shall begin at the opening of
trading on the day on which such security commences trading on
the national securities exchange with which such security is reg-
istered and end at the conclusion of the next day of trading.
(D) The Commission may prescribe, by rule or regulation such
additional procedures or requirements for extending unlisted trad-
ing privileges to any security as the Commission deems necessary
or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the
protection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(E) No extension of unlisted trading privileges to securities de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(ii) may occur except pursuant to a
rule, regulation, or order of the Commission approving such exten-
sion or extensions. In promulgating such rule or regulation or in
issuing such order, the Commission—
(i) shall find that such extension or extensions of unlisted
trading privileges is consistent with the maintenance of fair
and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public
interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title;
(ii) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
securities, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such securities, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to extend
unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule of such
national securities exchange would unreasonably impair the
ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such secu-
rities for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict com-

petition among dealers in such securities or between such deal-
ers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists
and such dealers who are not specialists.
(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and
the subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for eligi-
bility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations
issued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that
unlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities
which had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964,
notwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If un-
listed trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to
this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that secu-
rity, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.
(G) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a security is the subject of an initial public offering if—
(I) the offering of the subject security is registered under
the Securities Act of 1933; and
(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to filing
the registration statement with respect to the offering, was
not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or
15(d) of this title; and
(ii) an initial public offering of such security commences at
the opening of trading on the day on which such security com-
mences trading on the national securities exchange with which
such security is registered.
(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading
on an exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privi-
leges, the Commission may summarily suspend such unlisted trad-
ing privileges on the exchange. Such suspension shall not be re-
viewable under section 25 of this title and shall not be deemed to
be a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code. Upon such suspension—
(i) the exchange shall cease trading in the security by the
close of business on the date of such suspension, or at such
time as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order for the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of this title; and
(ii) if the exchange seeks to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges to the security, the exchange shall file an application to
reinstate its ability to do so with the Commission pursuant to
such procedures as the Commission may prescribe by rule or
order for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the pro-

trading privileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted
trading privileges pursuant to such application is consistent with
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of this title. If the application is made to reinstate un-
listed trading privileges to a security described in paragraph
(1)(A)(ii), the Commission—
(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
security, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such a security, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the na-
tional securities exchange making application under this sub-
section would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to so-
licit or effect transactions in such security for its own account,
or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in
such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of
marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers who are
not specialists.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Commission shall by
rules and regulations suspend unlisted trading privileges in whole
or in part for any or all classes of securities for a period not exceed-
ing twelve months, if it deems such suspension necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or to
prevent evasion of the purposes of this title.
(4) On the application of the issuer of any security for which un-
listed trading privileges on any exchange have been continued or
extended pursuant to this subsection, or of any broker or dealer
who makes or creates a market for such security, or of any other
person having a bona fide interest in the question of termination
or suspension of such unlisted trading privileges, or on its own mo-
tion, the Commission shall by order terminate, or suspend for a pe-
riod not exceeding twelve months, such unlisted trading privileges
for such security if the Commission finds, after appropriate notice
and opportunity for hearing, that such termination or suspension
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors.
(5) In any proceeding under this subsection in which appropriate
notice and opportunity for hearing are required, notice of not less
than ten days to the applicant in such proceeding, to the issuer of
the security involved, to the exchange which is seeking to continue
or extend or has continued or extended unlisted trading privileges
for such security, and to the exchange, if any, on which such secu-
rity is listed and registered, shall be deemed adequate notice, and
any broker or dealer who makes or creates a market for such secu-
rity, and any other person having a bona fide interest in such pro-
ceeding, shall upon application be entitled to be heard.
(6) Any security for which unlisted trading privileges are contin-
ued or extended pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be
registered on a national securities exchange within the meaning of
this title. The powers and duties of the Commission under this title
shall be applicable to the rules of an exchange in respect to any

as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors, either unconditionally or upon specified
terms and conditions, or for stated periods, exempt such securities
from the operation of any provision of section 13, 14, or 16 of this
title.
(g)(1) Every issuer which is engaged in interstate commerce, or
in a business affecting interstate commerce, or whose securities are
traded by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce shall—
(A) within 120 days after the last day of its first fiscal year
ended on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by either—
(i) 2,000 persons, or
(ii) 500 persons who are not accredited investors (as such
term is defined by the Commission), and
(B) in the case of an issuer that is a bank, a savings and
loan holding company (as defined in section 10 of the Home
Owners’ Loan Act), or a bank holding company, as such term
is defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), not later than 120 days after the last
day of its first fiscal year ended after the effective date of this
subsection, on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons,
register such security by filing with the Commission a registration
statement (and such copies thereof as the Commission may require)
with respect to such security containing such information and docu-
ments as the Commission may specify comparable to that which is
required in an application to register a security pursuant to sub-
section (b) of this section. Each such registration statement shall
become effective sixty days after filing with the Commission or
within such shorter period as the Commission may direct. Until
such registration statement becomes effective it shall not be
deemed filed for the purposes of section 18 of this title. Any issuer
may register any class of equity security not required to be reg-
istered by filing a registration statement pursuant to the provisions
of this paragraph. The Commission is authorized to extend the date
upon which any issuer or class of issuers is required to register a
security pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in respect
of—
(A) any security listed and registered on a national securities
exchange.
(B) any security issued by an investment company registered
pursuant to section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
(C) any security, other than permanent stock, guaranty
stock, permanent reserve stock, or any similar certificate evi-
dencing nonwithdrawable capital, issued by a savings and loan
association, building and loan association, cooperative bank,
homestead association, or similar institution, which is super-
vised and examined by State or Federal authority having su-
pervision over any such institution.

purposes than cooperative associations so defined.
(F) any security issued by a mutual or cooperative organiza-
tion which supplies a commodity or service primarily for the
benefit of its members and operates not for pecuniary profit,
but only if the security is part of a class issuable only to per-
sons who purchase commodities or services from the issuer, the
security is transferable only to a successor in interest or occu-
pancy of premises serviced or to be served by the issuer, and
no dividends are payable to the holder of the security.
(G) any security issued by an insurance company if all of the
following conditions are met:
(i) Such insurance company is required to and does file
an annual statement with the Commissioner of Insurance
(or other officer or agency performing a similar function)
of its domiciliary State, and such annual statement con-
forms to that prescribed by the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners or in the determination of such
State commissioner, officer or agency substantially con-
forms to that so prescribed.
(ii) Such insurance company is subject to regulation by
its domiciliary State of proxies, consents, or authorizations
in respect of securities issued by such company and such
regulation conforms to that prescribed by the National As-
sociation of Insurance Commissioners.
(iii) After July 1, 1966, the purchase and sales of securi-
ties issued by such insurance company by beneficial own-
ers, directors, or officers of such company are subject to
regulation (including reporting) by its domiciliary State
substantially in the manner provided in section 16 of this
title.

certificate of deposit for such a security, if the Commission finds
that such exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors.
(4) Registration of any class of security pursuant to this sub-
section shall be terminated ninety days, or such shorter period as
the Commission may determine, after the issuer files a certification
with the Commission that the number of holders of record of such
class of security is reduced to less than 300 persons, or, in the case
of a bank, a savings and loan holding company (as defined in sec-
tion 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act), or a bank holding com-
pany, as such term is defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), 1,200 persons persons. The
Commission shall after notice and opportunity for hearing deny ter-
mination of registration if it finds that the certification is untrue.
Termination of registration shall be deferred pending final deter-
mination on the question of denial.
(5) For the purposes of this subsection the term ‘‘class’’ shall in-
clude all securities of an issuer which are of substantially similar
character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar
rights and privileges. The Commission may for the purpose of this
subsection define by rules and regulations the terms ‘‘total assets’’
and ‘‘held of record’’ as it deems necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors in order to prevent
circumvention of the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of
this subsection, a security futures product shall not be considered
a class of equity security of the issuer of the securities underlying
the security futures product. For purposes of determining whether
an issuer is required to register a security with the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (1), the definition of ‘‘held of record’’ shall
not include securities held by persons who received the securities
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions ex-
empted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Secu-
rities Act of 1933.
(6) EXCLUSION FOR PERSONS HOLDING CERTAIN SECURITIES.—
The Commission shall, by rule, exempt, conditionally or uncon-
ditionally, securities acquired pursuant to an offering made

sions of this subsection.
(h) The Commission may by rules and regulations, or upon appli-
cation of an interested person, by order, after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, exempt in whole or in part any issuer or class
of issuers from the provisions of subsection (g) of this section or
from section 13, 14, or 15(d) or may exempt from section 16 any
officer, director, or beneficial owner of securities of any issuer, any
security of which is required to be registered pursuant to sub-
section (g) hereof, upon such terms and conditions and for such pe-
riod as it deems necessary or appropriate, if the Commission finds,
by reason of the number of public investors, amount of trading in-
terest in the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of
the issuer, income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, that such
action is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection
of investors. The Commission may, for the purposes of any of the
above-mentioned sections or subsections of this title, classify
issuers and prescribe requirements appropriate for each such class.

(i) In respect of any securities issued by banks and savings asso-
ciations the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the powers, functions, and duties
vested in the Commission to administer and enforce sections
10A(m), 12, 13, 14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f), and 16 of this Act, and sec-
tions 302, 303, 304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, (1) with respect to national banks and Federal
savings associations, the accounts of which are insured by the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation are vested in the Comptroller
of the Currency, (2) with respect to all other member banks of the
Federal Reserve System are vested in the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, and (3) with respect to all other in-
sured banks and State savings associations, the accounts of which
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are
vested in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Comp-
troller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall
have the power to make such rules and regulations as may be nec-
essary for the execution of the functions vested in them as provided
in this subsection. In carrying out their responsibilities under this
subsection, the agencies named in the first sentence of this sub-
section shall issue substantially similar regulations to regulations
and rules issued by the Commission under sections 10A(m), 12, 13,
14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f) and 16 of this Act, and sections 302, 303,
304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, unless they find that implementation of substantially similar
regulations with respect to insured banks and insured institutions
are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for protec-
tion of investors, and publish such findings, and the detailed rea-
sons therefor, in the Federal Register. Such regulations of the
above-named agencies, or the reasons for failure to publish such
substantially similar regulations to those of the Commission, shall
be published in the Federal Register within 120 days of the date
of enactment of this subsection, and, thereafter, within 60 days of
any changes made by the Commission in its relevant regulations
and rules.
(j) The Commission is authorized, by order, as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors to deny, to suspend
the effective date of, to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve
months, or to revoke the registration of a security, if the Commis-
sion finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of such security has failed to comply with any provi-
sion of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder. No mem-
ber of a national securities exchange, broker, or dealer shall make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate com-
merce to effect any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale
of, any security the registration of which has been and is sus-
pended or revoked pursuant to the preceding sentence.

section or has ceased to be effective upon direction of the Presi-
dent as provided in paragraph (3).
(5) LIMITATIONS ON REVIEW OF ORDERS.—An order of the
Commission pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to re-
view only as provided in section 25(a) of this title. Review shall
be based on an examination of all the information before the
Commission at the time such order was issued. The reviewing
court shall not enter a stay, writ of mandamus, or similar re-
lief unless the court finds, after notice and hearing before a
panel of the court, that the Commission’s action is arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord-
ance with law.
(6) CONSULTATION.—Prior to taking any action described in
paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall consult with and con-
sider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, unless such consultation is im-
practicable in light of the emergency.
