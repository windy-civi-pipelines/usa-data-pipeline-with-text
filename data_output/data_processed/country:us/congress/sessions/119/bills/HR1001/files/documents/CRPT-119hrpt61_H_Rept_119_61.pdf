TO PROVIDE FOR A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO ADDRESS
THE IMPACTS OF A CERTAIN RECORD OF DECISION ON THE UPPER COL-
ORADO RIVER BASIN FUND
APRIL17, 2025.—Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of
the Union and ordered to be printed
Mr. WESTERMAN, from the Committee on Natural Resources,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
together with
ADDITIONAL VIEWS
[To accompany H.R. 1001]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 1001) to provide for a memorandum of understanding to
address the impacts of a certain record of decision on the Upper
Colorado River Basin Fund, having considered the same, reports
favorably thereon without amendment and recommends that the
bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 1001 is to provide for a memorandum of un-
derstanding to address the impacts of a certain record of decision
on the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 1001 would require the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclama-
tion) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) to enter
into a memorandum of understanding to address the impacts of the
recent record of decision (ROD) to allow flow experiments at Glen
Canyon Dam on the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund (Basin
Fund).
On July 3, 2024, Reclamation finalized and signed the ROD for
the Long-Term Experimental and Management Plan (LTEMP) Sup-
plemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Glen Canyon
Dam. This decision modifies the original LTEMP to allow for water
releases that bypass the hydropower generators to disrupt the es-
tablishment of a smallmouth bass population.

However, bypassing the dam’s hydroelectric generators, Reclama-
tion is putting at risk funding to the Basin Fund. According to the
Final EIS, from May 2024, the average impact to the Basin Fund
for these experiments ranges from $13.5 to $26.9 million, with the
worst scenario of more than $200 million.1 This revenue loss could
greatly impact the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) system,
as the Basin Fund is the main source of funding for the operation
and maintenance of dams in the system. The loss of power genera-
tion will also impact the energy supply and the cost of energy in
the region, as power distributors would need to purchase more ex-
pensive replacement power on the open market to honor existing
contractual obligations.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 1001 was introduced on February 5, 2025, by Representa-
tive Harriet Hageman (R–WY). The bill was referred to the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources. On February 12, 2025, the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources met to consider the bill. The bill was
ordered favorably reported to the House of Representatives by
unanimous consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing in the 118th Congress by the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife
and Fisheries held on November 20, 2024.
SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Memorandum of Understanding to address potential im-
pacts of a certain record of decision on the upper colorado river
basin fund
Section 1 enables the Secretary of the Interior, acting through
the Commissioner of Reclamation, and the Secretary of Energy,
acting through the Administrator of the Western Area Power Ad-
ministration (WAPA) to, as soon as practically possible, enter into
a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to address the impact of
the ‘‘Supplement to the 2016 Glen Canyon Dam Long-Term Experi-
mental and Management Plan Record of Decision.’’ The MOU es-
tablishes a plan to address the impacts the record of decision may
have on the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund, the impacts on hy-
dropower production at Glen Canyon Dam, and identify impacts of
the record of decision on species listed as threatened or endangered
under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.
1533).
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.

ADDITIONAL VIEWS
This bill would require the Departments of Energy and the Inte-
rior to analyze the potential impacts on the Upper Colorado River
Basin Fund (the Fund) resulting from the 2024 Supplement to the
2016 Glen Canyon Dam Long-Term Experimental and Manage-
ment Plan (LTEMP) Record of Decision (ROD). Specifically, the bill
directs the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the Western
Area Power Administration (WAPA), in consultation with the Glen
Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Work Group, to develop a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) to examine and address the
potential impacts of the LTEMP Supplemental Environmental Im-
pact Statement (EIS) ROD on the Fund. In this MOU, the Depart-
ments would be required to establish a plan to address the effects
that the ROD may have on the contents of the Fund, analyze and
address the impact that the ROD may have on hydropower produc-
tion at Glen Canyon Dam, and identify impacts the ROD has had
on any species listed as threatened or endangered in the Basin.
The Glen Canyon Dam, located along the Colorado River in
northern Arizona, plays a crucial role in managing water resources
across the Upper and Lower Basins. It was designed to store water
in the Upper Basin while ensuring delivery commitments to the
Lower Basin. Beyond its water management functions, the dam
provides flood control, supports recreation through the creation of
Lake Powell, and generates hydroelectric power to help meet the
region’s energy demands. Revenues from hydropower sales are de-
posited into the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund, which supports
the operation and maintenance of Colorado River Storage Project
facilities and some fish and wildlife activities.
Persistent drought conditions, over-allocation of Colorado River
water, and the escalating impacts of climate change have signifi-
cantly strained water availability for agricultural and municipal
use. Reduced water supplies also threaten ecosystems, jeopardizing
the survival of native fish and wildlife. Habitat alterations caused
by dams have had significant impacts on native species, such as
the humpback chub, which was listed as endangered in 1967. Due
to recovery efforts, the species was able to be downlisted to threat-
ened in 2021. However, it remains vulnerable and is now facing in-
creased risks from invasive smallmouth bass passing through Glen
Canyon Dam due to the increased water temperatures and declin-
ing water levels.
In response to this growing risk, the Department of the Interior
released a 2024 Supplemental EIS to the 2016 Glen Canyon
LTEMP Final EIS and ROD to address the threat of smallmouth
bass below the dam and incorporated updated sediment science to
assess the timing of high-flow experiments. The preferred alter-
native in the 2024 Supplemental EIS, known as the Cool Mix Al-
ternative, proposed modifications to the hourly, daily, and monthly

water releases from Glen Canyon Dam. The goal was to disrupt the
establishment of smallmouth bass downstream to protect native
fish species while minimizing impacts on other resources. Prelimi-
nary results indicated that the experimental flows successfully dis-
rupted smallmouth bass populations below the dam, allowing Rec-
lamation to halt the cooler water flows in November 2024.
Efforts such as the 2024 Supplemental EIS to the 2016 Glen
Canyon LTEMP FEIS and ROD play a critical role in maintaining
the functionality and sustainability of the Colorado River system
for all water users and the environment. Given intensifying
drought conditions, climate change, and increasing water demand,
Congress must ensure that federal water management balances ag-
ricultural, municipal, and industrial uses with environmental
needs. This legislation directs Reclamation and WAPA to analyze
and address how the ROD affects the Fund’s contents, assess its
impact on hydropower production at Glen Canyon Dam, and evalu-
ate its effects on threatened or endangered species in the Basin.
Congress must also ensure that policies and federal agencies take
appropriate actions to protect environmental and cultural re-
sources. Addressing drought and climate change must be a priority,
ensuring that species and ecosystems receive the water they need
to survive.
