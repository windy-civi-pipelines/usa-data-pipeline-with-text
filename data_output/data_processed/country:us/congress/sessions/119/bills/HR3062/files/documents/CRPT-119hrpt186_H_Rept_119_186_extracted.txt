PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3062, the ‘‘Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure
Act,’’ was introduced by Rep. Fedorchak (R–ND) on April 29, 2025.
H.R. 3062 would establish a more uniform, transparent, and mod-
ern process to authorize the construction, connection, operation,
and maintenance of international border-crossing facilities for the
import and export of oil and natural gas and the transmission of
electricity. The legislation would replace the existing Presidential
Permit process that has been established through Executive Order
with a statutorily directed process. Under the legislation, the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would be authorized to
review applications for cross-border oil and natural gas pipelines,
and DOE would be authorized to review applications for cross-bor-
der electric transmission facilities.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Trade of oil, gas, and electricity among the United States, Can-
ada, and Mexico has resulted in one large, integrated North Amer-
ican market. In 2024, the value of energy trade between the United
States and its North American partners exceeded $1 trillion.12 The
expansion of cross-border energy transportation infrastructure—
pipelines for oil and natural gas and transmission lines for elec-
tricity—is necessary to enable increased energy trade. A number of
new projects are proposed to further expand cross-border capacity,
but they face considerable Federal regulatory uncertainty.
Congress has not asserted its authority to establish procedures
for permitting cross-border energy infrastructure. In the absence of
a statutorily directed process, agencies have made decisions regard-
ing cross-border energy infrastructure within the context of their
interpretations of a series of Executive Orders dating back to the
1950’s. Under these Orders, the Secretary of State has the author-
ity to issue Presidential permits for cross-border liquids pipelines,
the FERC for cross-border natural gas pipelines, and the DOE for
cross-border electric transmission facilities.
The U.S. currently has over 40 cross-border electric transmission
lines between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico. These
interconnections—the majority of which are located at the Cana-
dian border—have improved reliability, fuel diversity, and effi-
ciencies in system operations, particularly for the New England,
New York, and Midwest regions. Over the last decade, the U.S. has

experienced growing net electricity imports from both Canada and
Mexico, although Canada is by far the greater trading partner. Fu-
ture cross-border electricity trade will be a function of both the de-
velopment of future generation capacity and the availability of
cross-border transmission infrastructure to move electric power.
Under current law, applications for new transmission projects will
be required to obtain a Presidential Permit and an export author-
ization from the Secretary of Energy. There are currently 18 pend-
ing export authorization applications and five pending Presidential
Permit applications before DOE.3
There are over 50 operating natural gas pipelines between the
U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico. Over the last five years,
natural gas pipeline capacity between the U.S. and Mexico has
grown significantly. According to the Energy Information Adminis-
tration (EIA), U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico averaged
a record 6.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in June 2023, sur-
passing the previous record set in June 2021.4
Under the current process to construct and operate a cross-bor-
der natural gas pipeline, any person seeking to construct and oper-
ate such facility must obtain two, separate authorizations from
FERC for the facility and an authorization under section 3 of the
Natural Gas Act (NGA) is necessary for siting, construction, or op-
eration of facilities to import or export natural gas. In addition,
pursuant to Executive Order 10485 (September 3, 1954) as amend-
ed by Executive Order 12038 (February 3, 1978), a Presidential
Permit also must be obtained for the cross-border portion of the
pipeline. Any person seeking to import or export natural gas must
also obtain a separate authorization from DOE under section 3 of
the NGA.5 For imports and exports to countries with which the
U.S. has a Free Trade Agreement, such as Canada and Mexico,
DOE is required to grant requests ‘‘without modification or delay.’’
Executive Order 12038 provides that, before a Presidential Per-
mit is issued, there must be a finding that the action is consistent
with the public interest. The criteria used for determining if an ap-
plication is consistent with the public interest is identical to the
criteria for approving applications for the siting, construction, and
operation of import and export facilities under section 3 of the
NGA.
For ‘‘border facilities’’ subject to Presidential Permit and NGA

Section 6:
section 3 review, discretion is given to FERC on a project-by-project
basis to determine the exact scope of the project review, and there-
fore the exact parameters of the Presidential Permit and section 3
application. FERC looks for a physical feature on a project, such as
a valve or meter on the interior side of the U.S. border, as an end-
point for what may be considered to lie within the Commission’s ju-
risdiction and, therefore, subject to its review procedures. From the
physical feature, the border crossing facilities would be construed
to extend to either the U.S./Canada or the U.S./Mexico border.
Crude oil trade between the U.S. and its North American trading
partners is significant. Under the current process, any person seek-

ing to construct and operate an international cross-border oil pipe-
line must obtain a Presidential Permit pursuant to Executive
Order 13337 from the Department of State. Under Executive Order
13337, the Secretary of State is to approve cross-border oil pipe-
lines that have been determined to ‘‘serve the national interest.’’
Although the Department of State will not necessarily evaluate the
same factors for each application for a Presidential Permit, its eval-
uation considers such things as the environmental impacts of the
proposed project (associated closely with the compliance with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)), the stability of trad-
ing partners from whom the U.S. obtains crude oil, the security of
transport pathways for crude oil supplies to the U.S., and the eco-
nomic benefits to the U.S.
The Committee finds that cross-border permitting authority
should be explicitly granted by statute, as opposed to the current
framework created entirely by the Executive Branch. The Com-
mittee is concerned by the inconsistent, ad hoc manner in which
Presidential Permit authority has been exercised among the agen-
cies to which it has been delegated by Executive Order. This issue
came into particular focus in the context of the State Department’s
review of the Keystone XL pipeline proposal, which originally ap-
plied for a Presidential Permit in 2008 and did not receive approval
until 2017, and subsequently had its Presidential Permit revoked
by President Biden in January 2021. The Committee also finds
that removing the Presidential Permit authority from the executive
branch will grant increased regulatory certainty to cross-border fa-
cilities that have already been issued a Presidential Permit.
The Committee finds that the statutorily directed process for
cross-border permitting embodied in H.R. 3062 would lead to more
objective and timely decisions, which in turn would create jobs,
strengthen our nation’s energy security, and support affordable and
reliable energy for Americans.
H.R. 3062 would replace the Presidential Permit requirement
with a more transparent, efficient, and effective review process.
The legislation would require those seeking to construct, connect,
operate, or maintain a border-crossing facility for the import or ex-
port of oil or natural gas, or the transmission of electricity, to ob-
tain a Certificate of Crossing. The term ‘‘border-crossing facility’’
and thus what may be considered jurisdictional for the purposes of
the Certificate of Crossing review, means the portion of the pipe-
line or transmission facility that is located within 1,000 feet of an
international boundary. This description is consistent with FERC’s
established procedures for review of Presidential Permit and NGA

Section 7:
section 3 applications. Under the legislation, the relevant official
would issue the certificate of crossing unless it is found that the
construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of border facili-
ties comprising the cross-border segment is not in the public inter-
est of the United States. Consistent with FERC’s existing proce-
dures for review of cross-border gas pipelines, the cross-border seg-
ment of the border crossing facility would be identified as the seg-
ment spanning from the international boundary to a physical fea-
ture within 1,000 feet, such as a valve or meter. This legislation
would have no effect on the requirement to obtain approval or au-
thorization under sections 3 and 7 of the NGA or the authorities
of FERC with respect to the siting of oil pipelines upstream or

have no effect on any other Federal statute that would apply to a
project for which a Certificate of Crossing is required, including
any requirements of NEPA.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 11:
Section 1. Short title
This section provides the short title of ‘‘Promoting Cross-Border
Energy Infrastructure Act.’’

Section 12:
Section 2. Approval for border-crossing facilities

Section 13:
Section 2(a)(1) provides that no person may construct, connect,
operate, or maintain a border-crossing facility for the import or ex-
port of oil or natural gas, or the transmission of electricity, across
an international border of the United States without obtaining a
certificate of crossing.

Section 14:
Section 2(a)(2) instructs relevant officials or agencies, in con-
sultation with appropriate Federal agencies, to issue a certificate
of crossing for a border-crossing facility within 120 days after final
action is taken, unless the relevant official or agency finds that the
construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the border-
crossing facility is not in the public interest of the United States.
The relevant official or agency with respect to border-crossing fa-
cilities consisting of oil or natural gas pipelines is the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission. The relevant official or agency with
respect to electric transmission facilities is the Secretary of Energy.
This section also provides additional requirements for electric
transmission facilities.

proposes to use the LNG terminal exclusively or partially for
gas that the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant will sup-
ply to the facility; or
(ii) condition an order on—
(I) a requirement that the LNG terminal offer service to
customers other than the applicant, or any affiliate of the
applicant, securing the order;
(II) any regulation of the rates, charges, terms, or condi-
tions of service of the LNG terminal; or

INTERCONNECTION AND COORDINATION OF FACILITIES; EMERGENCIES;
TRANSMISSION TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES
SEC. 202. (a) For the purpose of assuring an abundant supply of
electric energy throughout the United States with the greatest pos-
sible economy and with regard to the proper utilization and con-
servation of natural resources, the Commission is empowered and
directed to divide the country into regional districts for the vol-
untary interconnection and coordination of facilities for the genera-
tion, transmission, and sale of electric energy, and it may at any
time thereafter, upon its own motion or upon application, make
such modifications thereof as in its judgment will promote the pub-
lic interest. Each such district shall embrace an area which, in the
judgment of the Commission, can economically be served by such
interconnected and coordinated electric facilities. It shall be the
duty of the Commission to promote and encourage such inter-
connection and coordination within each such district and between
such districts. Before establishing any such district and fixing or
modifying the boundaries thereof the Commission shall give notice
to the State commission of each State situated wholly or in part
within such district, and shall afford each such State commission
reasonable opportunity to present its views and recommendations,
and shall receive and consider such views and recommendations.
(b) Whenever the Commission, upon application of any State
commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale
of electric energy, and after notice to each State commission and
public utility affected and after opportunity for hearing, finds such
action necessary or appropriate in the public interest it may by
order direct a public utility (if the Commission finds that no undue
burden will be placed upon such public utility thereby) to establish
physical connection of its transmission facilities with the facilities
of one or more other persons engaged in the transmission or sale
of electric energy, to sell energy to or exchange energy with such
persons: Provided, That the Commission shall have no authority to
compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes,
nor to compel such public utility to sell or exchange energy when
to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its
customers. The Commission may prescribe the terms and condi-
tions of the arrangement to be made between the persons affected
by any such order, including the apportionment of cost between
them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to
any of them.

(c)(1) During the continuance of any war in which the United
States is engaged, or whenever the Commission determines that an
emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for
electric energy, or a shortage of electric energy or of facilities for
the generation or transmission of electric energy, or of fuel or water
for generating facilities, or other causes, the Commission shall have
authority, either upon its own motion or upon complaint, with or
without notice, hearing, or report, to require by order such tem-
porary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, inter-
change, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will
best meet the emergency and serve the public interest. If the par-
ties affected by such order fail to agree upon the terms of any ar-
rangement between them in carrying out such order, the Commis-
sion, after hearing held either before or after such order takes ef-
fect, may prescribe by supplemental order such terms as it finds to
be just and reasonable, including the compensation or reimburse-
ment which should be paid to or by any such party.
(2) With respect to an order issued under this subsection that
may result in a conflict with a requirement of any Federal, State,
or local environmental law or regulation, the Commission shall en-
sure that such order requires generation, delivery, interchange, or
transmission of electric energy only during hours necessary to meet
the emergency and serve the public interest, and, to the maximum
extent practicable, is consistent with any applicable Federal, State,
or local environmental law or regulation and minimizes any ad-
verse environmental impacts.
(3) To the extent any omission or action taken by a party, that
is necessary to comply with an order issued under this subsection,
including any omission or action taken to voluntarily comply with
such order, results in noncompliance with, or causes such party to
not comply with, any Federal, State, or local environmental law or
regulation, such omission or action shall not be considered a viola-
tion of such environmental law or regulation, or subject such party
to any requirement, civil or criminal liability, or a citizen suit
under such environmental law or regulation.
(4)(A) An order issued under this subsection that may result in
a conflict with a requirement of any Federal, State, or local envi-
ronmental law or regulation shall expire not later than 90 days
after it is issued. The Commission may renew or reissue such order
pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) for subsequent periods, not to
exceed 90 days for each period, as the Commission determines nec-
essary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.
(B) In renewing or reissuing an order under subparagraph (A),
the Commission shall consult with the primary Federal agency
with expertise in the environmental interest protected by such law
or regulation, and shall include in any such renewed or reissued
order such conditions as such Federal agency determines necessary
to minimize any adverse environmental impacts to the extent prac-
ticable. The conditions, if any, submitted by such Federal agency
shall be made available to the public. The Commission may exclude
such a condition from the renewed or reissued order if it deter-
mines that such condition would prevent the order from adequately
addressing the emergency necessitating such order and provides in
the order, or otherwise makes publicly available, an explanation of
such determination.

(5) If an order issued under this subsection is subsequently
stayed, modified, or set aside by a court pursuant to section 313 or
any other provision of law, any omission or action previously taken
by a party that was necessary to comply with the order while the
order was in effect, including any omission or action taken to vol-
untarily comply with the order, shall remain subject to paragraph
(3).
(d) During the continuance of any emergency requiring imme-
diate action, any person or municipality engaged in the trans-
mission or sale of electric energy and not otherwise subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission may make such temporary connec-
tions with any public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Com-
mission or may construct such temporary facilities for the trans-
mission of electric energy in interstate commerce as may be nec-
essary or appropriate to meet such emergency, and shall not be-
come subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by reason of
such temporary connection or temporary construction: Provided,
That such temporary connection shall be discontinued or such tem-
porary construction removed or otherwise disposed of upon the ter-
mination of such emergency: Provided further, That upon approval
of the Commission permanent connections for emergency use only
may be made hereunder.
ø(e) After six months from the date on which this Part takes ef-
fect, no person shall transmit any electric energy from the United
States to a foreign country without first having secured an order
of the Commission authorizing it to do so. The Commission shall
issue such order upon application unless, after opportunity for
hearing, it finds that the proposed transmission would impair the
sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or would im-
pede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of fa-
cilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commis-
sion may by its order grant such application in whole or in part,
with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the
Commission may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time
to time, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown,
make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find nec-
essary or appropriate.¿
(f) The ownership or operation of facilities for the transmission
or sale at wholesale of electric energy which is (a) generated within
a State and transmitted from that State across an international
boundary and not thereafter transmitted into any other State, or
(b) generated in a foreign country and transmitted across an inter-
national boundary into a State and not thereafter transmitted into
any other State, shall not make a person a public utility subject to
regulation as such under other provisions of this part. The State
within which any such facilities are located may regulate any such
transaction øinsofar as such State regulation does not conflict with
the exercise of the Commission’s powers under or relating to sub-

Section 28:
section 202(e)¿.

cilities as crosses Federal land under the jurisdiction of such
Secretary or such other Federal agency, as the case may be.
The Secretary shall provide to any State such cooperation and tech-
nical assistance as the State may request and as he determines ap-
propriate in the selection of a transmission route. If the trans-
mission route approved by any State does not appear to be feasible
and in the public interest, the Secretary shall encourage such State
to review such route and to develop a route that is feasible and in
the public interest. Any exercise by the Secretary of the power of
eminent domain under this section shall be in accordance with
other applicable provisions of Federal law. The Secretary shall pro-
vide public notice of his intention to acquire any right-of-way before
exercising such power of eminent domain with respect to such
right-of-way.
(b) PERMIT.—Notwithstanding any transfer of functions under
the first sentence of section 301(b) of the Department of Energy Or-
ganization Act, no permit referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B) may be
issued unless øthe Commission has conducted hearings and made
the findings required under section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act
and under the applicable execution order respecting the construc-
tion, operation, maintenance, or connection at the borders of the
United States of facilities for the transmission of electric energy be-
tween the United States and a foreign country. Any finding of the
Commission under an applicable executive order referred to in this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of judicial review as an
order issued under section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act.¿ the
Secretary has conducted hearings and finds that the proposed
transmission facilities would not impair the sufficiency of electric
supply within the United States or would not impede or tend to im-
pede the coordination in the public interest of facilities subject to the
jurisdiction of the Secretary.
(c) TIMELY ACQUISITION BY OTHER MEANS.—The Secretary may
not acquire any rights-of-day under this section unless he deter-
mines that the holder or holders of a permit referred to in sub-

Section 29:
section (a)(1)(B) are unable to acquire such rights-of-way under
State condemnation authority, or after reasonable opportunity for
negotiation, without unreasonably delaying construction, taking
into consideration the impact of such delay on completion of the fa-
cilities in a timely fashion.
(d) PAYMENTS BY PERMITTEES.—(1) The property interest ac-
quired by the Secretary under this section (whether by eminent do-
main or other purchase) shall be transferred by the Secretary to
the holder of a permit referred to in subsection (b) if such holder
has made payment to the Secretary of the entire costs of the acqui-
sition of such property interest, including administrative costs. The
Secretary may accept, and expend, for purposes of such acquisition,
amounts from any such person before acquiring a property interest
to be transferred to such person under this section.
(2) If no payment is made by a permit holder under paragraph
(1), within a reasonable time, the Secretary shall offer such rights-
of-way to the original owner for reacquisition at the original price
paid by the Secretary. If such original owner refuses to reacquire
such property after a reasonable period, the Secretary shall dispose
of such property in accordance with applicable provisions of law
governing disposal of property of the United States.

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 3062, the Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act
H.R. 3062 continues a decade-long Republican effort to relitigate
decisions made with respect to the Keystone XL pipeline, a pipeline
that ceased development over four years ago.1 This bill represents
the second time this Congress that Republicans have attempted to
move the legislation through the Committee—during consideration
of the committee print for reconciliation legislation for Fiscal Year
2025, Republicans proposed a provision that would have mandated
the approval of cross-border energy infrastructure for a fee of
$50,000.2
Ostensibly, the bill is focused on transforming the current per-
mitting process created and authorized by executive orders into one
authorized by statute.3 That is a laudable goal, assuming the statu-
tory provisions do not undermine environmental laws. Unfortu-
nately, the bill focuses on protecting crude oil and refined petro-
leum pipelines in particular from the full scope of environmental
reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by
narrowing the scope of Federal authorization to solely the first
1,000 feet of the pipeline after the border, and excluding consider-
ation of the rest of the pipeline. This is particularly egregious, as
the environmental review of the entirety of the Keystone XL pipe-
line was vital in then-Secretary of State John Kerry’s recommenda-
tion to President Obama that the issuance of a Presidential Permit
would not serve the national interest.4
Furthermore, the bill forces the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission (FERC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) to become
experts in matters of foreign affairs and diplomacy by not speci-
fying which agencies they must consult before making a determina-
tion on whether or not a border-crossing facility is in the public in-
terest. This is a major departure from current procedures, which
require DOE and FERC to obtain favorable recommendations from
the State Department and Department of Defense in order to move
forward with border-crossing permits for natural gas and electric
transmission lines (crude oil and refined petroleum product pipe-
line approvals are already handled by the State Department).5
The bill also severely curtails the power of DOE to condition and
regulate the imports and exports of electricity to Canada and Mex-
ico. Section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act currently requires DOE
to grant orders authorizing the transmission of electricity between

the U.S. and a foreign nation unless it finds that the ‘‘proposed
transmission would impair the sufficiency of electric supply within
the United States or would impede or tend to impede the coordina-
tion in the public interest of facilities subject to the Commission.’’6
However, the law also gives DOE the authority to attach any condi-
tion to its approvals that it deems necessary or appropriate. Sec-
tion 2(a)(2)(C) of H.R. 3062 would completely repeal section 202(e)
of the Federal Power Act, and only allow DOE to condition its ap-
proval of electric transmission border-crossing facilities on those fa-
cilities’ compliance with reliability and grid operator requirements,
giving up any ability to engage in economic regulation.
In the 118th Congress, at a legislative hearing on February 7,
2023, the Subcommittees on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security
and Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials heard tes-
timony from Mr. Tyson Slocum, Director of the Energy Program at
Public Citizen, on legislative text nearly-identical to H.R. 3062. Mr.
Slocum testified that the provisions in the bill relating to natural
gas pipelines would allow companies to dodge the requirements of

Section 30:
section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, and easily export natural gas to
Mexico, where it could then be re-exported anywhere in the world
in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG).7 He also testified—and
DOE has since found—that increased LNG exports lead to higher
domestic natural gas prices.89 Given the correlation between do-
mestic natural gas and electricity prices, this bill will likely lead
to Americans paying more for power, heating, and cooking all at
once.
During the markup of the bill in the Energy Subcommittee, Rep-
resentative Fedorchak (R–ND) stated that ‘‘The underlying legisla-
tion does nothing to alter the environmental review of these
projects.’’10 The majority’s report similarly states that ‘‘The legisla-
tion would also have no effect on any other Federal statute that
would apply to a project for which a Certificate of Crossing is re-
quired, including any requirements of NEPA.’’ Unfortunately, the
legislative history indicates that the majority is mistaken. In the
115th Congress, a nearly identical piece of legislation, H.R. 2883,
came to the floor, and the House adopted an amendment authored
by Rep. Marc Veasey (D–TX) by voice vote clarifying that nothing
in the bill shall affect the scope of any environmental review re-
quired by NEPA.11 When this legislation was re-introduced in the
117th Congress and in this Congress, the only substantive change
from the language that passed the House in the 115th Congress
was that Rep. Veasey’s amendment had been removed.12 An
amendment adding identical language back into the bill was of-
fered by Rep. Veasey during the Energy Subcommittee’s markup of
the bill was defeated on a recorded vote.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3062, the ‘‘Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure
Act,’’ was introduced by Rep. Fedorchak (R–ND) on April 29, 2025.
H.R. 3062 would establish a more uniform, transparent, and mod-
ern process to authorize the construction, connection, operation,
and maintenance of international border-crossing facilities for the
import and export of oil and natural gas and the transmission of
electricity. The legislation would replace the existing Presidential
Permit process that has been established through Executive Order
with a statutorily directed process. Under the legislation, the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would be authorized to
review applications for cross-border oil and natural gas pipelines,
and DOE would be authorized to review applications for cross-bor-
der electric transmission facilities.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Trade of oil, gas, and electricity among the United States, Can-
ada, and Mexico has resulted in one large, integrated North Amer-
ican market. In 2024, the value of energy trade between the United
States and its North American partners exceeded $1 trillion.12 The
expansion of cross-border energy transportation infrastructure—
pipelines for oil and natural gas and transmission lines for elec-
tricity—is necessary to enable increased energy trade. A number of
new projects are proposed to further expand cross-border capacity,
but they face considerable Federal regulatory uncertainty.
Congress has not asserted its authority to establish procedures
for permitting cross-border energy infrastructure. In the absence of
a statutorily directed process, agencies have made decisions regard-
ing cross-border energy infrastructure within the context of their
interpretations of a series of Executive Orders dating back to the
1950’s. Under these Orders, the Secretary of State has the author-
ity to issue Presidential permits for cross-border liquids pipelines,
the FERC for cross-border natural gas pipelines, and the DOE for
cross-border electric transmission facilities.
The U.S. currently has over 40 cross-border electric transmission
lines between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico. These
interconnections—the majority of which are located at the Cana-
dian border—have improved reliability, fuel diversity, and effi-
ciencies in system operations, particularly for the New England,
New York, and Midwest regions. Over the last decade, the U.S. has

experienced growing net electricity imports from both Canada and
Mexico, although Canada is by far the greater trading partner. Fu-
ture cross-border electricity trade will be a function of both the de-
velopment of future generation capacity and the availability of
cross-border transmission infrastructure to move electric power.
Under current law, applications for new transmission projects will
be required to obtain a Presidential Permit and an export author-
ization from the Secretary of Energy. There are currently 18 pend-
ing export authorization applications and five pending Presidential
Permit applications before DOE.3
There are over 50 operating natural gas pipelines between the
U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico. Over the last five years,
natural gas pipeline capacity between the U.S. and Mexico has
grown significantly. According to the Energy Information Adminis-
tration (EIA), U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico averaged
a record 6.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in June 2023, sur-
passing the previous record set in June 2021.4
Under the current process to construct and operate a cross-bor-
der natural gas pipeline, any person seeking to construct and oper-
ate such facility must obtain two, separate authorizations from
FERC for the facility and an authorization under section 3 of the
Natural Gas Act (NGA) is necessary for siting, construction, or op-
eration of facilities to import or export natural gas. In addition,
pursuant to Executive Order 10485 (September 3, 1954) as amend-
ed by Executive Order 12038 (February 3, 1978), a Presidential
Permit also must be obtained for the cross-border portion of the
pipeline. Any person seeking to import or export natural gas must
also obtain a separate authorization from DOE under section 3 of
the NGA.5 For imports and exports to countries with which the
U.S. has a Free Trade Agreement, such as Canada and Mexico,
DOE is required to grant requests ‘‘without modification or delay.’’
Executive Order 12038 provides that, before a Presidential Per-
mit is issued, there must be a finding that the action is consistent
with the public interest. The criteria used for determining if an ap-
plication is consistent with the public interest is identical to the
criteria for approving applications for the siting, construction, and
operation of import and export facilities under section 3 of the
NGA.
For ‘‘border facilities’’ subject to Presidential Permit and NGA
section 3 review, discretion is given to FERC on a project-by-project
basis to determine the exact scope of the project review, and there-
fore the exact parameters of the Presidential Permit and section 3

a valve or meter on the interior side of the U.S. border, as an end-
point for what may be considered to lie within the Commission’s ju-
risdiction and, therefore, subject to its review procedures. From the
physical feature, the border crossing facilities would be construed
to extend to either the U.S./Canada or the U.S./Mexico border.

ing to construct and operate an international cross-border oil pipe-
line must obtain a Presidential Permit pursuant to Executive
Order 13337 from the Department of State. Under Executive Order
13337, the Secretary of State is to approve cross-border oil pipe-
lines that have been determined to ‘‘serve the national interest.’’
Although the Department of State will not necessarily evaluate the
same factors for each application for a Presidential Permit, its eval-
uation considers such things as the environmental impacts of the
proposed project (associated closely with the compliance with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)), the stability of trad-
ing partners from whom the U.S. obtains crude oil, the security of
transport pathways for crude oil supplies to the U.S., and the eco-
nomic benefits to the U.S.
The Committee finds that cross-border permitting authority
should be explicitly granted by statute, as opposed to the current
framework created entirely by the Executive Branch. The Com-
mittee is concerned by the inconsistent, ad hoc manner in which
Presidential Permit authority has been exercised among the agen-
cies to which it has been delegated by Executive Order. This issue
came into particular focus in the context of the State Department’s
review of the Keystone XL pipeline proposal, which originally ap-
plied for a Presidential Permit in 2008 and did not receive approval
until 2017, and subsequently had its Presidential Permit revoked
by President Biden in January 2021. The Committee also finds
that removing the Presidential Permit authority from the executive
branch will grant increased regulatory certainty to cross-border fa-
cilities that have already been issued a Presidential Permit.
The Committee finds that the statutorily directed process for
cross-border permitting embodied in H.R. 3062 would lead to more
objective and timely decisions, which in turn would create jobs,
strengthen our nation’s energy security, and support affordable and
reliable energy for Americans.
H.R. 3062 would replace the Presidential Permit requirement
with a more transparent, efficient, and effective review process.
The legislation would require those seeking to construct, connect,
operate, or maintain a border-crossing facility for the import or ex-
port of oil or natural gas, or the transmission of electricity, to ob-
tain a Certificate of Crossing. The term ‘‘border-crossing facility’’
and thus what may be considered jurisdictional for the purposes of
the Certificate of Crossing review, means the portion of the pipe-
line or transmission facility that is located within 1,000 feet of an
international boundary. This description is consistent with FERC’s
established procedures for review of Presidential Permit and NGA
section 3 applications. Under the legislation, the relevant official
would issue the certificate of crossing unless it is found that the
construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of border facili-
ties comprising the cross-border segment is not in the public inter-
est of the United States. Consistent with FERC’s existing proce-
dures for review of cross-border gas pipelines, the cross-border seg-
ment of the border crossing facility would be identified as the seg-
ment spanning from the international boundary to a physical fea-
ture within 1,000 feet, such as a valve or meter. This legislation
would have no effect on the requirement to obtain approval or au-
thorization under sections 3 and 7 of the NGA or the authorities
of FERC with respect to the siting of oil pipelines upstream or

have no effect on any other Federal statute that would apply to a
project for which a Certificate of Crossing is required, including
any requirements of NEPA.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section provides the short title of ‘‘Promoting Cross-Border
Energy Infrastructure Act.’’
Section 2. Approval for border-crossing facilities
Section 2(a)(1) provides that no person may construct, connect,
operate, or maintain a border-crossing facility for the import or ex-
port of oil or natural gas, or the transmission of electricity, across
an international border of the United States without obtaining a
certificate of crossing.
Section 2(a)(2) instructs relevant officials or agencies, in con-
sultation with appropriate Federal agencies, to issue a certificate
of crossing for a border-crossing facility within 120 days after final
action is taken, unless the relevant official or agency finds that the
construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the border-
crossing facility is not in the public interest of the United States.
The relevant official or agency with respect to border-crossing fa-
cilities consisting of oil or natural gas pipelines is the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission. The relevant official or agency with
respect to electric transmission facilities is the Secretary of Energy.
This section also provides additional requirements for electric
transmission facilities.
Section 2(a)(3) instructs that subsection (a) shall not apply to
border-crossing facilities that are in operation on the date of enact-
ment of this Act if a permit as described in subsection (d) has been

meets certain requirements.
Section 2(a)(4) specifies that nothing in subsection (a) or sub-
section (e) shall affect the application of any other Federal statute
to a project for which a certificate of crossing for a border-crossing
facility is requested; the requirement to obtain approval or author-
ization under sections 3 and 7 of the NGA or the authority of the
FERC with respect to oil pipelines under section 60502 of title 49,
United States Code.
Section 2(b) amends section 3(c) of the NGA directing FERC to
grant an application for the importation of natural gas from, or ex-
portation of natural gas to, Canada and Mexico not later than 30
days after the date on which the Commission receives the complete
application.
Section 2(c) repeals section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act,
eliminating the requirement to secure an order from FERC to
transmit electric energy from the United States to a foreign coun-
try. This section also contains conforming amendments related to
State regulations and seasonal diversity electricity exchange.
Section 2(d) specifies that no Presidential Permit or any other
Executive Order shall be necessary for the construction, connection,
operation, or maintenance of an oil or natural gas pipeline or elec-
tric transmission facility, or any border-crossing facility.
Section 2(e) directs that no certificate of crossing under sub-
section (a) or permit described in subsection (d) shall be required
for a modification to an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric trans-
mission facility that is operating for the import or export of energy
as of the date of enactment of this Act. Additionally, a certificate
of crossing or a permit shall not be required for a modification to
an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility for
which a permit described in subsection (d) has been issued, or for
which a certificate of crossing has previously been issued under
subsection (a).
Section 2(f) specifies that the President may not revoke a Presi-
dential permit issued pursuant to a relevant Executive Order for
the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of an oil or
natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility unless such
revocation is authorized by Congress.
Section 2(g) specifies that subsections (a) through (c) shall take
effect on the date that is one year after the date of enactment of
this Act. Each relevant official or agency shall publish in the Fed-
eral Register a notice of a proposed rulemaking to carry out the re-
quirements of subsection (a) within 180 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act. Not later than one year after the date of enact-
ment, the relevant officials or agencies shall publish a final rule in
the Federal Register.
Section 2(h) provides definitions for terms used throughout this
section.

EXPORTATION OR IMPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS; LNG TERMINALS
SEC. 3. (a) After six months from the date on which this act takes
effect no person shall export any natural gas from the United
States to a foreign country or import any natural gas from a for-
eign country without first having secured an order of the Commis-
sion authorizing it to do so. The Commission shall issue such order
upon application, unless, after opportunity for hearing, it finds that
the proposed exportation or importation will not be consistent with
the public interest. The Commission may by its order grant such
application, in whole or in part, with such modification and upon
such terms and conditions as the Commission may find necessary
or appropriate, and may from time to time, after opportunity for
hearing, and for good cause shown, make such supplemental order
in the premises as it may find necessary or appropriate.
(b) With respect to natural gas which is imported into the United
States from a nation with which there is in effect a free trade
agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas,
and with respect to liquefied natural gas—
(1) the importation of such natural gas shall be treated as
a ‘‘first sale’’ within the meaning of section 2(21) of the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978; and
(2) the Commission shall not, on the basis of national origin,
treat any such imported natural gas on an unjust, unreason-
able, unduly discriminatory, or preferential basis.
(c) For purposes of subsection (a), the importation of the natural
gas referred to in subsection (b), or the exportation of natural gas
to a nation with which there is in effect a free trade agreement re-
quiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, shall be
deemed to be consistent with the public interest, and applications
for such importation or exportation shall be granted without modi-
fication or delay. In the case of an application for the importation
of natural gas from, or the exportation of natural gas to, Canada
or Mexico, the Commission shall grant the application not later
than 30 days after the date on which the Commission receives the
complete application.
(d) Except as specifically provided in this Act, nothing in this Act
affects the rights of States under—
(1) the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C.
1451 et seq.);
(2) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); or
(3) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251
et seq.).
(e)(1) The Commission shall have the exclusive authority to ap-
prove or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion,
or operation of an LNG terminal. Except as specifically provided in
this Act, nothing in this Act is intended to affect otherwise applica-
ble law related to any Federal agency’s authorities or responsibil-
ities related to LNG terminals.

(B) give reasonable notice of the hearing to all interested
persons, including the State commission of the State in which
the LNG terminal is located and, if not the same, the Gov-
ernor-appointed State agency described in section 3A;
(C) decide the matter in accordance with this subsection; and
(D) issue or deny the appropriate order accordingly.
(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission
may approve an application described in paragraph (2), in whole or
part, with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions
as the Commission find necessary or appropriate.
(B) Before January 1, 2015, the Commission shall not—
(i) deny an application solely on the basis that the applicant
proposes to use the LNG terminal exclusively or partially for
gas that the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant will sup-
ply to the facility; or
(ii) condition an order on—
(I) a requirement that the LNG terminal offer service to
customers other than the applicant, or any affiliate of the
applicant, securing the order;
(II) any regulation of the rates, charges, terms, or condi-
tions of service of the LNG terminal; or
(III) a requirement to file with the Commission sched-
ules or contracts related to the rates, charges, terms, or

(4) An order issued for an LNG terminal that also offers service
to customers on an open access basis shall not result in subsidiza-
tion of expansion capacity by existing customers, degradation of
service to existing customers, or undue discrimination against ex-
isting customers as to their terms or conditions of service at the fa-
cility, as all of those terms are defined by the Commission.
(f)(1) In this subsection, the term ‘‘military installation’’—
(A) means a base, camp, post, range, station, yard, center, or
homeport facility for any ship or other activity under the juris-
diction of the Department of Defense, including any leased fa-
cility, that is located within a State, the District of Columbia,
or any territory of the United States; and
(B) does not include any facility used primarily for civil
works, rivers and harbors projects, or flood control projects, as
determined by the Secretary of Defense.

INTERCONNECTION AND COORDINATION OF FACILITIES; EMERGENCIES;
TRANSMISSION TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES
SEC. 202. (a) For the purpose of assuring an abundant supply of
electric energy throughout the United States with the greatest pos-
sible economy and with regard to the proper utilization and con-
servation of natural resources, the Commission is empowered and
directed to divide the country into regional districts for the vol-
untary interconnection and coordination of facilities for the genera-
tion, transmission, and sale of electric energy, and it may at any
time thereafter, upon its own motion or upon application, make
such modifications thereof as in its judgment will promote the pub-
lic interest. Each such district shall embrace an area which, in the
judgment of the Commission, can economically be served by such
interconnected and coordinated electric facilities. It shall be the
duty of the Commission to promote and encourage such inter-
connection and coordination within each such district and between
such districts. Before establishing any such district and fixing or
modifying the boundaries thereof the Commission shall give notice
to the State commission of each State situated wholly or in part
within such district, and shall afford each such State commission
reasonable opportunity to present its views and recommendations,
and shall receive and consider such views and recommendations.
(b) Whenever the Commission, upon application of any State
commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale
of electric energy, and after notice to each State commission and
public utility affected and after opportunity for hearing, finds such
action necessary or appropriate in the public interest it may by
order direct a public utility (if the Commission finds that no undue
burden will be placed upon such public utility thereby) to establish
physical connection of its transmission facilities with the facilities
of one or more other persons engaged in the transmission or sale
of electric energy, to sell energy to or exchange energy with such
persons: Provided, That the Commission shall have no authority to
compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes,
nor to compel such public utility to sell or exchange energy when
to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its
customers. The Commission may prescribe the terms and condi-
tions of the arrangement to be made between the persons affected
by any such order, including the apportionment of cost between
them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to
any of them.

(c)(1) During the continuance of any war in which the United
States is engaged, or whenever the Commission determines that an
emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for
electric energy, or a shortage of electric energy or of facilities for
the generation or transmission of electric energy, or of fuel or water
for generating facilities, or other causes, the Commission shall have
authority, either upon its own motion or upon complaint, with or
without notice, hearing, or report, to require by order such tem-
porary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, inter-
change, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will
best meet the emergency and serve the public interest. If the par-
ties affected by such order fail to agree upon the terms of any ar-
rangement between them in carrying out such order, the Commis-
sion, after hearing held either before or after such order takes ef-
fect, may prescribe by supplemental order such terms as it finds to
be just and reasonable, including the compensation or reimburse-
ment which should be paid to or by any such party.
(2) With respect to an order issued under this subsection that
may result in a conflict with a requirement of any Federal, State,
or local environmental law or regulation, the Commission shall en-
sure that such order requires generation, delivery, interchange, or
transmission of electric energy only during hours necessary to meet
the emergency and serve the public interest, and, to the maximum
extent practicable, is consistent with any applicable Federal, State,
or local environmental law or regulation and minimizes any ad-
verse environmental impacts.
(3) To the extent any omission or action taken by a party, that
is necessary to comply with an order issued under this subsection,
including any omission or action taken to voluntarily comply with
such order, results in noncompliance with, or causes such party to
not comply with, any Federal, State, or local environmental law or
regulation, such omission or action shall not be considered a viola-
tion of such environmental law or regulation, or subject such party
to any requirement, civil or criminal liability, or a citizen suit
under such environmental law or regulation.
(4)(A) An order issued under this subsection that may result in
a conflict with a requirement of any Federal, State, or local envi-
ronmental law or regulation shall expire not later than 90 days
after it is issued. The Commission may renew or reissue such order
pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) for subsequent periods, not to
exceed 90 days for each period, as the Commission determines nec-
essary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.
(B) In renewing or reissuing an order under subparagraph (A),
the Commission shall consult with the primary Federal agency
with expertise in the environmental interest protected by such law
or regulation, and shall include in any such renewed or reissued
order such conditions as such Federal agency determines necessary
to minimize any adverse environmental impacts to the extent prac-
ticable. The conditions, if any, submitted by such Federal agency
shall be made available to the public. The Commission may exclude
such a condition from the renewed or reissued order if it deter-
mines that such condition would prevent the order from adequately
addressing the emergency necessitating such order and provides in
the order, or otherwise makes publicly available, an explanation of
such determination.

(5) If an order issued under this subsection is subsequently
stayed, modified, or set aside by a court pursuant to section 313 or
any other provision of law, any omission or action previously taken
by a party that was necessary to comply with the order while the
order was in effect, including any omission or action taken to vol-
untarily comply with the order, shall remain subject to paragraph
(3).
(d) During the continuance of any emergency requiring imme-
diate action, any person or municipality engaged in the trans-
mission or sale of electric energy and not otherwise subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission may make such temporary connec-
tions with any public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Com-
mission or may construct such temporary facilities for the trans-
mission of electric energy in interstate commerce as may be nec-
essary or appropriate to meet such emergency, and shall not be-
come subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by reason of
such temporary connection or temporary construction: Provided,
That such temporary connection shall be discontinued or such tem-
porary construction removed or otherwise disposed of upon the ter-
mination of such emergency: Provided further, That upon approval
of the Commission permanent connections for emergency use only
may be made hereunder.
ø(e) After six months from the date on which this Part takes ef-
fect, no person shall transmit any electric energy from the United
States to a foreign country without first having secured an order
of the Commission authorizing it to do so. The Commission shall
issue such order upon application unless, after opportunity for
hearing, it finds that the proposed transmission would impair the
sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or would im-
pede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of fa-
cilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commis-
sion may by its order grant such application in whole or in part,
with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the
Commission may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time
to time, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown,
make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find nec-
essary or appropriate.¿
(f) The ownership or operation of facilities for the transmission
or sale at wholesale of electric energy which is (a) generated within
a State and transmitted from that State across an international
boundary and not thereafter transmitted into any other State, or
(b) generated in a foreign country and transmitted across an inter-
national boundary into a State and not thereafter transmitted into
any other State, shall not make a person a public utility subject to
regulation as such under other provisions of this part. The State
within which any such facilities are located may regulate any such
transaction øinsofar as such State regulation does not conflict with
the exercise of the Commission’s powers under or relating to sub-
section 202(e)¿.
(g) In order to insure continuity of service to customers of public
utilities, the Commission shall require by rule, each public utility
to—

SEC. 602. SEASONAL DIVERSITY ELECTRICITY EXCHANGE.
(a) AUTHORITY.—The Secretary may acquire rights-of-way by
purchase, including eminent domain, through North Dakota, South
Dakota, and Nebraska for transmission facilities for the seasonal
diversity exchange of electric power to and from Canada if he de-
termines—
(1) after opportunity for public hearing—
(A) that the exchange is in the public interest and would
further the purposes referred to in section 101 (1) and (2)
of this Act and that the acquisition of such rights-of-way
and the construction and operation of such transmission
facilities for such purposes is otherwise in the public inter-
est,
(B) that a permit has been issued in accordance with
subsection (b) for such construction, operation, mainte-
nance, and connection of the facilities at the border for the
transmission of electric energy between the United States
and Canada as is necessary for such exchange of electric
power, and
(C) that each affected State has approved the portion of
the transmission route located in each State in accordance
with applicable State law, or if there is no such applicable
State law in such State, the Governor has approved such
portion; and
(2) after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and
the heads of other affected Federal agencies, that the Secretary
of the Interior and the heads of such, other agencies concur in
writing in the location of such portion of the transmission fa-

cilities as crosses Federal land under the jurisdiction of such
Secretary or such other Federal agency, as the case may be.
The Secretary shall provide to any State such cooperation and tech-
nical assistance as the State may request and as he determines ap-
propriate in the selection of a transmission route. If the trans-
mission route approved by any State does not appear to be feasible
and in the public interest, the Secretary shall encourage such State
to review such route and to develop a route that is feasible and in
the public interest. Any exercise by the Secretary of the power of
eminent domain under this section shall be in accordance with
other applicable provisions of Federal law. The Secretary shall pro-
vide public notice of his intention to acquire any right-of-way before
exercising such power of eminent domain with respect to such
right-of-way.
(b) PERMIT.—Notwithstanding any transfer of functions under
the first sentence of section 301(b) of the Department of Energy Or-
ganization Act, no permit referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B) may be
issued unless øthe Commission has conducted hearings and made
the findings required under section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act
and under the applicable execution order respecting the construc-
tion, operation, maintenance, or connection at the borders of the
United States of facilities for the transmission of electric energy be-
tween the United States and a foreign country. Any finding of the
Commission under an applicable executive order referred to in this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of judicial review as an
order issued under section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act.¿ the
Secretary has conducted hearings and finds that the proposed
transmission facilities would not impair the sufficiency of electric
supply within the United States or would not impede or tend to im-
pede the coordination in the public interest of facilities subject to the
jurisdiction of the Secretary.
(c) TIMELY ACQUISITION BY OTHER MEANS.—The Secretary may
not acquire any rights-of-day under this section unless he deter-
mines that the holder or holders of a permit referred to in sub-
section (a)(1)(B) are unable to acquire such rights-of-way under
State condemnation authority, or after reasonable opportunity for
negotiation, without unreasonably delaying construction, taking
into consideration the impact of such delay on completion of the fa-
cilities in a timely fashion.
(d) PAYMENTS BY PERMITTEES.—(1) The property interest ac-
quired by the Secretary under this section (whether by eminent do-
main or other purchase) shall be transferred by the Secretary to
the holder of a permit referred to in subsection (b) if such holder
has made payment to the Secretary of the entire costs of the acqui-
sition of such property interest, including administrative costs. The
Secretary may accept, and expend, for purposes of such acquisition,
amounts from any such person before acquiring a property interest
to be transferred to such person under this section.
(2) If no payment is made by a permit holder under paragraph
(1), within a reasonable time, the Secretary shall offer such rights-
of-way to the original owner for reacquisition at the original price
paid by the Secretary. If such original owner refuses to reacquire
such property after a reasonable period, the Secretary shall dispose
of such property in accordance with applicable provisions of law
governing disposal of property of the United States.

MINORITY VIEWS
H.R. 3062, the Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act
H.R. 3062 continues a decade-long Republican effort to relitigate
decisions made with respect to the Keystone XL pipeline, a pipeline
that ceased development over four years ago.1 This bill represents
the second time this Congress that Republicans have attempted to
move the legislation through the Committee—during consideration
of the committee print for reconciliation legislation for Fiscal Year
2025, Republicans proposed a provision that would have mandated
the approval of cross-border energy infrastructure for a fee of
$50,000.2
Ostensibly, the bill is focused on transforming the current per-
mitting process created and authorized by executive orders into one
authorized by statute.3 That is a laudable goal, assuming the statu-
tory provisions do not undermine environmental laws. Unfortu-
nately, the bill focuses on protecting crude oil and refined petro-
leum pipelines in particular from the full scope of environmental
reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by
narrowing the scope of Federal authorization to solely the first
1,000 feet of the pipeline after the border, and excluding consider-
ation of the rest of the pipeline. This is particularly egregious, as
the environmental review of the entirety of the Keystone XL pipe-
line was vital in then-Secretary of State John Kerry’s recommenda-
tion to President Obama that the issuance of a Presidential Permit
would not serve the national interest.4
Furthermore, the bill forces the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission (FERC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) to become
experts in matters of foreign affairs and diplomacy by not speci-
fying which agencies they must consult before making a determina-
tion on whether or not a border-crossing facility is in the public in-
terest. This is a major departure from current procedures, which
require DOE and FERC to obtain favorable recommendations from
the State Department and Department of Defense in order to move
forward with border-crossing permits for natural gas and electric
transmission lines (crude oil and refined petroleum product pipe-
line approvals are already handled by the State Department).5
The bill also severely curtails the power of DOE to condition and
regulate the imports and exports of electricity to Canada and Mex-
ico. Section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act currently requires DOE
to grant orders authorizing the transmission of electricity between

the U.S. and a foreign nation unless it finds that the ‘‘proposed
transmission would impair the sufficiency of electric supply within
the United States or would impede or tend to impede the coordina-
tion in the public interest of facilities subject to the Commission.’’6
However, the law also gives DOE the authority to attach any condi-
tion to its approvals that it deems necessary or appropriate. Sec-
tion 2(a)(2)(C) of H.R. 3062 would completely repeal section 202(e)
of the Federal Power Act, and only allow DOE to condition its ap-
proval of electric transmission border-crossing facilities on those fa-
cilities’ compliance with reliability and grid operator requirements,
giving up any ability to engage in economic regulation.
In the 118th Congress, at a legislative hearing on February 7,
2023, the Subcommittees on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security
and Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials heard tes-
timony from Mr. Tyson Slocum, Director of the Energy Program at
Public Citizen, on legislative text nearly-identical to H.R. 3062. Mr.
Slocum testified that the provisions in the bill relating to natural
gas pipelines would allow companies to dodge the requirements of
section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, and easily export natural gas to
Mexico, where it could then be re-exported anywhere in the world
in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG).7 He also testified—and
DOE has since found—that increased LNG exports lead to higher
domestic natural gas prices.89 Given the correlation between do-
mestic natural gas and electricity prices, this bill will likely lead
to Americans paying more for power, heating, and cooking all at
once.
During the markup of the bill in the Energy Subcommittee, Rep-
resentative Fedorchak (R–ND) stated that ‘‘The underlying legisla-
tion does nothing to alter the environmental review of these
projects.’’10 The majority’s report similarly states that ‘‘The legisla-
tion would also have no effect on any other Federal statute that
would apply to a project for which a Certificate of Crossing is re-
quired, including any requirements of NEPA.’’ Unfortunately, the
legislative history indicates that the majority is mistaken. In the
115th Congress, a nearly identical piece of legislation, H.R. 2883,
came to the floor, and the House adopted an amendment authored
by Rep. Marc Veasey (D–TX) by voice vote clarifying that nothing
in the bill shall affect the scope of any environmental review re-
quired by NEPA.11 When this legislation was re-introduced in the
117th Congress and in this Congress, the only substantive change
from the language that passed the House in the 115th Congress
was that Rep. Veasey’s amendment had been removed.12 An
amendment adding identical language back into the bill was of-
fered by Rep. Veasey during the Energy Subcommittee’s markup of
the bill was defeated on a recorded vote.
