SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE RELATING TO MULTI-CLASS SHARE STRUCTURES.
Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78n) is amended by
adding at the end the following:
‘‘(l) DISCLOSURERELATINGTOMULTI-CLASSSHARESTRUCTURES.—
‘‘(1) DISCLOSURE.—The Commission shall, by rule, require each issuer with a
multi-class share structure to disclose the information described in paragraph
(2) in any proxy or consent solicitation material for an annual meeting of the
shareholders of the issuer, or any other filing as the Commission determines ap-
propriate.
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF DISCLOSURE.—A disclosure made under paragraph (1) shall
include, with respect to each person who is a director, director nominee, or
named executive officer of the issuer, or who is the beneficial owner of securities
with 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of secu-
rities entitled to vote in the election of directors—
‘‘(A) the number of shares of all classes of securities entitled to vote in
the election of directors beneficially owned by such person, expressed as a
percentage of the total number of the outstanding securities of the issuer
entitled to vote in the election of directors; and
‘‘(B) the amount of voting power held by such person, expressed as a per-
centage of the total combined voting power of all classes of the securities
of the issuer entitled to vote in the election of directors.
‘‘(3) MULTI-CLASSSHARESTRUCTURE.—In this subsection, the term ‘multi-class
share structure’ means a capitalization structure that contains 2 or more types
of securities that have differing amounts of voting rights in the election of direc-
tors.’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3357, the Enhancing Multi-Class Share Disclosures Act, was
introduced on May 13, 2025, by Representative Gregory Meeks
(NY–05). The bill requires issuers with a multi-class stock struc-
ture to make certain disclosures in any proxy or consent solicita-
tion material.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Multi-class share structures have existed in the U.S. since the
late 1800s. The original intent of these structures was to allow
companies, particularly family-run businesses, to maintain voting
control without having to own the majority of equity in their com-
pany. In the 1980s, in response to a number of hostile takeovers
of companies and the increasing competitiveness of national securi-
ties exchanges, limitations on multi-class share structures became
more relaxed. The majority of companies that took advantage of the
newly relaxed limitations were media companies such as the Wash-
ington Post and New York Times. Media companies viewed multi-
class structures as a means to protect journalistic integrity.
In 2017, the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee approved a rec-
ommendation that called for the SEC to require more disclosures
from companies with multi-class shares.1 Currently, the SEC does
not require companies to disclose the gap between the equity an in-
dividual holds in the company and the number of voting shares
they control—although many companies already do this for their
shareholders. Requiring disclosures regarding voting power, par-
ticularly regarding officers and directors and those who have more
than five percent voting power, ensures shareholders receive more
uniform information in proxy materials, particularly because com-
panies already are required to disclose ownership information for

directors, officers, and shareholders controlling more than five per-
cent of equity.
Rather than prohibiting multi-class share structures altogether,
this bill represents a thoughtful and balanced approach to enhance
transparency without eliminating class structures that encourage
founders who may not otherwise go public to do so.

Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3357 is to require issuers with
a multi-class stock structure to make certain disclosures in any
proxy or consent solicitation material.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3357. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Enhancing Multi-Class
Share Disclosures Act.’’
Section 2. Disclosure relating to multi-class share structures
This section amends Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 by mandating certain disclosures by issuers of multi-class
share structures. Specifically, this section requires the U.S. Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require, by rule, issuers
to make certain disclosures in any proxy or consent solicitation ma-
terial with respect to each person who is a director or executive of-
ficer of the issuer or who holds five percent or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the
election of directors.

respect of any security (other than an exempted security) registered
pursuant to section 12 of this title.
(2) The rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission
under paragraph (1) may include—
(A) a requirement that a solicitation of proxy, consent, or au-
thorization by (or on behalf of) an issuer include a nominee

(2) With respect to banks, the rules and regulations prescribed

has filed with the Commission a statement containing such of the
information specified in section 13(d) of this title, and such addi-
tional information as the Commission may by rules and regulations
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. All requests or invitations for tenders
or advertisements making a tender offer or requesting or inviting
tenders, of such a security shall be filed as a part of such statement

ment as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe.
Copies of any additional material soliciting or requesting such ten-
der offers subsequent to the initial solicitation or request shall con-
tain such information as the Commission may by rules and regula-
tions prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors, and shall be filed with the Commis-
sion not later than the time copies of such material are first pub-
lished or sent or given to security holders. Copies of all statements,
in the form in which such material is furnished to security holders
and the Commission, shall be sent to the issuer not later than the
date such material is first published or sent or given to any secu-
rity holders.
(2) When two or more persons act as a partnership, limited part-
nership, syndicate, or other group for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, or disposing of securities of an issuer, such syndicate or
group shall be deemed a ‘‘person’’ for purposes of this subsection.
(3) In determining, for purposes of this subsection, any percent-
age of a class of any security, such class shall be deemed to consist
of the amount of the outstanding securities of such class, exclusive
of any securities of such class held by or for the account of the
issuer or a subsidiary of the issuer.
(4) Any solicitation or recommendation to the holders of such a
security to accept or reject a tender offer or request or invitation
for tenders shall be made in accordance with such rules and regu-
lations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(5) Securities deposited pursuant to a tender offer or request or
invitation for tenders may be withdrawn by or on behalf of the de-
positor at any time until the expiration of seven days after the time
definitive copies of the offer or request or invitation are first pub-
lished or sent or given to security holders, and at any time after
sixty days from the date of the original tender offer or request or
invitation, except as the Commission may otherwise prescribe by
rules, regulations, or order as necessary or appropriate in the pub-
lic interest or for the protection of investors.
(6) Where any person makes a tender offer, or request or invita-
tion for tenders, for less than all the outstanding equity securities
of a class, and where a greater number of securities is deposited
pursuant thereto within ten days after copies of the offer or request
or invitation are first published or sent or given to security holders
than such person is bound or willing to take up and pay for, the
securities taken up shall be taken up as nearly as may be pro rata,
disregarding fractions, according to the number of securities depos-
ited by each depositor. The provisions of this subsection shall also
apply to securities deposited within ten days after notice of an in-

in paragraph (7), is first published or sent or given to security hold-
ers.
(7) Where any person varies the terms of a tender offer or re-
quest or invitation for tenders before the expiration thereof by in-
creasing the consideration offered to holders of such securities,
such person shall pay the increased consideration to each security
holder whose securities are taken up and paid for pursuant to the
tender offer or request or invitation for tenders whether or not
such securities have been taken up by such person before the vari-
ation of the tender offer or request or invitation.
(8) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any offer
for, or request or invitation for tenders of, any security—
(A) if the acquisition of such security, together with all other
acquisitions by the same person of securities of the same class
during the preceding twelve months, would not exceed 2 per
centum of that class;
(B) by the issuer of such security; or
(C) which the Commission, by rules or regulations or by
order, shall exempt from the provisions of this subsection as
not entered into for the purpose of, and not having the effect
of, changing or influencing the control of the issuer or other-
wise as not comprehended within the purposes of this sub-
section.
(e) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue state-
ment of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made, in the light of the cir-
cumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or to en-
gage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or prac-
tices, in connection with any tender offer or request or invitation
for tenders, or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to
or in favor of any such offer, request, or invitation. The Commis-
sion shall, for the purposes of this subsection, by rules and regula-
tions define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent,
such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipula-
tive.
(f) If, pursuant to any arrangement or understanding with the
person or persons acquiring securities in a transaction subject to
subsection (d) of this section or subsection (d) of section 13 of this
title, any persons are to be elected or designated as directors of the
issuer, otherwise than at a meeting of security holders, and the
persons so elected or designated will constitute a majority of the di-
rectors of the issuer, then, prior to the time any such person takes
office as a director, and in accordance with rules and regulations
prescribed by the Commission, the issuer shall file with the Com-
mission, and transmit to all holders of record of securities of the
issuer who would be entitled to vote at a meeting for election of di-
rectors, information substantially equivalent to the information
which would be required by subsection (a) or (c) of this section to
be transmitted if such person or persons were nominees for election
as directors at a meeting of such security holders.

the assets of a company, the person making such filing, other than
a company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
shall pay to the Commission the following fees:
(i) for preliminary proxy solicitation material involving an
acquisition, merger, or consolidation, if there is a proposed pay-
ment of cash or transfer of securities or property to share-
holders, a fee at a rate that, subject to paragraph (4), is equal
to $92 per $1,000,000 of such proposed payment, or of the

ferred; and

proposed sale or other disposition of substantially all of the as-
sets of a company, a fee at a rate that, subject to paragraph
(4), is equal to $92 per $1,000,000 of the cash or of the value
of any securities or other property proposed to be received
upon such sale or disposition.
(B) The fee imposed under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced
with respect to securities in an amount equal to any fee paid to the
Commission with respect to such securities in connection with the
proposed transaction under section 6(b) of the Securities Act of
1933 (15 U.S.C. 77f(b)), or the fee paid under that section shall be
reduced in an amount equal to the fee paid to the Commission in

or more companies involved in an acquisition, merger, consolida-
tion, sale, or other disposition of substantially all the assets of a
company must file such proxy material with the Commission, each
shall pay a proportionate share of such fee.
(2) At the time of filing such preliminary information statement

of this section, the issuer shall pay to the Commission the same fee
as required for preliminary proxy solicitation material under para-
graph (1) of this subsection.
(3) At the time of filing such statement as the Commission may
require by rule pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section, the

other property proposed to be offered. The fee shall be reduced with
