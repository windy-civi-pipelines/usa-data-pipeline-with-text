Estimated Changes in Spending Subject to Appropriation Under H.R. 2027Data and Supplemental InformationLegislative InformationRelated Publications Bill SummaryH.R. 2027 would require the Small Business Administration (SBA) to relocate 30 percent of its employees from its headquarters in Washington, D.C., to regional offices throughout the United States and reduce its headquarters office space by 30 percent. Those changes would be contingent upon the agency determining that they would reduce costs to the federal government.Estimated Federal CostThe estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 2027 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within budget function 370 (commerce and housing credit).Table 1.Estimated Changes in Spending Subject to Appropriation Under H.R. 2027 By Fiscal Year, Millions of Dollars  2025202620272028202920302025-2030Salaries and Benefits       Estimated Authorization*-4-10-8-2-2-26Estimated Outlays*-3-9-9-3-2-26Overhead Expenses       Estimated Authorization056-5-5-5-4Estimated Outlays046-3-5-5-3Total Changes       Estimated Authorization*1-4-13-7-7-30Estimated Outlays*1-3-12-8-7-29* = between zero and $500,000.Basis of EstimateCBO assumes that H.R. 2027 will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2025, that the SBA would not begin to relocate employees until 2026, and that the Congress would reduce annual appropriations by the estimated amounts each year. Outlays were estimated using historical obligation and spending rates.Spending Subject to AppropriationCBO estimates that implementing H.R. 2027 would decrease spending subject to appropriation by $29 million over the 2025-2030 period. The Congress appropriated $974million for the SBA’s administrative expenses in fiscal year 2025.Salaries and Benefits. H.R. 2027 would require the SBA to relocate 30 percent of its employees currently assigned to work at the headquarters in Washington, D.C., to regional offices throughout the United States within one year and to adjust their compensation for the new location. Additionally, employees would no longer be allowed to telework unless they qualify for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.There are currently about 900 full-time employees assigned to work at the SBA headquarters; under the bill, about 270 employees would need to be relocated. CBO assumes that half of those employees would relocate in 2026, and half would choose to leave the agency. CBO expects that it would take about two years for the SBA to hire new employees at regional offices to replace those that leave the agency. The lag in hiring new employees accounts for about 50 percent of the estimated reduction in costs for salaries and benefits.Salaries and benefits for federal employees vary by location. Based on information from the SBA, CBO expects that the average salaries and benefits of those employees in 2026 would decrease from about $208,000 to $201,000. Employees that relocate would be eligible to receive amounts to cover their household’s transportation expenses, temporary housing and assistance with selling and purchasing a home.Using information from the Department of Agriculture, which relocated two subagencies in 2019, CBO estimates that average relocation expenses would be about $70,000 per employee. Additionally, some employees that leave the SBA would be eligible for severance averaging about $55,000 per employee. After accounting for anticipated inflation, attrition, and the time required to hire new employees, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 2027 would reduce the costs of SBA’s salaries and benefits by $26 million over the 2025-2030 period. Any reduction in spending would be subject to future appropriations being reduced by the estimated amounts.H.R. 2027 also would require the SBA to report within six months on the number of employees at its headquarters who would be eligible to be relocated and a plan for implementing those changes. CBO estimates that the report would cost less than $500,000.Overhead Expenses. H.R. 2027 also would require the agency to reduce office space at its headquarters location by 30 percent within two years. Using information from the SBA, CBO estimates that overhead expenses (including rent, security, and telecommunications services) for the affected employees at the SBA headquarters totaled about $6 million in 2025 compared to costs of about $1.5 million at regional offices for the same number of employees.Finally, the SBA would require assistance from the General Services Administration (GSA) to locate and set up additional office space in regional offices. Using information from GSA, CBO estimates that the new working and meeting space, furniture, and workstation purchases, and installation of information technology and audiovisual equipment would cost $10 million. CBO expects those costs would be incurred in 2026 and 2027.After accounting for inflation, attrition, and the time required for hiring, and acquiring space and under the assumption that the SBA would reduce its office space in Washington, D.C., CBO estimates that implementing the bill would reduce overhead costs for the SBA by $3million over the 2025-2030 period. Any reduction in spending would be subject to future appropriations being reduced by the estimated amounts.UncertaintyCBO’s estimate of H.R. 2027 is subject to uncertainty because determining how many employees would relocate and the costs associated with their relocation is uncertain. For example, if the SBA paid severance to those that choose to leave the agency, decided not to hire new employees to offset expected attrition, or paid higher or lower relocation expenses, the actual costs could be higher or lower than those estimated.Additionally, if employees chose to retire and collect retirement benefits earlier than they would under current law, spending on retirement benefits, which are recorded in the budget as direct spending, would change.Pay-As-You-Go ConsiderationsEnacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and DeficitsCBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2027 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.MandatesThe bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.Previous CBO EstimateOn June 27, 2025, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for S. 298, the Returning SBA to Main Street Act, as reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship on March 4, 2025. The two bills are similar, and CBO’s estimates of their budgetary effects are the same.Estimate Prepared ByFederal Costs: Aurora SwansonMandates: Rachel AustinEstimate Reviewed ByJustin HumphreyChief, Finance, Housing, and Education Cost Estimates UnitKathleen FitzGerald Chief, Public and Private Mandates UnitH.
