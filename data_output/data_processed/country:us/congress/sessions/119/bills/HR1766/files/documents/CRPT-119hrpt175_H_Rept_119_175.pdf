March 3, 2025. The bill establishes within the National Tele-
communications and Information Administration (NTIA), the Office
of Policy Development and Cybersecurity.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
NTIA is required by statute to coordinate the telecommuni-
cations activities of the executive branch and assist in the formula-
tion of policies for those activities, including security.1 Additionally,
NTIA has the responsibility to ensure that the views of the execu-
tive branch on telecommunications matters are effectively pre-
sented to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).2 Given
the recent cyberattacks on telecommunications networks, H.R.
1766 augments NTIA’s role in conducting important policy coordi-
nation functions with respect to cybersecurity and provides addi-
tional clarity in carrying out existing and future activities con-
sistent with NTIA’s authority.
COMMITTEE ACTION
The Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing in the
development of the legislation during the 119th Congress. On Jan-
uary 23, 2025, the Subcommittee on Communications and Tech-
nology held a hearing. The title of the hearing was ‘‘Strengthening
American Leadership in Wireless Technology.’’ The Subcommittee
received testimony from the following witnesses:
• Michael K. Powell, President & CEO, NCTA—The Internet
& Television Association;
• Brad Gillen, Executive Vice President, CTIA—The Wire-
less Association;
• Diane Rinaldo, Executive Director, Open RAN Policy Coa-
lition; and
• Chris Lewis, President & CEO, Public Knowledge.
On March 4, 2025, the full Committee on Energy and Commerce
met in open markup session and ordered H.R. 1766, without
amendment, favorably reported to the House by voice vote.

NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND
TAX EXPENDITURES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII, the Committee finds that
H.R. 1766 would result in no new or increased budget authority,
entitlement authority, or tax expenditures or revenues.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII, the following is the cost
estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to
section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
Summary of legislation: On March 4, 2025, the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce ordered 10 bills to be reported. This doc-
ument provides estimates for 8 of those bills. One of the bills, H.R.
1721, was passed by the House of Representatives on April 28,
2025.
The legislation would:
• Codify some authorities and responsibilities at offices with-
in the National Telecommunications and Information Adminis-
tration (NTIA) and would require certain activities, including
standardizing wireless communications networks;
• Require the Department of Commerce to report on the ef-
fect of imports on U.S. infrastructure, barriers to foreign trade
faced by U.S. technology businesses, and the feasibility of a
trans-Atlantic cable linked to specific countries; and

• Require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
to establish a safety standard for retractable awnings, initiate
a pilot program for using artificial intelligence, and report the
findings to the Congress.
Estimated Federal cost: The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 270 (energy) and 370 (commerce and housing
credit).
Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that each
piece of legislation will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and that the
estimated amounts will be available each year. CBO estimates that
all eight pieces of legislation would affect spending subject to ap-
propriation.
This cost estimate does not include any effects of interactions
among the pieces of legislation. If all eight were combined and en-
acted as a single piece of legislation, the effects could be different
from the sum of the separate estimates, but CBO expects that any
differences would be small.
H.R. 1455, the ITS Codification Act, would codify the authority
for and delineate the responsibilities of the Institute for Tele-
communication Sciences (ITS), a research and engineering labora-
tory within the National Telecommunications and Information Ad-
ministration. The bill also would require ITS to develop emergency
communication and tracking technologies to locate people trapped
in confined spaces, such as underground mines.
Using information from the NTIA about the cost of implementing
the bill, CBO estimates that ITS would need four additional engi-
neers and technicians, at an initial annual cost of about $160,000
each, with that amount increasing each year for anticipated infla-
tion. Additionally, the institute would need to acquire simulation
software licenses, pay for travel, and cover other miscellaneous ex-
penses at an annual cost of about $100,000. Finally, ITS would
need to make onetime equipment purchases of items such as a sig-
nal generator, a vector signal analyzer receiver, and a power ampli-
fier for about $500,000 in 2026. On that basis, CBO estimates that
implementing the bill would cost $4 million over the 2025–2030 pe-
riod; any related spending would be subject to the availability of
appropriated funds.
The bill also would require ITS to study radio frequency emis-
sions, determine spectrum propagation characteristics, and test
technologies that enhance spectrum sharing among federal and
nonfederal entities, among other activities. Because ITS has simi-
lar responsibilities under current law, CBO estimates that imple-
menting those requirements would have no additional cost.
H.R. 1679, the Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2025,
would require the Department of Commerce, the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO), and a federal interagency working group
to study and report to the Congress on the ability of the United
States to attract foreign direct investment and about barriers to
foreign trade faced by advanced-technology firms in the United
States.
Using information from the Department of Commerce, CBO ex-
pects that completing the study and report would require 10 econo-
mists and support staff, at an average cost of $190,000 each, for
one year. On that basis, CBO estimates that implementing H.R.
1679 would cost $2 million in 2026. Based on the cost of similar

5
activities, CBO estimates that the costs for GAO and the working
group would be insignificant. Any related spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 1721, the Critical Infrastructure Manufacturing Feasibility
Act, would require the Department of Commerce to identify, within
each critical infrastructure sector, high-demand products that are
imported to the United States because of manufacturing, material,
or supply chain constraints. The department would analyze the fea-
sibility, costs, and benefits of producing such products in the
United States and report the findings to the Congress.
Based on the cost of similar studies, CBO estimates that imple-
menting H.R. 1721 would cost $1 million for the work of four em-
ployees in 2026, at a cost of about $220,000 each, along with the
purchase of data and survey contracts. Any related spending would
be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 1737, a bill to direct the Secretary of Commerce to submit
to Congress a report containing an assessment of the value, cost,
and feasibility of a trans-Atlantic submarine fiber optic cable con-
necting the contiguous United States, the United States Virgin Is-
lands, Ghana, and Nigeria, would require the Secretary of Com-
merce, within one year of enactment, to report to the Congress on
the cost, benefits, and feasibility, with respect to U.S. national se-
curity, of constructing such a fiber-optic cable.
Based on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that imple-
menting the bill would cost $1 million over the 2025–2030 period;
any related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
H.R. 1765, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act
of 2025, would require the National Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration to encourage trusted companies and stand-
ards-setting bodies to participate in setting standards for 5G and
future generations of wireless communications networks. Under the
bill, the NTIA would provide technical assistance to those entities
to facilitate participation.
Using information from the NTIA, CBO expects that the agency
would need eight employees, at an average annual salary of about
$160,000 each, to meet the bill’s requirements. After accounting for
anticipated inflation, CBO estimates that salaries and additional
expenses would cost $9 million over the 2025–2030 period. CBO es-
timates that having the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology facilitate industry participation in the international stand-
ard-setting process for 5G networks would cost an insignificant
amount. Any related costs for both agencies would be subject to the
availability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 1766, the NTIA Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act,
would codify the duties currently undertaken by the Office of Policy
Analysis and Development within the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration and rename it the Office of
Policy Development and Cybersecurity. Using information from the
NTIA, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1766 would cost less
than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period; any related costs would
be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 1767, the Awning Safety Act of 2025, would require the
Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue a final safety stand-
ard on retractable awnings.

Using information from CPSC, CBO expects that the agency
would need five full-time- equivalent employees for the first eight-
een months after enactment, and two full-time employees annually
thereafter, at an average cost of $200,000 per full-time employee to
enforce the standard. After accounting for anticipated inflation,
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $3 million
over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be subject
to the availability of appropriated funds.
H.R. 1770, the Consumer Safety Technology Act, would require
the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a pilot pro-
gram to explore the use of artificial intelligence and report its find-
ings to the Congress. The bill also would direct the Department of
Commerce, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), to study and report to the Congress on how blockchain tech-
nology may be used for consumer protection services.
Finally, the bill would require the FTC to report to the Congress
on its efforts and on recommendations to prevent anticompetitive
behavior involving tokens—transferable representations of informa-
tion recorded on a blockchain or similar technology.
Using information from the agencies and the costs for similar ac-
tivities, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1770 would cost $2
million over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending would be
subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: None of the legislation would af-
fect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go proce-
dures do not apply.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: None of
the legislation would increase net direct spending or deficits in any
of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: H.R. 1767 would impose a private-sector mandate as
defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by requir-
ing awning manufacturers to comply with a prospective Consumer
Product Safety Commission safety standard concerning fixed and
freestanding retractable awnings. CBO expects that the standard
may require awnings to be equipped with safety clips and to issue
visual or audible alerts when in motion. Based on the cost of such
additional equipment and the volume of covered awnings likely to
be sold, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would not ex-
ceed the private-sector threshold established in UMRA ($206 mil-
lion in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
H.R. 1767 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
None of the other pieces of legislation would impose private-sec-
tor or intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Zunara Naeem (National
Telecommunications and Information Administration), Margot Ber-
man (Department of Commerce), Cyrus Ekland (Consumer Product
Safety Commission, Federal Trade Commission); Mandates: Rachel
Austin, Andrew Laughlin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Sean Dunbar, Chief, Low-
Income Health Programs and Prescription Drugs Cost Estimates
Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates
Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
