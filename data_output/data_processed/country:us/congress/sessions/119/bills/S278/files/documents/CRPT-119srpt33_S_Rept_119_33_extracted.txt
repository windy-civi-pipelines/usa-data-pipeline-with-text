KIDS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA ACT
JUNE30, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 278]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 278) to prohibit users who are under
age 13 from accessing social media platforms, to prohibit the use
of personalized recommendation systems on individuals under age
17, and limit the use of social media in schools, having considered
the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and rec-
ommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 278 is to require social media companies to im-
plement a number of policies to protect young users, including re-
quirements that social media platforms prohibit children under age
13 from creating or maintaining a social media account and not use
the personal data of a child or teen to display targeted, personal-
ized content to such child or teen. It would also require similar pro-
tections from elementary or secondary schools that receive certain
Federal funds by requiring them to certify that they block or filter
access to certain social media platforms on any such school’s feder-
ally supported services, devices, and networks.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Given the prevalence of internet connected devices in our society,
children are often introduced to social media use at a young age.
Numerous studies, as well as hearings held before the Committee’s
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data

Security, document the significant physical and mental health
harms to children from social media use, as well as safety concerns
that arise when predators have access to children through their on-
line accounts and activities.
Studies have shown a strong relationship between social media
use and poor mental health, especially among children. From 2019
to 2021, overall media use among teens and tweens (ages 8 to 12)
increased by 17 percent, with tweens using screens for 5 hours and
33 minutes per day and teens using screens for 8 hours and 39
minutes.1
The risk of harm from social media continues as children reach
high school age. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that frequent social media use
among high school students was associated with higher prevalence
of bullying victimization, persistent feelings of sadness and hope-
lessness, and thoughts of suicide.2
A May 2023 advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General stated that up
to 95 percent of youth between ages 13–17 reported using social
media, with over a third using it ‘‘almost constantly.’’3 Teens who
spend more than 3 hours per day on social media face double the
risk of poor mental health outcomes.4
A phone-based childhood—predominantly spent on social
media—has been documented to lead to social awkwardness, re-
duced self-confidence, a more sedentary childhood, fragmented at-
tention, disrupted learning, addiction, and social withdrawal.5
The U.S. Surgeon General has stated there is not enough evi-
dence to conclude social media is sufficiently safe for children and
adolescents.6 The Surgeon General cited studies showing that when
children and teens reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for
longer than a month it improves mental health.7
Parents intuitively understand the harms associated with their
child’s use of social media. For example, a survey conducted by
Count on Mothers shows that over 90 percent of mothers agree
that there should be a minimum of age 13 for social media.8
The Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and
Data Security has held a number of hearings to explore harms to
children and teens caused by social media use.
On October 2, 2021, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection,
Product Safety, and Data Security heard from a whistleblower and

former Facebook (now Meta) employee who testified that Meta
prioritized user engagement, which fueled growth and profit, over
the wellbeing of young users. The witness further testified that
Meta’s policies, practices, and the extent of its internal research on
harms to youth on its platforms lack transparency, both to the pub-
lic and independent researchers.9
The subcommittee held other hearings on September 30, 2021,10
October 26, 2021,11 and December 8, 2021,12 to examine how online
platforms—particularly social media platforms—harm young users.
These hearings highlighted that algorithmic recommendation sys-
tems and targeted advertisements push age-inappropriate, poten-
tially life-threatening content on youth, such as content encour-
aging dieting and eating disorder behaviors, reckless and dan-
gerous driving, and viral challenges to perform life-threatening
stunts. The hearings suggested that external oversight and regula-
tion may be necessary to ensure the safety of minors online be-
cause the platforms have failed in doing so on their own.
S. 278 responds to the concerns that social media platforms have
not taken appropriate steps to protect children or teens online.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 278 would do the following:
• Require a social media platform to prohibit an individual from
creating or maintaining an account or profile if the platform
knows that such individual is a child under the age of 13.
• Require a social media platform to terminate any existing ac-
count or profile of a user who the social media platform knows
is a child.
• Prohibit a social media platform from using the personal data
of a child or teen in a personalized recommendation system to
display content to a user or visitor the platform knows is a
child or teen.
• Establish a standard for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
or the attorney general of a State to make a determination as
to whether a social media platform has knowledge that a user
is a child or teen.
• Authorize the FTC to enforce violations of title I of this Act as
a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or prac-

tice prescribed under section 18 of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion Act.13
• Authorize the attorney general of a State to enforce violations
of title I of this Act.
• Preempt any State law, rule, or regulation only to the extent
that such State law, rule, or regulation conflicts with a provi-
sion of title I. Clarifies that nothing in title I should be con-
strued to prohibit a State from enacting a law, rule, or regula-
tion that provides greater protection to children or teens than
the protection provided by the provisions of this title.
• Update the Children’s Internet Protection Act14 to require the
school, school board, local educational agency, or other author-
ity with responsibility for administration of an elementary or
secondary school that is subject to paragraph (5) of section
254(h) of the Communications Act of 193415 to certify that it
is enforcing a policy to prevent students from accessing, and
has in place measures to block or filter, certain social media
platforms on any such school’s federally supported services, de-
vices, and networks. Determine that any covered school that is
unable to certify such compliance is ineligible to receive service
at discount rates under section 254(h) until such school comes
into compliance.
• Require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to en-
force violations of title II of this Act. Limit the FCC from seek-
ing recovery of funding or delay the processing of a fund appli-
cation due to a violation of title II if the school, school board,
local educational agency, or other authority made a good faith
effort to comply with the requirements in title II and correct
any known violations of such requirements within a reasonable
period of time.
• Require the FCC to establish an easily accessible, public data-
base that contains each internet safety policy that is required
to be submitted to the FCC under title II.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 278 was introduced on January 28, 2025, by Senator Schatz
(for himself and Senators Cruz, Murphy, Britt, Welch, Budd, King,
Curtis, Warner, and Fetterman) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On Feb-
ruary 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and,
by voice vote, ordered S. 278 reported favorably without amend-
ment.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
1315 U.S.C. 57a.
1415 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.
1547 U.S.C. 254(h).

The bill would:
• Prohibit social media platforms from allowing children to
create accounts and from recommending certain content to
children or teens based on their personal data
• Require schools to block access to social media as a condi-
tion of receiving discounted broadband service through the E-
Rate program of the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC)
• Impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Increases in spending subject to appropriation for the Fed-
eral Trade Commission and FCC to implement and enforce the
bill’s requirements
• Increases in direct spending and revenues associated with
administrative costs of the Universal Service Administrative
Company
• Increases in civil penalties
Bill summary: S. 278 would prohibit social media platforms from
allowing children to create accounts and from recommending cer-
tain content to children or teens based on their personal data. The
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be required to enforce
those prohibitions.
The bill also would require schools to block access to social media
on school-provided services, networks, and devices as a condition of
receiving discounted broadband service through the E-Rate pro-
gram of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC
would be required to enforce that requirement. Finally, S. 278
would direct the FCC to collect information from schools about
their Internet safety policies and establish a public database of
those policies.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs fall within budget
function 370 (commerce and housing credit).
Basis of estimate: CBO assumes that S. 278 will be enacted be-
fore the end of fiscal year 2025.

Spending subject to appropriation: Using information from the
affected agencies, CBO estimates that implementing S. 278 would
cost $4 million over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending
would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
CBO estimates that the FTC would need three additional law-
yers and technologists in its Bureau of Consumer Protection to en-
force violations at a cost of about $235,000 per employee in 2025.
On that basis, and accounting for anticipated inflation, CBO esti-
mates that it would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to implement the requirements in the bill.
CBO estimates that it would cost the FCC less than $500,000 to
provide guidance to E-Rate recipients and to establish and main-
tain the public database. Because the FCC is authorized to collect
fees each year sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its regu-
latory activities, CBO estimates that the net cost to the FCC would
be negligible, assuming appropriation actions consistent with that
authority.
Direct spending and revenues: In total, CBO estimates that en-
acting S. 278 would increase revenues and direct spending by an
insignificant amount over the 2025–2035 period.
The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), which
administers the E-Rate program on behalf of the FCC, already
oversees compliance with E-Rate policies as part of its normal du-
ties; therefore, S. 278 would not create substantial new responsibil-
ities. In addition, CBO expects that many schools already block so-
cial media access under current policy, and that schools would gen-
erally comply with the new requirements under the bill. Therefore,
CBO estimates that any additional costs for USAC to oversee
schools’ social media policies would be insignificant. Under current
law, USAC levies assessments on telecommunications carriers to
fund its operations; the collection of those assessments is recorded
in the budget as revenue and the spending of those assessments is
classified as direct spending. On that basis, CBO estimates that
the increase in the deficit from increases in revenues and direct
spending would be negligible.
The bill would authorize the FTC to collect civil monetary pen-
alties from businesses found in violation of the bill, along with pur-
suing other remedies. Civil monetary penalties are generally remit-
ted to the Treasury and recorded as revenues. CBO estimates that
the additional revenues collected through 2035 would be insignifi-
cant.
The extent to which businesses would violate the new rules after
they go into effect is uncertain. Furthermore, if a business does vio-
late the new rules and the FTC chooses to proceed with an enforce-
ment action, the extent to which the agency pursues civil penalties
versus other remedies is also uncertain, as is the amount of time
it would take to resolve a case.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates
that enacting the bill would increase direct spending and revenues
by less than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting S. 278 would increase net direct spending by

an insignificant amount in all of the four consecutive 10-year peri-
ods beginning in 2036.
CBO estimates that enacting S. 278 would not increase on-budg-
et deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning
in 2036.
Mandates: The bill would impose intergovernmental and private-
sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates
would not exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergov-
ernmental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 mil-
lion in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
S. 278 would impose an intergovernmental mandate by pre-
empting state laws governing access to social media platforms for
people under the age of 17. Although the preemption would limit
the application of state laws, it would impose no duty on state gov-
ernments that would result in additional spending or loss of rev-
enue.
The bill would impose private-sector mandates by prohibiting so-
cial media platforms from allowing children under the age of 13 to
create and maintain accounts. Social media platforms also would
be required to delete those accounts and supply a copy, upon re-
quest, of the personal data of that child user. In addition, social
media platforms would be prohibited from using automated sys-
tems to promote content based on personal data for people under
the age of 17. The incremental cost of the mandates would be small
because social media platforms already voluntarily comply, or their
current business practices would allow the platforms to easily com-
ply with provisions of the bill.
If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of
implementing provisions in the bill, S. 278 would increase the cost
of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay
those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate
would be small.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
NUMBER OF PERSONS COVERED
Title I of S. 278 would cover the following entities and any em-
ployees retained by them: (1) Social media platforms; (2) the FTC;
and (3) State attorneys general.
Title II of S. 278 would cover all elementary or secondary schools
that are subject to paragraph (5) of section 254(h) of the Commu-

nications Act of 193416 and receive services at discount rates under

Section 3:
section 254(h).
ECONOMIC IMPACT
S. 278’s primary economic impact would be from costs to or
changes in revenue for social media platforms that result from: (1)
prohibiting children from creating or maintaining a social media
account or profile, or (2) prohibiting use of personal data of a child
or teen in a personalized recommendation system to display con-
tent to such child or teen.
Further, S. 278 may have an economic impact on elementary or
secondary schools due to the cost of acquiring new or extending ex-
isting legally required technology protection measures, such as
internet firewalls, to prohibit student access to certain social media
platforms on any federally supported service, device, or network.
Should schools not comply, they could also lose funding currently
supported through FCC’s programs.
PRIVACY
S. 278 is expected to strengthen the privacy of children online.
It does so by: (1) prohibiting social media companies from permit-
ting children under 13 years of age from creating or maintaining
a social media account and (2) prohibiting the use of a child or
teen’s personal data in a personalized recommendation system to
display content to such child or teen.
PAPERWORK
Title I of S. 278 is not expected to generate any additional paper-
work. Title II of S. 278 would have minimal impact on paperwork
for elementary or secondary schools. Paperwork would be limited
to providing, as a condition of receiving funding under section
254(h) of the Communications Act,17 the necessary certifications
and screen use policies for parents to the FCC to demonstrate com-
pliance with the requirements of title II.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 4:

TITLE I—KIDS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA ACT

Section 6:
Section 101. Short title.
This section would provide that title I may be cited as the ‘‘Kids
Off Social Media Act’’.

Section 7:
Section 102. Definitions.
This section would define the term ‘‘personalized recommenda-
tion system’’ to mean a fully or partially automated system used
to suggest, promote, or rank content, including other users or posts,
based on the personal data of users; the term ‘‘child’’ to mean an
individual under the age of 13; the term ‘‘Commission’’ to mean the
Federal Trade Commission; the terms ‘‘know’’ and ‘‘knows’’ to mean
to have actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis
of objective circumstances; the term ‘‘personal data’’ to mean the
term ‘‘personal information’’ as defined in section 1302 of the Chil-
dren’s Online Privacy Protection Act; the term ‘‘social media plat-
form’’ to mean a public-facing website, online service, online appli-
cation, or mobile application that (1) is directed to consumers, (2)
collects personal data, (3) primarily derives revenue from the ad-
vertising or the sale of personal data, and (4) as its primary func-
tion provides a community forum for user-generated content, in-
cluding messages, videos, and audio files among users where such
content is primarily intended for viewing, resharing, or platform-
enabled distributed social endorsement or comment. This section
also contains a number of express limitations to the scope of the
term ‘‘social media platform’’. This section would further define the
term ‘‘teen’’ to mean an individual over the age of 12 and under the
age of 17 and the term ‘‘user’’ to mean, with respect to a social
media platform, an individual who registers an account or creates
a profile on the social media platform.

Section 8:
Section 103. No children under 13.
This section would prohibit a social media platform from permit-
ting an individual to create or maintain an account or profile on
such social media platform if it knows that the individual is a
child. This section would further require a social media platform to
terminate any existing account or profile of a user who the social
media platform knows is a child.
For any accounts or profiles of a child deleted in accordance with
this section, a social media platform would be required to delete all
personal data collected from the user or submitted by the user to
the platform. Such deletion would need to take place after the plat-
form provides the user of such existing account or profile with the
opportunity to request and receive a copy of the user’s personal
data within 90 days after the platform terminates such account or
profile.

Section 9:
Section 104. Prohibition on the use of personalized recommendation
systems on children or teens.
This section would prohibit a social media platform from using

use of the following categories of personal data in a personalized
recommendation system:
• The type of device used by the child or teen.
• The languages used by the child or teen to communicate.
• The city or town in which the child or teen is located.
• The fact that the individual is a child or teen.
• The age of the child or teen.
This section would also include a rule of construction. This sec-
tion could not be construed to prevent a child or teen from delib-
erately or independently requesting content so long as such results
are not based on the personal data of the child or teen. Social
media platforms would also not be prevented from taking measures
to stop unlawful or obscene material, block or filter spam or protect
the security of a platform, or prevent criminal activity. This section
could also not be construed to prohibit a social media platform from
displaying content that a teen account holder has selected, fol-
lowed, or subscribed to, provided that such display is in chrono-
logical format.

Section 10:
Section 105. Determination of whether an operator has knowledge
fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that an in-
dividual is a child or teen.
This section would provide that for purposes of this title, in mak-
ing a determination of whether a social media platform has knowl-
edge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that a
user is a child or teen, the FTC or the attorney general of a State,
as applicable, shall rely on competent and reliable evidence, taking
into account the totality of circumstances, including whether a rea-
sonable and prudent person under the circumstances would have
known that the user is a child or teen.
Such determination shall not be construed to require a social
media platform to implement an age gating or age verification
functionality or affirmatively collect any personal data with respect
to the age of users that the social media platform is not already
collecting in the normal course of business.
By adopting this determination, a social media platform would
no longer be able to rely only on self-reporting or self-attestation
of age submitted by a user, nor would a social media company be
able to ignore objective facts indicating that a user is a child.
Further, this section would provide that if any social media plat-
form or party acting on the platform’s behalf voluntarily collects
personal data to comply with this title, the platform or party shall
not use such data for any purpose other than sole compliance with
this title or retain any personal data collected for longer than nec-
essary to comply with the obligations under this title or minimally
necessary to demonstrate compliance with this title.

Section 11:
Section 106. Enforcement.
This section would provide that the FTC shall enforce violations
of this title as violations of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive
act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act.18
1815 U.S.C. 57a.

This section would further provide that the attorney general of
a State may, subject to the requirements in this title, bring a civil
action against a social media platform for violations of this title
committed against the residents of the applicable State.

Section 12:
Section 107. Relationship to other laws.
This section would state that the provisions of this title shall pre-
empt any State law, rule, or regulation only to the extent that such
State law, rule, or regulation conflicts with a provision of this title.
It would also clarify that nothing in this title shall be construed to
prohibit a State from enacting a law, rule, or regulation that pro-
vides greater protection to children or teens than the protection
provided by the provisions of this title.

Section 13:
Section 108. Effective date.
This section would provide that this title shall take effect 1 year
after the date of enactment of this Act.
TITLE II—EYES ON THE BOARD ACT OF 2025

Section 14:
Section 201. Short title.
This section would provide that title II may be cited as the ‘‘Eyes
on the Board Act of 2025’’.

Section 15:
Section 202. Updating the children’s internet protection act to in-
clude social media platforms.
This section would expand the Children’s Internet Protection Act
to require schools to certify that they are enforcing a policy to pre-
vent students from accessing, and have in place measures to block
or filter students’ access to certain social media platforms on feder-
ally supported services, devices, and networks, as a condition of re-
ceiving services at discount rates under section 254(h) of the Com-
munications Act of 1934.19
It would further clarify that these requirements do not prohibit
district-sanctioned or school-sanctioned learning management sys-
tems and school information systems used for purposes of con-
veying content related to the education of students; or teachers
from using a social media platform for educational instruction.
Finally, this section would clarify that the FCC may not seek re-
covery of funding or delay the processing of a fund application from
a school due to a violation of this title if the school, school board,
local educational agency, or other authority made a good faith ef-
fort to comply with the requirements in this title and correct any
known violations of such requirements within a reasonable period
of time.

Section 16:
Section 203. Internet safety policies.
This section would require elementary or secondary schools that
receive Federal funding under section 254(h) of the Communica-
tions Act of 1934 to submit copies of their internet safety policies
to the FCC, to be made available in an easily accessible, public
database.

TITLE III—SEVERABILITY

Section 17:
Section 301. Severability.

amendment made by this Act, is determined to be unenforceable or
invalid, the remaining provision of this Act and the amendments
made by this Act shall not be affected.

KIDS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA ACT
JUNE30, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 278]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 278) to prohibit users who are under
age 13 from accessing social media platforms, to prohibit the use
of personalized recommendation systems on individuals under age
17, and limit the use of social media in schools, having considered
the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and rec-
ommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 278 is to require social media companies to im-
plement a number of policies to protect young users, including re-
quirements that social media platforms prohibit children under age
13 from creating or maintaining a social media account and not use
the personal data of a child or teen to display targeted, personal-
ized content to such child or teen. It would also require similar pro-
tections from elementary or secondary schools that receive certain
Federal funds by requiring them to certify that they block or filter
access to certain social media platforms on any such school’s feder-
ally supported services, devices, and networks.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Given the prevalence of internet connected devices in our society,
children are often introduced to social media use at a young age.
Numerous studies, as well as hearings held before the Committee’s
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data

Security, document the significant physical and mental health
harms to children from social media use, as well as safety concerns
that arise when predators have access to children through their on-
line accounts and activities.
Studies have shown a strong relationship between social media
use and poor mental health, especially among children. From 2019
to 2021, overall media use among teens and tweens (ages 8 to 12)
increased by 17 percent, with tweens using screens for 5 hours and
33 minutes per day and teens using screens for 8 hours and 39
minutes.1
The risk of harm from social media continues as children reach
high school age. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that frequent social media use
among high school students was associated with higher prevalence
of bullying victimization, persistent feelings of sadness and hope-
lessness, and thoughts of suicide.2
A May 2023 advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General stated that up
to 95 percent of youth between ages 13–17 reported using social
media, with over a third using it ‘‘almost constantly.’’3 Teens who
spend more than 3 hours per day on social media face double the
risk of poor mental health outcomes.4
A phone-based childhood—predominantly spent on social
media—has been documented to lead to social awkwardness, re-
duced self-confidence, a more sedentary childhood, fragmented at-
tention, disrupted learning, addiction, and social withdrawal.5
The U.S. Surgeon General has stated there is not enough evi-
dence to conclude social media is sufficiently safe for children and
adolescents.6 The Surgeon General cited studies showing that when
children and teens reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for
longer than a month it improves mental health.7
Parents intuitively understand the harms associated with their
child’s use of social media. For example, a survey conducted by
Count on Mothers shows that over 90 percent of mothers agree
that there should be a minimum of age 13 for social media.8
The Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and
Data Security has held a number of hearings to explore harms to
children and teens caused by social media use.
On October 2, 2021, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection,
Product Safety, and Data Security heard from a whistleblower and

former Facebook (now Meta) employee who testified that Meta
prioritized user engagement, which fueled growth and profit, over
the wellbeing of young users. The witness further testified that
Meta’s policies, practices, and the extent of its internal research on
harms to youth on its platforms lack transparency, both to the pub-
lic and independent researchers.9
The subcommittee held other hearings on September 30, 2021,10
October 26, 2021,11 and December 8, 2021,12 to examine how online
platforms—particularly social media platforms—harm young users.
These hearings highlighted that algorithmic recommendation sys-
tems and targeted advertisements push age-inappropriate, poten-
tially life-threatening content on youth, such as content encour-
aging dieting and eating disorder behaviors, reckless and dan-
gerous driving, and viral challenges to perform life-threatening
stunts. The hearings suggested that external oversight and regula-
tion may be necessary to ensure the safety of minors online be-
cause the platforms have failed in doing so on their own.
S. 278 responds to the concerns that social media platforms have
not taken appropriate steps to protect children or teens online.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 278 would do the following:
• Require a social media platform to prohibit an individual from
creating or maintaining an account or profile if the platform
knows that such individual is a child under the age of 13.
• Require a social media platform to terminate any existing ac-
count or profile of a user who the social media platform knows
is a child.
• Prohibit a social media platform from using the personal data
of a child or teen in a personalized recommendation system to
display content to a user or visitor the platform knows is a
child or teen.
• Establish a standard for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
or the attorney general of a State to make a determination as
to whether a social media platform has knowledge that a user
is a child or teen.
• Authorize the FTC to enforce violations of title I of this Act as
a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or prac-

tice prescribed under section 18 of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion Act.13
• Authorize the attorney general of a State to enforce violations
of title I of this Act.
• Preempt any State law, rule, or regulation only to the extent
that such State law, rule, or regulation conflicts with a provi-
sion of title I. Clarifies that nothing in title I should be con-
strued to prohibit a State from enacting a law, rule, or regula-
tion that provides greater protection to children or teens than
the protection provided by the provisions of this title.
• Update the Children’s Internet Protection Act14 to require the
school, school board, local educational agency, or other author-
ity with responsibility for administration of an elementary or
secondary school that is subject to paragraph (5) of section
254(h) of the Communications Act of 193415 to certify that it
is enforcing a policy to prevent students from accessing, and
has in place measures to block or filter, certain social media
platforms on any such school’s federally supported services, de-
vices, and networks. Determine that any covered school that is
unable to certify such compliance is ineligible to receive service
at discount rates under section 254(h) until such school comes
into compliance.
• Require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to en-
force violations of title II of this Act. Limit the FCC from seek-
ing recovery of funding or delay the processing of a fund appli-
cation due to a violation of title II if the school, school board,
local educational agency, or other authority made a good faith
effort to comply with the requirements in title II and correct
any known violations of such requirements within a reasonable
period of time.
• Require the FCC to establish an easily accessible, public data-
base that contains each internet safety policy that is required
to be submitted to the FCC under title II.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 278 was introduced on January 28, 2025, by Senator Schatz
(for himself and Senators Cruz, Murphy, Britt, Welch, Budd, King,
Curtis, Warner, and Fetterman) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On Feb-
ruary 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and,
by voice vote, ordered S. 278 reported favorably without amend-
ment.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
1315 U.S.C. 57a.
1415 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.
1547 U.S.C. 254(h).

The bill would:
• Prohibit social media platforms from allowing children to
create accounts and from recommending certain content to
children or teens based on their personal data
• Require schools to block access to social media as a condi-
tion of receiving discounted broadband service through the E-
Rate program of the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC)
• Impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Increases in spending subject to appropriation for the Fed-
eral Trade Commission and FCC to implement and enforce the
bill’s requirements
• Increases in direct spending and revenues associated with
administrative costs of the Universal Service Administrative
Company
• Increases in civil penalties
Bill summary: S. 278 would prohibit social media platforms from
allowing children to create accounts and from recommending cer-
tain content to children or teens based on their personal data. The
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be required to enforce
those prohibitions.
The bill also would require schools to block access to social media
on school-provided services, networks, and devices as a condition of
receiving discounted broadband service through the E-Rate pro-
gram of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC
would be required to enforce that requirement. Finally, S. 278
would direct the FCC to collect information from schools about
their Internet safety policies and establish a public database of
those policies.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated costs fall within budget
function 370 (commerce and housing credit).
Basis of estimate: CBO assumes that S. 278 will be enacted be-
fore the end of fiscal year 2025.

Spending subject to appropriation: Using information from the
affected agencies, CBO estimates that implementing S. 278 would
cost $4 million over the 2025–2030 period; any related spending
would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
CBO estimates that the FTC would need three additional law-
yers and technologists in its Bureau of Consumer Protection to en-
force violations at a cost of about $235,000 per employee in 2025.
On that basis, and accounting for anticipated inflation, CBO esti-
mates that it would cost the FTC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to implement the requirements in the bill.
CBO estimates that it would cost the FCC less than $500,000 to
provide guidance to E-Rate recipients and to establish and main-
tain the public database. Because the FCC is authorized to collect
fees each year sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its regu-
latory activities, CBO estimates that the net cost to the FCC would
be negligible, assuming appropriation actions consistent with that
authority.
Direct spending and revenues: In total, CBO estimates that en-
acting S. 278 would increase revenues and direct spending by an
insignificant amount over the 2025–2035 period.
The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), which
administers the E-Rate program on behalf of the FCC, already
oversees compliance with E-Rate policies as part of its normal du-
ties; therefore, S. 278 would not create substantial new responsibil-
ities. In addition, CBO expects that many schools already block so-
cial media access under current policy, and that schools would gen-
erally comply with the new requirements under the bill. Therefore,
CBO estimates that any additional costs for USAC to oversee
schools’ social media policies would be insignificant. Under current
law, USAC levies assessments on telecommunications carriers to
fund its operations; the collection of those assessments is recorded
in the budget as revenue and the spending of those assessments is
classified as direct spending. On that basis, CBO estimates that
the increase in the deficit from increases in revenues and direct
spending would be negligible.
The bill would authorize the FTC to collect civil monetary pen-
alties from businesses found in violation of the bill, along with pur-
suing other remedies. Civil monetary penalties are generally remit-
ted to the Treasury and recorded as revenues. CBO estimates that
the additional revenues collected through 2035 would be insignifi-
cant.
The extent to which businesses would violate the new rules after
they go into effect is uncertain. Furthermore, if a business does vio-
late the new rules and the FTC chooses to proceed with an enforce-
ment action, the extent to which the agency pursues civil penalties
versus other remedies is also uncertain, as is the amount of time
it would take to resolve a case.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates
that enacting the bill would increase direct spending and revenues
by less than $500,000 in every year and over the 2025–2035 period.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting S. 278 would increase net direct spending by

an insignificant amount in all of the four consecutive 10-year peri-
ods beginning in 2036.
CBO estimates that enacting S. 278 would not increase on-budg-
et deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning
in 2036.
Mandates: The bill would impose intergovernmental and private-
sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates
would not exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergov-
ernmental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 mil-
lion in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
S. 278 would impose an intergovernmental mandate by pre-
empting state laws governing access to social media platforms for
people under the age of 17. Although the preemption would limit
the application of state laws, it would impose no duty on state gov-
ernments that would result in additional spending or loss of rev-
enue.
The bill would impose private-sector mandates by prohibiting so-
cial media platforms from allowing children under the age of 13 to
create and maintain accounts. Social media platforms also would
be required to delete those accounts and supply a copy, upon re-
quest, of the personal data of that child user. In addition, social
media platforms would be prohibited from using automated sys-
tems to promote content based on personal data for people under
the age of 17. The incremental cost of the mandates would be small
because social media platforms already voluntarily comply, or their
current business practices would allow the platforms to easily com-
ply with provisions of the bill.
If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of
implementing provisions in the bill, S. 278 would increase the cost
of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay
those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate
would be small.

Rachel Austin.

ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
NUMBER OF PERSONS COVERED
Title I of S. 278 would cover the following entities and any em-
ployees retained by them: (1) Social media platforms; (2) the FTC;
and (3) State attorneys general.
Title II of S. 278 would cover all elementary or secondary schools
that are subject to paragraph (5) of section 254(h) of the Commu-

nications Act of 193416 and receive services at discount rates under
section 254(h).
ECONOMIC IMPACT
S. 278’s primary economic impact would be from costs to or
changes in revenue for social media platforms that result from: (1)
prohibiting children from creating or maintaining a social media
account or profile, or (2) prohibiting use of personal data of a child
or teen in a personalized recommendation system to display con-
tent to such child or teen.
Further, S. 278 may have an economic impact on elementary or
secondary schools due to the cost of acquiring new or extending ex-
isting legally required technology protection measures, such as
internet firewalls, to prohibit student access to certain social media
platforms on any federally supported service, device, or network.
Should schools not comply, they could also lose funding currently
supported through FCC’s programs.
PRIVACY
S. 278 is expected to strengthen the privacy of children online.
It does so by: (1) prohibiting social media companies from permit-
ting children under 13 years of age from creating or maintaining
a social media account and (2) prohibiting the use of a child or
teen’s personal data in a personalized recommendation system to
display content to such child or teen.
PAPERWORK
Title I of S. 278 is not expected to generate any additional paper-
work. Title II of S. 278 would have minimal impact on paperwork
for elementary or secondary schools. Paperwork would be limited
to providing, as a condition of receiving funding under section
254(h) of the Communications Act,17 the necessary certifications
and screen use policies for parents to the FCC to demonstrate com-
pliance with the requirements of title II.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title; table of contents.

TITLE I—KIDS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA ACT
Section 101. Short title.
This section would provide that title I may be cited as the ‘‘Kids
Off Social Media Act’’.
Section 102. Definitions.
This section would define the term ‘‘personalized recommenda-
tion system’’ to mean a fully or partially automated system used
to suggest, promote, or rank content, including other users or posts,
based on the personal data of users; the term ‘‘child’’ to mean an
individual under the age of 13; the term ‘‘Commission’’ to mean the
Federal Trade Commission; the terms ‘‘know’’ and ‘‘knows’’ to mean
to have actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis
of objective circumstances; the term ‘‘personal data’’ to mean the
term ‘‘personal information’’ as defined in section 1302 of the Chil-
dren’s Online Privacy Protection Act; the term ‘‘social media plat-
form’’ to mean a public-facing website, online service, online appli-
cation, or mobile application that (1) is directed to consumers, (2)
collects personal data, (3) primarily derives revenue from the ad-
vertising or the sale of personal data, and (4) as its primary func-
tion provides a community forum for user-generated content, in-
cluding messages, videos, and audio files among users where such
content is primarily intended for viewing, resharing, or platform-
enabled distributed social endorsement or comment. This section
also contains a number of express limitations to the scope of the
term ‘‘social media platform’’. This section would further define the
term ‘‘teen’’ to mean an individual over the age of 12 and under the
age of 17 and the term ‘‘user’’ to mean, with respect to a social
media platform, an individual who registers an account or creates
a profile on the social media platform.
Section 103. No children under 13.
This section would prohibit a social media platform from permit-
ting an individual to create or maintain an account or profile on
such social media platform if it knows that the individual is a
child. This section would further require a social media platform to
terminate any existing account or profile of a user who the social
media platform knows is a child.
For any accounts or profiles of a child deleted in accordance with
this section, a social media platform would be required to delete all
personal data collected from the user or submitted by the user to
the platform. Such deletion would need to take place after the plat-
form provides the user of such existing account or profile with the
opportunity to request and receive a copy of the user’s personal
data within 90 days after the platform terminates such account or
profile.
Section 104. Prohibition on the use of personalized recommendation
systems on children or teens.
This section would prohibit a social media platform from using
a user or visitor’s personal data in a personalized recommendation
system to display content if the platform knows that the user is a
child or teen. This section would provide exceptions to allow for the

• The city or town in which the child or teen is located.
• The fact that the individual is a child or teen.
• The age of the child or teen.
This section would also include a rule of construction. This sec-
tion could not be construed to prevent a child or teen from delib-
erately or independently requesting content so long as such results
are not based on the personal data of the child or teen. Social
media platforms would also not be prevented from taking measures
to stop unlawful or obscene material, block or filter spam or protect
the security of a platform, or prevent criminal activity. This section
could also not be construed to prohibit a social media platform from
displaying content that a teen account holder has selected, fol-
lowed, or subscribed to, provided that such display is in chrono-
logical format.
Section 105. Determination of whether an operator has knowledge
fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that an in-
dividual is a child or teen.
This section would provide that for purposes of this title, in mak-
ing a determination of whether a social media platform has knowl-
edge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that a
user is a child or teen, the FTC or the attorney general of a State,
as applicable, shall rely on competent and reliable evidence, taking
into account the totality of circumstances, including whether a rea-
sonable and prudent person under the circumstances would have
known that the user is a child or teen.
Such determination shall not be construed to require a social
media platform to implement an age gating or age verification
functionality or affirmatively collect any personal data with respect
to the age of users that the social media platform is not already
collecting in the normal course of business.
By adopting this determination, a social media platform would
no longer be able to rely only on self-reporting or self-attestation
of age submitted by a user, nor would a social media company be
able to ignore objective facts indicating that a user is a child.
Further, this section would provide that if any social media plat-
form or party acting on the platform’s behalf voluntarily collects
personal data to comply with this title, the platform or party shall
not use such data for any purpose other than sole compliance with
this title or retain any personal data collected for longer than nec-
essary to comply with the obligations under this title or minimally
necessary to demonstrate compliance with this title.
Section 106. Enforcement.
This section would provide that the FTC shall enforce violations
of this title as violations of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive
act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act.18
1815 U.S.C. 57a.

This section would further provide that the attorney general of
a State may, subject to the requirements in this title, bring a civil
action against a social media platform for violations of this title
committed against the residents of the applicable State.
Section 107. Relationship to other laws.
This section would state that the provisions of this title shall pre-
empt any State law, rule, or regulation only to the extent that such
State law, rule, or regulation conflicts with a provision of this title.
It would also clarify that nothing in this title shall be construed to
prohibit a State from enacting a law, rule, or regulation that pro-
vides greater protection to children or teens than the protection
provided by the provisions of this title.
Section 108. Effective date.
This section would provide that this title shall take effect 1 year
after the date of enactment of this Act.
TITLE II—EYES ON THE BOARD ACT OF 2025
Section 201. Short title.
This section would provide that title II may be cited as the ‘‘Eyes
on the Board Act of 2025’’.
Section 202. Updating the children’s internet protection act to in-
clude social media platforms.
This section would expand the Children’s Internet Protection Act
to require schools to certify that they are enforcing a policy to pre-
vent students from accessing, and have in place measures to block
or filter students’ access to certain social media platforms on feder-
ally supported services, devices, and networks, as a condition of re-
ceiving services at discount rates under section 254(h) of the Com-
munications Act of 1934.19
It would further clarify that these requirements do not prohibit
district-sanctioned or school-sanctioned learning management sys-
tems and school information systems used for purposes of con-
veying content related to the education of students; or teachers
from using a social media platform for educational instruction.
Finally, this section would clarify that the FCC may not seek re-
covery of funding or delay the processing of a fund application from
a school due to a violation of this title if the school, school board,
local educational agency, or other authority made a good faith ef-
fort to comply with the requirements in this title and correct any
known violations of such requirements within a reasonable period
of time.
Section 203. Internet safety policies.
This section would require elementary or secondary schools that
receive Federal funding under section 254(h) of the Communica-
tions Act of 1934 to submit copies of their internet safety policies
to the FCC, to be made available in an easily accessible, public
database.

TITLE III—SEVERABILITY
Section 301. Severability.

invalid, the remaining provision of this Act and the amendments
made by this Act shall not be affected.

school, school board, local educational agency, or other
authority with responsibility for administration of the
