BOTTLES AND BREASTFEEDING EQUIPMENT SCREENING
ENHANCEMENT ACT
MAY6, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 260]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 260) to amend the Bottles and
Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act to require hygienic han-
dling of breast milk and baby formula by security screening per-
sonnel of the Transportation Security Administration and per-
sonnel of private security companies providing security screening,
and for other purposes, having considered the same, reports favor-
ably thereon without amendment and recommends that the bill do
pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of this legislation is to direct the Transportation Se-
curity Administration (TSA) to issue or update guidance to mini-
mize the risk of contamination of breast milk, baby formula, puri-
fied deionized water for infants, juice, and other related products
that are subject to re-screening or additional screening, including
adherence to hygienic standards.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
After terrorists plotted to bring liquid explosives on-board air-
craft in August 2006, TSA banned all liquids, gels, and aerosols

from carry-on luggage.1 In September 2006, however, the TSA
amended the ban to allow for a limited quantity of liquid on-board,
now known as the TSA 3–1–1 liquids rule.2 TSA’s 3–1–1 liquids
rule allows passengers to bring containers holding liquids, aerosols,
gels, creams and pastes of 3.4 ounces or less that fit into one quart-
sized plastic bag in carry-on luggage.3 Any containers larger than
3.4 ounces, or in addition to what can fit in a quart-sized plastic
bag, must be put into checked baggage.
The Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening (BABES)
Enhancement Act4 exempts baby formula, breast milk, purified de-
ionized water for infants, and juice from TSA’s 3–1–1 liquids re-
striction. The law includes additional training requirements for
TSA screening personnel. Yet, families continue to report instances
of TSA delaying screening or prohibiting families from carrying
covered infant liquids through security checkpoints.5 Additionally,
families have reported that TSA’s wipe down of bottles, pumps, or
formula, in screening for explosives and other contaminants, has
contaminated such medically necessary items.6
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 260, the BABES Enhancement Act, would do the following:
• Direct TSA to, not later than 90 days after the date of enact-
ment and every 5 years thereafter if appropriate, issue or up-
date guidance to minimize the risk for contamination of any
breast milk, baby formula, purified deionized water for infants,
and juice (as well as ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs
and other accessories required to cool breast milk, baby for-
mula, and juice) that is subject to re-screening or otherwise
subject to additional screening; and
• Direct the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspec-
tor General to audit and report to Congress on TSA’s compli-
ance with the BABES Enhancement Act.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 260, the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening En-
hancement Act, was introduced on January 27, 2025, by Senator
Duckworth (for herself and Senators Daines, Cruz, and Hirono) and
was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Trans-
portation of the Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee met
in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 260 re-
ported favorably without amendment.
1‘‘Terrorists plot to detonate liquid explosives carried onboard at least 10 airliners traveling
from the UK to United States and Canada. British Police foil the plot. In response, TSA bans
all liquids, gels and aerosols from passenger carry-on luggage.’’ See ‘‘Timeline: Aug. 2006 Trans-
atlantic Aircraft Plot,’’ Transportation Security Administration (https://www.tsa.gov/timeline).
2‘‘A month after the implementation of the original liquids ban, TSA amends its rules gov-
erning liquids in passenger carry-on baggage and allows airline passengers to carry liquids, gels
and aerosols in containers of only 3.4 ounces or less in a single, clear, resealable 1-quart plastic
bag.’’ See ‘‘Timeline: Sep. 2006 3–1–1 Liquids Rule,’’ Transportation Security Administration
(https://www.tsa.gov/timeline).

House companion legislation, H.R. 820, was introduced on Janu-
ary 28, 2025, by Representative Swalwell (for himself and 14 origi-
nal cosponsors) and was referred to the Committee on Homeland
Security of the House of Representatives. Seven cosponsors were
later added.
118TH CONGRESS
S. 1570, the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening En-
hancement Act, was introduced on May 11, 2023, by Senator
Duckworth (for herself and Senators Daines and Hirono) and was
referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation of the Senate. Senator Cruz was added as a cosponsor on
January 30, 2024. On July 31, 2024, the Committee met in open
Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 1570 reported fa-
vorably without amendment. On September 25, 2024, S. 1570
passed the Senate by unanimous consent.
A House companion bill, H.R. 3386, was introduced on May 16,
2023, by Representative Porter (for herself and Representatives
Salazar and Swalwell) and was referred to the Committee on
Homeland Security of the House of Representatives. Sixteen co-
sponsors were later added. On September 25, 2024, H.R. 3386 was
ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security
by voice vote.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 260 would require the Transportation Security Administration
(TSA) to issue or update guidance to minimize the risk of contami-
nating breastmilk, baby formula, and related accessories during the
passenger screening process at airports. The bill also would require

the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security to
audit that guidance.
According to information from the agency, TSA regularly updates
its guidance for screening breastmilk and related items under cur-
rent law. On that basis, CBO estimates that implementing that
provision would not significantly affect the federal budget. Based
on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that conducting the
audit would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period; any
related spending would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Emma Uebelhor. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 260 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘Bot-
tles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act’’.
Section 2. Hygienic handling of breast milk and baby formula dur-
ing aviation security screening.
This section would amend the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equip-
ment Screening Act7 by adding new sections to:
• Require the TSA Administrator to issue or update guidance
within 90 days of enactment, and every 5 years after (if appro-
priate), to minimize the risk for contamination of any breast
milk, baby formula, purified deionized water for infants, and
juice (as well as ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs, and
other accessories required to cool breast milk) subject to re-
screening or additional screening.
• Direct TSA to consult with nationally recognized maternal
health organizations in developing the guidance for covered in-
fant liquids undergoing additional screening and adherence to
such protocols. This provision would apply to TSA and con-
tracted airport screening personnel.

liquid scanners, breast milk, baby formula, purified deionized
water for infants, and juice (as well as ice packs, freezer packs,
frozen gel packs, and other accessories required to cool breast
milk).
