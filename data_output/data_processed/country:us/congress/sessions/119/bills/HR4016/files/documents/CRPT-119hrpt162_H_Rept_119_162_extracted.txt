COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT
The Subcommittee on Defense held six oversight hearings and
seven classified sessions during the period of February to June

Section 4:
2025. Hearings were held in open session, except when the security
classification of the material to be discussed presented no alter-
native but to conduct those hearings in executive or closed session.
INTRODUCTION
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 Department
of Defense discretionary funding is $831,513,000,000 which is equal
to the fiscal year 2025 enacted regular appropriation. The rec-
ommendation invests in America’s military superiority, shapes a
more efficient and effective Department of Defense, protects from
threats at America’s border, and takes care of servicemembers and
their families.
The Committee recommendation is fiscally responsible and ad-
heres to the discretionary budget topline put forward by the Ad-
ministration in the abbreviated budget proposal. This recommenda-
tion was developed to complement the defense investments moving
on a parallel legislative track through the reconciliation process.
While these efforts are coordinated, the mandatory spending pro-
posals in the Administration’s budget fall outside the jurisdiction
of this Committee. Taken together these spending proposals rep-
resent the first $1 trillion budget request for defense.
These national security investments represent a historic step for-
ward in enhancing readiness, modernizing the force, shoring up
munitions stockpiles, revitalizing necessary shipbuilding capacity
and production, protecting the nation’s borders from illegal traf-
ficking of people and dangerous drugs and materials, initiating a
Golden Dome for America by enhancing our air and missile defense
research and development, taking care of our service members, and
fostering innovation in the industrial base.
Importantly, enhancing our investments in national defense is
not just about additional funding, it is also about resourcing the
right things. The Committee appreciates the Administration’s
shared dedication to eliminating waste and pursuing governmental
efficiency within the Department of Defense and the Intelligence
Community.
Furthermore, this recommendation realizes true budget savings
resulting from the Administration’s immediate and diligent efforts
by legislating funding reductions and efficiencies. However, the
Committee’s effort to support this goal was hampered by the lack
of a full budget proposal and detailed justification material. This
lack of information meant that the Committee was unable to exam-
ine up-to-date program execution data, in the context of a full fiscal
year 2026 request. Nonetheless, the Committee offers its rec-
ommendation on a timeline to allow for on-time consideration and
enactment. Funding a program must be timely (Kelly Johnson’s
Rule #11).
Despite the lack of information, the Committee maintained its
long-standing tradition of producing a bill in a bipartisan manner
to ensure the appropriate use of valuable taxpayer funds. This
Committee has produced a bill that meets our obligations to the

warfighter and to keep this nation safe from ever-growing threats
by making tough choices.
DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY
For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit
Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of
1987 (Public Law 100–119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of
1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘program, project, and activ-
ity’’ for appropriations contained in this Act shall be defined as the
most specific level of budget items identified in the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act, 2026, the related classified annexes
and Committee reports, and the P–1 and R–1 budget justification
documents as subsequently modified by congressional action.
The following exception to the above definition shall apply: the
military personnel and the operation and maintenance accounts,
for which the term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is defined as the
appropriations accounts contained in the Department of Defense
Appropriations Act.
At the time the President submits the budget request for fiscal
year 2027, the Secretary of Defense is directed to transmit to the
congressional defense committees budget justification documents to
be known as the M–1 and O–1, which shall identify, at the budget
activity, activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts
requested by the President to be appropriated to the Department
of Defense for military personnel and operation and maintenance
in any budget request, or amended budget request, for fiscal year

Section 5:
2027.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE
The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the re-
programming guidance for acquisition accounts as specified in the
report accompanying the House version of the Department of De-
fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–
279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall be
$15,000,000 for military personnel and operation and maintenance;
and $15,000,000 for procurement and research, development, test
and evaluation.
Additionally, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is di-
rected to continue to provide the congressional defense committees
annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II and quarterly,
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III
and IV shall comply with guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropria-
tions Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogramming actions are set at either
the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or
research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less.
These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined
value of transfers into or out of a military personnel (M–1); an op-
eration and maintenance (O–1); a procurement (P–1); or a research,
development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval

reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addi-
tion, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming
procedures for congressional special interest items are established
elsewhere in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in the tables for each appropria-
tion account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indi-
cated in the tables.
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been provided or items for
which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the project level
tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in
this report are congressional special interest items for the purpose
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these
items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount,
as specifically addressed in the Committee report.
FISCAL YEAR 2025 ENACTED POSITIONS
The fiscal year 2025 enacted position detailed in this report re-
flects the amount enacted in the Full-Year Continuing Appropria-
tions and Extensions Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4), which was
transmitted to the Department of Defense as part of consultations
prescribed in section 1422 and do not reflect subsequent changes
made by the Department as established in its baseline for re-
programming.

DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM
The Committee recommends a total of $40,917,184,000 for the
Defense Health Program to support worldwide medical and dental
services for active forces and other eligible beneficiaries.
GOLDEN DOME
On January 27, 2025, the President signed an executive order
creating the Iron Dome for America, more commonly called the
Golden Dome for America, to develop a next-generation missile de-
fense shield to protect the American people from the growing
threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles, and
other advanced weapon systems. Providing for the common defense
of the Nation is a fundamental responsibility of the United States
Government and the Committee strongly supports the goals and
objectives of Golden Dome. Importantly, such an ambitious endeav-
or will require a comprehensive national effort and a clear common
understanding between the Department of Defense and the Com-
mittee of the detailed plans, cost, tradeoffs, and risks involved in
developing and fielding such a complex system.
To date, the Department of Defense has yet to provide informa-
tion on what exactly it entails and how it intends to implement
Golden Dome or to make the case that it is feasible or affordable.
The Committee applauds the Department for naming a highly
qualified senior military officer to lead this effort, but the Com-
mittee will need a detailed understanding of the overall architec-
ture and capabilities envisioned for Golden Dome, both in the near-
term—the next three years—and at full operational capability. The
Department of Defense must clearly articulate to the Committee
what current programs across the Department are part of Golden
Dome and how they will be augmented and integrated to support
it. Furthermore, the Committee will require detailed proposals, re-
alistic cost estimates, and risk assessments of new investments and
new technologies for Golden Dome. In addition, the Committee
needs to understand the role, responsibility, and resources provided
by key allies and partners in Golden Dome.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees,
not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act and quar-
terly updates thereafter, with a comprehensive plan, in classified
form if necessary, that addresses the reference architecture, capa-
bilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the
next-generation missile defense shield. In addition, the Committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a separate budget jus-
tification volume with the fiscal year 2027 budget request specifi-

cally detailing the program descriptions, justifications, and budget
requests associated with Golden Dome, including a crosswalk of
funds requested for Golden Dome-related programs executed across
the Department.
F/A–XX
The Committee is deeply concerned by the Navy’s declining in-
vestment in strike fighter aircraft, particularly at a time when car-
rier air wings are sustaining high operational tempo across global
theaters. This shortfall comes as the People’s Republic of China is
rapidly out-producing the United States in advanced fighters and
threatens to surpass U.S. air superiority in the Indo-Pacific, as the
Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command recently testified. Chi-
na’s continued advancements in carrier aviation underscores the
urgent need to modernize and enhance the Navy’s carrier air wing.
The Committee continues to strongly support the Navy’s efforts
to develop the F/A–XX, a next-generation, carrier-capable strike
fighter to replace the aging F/A–18E/F Super Hornet fleet. The
Committee recognizes the unique capability that Navy’s F/A–XX
program will provide in terms of air superiority to the fleet, includ-
ing greater operational range, speed, stealth, and enhanced surviv-
ability. The Committee understands the Navy’s requirement for a
sixth-generation fighter remains unchanged and emphatically notes
that the Air Force’s F–47 program is not interchangeable with
Navy’s carrier-capable program. The Committee notes that both
programs are necessary parts of the future joint fight and failure
to pursue Navy’s F/A–XX program risks leaving the U.S. dan-
gerously outmatched in a high-end conflict.
The Committee is dismayed by recent actions within the Depart-
ment to pause or delay progress on this critical program, despite
strong bipartisan and bicameral congressional support. In fiscal
year 2025, Congress provided $453,828,000 with the clear expecta-
tion that the Navy would award an Engineering and Manufac-
turing Development (EMD) contract. To date, no contract has been
awarded, which the Committee considers a failure to execute con-
gressional intent.
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes
$971,580,000 to continue development of the F/A–XX program and
directs the Secretary of Defense to obligate these and any prior
funds in a manner that supports accelerated design, system inte-
gration, and risk reduction activities to achieve an accelerated Ini-
tial Operational Capability (IOC).
Further, the Secretary of the Navy is directed, not later than Au-
gust 12, 2025, to submit a report to the congressional defense com-
mittees that details: (1) the current acquisition strategy and up-
dated schedule for awarding the EMD contract; (2) a revised devel-
opment and fielding timeline for the F/A–XX program to meet an
accelerated IOC; (3) any programmatic, budgetary, or policy bar-
riers that have delayed execution of prior-year funds.
ARMY TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE

2025, the Secretary of Defense directed the Secretary of the Army
to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy to accel-
erate delivery of critical capabilities, optimize force structure, and

divest of programs deemed obsolete or inadequate to meet the re-
quirements of future fights.
While the Committee supports the Army’s intent to become a
leaner, more lethal, and adaptive force; the Committee is dis-
concerted by the manner in which the Army has chosen to present
its plans and rationale to achieve the objectives set out in the Army
Transformation Initiative (ATI) to the congressional defense com-
mittees. To date, the Army has yet to provide complete budgetary
details, tradeoffs, and risk assessments of proposed divestments
and investments of capabilities and programs associated with ATI.
In addition, the Committee must be informed of the Army’s future
force structure and end strength targets in its pursuit of elimi-
nating waste and optimization. Consequently, in drafting its rec-
ommendation, the Committee is unable to take the Army Trans-
formation Initiative proposal into full consideration until further
details have been provided.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Army and
the Chief of Staff of the Army to provide a briefing to the House
and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees, not later than
July 31, 2025, that addresses fiscal year 2026 budgetary impacts
and funding requirements across the future years defense program,
capability-based requirements and identification of capability gaps
as a result of planned divestments, and an implementation plan for
Army Transformation Initiative efforts. In addition, the Committee
directs the Secretary of the Army to inform the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than 30 days prior to implementation,
of any additional proposed changes taking place as part of the
Army Transformation Initiative or broader transformation efforts.
DIVERSIFIED CAPABILITIES
The Committee strongly supports fielding and maintaining an
array of capabilities to enable combatant commanders to create di-
lemmas, sow doubt, and increase strategic and operational com-
plexity for the adversary. Previous ‘divest to invest’ strategies have
led to funding tradeoffs between emerging and existing capabilities,
often leading to premature divestment or retirement of platforms.
The Committee believes the U–2 Dragon Lady continues to offer
combatant commanders with intelligence, surveillance, and recon-
naissance critical to their overall intelligence picture. The Com-
mittee remains concerned about timely follow-on capabilities, and
therefore includes a general provision that prohibits divestment of
the majority of the U–2 fleet and provides $55,000,000 in Oper-
ation and Maintenance, Air Force, to support U–2 programmed
depot maintenance.
Further, the Committee firmly believes that a combination of air
and space assets for mission sets such as early warning are nec-
essary today and will be required well into the future. Therefore,
the Committee recommendation includes $500,000,000 in Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force for the E–7 Wedgetail
that will replace airborne capability lost by the retirement of the
E–3 Airborne Warning and Control System.

heading the ‘‘Munitions Stock,’’ directed the Secretary of Defense
and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to jointly submit a report
on current and future munitions shortfalls. The Committee directs
the Secretary of Defense and Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff to
submit an updated report, following the same parameters, to the
congressional defense committees, not later than 120 days after en-
actment of this Act. The report shall be submitted in an unclassi-
fied form and may include a classified annex.
The Committee notes that significant sums have been provided
for munitions in prior years through Department of Defense Appro-
priations Acts, Supplemental Appropriations Acts, and replenish-
ment funds. A comprehensive view of munitions procurement
across funding sources is required to ensure an accurate picture of
industrial base health and capacity. The Committee directs the
chiefs of staff for each of the military services to submit quarterly
reports to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, start-
ing not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, on the
services’ total munitions requirements. In addition to providing a
table listing the total munitions requirements, this report shall in-
clude production quantities by fiscal year, noting the source of the
funds being used to procure those quantities; the total capacity of
the line; and changes in projected quantities and capacity from the
previous quarter’s report. The report shall be submitted in an un-
classified form and may include a classified annex.
Lastly, the Committee notes that 10 U.S.C. 222c, Chapter 9, di-
rects an annual report to the congressional defense committees on
outyear unconstrained total munitions requirements and outyear
inventory numbers. The Committee reminds the chiefs of staff of
each of the military services that this report shall accompany the
annual President’s budget request.
LEVERAGING COMMERCIAL DEFENSE ACQUISITION SOFTWARE-AS-
SERVICE
The Committee notes the significant investment in the defense
industrial base, none more so than the shipbuilding industrial base
where substantial investments are being made to strengthen and
expand manufacturing capabilities throughout the supply chain,
up-to and including additional super module production locations.
Despite this investment, the government still employs legacy stove-
piped supply chain management systems and processes that are
not capable of the active supply chain management that is required
across the life cycle of a program.
Further, the Committee notes that commercial off-the-shelf sup-
ply chain management software is currently available, and in some
cases employed at the program level. Program managers that are
leveraging these commercial tools should be commended for their
willingness to innovate and proactively anticipate and mitigate
supply chain challenges. However, the disaggregated employment
of these solutions limits their potential impact. Today’s supply
chains are global, complex, and shared across industries and gov-
ernment weapons systems of all types.
Therefore, the Committee urges the Secretary of the Navy to ex-
plore enterprise-wide opportunities to employ and scale firm-fixed-
price commercial off-the-shelf defense acquisition software-as-a-
service (SaaS) to solve persistent cost and schedule challenges in

weapon systems across their life-cycle. These defense acquisition
cost and schedule challenges expressly include supply chain risk
and assurance, obsolescence part management, alternative
sourcing, foreign ownership due diligence, science and technology
scouting, small business utilization, prototyping and rapid fielding,
and modernization. The firm-fixed price commercial off-the-shelf
defense acquisition SaaS shall integrate real-time defense and com-
mercial data, leverage artificial intelligence, automate tasks and
reporting, and align acquisition timelines with operational de-
mands.
Further, the Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide a report
to the congressional defense committees, not later than 90 days fol-
lowing enactment of this Act, that details the current supply chain
management systems employed by program managers, to include
the fiscal year 2026 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)
resourcing profile for each system. The report shall also detail a
plan for employment of modern commercial software technology to
improve program supply chain management, including a resourcing
profile across the FYDP.
TECHNICAL COMPETENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE—SPACE
FORCE PILOT PROGRAM
The Committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense continues to struggle with delivering critical capabilities on-
time and on-budget. Earlier this year, the President signed an ex-
ecutive order directing the Secretary of Defense to review the anti-
quated defense acquisition process, address burdensome regula-
tions, and make recommendations to incentivize the acquisition
workforce to utilize innovative acquisition authorities and take
measured risks. The Committee supports this review and looks for-
ward to receiving the recommendations resulting from it. However,
the Committee would like to add that it believes a major contrib-
utor and perhaps the root cause of the Department’s failed acquisi-
tion system is less an issue of process and authorities but is fun-
damentally caused by the military rotation system where program
managers are replaced every two to three years and rarely in the
job long enough to become effective.
Admiral Hyman Rickover—Father of the Nuclear Navy—testified
before the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee nearly 50
years ago about the core problem in managing complex develop-
ment programs. Rickover stated that due to the short duration in
the job, program managers ‘‘have only the shallowest knowledge of
the theory of the techniques they must deal with and little experi-
ence with the practical problems involved. And they are never kept
long enough on the job to acquire such skill and knowledge. Before
the results are in, the manager will have moved and a new man-
ager, equally unqualified technically, will take his place.’’ Rickover
continued, ‘‘naturally the new manager will feel no responsibility
for prior decisions and actions; his primary ambition will be to keep
the project moving in the hope that it will not fail during his own
tour. Thus, responsibility cannot be fixed and there is bound to be
little continuity in technical direction for most of the defense devel-
opments underway today.’’
Rickover’s assessment is as true today as it was 50 years ago.
The Committee notes that statutes have been in place for years re-

quiring tenure of program managers, but sadly the Department
routinely ignores the statute, favoring instead to rotate officers fre-
quently in order to better position them for promotion. The Com-
mittee feels strongly that promotions should be based on merit and
accomplishment, not based on getting the plum assignments to
‘‘punch the right tickets.’’ The Committee strongly encourages the
Department to take Rickover’s assessment to heart and require
program managers to stay in their position until the job is done.
The issue of program manager technical competency is more crit-
ical than ever as defense systems and weapons platforms are more
technologically complex than ever, such as with space systems.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
pose to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees,
not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, a plan for
a pilot program in the Space Force to organize its programs and
people by mission area. The Committee encourages the Department
to require those assigned to each mission area to serve for substan-
tially longer tours of service so that they may develop and build the
technical skills commensurate with the challenges they face. While
the Committee is aware of the Space Force’s Integrated Mission
Delta (IMD) concept, it does not go far enough in eliminating the
seam between the operations community and the acquisition com-
munity. The intent of the pilot program is to implement mission
area program offices with responsibility, authority and account-
ability for the entire life-cycle of a mission, from system concept,
through acquisition, development, fielding, and operational life.
Furthermore, the Space Force pilot program should examine com-
bining the enlisted and officer ranks into a single system with
fewer ranks, elimination of the current occupational specialty cat-
egories, such as acquirers or operations, in favor of specializations
focused on mission areas, such as missile warning or satellite com-
munications, with assignments focused on developing deep exper-
tise in all aspects of a mission area. The objective is to build tech-
nical competency and depth in mission areas that will be better po-
sitioned to make wise decisions in managing and delivering the ca-
pabilities the warfighter needs.
SPACE FORCE MISSION AREA BUDGET REPORT
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to continue
to submit a report for Space Force programs that organizes and
aligns all budget lines for programs, projects, and activities into
mission areas, such as missile warning, satellite communications,
and position, navigation, and timing. The report shall also include
separate mission areas for enterprise management, enterprise in-
formation technology, and facilities and logistics. Each mission area
shall include a clear statement of the mission goals and plans, a
detailed and compelling justification for the requested budget,
number of military and civilian personnel required to carry out
each mission area, and an alignment of all the relevant individual
budget line items without further consolidation from the traditional
budget exhibits and activity groups of the various types of appro-
priations. The Committee notes that the Space Force has in the
past funded a significant portion of its overhead expenses through
taxes on programs in the procurement and the research, develop-
ment, test and evaluation accounts. This practice distorts the budg-

ets for the programs in these accounts and obscures the true over-
head cost of the Space Force. Therefore, the report shall clearly ac-
count for Space Force overhead costs in the appropriate mission
areas without taxes being levied on programs. The Secretary of the
Air Force is directed to submit a fully completed report with the
submission of the fiscal year 2027 President’s budget request.
DEFENSE INNOVATION UNIT AND DEFENSE INNOVATION COMMUNITY
OF ENTITIES
The Committee views innovation as foundational to high per-
forming teams and high performing teams are the fabric of high
performing organizations. The Committee is encouraged the De-
partment has recognized the value of the Defense Innovation Unit
(DIU) as a contributor to acquisition improvements within existing
authorities. Specifically, the Committee notes the Department’s
early emphasis to scale adoption of Software Acquisition Pathway
wherein the Secretary of Defense directed collaboration between
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
and DIU to develop an implementation plan utilizing Commercial
Solutions Openings (CSO) as the default solicitation approach for
software acquisitions. The Committee applauds the Department for
increasing opportunities for commercial solutions. The Department
cannot afford to make decisions that result in vendor-lock on capa-
bilities and enabling activities in any domain, hardware or soft-
ware. The Committee looks forward to understanding more about
the implementation plan to scale adoption of the Software Acquisi-
tion Pathway approach.
The Committee believes the Department continues to make sig-
nificant progress in facilitating collaborative innovation environ-
ments and recognizes a review of organizations in the innovation
ecosystem is underway. The Committee anticipates the review to
be thorough and thoughtful, and that the DIU, as an organization
and leader of the Defense Innovation Community of Entities
(DICE), retains uninhibited access to Department leadership. As
evidenced by the Committee’s recommendations for fiscal year
2026, the Committee continues to support Accelerate the Procure-
ment and Fielding of Innovative Technologies (APFIT), DIU, Office
of Strategic Capital (OSC), and many efforts led by DICE organiza-
tions. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Department to
implement recommendations outlined in the Government Account-
ability Office report GAO–25–106856 fortwith. Implementation of
the recommendations would facilitate enhanced DICE synergy, pro-
vide strategic focus to investments in innovation, and promote best
practices in leveraging commercial technology.
INDUSTRIAL BASE POLICY
The Committee is pleased that the Office of Industrial Base Pol-
icy published a National Defense Industrial Strategy and Imple-
mentation Plan that can begin to address long-standing crevasses
in the defense industrial base. The Committee believes the Depart-
ment has not properly resourced the defense industrial base and
arguably, until relatively recently, was laissez-faire in thoroughly
understanding relationships, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities in the
supply chain that if understood, and valued, would have resulted
in prioritized budgeting and greater resources. The Department

can no longer afford to avoid issues and must act with urgency to
shore up critical gaps in the industrial base.
The Committee is cautiously optimistic that the Department is
motivated to address the range of issues spanning from dependence
on foreign sources of critical minerals to single points of failure
within a supply chain. The Committee urges utilization of commer-
cially available data and analytic tools as well as federally funded
research and development centers to intensely analyze, illuminate,
and subsequently resource a combination of traditional and emerg-
ing technologies to dramatically reduce supply chain
vulnerabilities, radically strengthen domestic manufacturing, and
significantly elevate advanced and emerging manufacturing tech-
nologies.
Furthermore, the Committee applauds the Department’s actions
to prioritize and tackle programs experiencing systemic perform-
ance difficulty in delivering capabilities on time and on budget. The
Committee is interested in understanding the Department’s anal-
yses of what is fully uncovered by detailed program reviews cur-
rently underway. Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to,
not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, submit a
report to the congressional defense committees, on the drivers of
schedule delays, cost overruns, and performance difficulty on meet-
ing technical requirements for all programs identified as requiring
Department leadership to formulate a ‘‘turn-around’’ strategy. This
report shall minimally include trends, if any, relating to defense in-
dustrial base weaknesses, supply chain vulnerabilities, and work-
force constraints. Furthermore, the report shall attempt to cal-
culate cost estimates relating to schedule delays, specifically.
U.S. TRANSFORMATION AND TRAINING COMMAND
The Committee is aware of the Army’s decision to consolidate
Training and Doctrine Command and Army Futures Command into
a single Transformation and Training Command, and looks forward
to a detailed plan on the consolidation of force generation, force de-
sign, and force development under one headquarters.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later than
July 25, 2025, on the Army’s plan to merge the two major com-
mands. The briefing shall include: (1) the roles, responsibilities,
and authorities to be assigned to the Commander of the Trans-
formation and Training Command; (2) a description of the relation-
ship between such authorities and the authorities of the estab-
lished Army acquisition enterprise; (3) resources to be realigned
from the Army Training and Doctrine Command and Army Futures
Command, to include any costs associated with the consolidation;
and (4) a description of proposed force structure changes.
CONTRACTING STRATEGIES AND GUIDANCE RELATING TO
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Committee recognizes the Department recently published
contracting strategies and guidance relating to Intellectual Prop-
erty (IP). The Committee values an approach focused on tailored IP
rights and balancing the interests of industry and the Department.
The Committee is optimistic that the Department and industry,
alike, recognize the complementary nature of IP rights and Mod-

ular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and agree increased lethality
and value to the taxpayer are the outcomes of harmonizing IP
rights and MOSA. The Committee looks forward to collaborating
with the Department to ensure resources are available to support
the Federated IP Cadre and acquisition professionals to scale pro-
ficiency in negotiating data rights to ensure taxpayer dollars are
spent wisely.
OPERATIONAL ENERGY
The Committee expects the Department to recognize the value in
uninterrupted access to energy to improve lethality as well as op-
portunities to reduce operating costs. There is direct correlation be-
tween resilient, enduring energy access and decisive advantage.
The Committee notes, consistent with other industrial base policy
concerns that have received anemic resourcing year-after-year,
operational energy efforts are often not prioritized. Therefore, the
Secretary of Defense is directed to submit biannual reports on ad-
vancements in operational energy efforts to the House and Senate
Defense Appropriations Committees, beginning not later than 60
days after enactment of this Act. The reports shall include a de-
tailed breakout of all investments underway throughout the De-
partment that contribute to the current Department of Defense
Operational Energy Strategy as well as new focus areas that may
have emerged since the strategy was published in 2023.
BUDGET OR APPROPRIATIONS LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
Title II of this Act includes a provision that prohibits the use of
funds in this Act to plan or implement the elimination or consolida-
tion of a budget or appropriations liaison office of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military de-
partment, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed Forces
into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison office. The House Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Defense relies heavily on these of-
fices to conduct its oversight responsibilities and make funding rec-
ommendations for the Department of Defense. The Committee
notes that while the separate offices of legislative affairs within the
Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments
offer assistance to the authorizing committees and individual mem-
bers of Congress, such assistance is provided on a parallel and sep-
arate track from the assistance provided to this Committee and its
Members by the budget or appropriations liaison office of the Office
of the Secretary of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military
department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed
Forces. As the offices of legislative affairs do not possess the exper-
tise and direct relationship to the Financial Management and
Comptroller organizations, which are essential to the effective com-
munication between the Department and the Committees on Ap-
propriations, it is critical that the budget or appropriations liaison
offices remain independent from the legislative liaison offices, have
organizational parity, and retain the authority to respond directly
and promptly with the information required by the Committee and
its Members.
Furthermore, with a reduction in personnel across the Depart-
ment and an apparent increase in congressional advisors who at-

tempt to supplant the budget or appropriations liaison offices, the
Committee is concerned that the ability of budget and appropria-
tions liaison offices to exercise their responsibility towards the
Committee is negatively impacted. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries to pro-
vide appropriations liaison offices with organizational parity and
proper resourcing, ensure that these offices have tasking authority,
and serve as the primary advisors to senior leaders in the Depart-
ment of Defense on appropriations and budget related matters.
INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
The Committee recognizes the importance of international initia-
tives and the trilateral AUKUS security partnership in particular.
The AUKUS security partnership helps create a more lethal force
that further integrates the United States, United Kingdom, and
Australian forces, as well as lifts the domestic defense industrial
base under the regulatory framework authorized under the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024 (Public Law
118–31). Given the strategic nature of international initiatives,
AUKUS in particular, the Committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense to provide the congressional defense committees a report, not
later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act and quarterly
updates thereafter, on the progress of Pillar 2 technology efforts re-
lating undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, artificial intel-
ligence and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-
hypersonic capabilities, electronic warfare, innovation and any fu-
ture efforts/initiatives being considered. The report will include
budget profiles and schedules, a full list of industry performers con-
tributing to ongoing efforts, and challenges that are slowing col-
laboration and progression to deliver capabilities.
COUNTER-UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS
The Committee remains concerned about the escalating threat
posed by unmanned aerial systems (UAS), including the potential
for loitering munitions and other advanced drone technologies to
undermine U.S. defense capabilities and jeopardize national secu-
rity. The Committee supports the Department’s efforts to advance
Counter-UAS (C–UAS) capabilities. Accordingly, the Secretary of
Defense is directed to, not later than 90 days after the enactment
of this Act, submit a report to the congressional defense committees
on research, development, test, and evaluation of C–UAS tech-
nologies throughout the Department. The report shall outline the
Department’s current and planned C–UAS initiatives, including an
assessment of existing systems’ effectiveness against emerging
threats, coordination with interagency partners, allies, academia,
and industry to advance C–UAS efforts, and illuminate challenges
integrating C–UAS solutions into air defense systems in complex
environments, such as urban or highly rural areas. Additionally,
the report shall include funding provided to date, broken out by
Service, component, or agency, as well as a full list of industry per-
formers contributing to ongoing efforts.

DOD REPORT ON SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION
The Committee supports the Department of Defense Integrated
Primary Prevention (IPP) workforce, Sexual Assault Prevention
and Response (SAPR), and related support staff who are tasked
with reducing harmful behaviors, preventing sexual assault and
harassment, and providing specialized response services. The Com-
mittee seeks to understand if recent workforce actions have had
any impact on command climates and prevention and response to
combat sexual assault and harassment. As such, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary of Defense to submit a report within 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act to the House and Senate Ap-
propriations Committees that includes: the total number of billets
designated to IPP, SAPR, and related roles at the start of the cal-
endar year 2025; the number of vacant positions that have been
open over one year; details on any exemptions designated to hiring
IPP, SAPR, and related roles; and the number of staff who have
opted to accept the deferred resignation program, disaggregated by
month of acceptance.
CIVIL RESERVE MANUFACTURING NETWORK
The Committee is deeply concerned about the national security
implications of China’s global manufacturing dominance. The abil-
ity of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to scale and field sys-
tems quickly has highlighted the calcification of the United States
defense acquisition system which struggles to deliver systems on
time and on budget. Action is needed to immediately accelerate the
Department’s adoption of commercially available artificial intel-
ligence (AI)-driven additive manufacturing factories to preserve
America’s military advantage. The Department has an exceptional
opportunity to scale advanced manufacturing technologies in a way
that bolsters the defense industrial base and the broader American
industrial base. A network of dual-use factories would have the
ability, with the same tooling on the same day, to adaptively use
metallic additive manufacturing for structural components required
in ships, submarines, munitions, ground vehicles, aircraft, or space-
craft. By qualifying such factories, the Department would establish
a model for a broader Civil Reserve Manufacturing Network
(CRMN) that could have qualified capacity to rapidly scale weapons
during wartime, while reducing taxpayer burden by manufacturing
commercial goods during peacetime, with no capital expenditure
when transitioning between products. The taxpayer expects the De-
partment to maximize every dollar. To emphasize the need for a
CRMN, the Committee recommends more than $131,700,700 in
Army, Air Force, and Defense-Wide Research, Development, Test
and Evaluation accounts to initiate the establishment of a CRMN.
Furthermore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a report and brief to the congressional defense committees,
not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, outlining
a plan to qualify the first factory in Fiscal Year 2026. This briefing
and report will also include a path for transitioning existing pro-
duction approaches to these advanced manufacturing techniques
that are capable of scaling through direct government purchase of
system hardware structures as ‘‘Government Furnished Equip-
ment’’ for integrators, with improved government data rights that

enable agile broadening of the supply chain for subcomponents to
improve supply chain resiliency. This plan should include ap-
proaches to government efficiency like stimulating the use of ad-
vanced manufacturing through application of Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 48, Value Engineering, to reduce cost without sac-
rificing performance, reliability, qualify, or safety. The plan should
also identify statutory constraints and recommendations to stream-
line the establishment of the CRMN.

MILITARY PERSONNEL OVERVIEW
The Committee recommendation provides $176,171,154,000 for
the military personnel accounts, which fund military pay and al-
lowances, recruitment and retention initiatives, and overall quality
of life programs for active duty, National Guard, and reserve per-
sonnel. The recommendation provides an increase in basic pay for
all military personnel by 3.8 percent, effective January 1, 2026.
The Committee continues to encourage constructive evaluations of
recruitment and retention programs, bonus and special pay incen-
tives, and personnel benefit programs for fiscal year 2026. The
Committee remains supportive of programs intended to enhance
the morale and quality of life of military personnel and their fami-
lies.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for Re-
programming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2026 ap-
propriations accounts not later than 60 days after the enactment
of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from executing
any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other than
originally appropriated until the aforementioned report is sub-
mitted to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Sub-
committees.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal prior ap-
proval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in the Services’
military personnel accounts between budget activities in excess of
$15,000,000.
MILITARY PERSONNEL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been provided or have
been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in
paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report
are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base
for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be
carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically
addressed in the Committee report. Below threshold
reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or reduce fund-
ing from congressional special interest items as identified on the
DD Form 1414.
PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION
The Committee commends the Secretary of Defense for directing
the formation of a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Task Force
to ‘‘ensure that the Department of Defense provides the highest
quality moving services for our warriors, civilian employees, and
their families.’’ The Committee is concerned that the PCS process
is inefficient, too costly, and severely impacts morale, quality of
life, and readiness of service members and their families.
Relatedly, the Department continues to struggle to keep many of
its critical acquisition programs on schedule and at cost. In recent
hearings, the Committee has noted that this is not a new issue and
pointed to the nearly 50-year-old testimony of Admiral Hyman
Rickover before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on De-

fense concerning the pitfalls of an acquisition system that replaces
program managers every two or three years.
Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes a reduction
of $662,872,000 for rotational travel across the active-duty compo-
nents. The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide
a briefing within 90 days after the enactment of this Act to the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the findings of
the PCS Task Force with emphasis on quality of life improvements
and stability across the Department’s acquisition programs.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a
baseline report that shows the Special Operations Command’s oper-
ation and maintenance funding by subactivity group for the fiscal
year 2026 appropriation not later than 60 days after the enactment
of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is further directed to submit
quarterly execution reports to the congressional defense committees
not later than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter that ad-
dresses the rationale for the realignment of any funds within and
between budget subactivities and the movement of any base funds
used to support overseas contingency operations. Finally, the Sec-
retary of Defense is directed to notify the congressional defense
committees 30 days prior to the realignment of funds in excess of
$15,000,000 between subactivity groups.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been provided or have
been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in
paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report
are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base
for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be
carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically
addressed in this report. Below threshold reprogrammings may not
be used to either restore or reduce funding from congressional spe-
cial interest items as identified on the DD Form 1414.
QUARTERLY OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE UPDATES
Regular interaction with each of the Services’ financial manage-
ment offices enhances the ability of the Committee to perform its
essential oversight responsibilities. The Committee notes the suc-
cessful quarterly meetings this year with each of the Services and
directs the Director of each of the Service’s Operations Divisions
(Financial Management and Budget) to continue to provide quar-
terly briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
on their respective operation and maintenance execution rates in
fiscal year 2026.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET EXECUTION DATA
The Secretary of Defense and Service Secretaries are directed to
provide the congressional defense committees with quarterly budg-
et execution data. Such data should be provided not later than 45
days after the close of each quarter of the fiscal year and should
be provided for each O-1 budget activity, activity group, and sub-
activity group for each of the active, defense-wide, reserve, and Na-
tional Guard components. For each O-1 budget activity, activity
group, and subactivity group, these reports should include the
budget request and actual obligations amount, the distribution of
unallocated congressional adjustments to the budget request, all
adjustments made by the Department in establishing the Base for
Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) report, all adjustments resulting
from below threshold reprogrammings, and all adjustments result-
ing from prior approval reprogramming requests.
SOLAR MODULES AND INVERTERS
The Committee is concerned that solar modules and inverters
manufactured by Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC), as defined
by section 9901(6) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, could undermine
United States national security. Therefore, the Committee urges
the Secretary of Defense not to award federal financial assistance
or contracts for the purchase of solar modules or inverters manu-
factured by FEOCs. The Committee also urges the Secretary of De-
fense not to procure electricity from a solar energy system con-
taining solar modules or inverters manufactured by an FEOC.
VIEQUES AND CULEBRA
The Committee remains concerned by the pace and scope of envi-
ronmental restoration on the island municipalities of Vieques and
Culebra in Puerto Rico. The Committee directs the Secretaries of
the Army and Navy, in collaboration with the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the
Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, and other local stake-
holders, to submit a report to the congressional defense committees
no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. The report
shall provide a detailed status update on current cleanup activities,
a plan for addressing remaining contamination and unexploded or-
dinance hazards, a projected time horizon for completion of the
cleanup; and a funding plan outlining annual requirements and
planned contracting actions to achieve a thorough decontamination
result on both islands.
PUEBLO OF ISLETA UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE REMEDIATION
The Committee remains concerned with the pace and scope of
munitions and unexploded ordnance (UXO) removal on Pueblo of
Isleta. The Committee encourages the Assistant Secretaries of the
Air Force and the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment
to work closely with the National Nuclear Security Administration,
Department of Energy, and the officials from Pueblo of Isleta to
continue tribal consultation, participation, and transparency in the
survey and removal of munitions and UXO to achieve a thorough

and expedited removal process. This should include any informa-
tional gaps on types and amounts of debris and/or ordnance that
might threaten public health.
The Committee directs the Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force
and Army for Installations, Energy and Environment to submit a
report to the congressional defense committees not later than 90
days after the enactment of this Act detailing all respective muni-
tions, UXO removal, decontamination authorities, and plans appli-
cable to Pueblo of Isleta.
To fully address the issue, the Committee encourages each of the
Assistant Secretaries for Installations, Energy and Environment to
work collaboratively with other agencies who have conducted weap-
ons-related activity on and around native lands to ensure all muni-
tions, UXOs, and hazardous materials are surveyed. Where weap-
ons-related activity between the Services and other agencies over-
lap, both now and in the past, the Committee directs the Assistant
Secretaries for Installations, Energy and Environmental to provide
a report 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act to the con-
gressional defense committees providing the site, the amount and
type of munitions/remnants found that are under the jurisdiction
of that specific Service, and the cost and plan to remove it.
AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND CV–22 OSPREY MISHAPS
Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the Commander, Special Operations Command shall submit to
the House of Representatives and Senate Appropriations Sub-
committees on Defense a report, with a follow-on briefing, that in-
cludes the results of accident investigations pertaining to any crash
of the CV–22 Osprey since the introduction of the aircraft or other
mishap findings involving the failure of the single high-speed plan-
etary pinion gear.
FOOD INSECURITY
The Committee recognizes the steps the Department of Defense
has taken to address food insecurity, including those outlined in
the ‘‘Strengthening Food Security in the Force: Building on Our
Progress’’ report delivered, in December 2023. The Committee ac-
knowledges the findings of registered dieticians embedded within
the 62nd Medical Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, who cre-
ated a food pantry to address food insecurity affecting the health
and readiness of Service members and families and encourages the
Department to support other units who are seeking to emulate the
food pantry initiative. The Committee further encourages the De-
partment to educate units on the benefits of creating a food pantry
to address food insecurity.
MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT
The Committee recognizes the need for comprehensive data
measuring employment among military spouses over time. The
Committee encourages the Department of Defense to engage with
the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collaborate in assessing the po-
tential for measuring labor market outcomes and characteristics of

military spouses with existing survey data and explore options for
modifying such surveys to capture this population.
MILITARY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE ORGANIZATIONS
The Committee encourages the Service Secretaries to fully fund
each military criminal investigative organization (MCIO) commen-
surate with their increased caseloads. The Committee directs the
Service Secretaries to provide a briefing within 120 days after the
enactment of this Act to the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees on the ongoing efforts to improve the MCIOs, including
the need for updated case management systems, improved cold
case units, and staffing of hard to fill posts.
MEDIA COMPANIES
The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the
United States, the federal government should work to ensure fair
access to its advertising contracts for small, disadvantaged busi-
nesses and businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, minori-
ties, and women. The Committee directs each agency under juris-
diction of this Act to include the following information in its fiscal
year 2027 budget justification: expenditures for fiscal year 2026
and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2027 for all contracts for
advertising services; contracts for the advertising services of so-
cially and economically disadvantaged small businesses concerns
(as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.
637 (a)(4)); and contracts for the advertising services of service-dis-
abled veteran-, women-, and minority-owned businesses.
QUANTUM WORKFORCE STUDY
The Committee recognizes the importance of developing a strong
quantum workforce and encourages the Department of Defense to
work with the National Science Foundation in developing a pipe-
line of quantum talent to address our national security needs. The
Committee expects the Department of Defense, through the Office
of the Under Secretary of Research and Engineering, to develop a
workforce that covers each area of the Science, Technology, Engi-
neering and Mathematics (STEM) fields to employ physicists, com-
puter science engineers, chemists, and mathematicians. To ensure
this workforce is developed, the Committee directs the Secretary of
Defense to provide a report to the congressional defense committees
that provides the numbers of STEM personnel on staff across the
Department for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 and the numbers budg-
eted for in fiscal year 2026 within 45 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act.
COORDINATION WITH TRIBAL NATIONS
The Committee is pleased that the Department of Defense has
entered into partnerships with Tribal Nations to coordinate proving
grounds and testing ranges for active duty and National Guard
troops in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Plains States. The
Committee encourages the Department to consider additional part-
nership agreements and expand coordination where practicable.

U.S. OVERSEAS INSTALLATION COMMISSARIES
The Committee is concerned by the limits foreign countries place
on U.S. products in commissaries located on U.S. overseas installa-
tions. In particular, the Committee notes that undue restrictions
have been placed prohibiting the transit of poultry to commissaries
on U.S. overseas installations based on outbreaks of avian influ-
enza in the United States. These restrictions are even stricter than
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) restrictions within the
United States. The Committee believes that products that meet
U.S. regulatory standards that have been deemed safe for com-
merce by USDA and identified for military use should be consid-
ered for exemptions. The Committee encourages the Secretary of
Defense, in concurrence with the Secretary of State, to work with
the Secretary of Agriculture to negotiate with foreign governments
that host U.S. overseas installations to allow exemptions to transit
products to the commissaries in such foreign countries.

NAVAL AIR STATION OCEANA
The Committee remains concerned about the facility conditions of
Naval Air Station Oceana, the Navy’s primary location for force de-
velopment and force generation of strike fighter capability for east
coast-based carrier air wings and strike groups. While the Com-
mittee appreciates the Navy’s increased emphasis on investment in
infrastructure, particularly for enablers of fleet readiness, there re-
mains a lack of focus on sustaining long-term investments to im-
prove readiness. Further, continued reliance on traditional ap-
proaches and solutions will not solely contribute to increased facil-
ity conditions and improved readiness. Given the magnitude of cost
and scope of outstanding repairs as well as the cost and schedule
of new military construction, the Committee encourages the Navy
to determine the suitability of tension fabric structures, particu-
larly for large facilities such as hangars.
KENNEBEC RIVER FEDERAL NAVIGATION CHANNEL
The Committee supports the Memorandum of Agreement signed
in January 2020 denoting the responsibilities of the Department of
the Army and the Department of the Navy for the regular mainte-
nance of the Kennebec River Federal Navigation Channel. The
Committee is concerned that the channel is not currently being
maintained to the required depth on an annual basis, affecting the
movement of Navy surface combatants, and encourages the Sec-
retary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy to respond with
the appropriate resources and planning to ensure that the channel
is passable annually, per the Memorandum of Agreement, to en-
sure the navigability of the Kennebec River for the test, trial and
delivery of newly constructed Navy surface combatants to the At-
lantic Ocean. The Committee directs the Secretaries of the Army
and Navy to provide a briefing to the congressional defense com-
mittees on progress to achieve the goals outlined in the Memo-
randum within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
MARINE INVASIVE SPECIES AT JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR HICKAM
Marine invasive species pose a potential threat to the unique ma-
rine ecosystems and operational readiness at Joint Base Pearl Har-
bor-Hickam. These non-native organisms can damage naval infra-
structure by clogging cooling systems, damaging hulls, and increas-
ing maintenance costs. Removal and control of invasive species en-
sures mission readiness and preserves the base’s strategic capabili-
ties.
The Secretary of the Navy is encouraged to support a program
to control and eradicate invasive coral at domestic naval installa-
tions. These efforts should consider carrying out invasive coral con-
trol and eradication programs, supporting interagency and inter-
governmental responses, and carrying out an education program to
help prevent the introduction of new invasive marine species into
the waters of military installations.
TREATMENT OF LIVESTOCK GRAZING PERMITS

ment and proposed compensation for livestock grazing permitees

impacted by the expansion of the Fallon Range Training Complex.
The Committee reminds the Navy that Section 2993 of Public Law
117–263 was intended to compensate impacted grazing permittees
for the generational loss of their operations at full market rates.
The Committee further reminds the Navy that Section 2993 of Pub-
lic Law 117–263 did not provide any discretion for the Navy to use
depreciated loss calculations when determining how to make full
and complete payments to impacted parties for all losses suffered.
Consistent with the law, in the event that replacement forage can-
not be identified, the Committee expects the Navy to make pay-
ments to impacted parties to cover all losses suffered by the loss
of their ranching at full market values for their cattle over a 100-
year time period.

DEFENSE SECURITY COOPERATION AGENCY PROGRAMS
The Secretary of Defense shall, not later than 30 days after the
enactment of this Act, submit to the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees a detailed spend plan for amounts made avail-
able for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The plan shall
include amounts for each program listed in the budget justification
documents and, for International Security Cooperation Programs,
amounts provided in the prior two fiscal years and planned for fis-
cal year 2026 by combatant command, country, and authority. The
plan shall only reflect the amounts requested in the fiscal year
2026 budget justification materials as modified by fiscal year 2025
appropriations. A similar document with requested amounts shall
be provided to such Committees concurrent with the submission of
the fiscal year 2027 President’s budget request.
Of the amount provided for Defense Security Cooperation Agen-
cy, the recommendation includes $1,274,174,000 for International
Security Cooperation Programs. The Committee directs that con-
gressional notifications for these funds specify the fiscal year,
whether funds support ongoing or new programs, and the duration
and expected cost over the life of each program.
The recommendation also includes $500,000,000 for the Taiwan
Security Cooperation Initiative, which is $100,000,000 above the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Such funds are provided to increase
Taiwan’s defense, readiness, and deterrence capabilities. The Com-
mittee expects these programs to be integrated with other security
assistance programs in a manner that complements, rather than
duplicates, efforts and directs the Secretary of Defense to submit
a spend plan to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act.
The Committee also includes a provision that transfers Mexico
from the United States Northern Command area of responsibility
to the United States Southern Command area of responsibility.
This transfer is necessary to enable better coordination and
prioritization between countries within the United States Southern
Command area of responsibility. United States Southern Command
is best positioned to address the shared security challenges be-
tween Mexico and its Central and South American neighbors, par-
ticularly on the issues of drug trafficking and illegal immigration.
NORTHERN TRIANGLE COUNTRIES
The Committee remains interested in evaluations of security co-
operation programs with Northern Triangle countries and requests
that the Secretary of Defense keep the Committee apprised of such
evaluations. The Committee is also concerned about end-use moni-
toring of assistance provided under this heading and directs the
Department of Defense to provide a briefing, not later than 60 days
after the enactment of this Act, on the status of implementation of
recommendations contained in the of Government Accountability
Office report ‘‘Northern Triangle: DoD and State need improved
policies to address equipment misuse’’ (GAO–23–105856). The Com-
mittee is also interested in Army Security Force Assistance Brigade
deployments. Therefore, any congressional notification made pursu-
ant to 10 U.S.C. 321 or 10 U.S.C. 333 should include a description

of the number of individuals deployed and their training; the
amount, type, and purpose of the training and equipment to be pro-
vided to the recipient country’s security forces; the timeline and
source of funds; and how the proposed program would promote the
overall security cooperation goals of the brigade or country.
TANZANIA
The Committee recognizes that Tanzania has remained a stable
partner in the region, despite ongoing instability in neighboring
countries. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that the Depart-
ment of Defense and United States Africa Command (AFRICOM)
have invested in the U.S.-Tanzania partnership through civil-mili-
tary engagements and joint exercises with the Tanzania Peoples
Defense Forces (TPDF), as well as having added Tanzania to the
State Partnership Program. The Committee encourages strength-
ening the U.S.-Tanzania military partnership by continuing their
participation in multinational exercises such as Justified Accord, as
well as military intelligence and senior staff planning conferences.
To better understand the role of Tanzania in the Department’s
plans for the region, the Committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense, with support from the Commander, AFRICOM, to submit a
report not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act to the
congressional defense committees. The report should assess the
strategic importance of partnering with Tanzania, detail additional
military cooperation that can be achieved between U.S. military
forces and the TPDF and evaluate the impact that training with
the TPDF has on American readiness and lethality. The report
should also provide policy and funding recommendations that Con-
gress can adopt to achieve U.S. national security goals and
AFRICOM campaign objectives in Tanzania.
NORTHEAST ASIA
The Department of Defense must provide clarity and a vision re-
garding the enduring mission, force posture, capability develop-
ment, and resourcing priorities for United States Forces Japan
(USFJ), United States Forces Korea (USFK) and United Nations
Command (UNC), consistent with the Interim National Defense
Strategy, integrated deterrence objectives, and evolving regional
threats. U.S. force posture and command and control decisions in
Japan and Korea must reflect both current operational require-
ments and future strategic demands and must be clearly articu-
lated to our allies and partners, as well as to Congress to ensure
alignment with legislative priorities and oversight responsibilities.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command, the
Commander of United States Forces Korea, and the Commander of
United Nations Command, and the Commander of United States
Forces Japan to submit to the congressional defense committees an
assessment that: (1) articulates the interoperability of USFJ,
USFK, and UNC within the context of the most recent Interim Na-
tional Defense Strategy and posture planning documents; (2) evalu-
ates posture, logistics, and command and control challenges that
may inhibit the responsiveness or effectiveness of USFJ, USFK and
UNC, including prepositioned stocks, limitations in strategic mobil-

ity, and operational access; (3) outlines a framework that drives the
capabilities required; and (4) assesses whether current and pro-
grammed force posture, command and control, capabilities, logis-
tics, and infrastructure in Japan and the Republic of Korea are suf-
ficient to support deterrence, warfighting, and integrated cam-
paigning requirements. This assessment shall account for all exist-
ing Host Nation Agreements and shall be delivered to the congres-
sional defense committees by April 1, 2026.
WORKFORCE WITH SECURITY CLEARANCES
The Committee is concerned that the rapid technological progress
in artificial intelligence and other fields has markedly increased
competition for professionals with advanced science, technology, en-
gineering, and math credentials. Current education-to-hire pipeline
programs have shown recruiting success, and the Committee recog-
nizes the progress the Department continues to make in the Trust-
ed Workforce 2.0 initiative. Additionally, the Committee commends
efforts by the Department to partner with academia in creating a
pipeline of students with security clearances, enabling immediate
employment upon graduation, and encourages the Department to
further expand these partnerships across Department of Defense
laboratories, ranges, and installations. The Committee directs the
Secretary of Defense to continue providing Trusted Workforce quar-
terly progress reports to the congressional defense committees.
COUNTER-ISIS TRAIN AND EQUIP FUND
The Committee recommends the following appropriations for the
Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund:
The Committee recommendation continues support for the Iraqi
Security Forces, Kurdish Peshmerga, and the Syrian Democratic
Forces to participate in activities to counter the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria. The Committee directs that congressional notifica-
tions for funds provided under this heading include a description
of the amount, type, and purpose of assistance to be funded, and
the recipient of the assistance; the budget and implementation
timeline, with anticipated delivery schedule for assistance; and a
description of any material misuse of assistance since the last noti-
fication was submitted, along with a description of any remedies
taken.
The Committee commends the Department on reducing the foot-
print of U.S. forces in Syria, enabling them to operate from a more
defensible posture. The Committee, however, is concerned about
the integration of Syrian Democratic Forces into the new Syrian
government’s security forces. The Committee also remains con-

MATERNAL CARE RESPONSE DURING EMERGENCIES
The Committee recognizes the critical role that the National
Guard plays in support of local, state, and federal agencies in pre-
paring for and responding to public health emergencies and domes-
tic disasters. To better prepare National Guard members, the Com-
mittee encourages the Department of Defense within 120 days
after the enactment of this Act to convene a meeting of federal;
state, local, or territorial public health officials; Tribal public
health officials; and public stakeholders representing maternity
care providers, maternal health focused community based organiza-
tions, and patient voices to discuss measures to detect maternal
and child health needs and measures to facilitate access and deliv-
ery of maternal and child healthcare during public health emer-
gencies and domestic disasters. Additionally, the Department
should consider a process for the routine creation, dissemination,
and update of materials related to safe maternity care during pub-
lic health emergencies and domestic disasters.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the re-
programming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the
House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for
Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar
threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $15,000,000 for pro-
curement and research, development, test and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to
continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly,
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III
and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropria-
tions Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogramming actions are set at either
the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or
research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less.
These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined
value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research,
development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addi-
tion, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming
procedures for congressional special interest items are established
elsewhere in this report.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided
only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables.
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been recommended or
items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the
project level tables detailing recommended adjustments or in para-
graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report are
congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for
Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically ad-
dressed elsewhere in this report.

DIVERSIFYING ADVANCED COUNTER-UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM
INVENTORY
The Committee remains concerned about the evolving threat
from advanced, adversarial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and
the Army’s ability to rapidly incorporate novel solutions into their
formal acquistion framework. To support the development of an ac-
quisition framework of innovative counter-UAS (C–UAS) capabili-
ties, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide
a spend plan, not later than 90 days after the enactment of this
Act, to diversify and expand C–UAS systems. The spend plan shall
include detect and track systems, combat-validated C–UAS inter-
ceptors, and any other capabilities as determined by the Secretary.
ARMY INTEGRATED TACTICAL NETWORK AND CRYPTO MODERNIZATION
REQUIREMENTS
The Committee supports the Army’s investments in the
Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) programs, and
recognizes the importance of procuring systems that conform to se-
curity, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities
through the Risk Management Framework process. The Committee
encourages the Secretary of the Army to ensure such levels of secu-
rity are met in current and future tactical radio system procure-
ments.

NAVY ADVERSARY AIRCRAFT FOR TRAINING PURPOSES
The Committee notes the growing requirement for near-peer rep-
resentative air-to-air training using aggressor aircraft with capa-
bilities similar to that of advanced adversaries. The Committee re-
mains supportive of ongoing efforts to increase capabilities of air-
craft assigned to aggressor squadrons; however, the Committee re-
mains concerned about the overuse of some legacy aircraft to carry
out this mission in the long-term. To maintain strategic Navy Re-
serve air strike fighter and air aggressor capability, the Committee
encourages the Secretary of the Navy to transition deployable F/A–
18E/F aircraft considered for divestment, as available, from the Ac-
tive Component to Navy Reserve aviation squadrons.

SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION
The Committee believes full funding is critical for the stability of
the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB) and provides for increased ac-
countability to best ensure the delivery of on-time, on-budget sub-
marines to the fleet. In a time where the industrial base is already
challenged to meet the critical 2030 delivery schedule of the lead
Columbia-class submarine to fulfill the nation’s strategic nuclear
requirement, the Committee believes that incremental funding will
only create further risk to the program. Therefore, the Committee
recommendation includes full funding for one Columbia-class sub-
marine and two Virginia-class submarines.
The Committee notes the Navy’s 45-day Shipbuilding Review
found significant delays, cost overruns, and workforce recruitment
and retention challenges to several critical shipbuilding programs,
but notably reported 12–16 months delay in lead boat construction
of the Columbia-class submarine construction and 24–36 months
delay in Virginia-class construction. Delays in submarine construc-
tion present a significant risk to strategic deterrence, seriously
erode undersea superiority, and negatively impact operational
availability and long-term readiness.
The Committee recognizes that the health of the MIB is vital to
achieving the ‘‘1+2’’ production rate for the Columbia and Virginia-
class programs and meeting national security requirements. There-
fore, the Committee recommendation includes $1,532,000,000 for
the MIB to drive gains in critical areas including supplier capacity
and capability, strategic outsourcing, workforce training, and tech-
nology and infrastructure. This funding is in addition to the
$9,724,700,000 provided since 2018 to revitalize the maritime in-
dustrial base and restore domestic shipbuilding. The Committee
recognizes that the success of this effort requires more than just
funding and that an undertaking of this scale necessitates strategic
and timely investment and rigorous oversight. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
congressional defense committees, not later than 45 days after the
enactment of this Act and semi-annually thereafter, that details
the Navy’s oversight strategy for administering all phases of MIB
funding, including the identification of gaps, selection of projects,
oversight of funding execution, and determining the return on in-
vestment.
After significant subcommittee engagement in the form of official
briefings with the Navy and the prime nuclear shipyards, in De-
cember 2024, Congress provided $2,212,410,000 in supplemental
funding to address infrastructure and workforce limitations at the
private nuclear shipyards. The Committee believes these invest-
ments are necessary to achieving and sustaining the required sub-
marine cadence in the long-term and maintaining international
commitments under the trilateral Australia, United Kingdom,
United States (AUKUS) security partnership. To that end, the
Committee recommendation includes $1,641,160,000 for produc-
tivity enhancements and $521,00,000 for wage enhancements at
the private nuclear shipyards. The Committee directs the Secretary
of the Navy to submit a spend plan for wage and productivity en-
hancement funding provided in this and prior acts not later than

plans.

cure four space launch services under the National Security Space
Launch program line; $641,120,000 to procure seven space launch
services under the Space Development Agency Launch program
line; and $679,350,000 to procure two Global Positioning System III
Follow-On spacecraft. Quantities for other end items funded in the
Space Force procurement account for fiscal year 2026 are the quan-
tities as planned for fiscal year 2026 in the fiscal year 2025 future
years defense program.
NATIONAL SECURITY SPACE LAUNCH INFRASTRUCTURE
Access to space remains critical to national security. In 2024, the
United States conducted a record high of nearly 150 successful
space launches. The Space Force estimates that the tempo of
launches will increase by 25 percent or more over the next few
years. Further, the commercial industry is readying new and larger
heavy-lift launch vehicles to begin regular operations soon. The
limited capacity of the current space launch range infrastructure,
to include processing facilities, launch pads and related infrastruc-
ture, range instrumentation, communication capabilities, utilities,
and roads requires urgent investment and a long-term strategy to
efficiently and effectively meet the demand and maintain U.S. lead-
ership in space. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of
the Air Force to submit to the congressional defense committees,
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, with a long-term
strategy, including a plan of action and milestones, to make invest-
ments and modernize U.S. space launch ranges. In addition, the
strategy and plan shall specifically address Space Force’s projected
plans for commercial heavy-lift launch systems, to include what
sites it will make available for these vehicles, and how it intends
to ensure a competitive, transparent, and cost-effective process for
supporting commercial heavy-lift launch systems use of the ranges.
The strategy shall detail a five-year investment plan by fiscal year
to fully implement the strategy. The investment plan shall include
the use of any funds provided in the reconciliation process for space
launch infrastructure.

ADVANCED ANTICONVULSANT SYSTEM
The Committee applauds the Joint Program Executive Office for
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO–
CBRN) for successfully developing a Food and Drug Administration
approved next generation autoinjector to help forward deployed
personnel effectively respond to chemical weapons and nerve agent
exposure. Moreover, the Committee recognizes the successful tran-
sition from research, development, test and evaluation with JPEO–
CBRN to procurement through the Defense Logistics Agency. The
advanced anticonvulsant system will have wide-spread use by the
Services, both in training and as an essential piece of equipment
to be carried by forward deployed personnel. As the recently pub-
lished 2025 Annual Threat Assessment from the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence makes abundantly clear, the threat of chemical
weapons and nerve agents to our service members is all too real.
Accordingly, the Committee supports a funding level of $42,250,000
for the procurement of the advanced anticonvulsant system.
DEFENSE SUPPLY CHAIN PACKAGING
The Committee recognizes the critical importance of protective
packaging to ensure the safe transport and storage of military
equipment and goods. Packaging materials and solutions are spe-
cifically tailored based on detailed calculations for each require-
ment across the Department’s logistics supply chain. The Com-
mittee urges the Secretary of Defense to prioritize performance, ef-
ficiency, damage avoidance, domestic production, and cost-effective
preferences for protective packaging. Additionally, the Committee
urges the Secretary of Defense to avoid packaging preferences for
alternative or substitute packaging that could result in increased
damage, spoilage, or waste. The Committee directs the Secretary to
provide a combined list of packaging modernization focus areas for
fiscal year 2027 to the House and Senate Appropriations Commit-
tees along with the submission of the President’s budget for fiscal
year 2027.
INDO-PACIFIC AMMUNITION MANUFACTURING
The Committee is concerned with the lack of a forward staged
ammunition manufacturing facility in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore,
the Committee directs the Department of Defense to assess, in co-
ordination with the Department of State and the International De-
velopment Finance Corporation, the feasibility of establishing a
joint ammunition manufacturing and storage facility at United
States Naval Base Subic Bay. The facility would enable the for-
ward staging of ammunition stockpiles and related materials such
as nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and acid. The Committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to provide an update on the progress of
this feasibility study within 60 days of the enactment of this Act.

NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE EQUIPMENT ACCOUNT
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $800,000,000 for
the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account. Of that
amount, $250,000,000 is for the Army National Guard;
$235,000,000 is for the Air National Guard; $115,000,000 is for the
Army Reserve; $46,000,000 is for the Navy Reserve; $22,000,000 is
for the Marine Corps Reserve; and $132,000,000 is for the Air
Force Reserve to meet urgent equipment needs. This funding will
allow the National Guard and Reserve components to procure high
priority equipment used by these components for both their mili-
tary missions and missions in support of State governors. The
funding within this account is not to be used to procure equipment
designated as high-density critical equipment, major weapon sys-
tems, aircraft, and other equipment central to a unit’s ability to
perform its doctrinal mission. The funding within this account is
not to be used to procure equipment purchased by the senior Serv-
ice, to expand or accelerate current Service procurement plans, to
purchase expendable items, or to purchase facilities or equipment
for any requirement able to be satisfied elsewhere.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that
the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account is executed by
the Chiefs of the National Guard and Reserve components with pri-
ority consideration given to the following items: acoustic hailing de-
vices; aircraft survivability equipment and weapons training aids;
aviation status dashboards; cloud defense solutions; controlled hu-
midity preservation; crash-survivable UH–60 helicopter gunner
seats; degraded visual environment systems; emergency response
refuel equipment kits for C–130/135 aircraft; heavy dump trucks;
high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle modernization; im-
proved thermal acoustic blankets; internal auxiliary crashworthy,
ballistically tolerant auxiliary fuel systems for UH–60 helicopters;
KC–135 aircrew ground cooling units; land survey systems; light-
weight, rapidly deployable, computer-based artillery call for fire
training and simulation; litter stabilization systems; modular small
arms ranges and small arms training simulators and tools; NSA
compliant, multiple network configurable, secure tactical voice
bridge; secure enterprise, emergency, and social communication;
software defined radios; UH–72 Lakota mission equipment mod-
ernization; upgraded commercial off the shelf ground mapping for
C–130 aircraft; and vehicle-mounted, man-portable radiological nu-
clear detection systems.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the re-
programming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the
House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for
Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar
threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $15,000,000 for pro-
curement and research, development, test and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to
continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly,
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III
and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropria-
tions Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogramming actions are set at either
the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or
research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less.
These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined
value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research,
development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addi-
tion, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming
procedures for congressional special interest items are established
elsewhere in this report.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided
only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST
ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been recommended or
items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the
project level tables detailing recommended adjustments or in para-
graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report are
congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for
Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically ad-
dressed elsewhere in this report.
LONG ENDURANCE AIRCRAFT
The Committee is aware of similar efforts by the Air Force and
U.S. Special Operations Command to develop a capability to meet
unmanned long range, long endurance intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance mission needs. While the requirements be-
tween the two organizations are not completely aligned, the Com-
mittee believes closer cooperation is critical to fielding a capable
and cost-effective platform. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $15,000,000 in Air Force Research, Development, Test &
Evaluation to pursue this objective. Further, the Committee directs
the Secretary of the Air Force, in cooperation with the Commander,

JOINT READINESS TRAINING CENTER CATALYST PATHFINDER LAB
The Committee recognizes the strategic and training value that
the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Johnson provides the
Army in preparing soldiers for multi-domain operations and devel-
oping next-generation warfighting capabilities. To enhance its role,
the Committee encourages the Secretary of the Army to leverage
the JRTC as a Catalyst Pathfinder Lab in collaboration with re-
gional academic institutions.
In addition, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations
Committees, not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act,
on efforts to establish and expand partnerships between the Joint
Readiness Training Center and regional academic institutions. The
report shall identify potential collaborative research focus areas
aligned to capability-based requirements, and funding require-
ments associated with such efforts.
VAS AI/ML OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM
Modern combat requires visual superiority without cognitive bur-
den. Sophisticated Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS), designed
with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) optimization,
eliminate the need for on-the-fly manual adjustments, allowing op-
erators to stay mission-focused under demanding conditions. There-
fore, the Committee supports and encourages the Department of
the Army to review AI/ML augmented imaging and signal proc-
essing for visual augmentation systems.

NAVAL TELEPHONY MODERNIZATION TO REDUCE MOUNTING
TECHNICAL DEBT
As the Navy evaluates options to modernize its legacy Time Divi-
sion Multiplexing (TDM)-based telephony infrastructure and mi-
grate to secure, scalable, and redundant IP-based technologies, the
Committee recognizes the critical importance of this initiative in
improving the Department of Defense’s (DoD) overall network per-
formance, security, resilience, redundancy, user experience, and
cost. The Committee encourages the Navy to promptly execute this
modernization initiative. The Committee views this as essential to
enhancing the security posture through modernization to DoD secu-
rity standards, maintaining operational readiness through im-
proved network resiliency and survivability, driving cost effi-
ciencies through infrastructure consolidation and transport unifica-
tion, and complying with DoD CIO modernization requirements in
the June 21, 2024 memorandum, ‘‘Technical Debt Reduction in the
DOD Information Network.’’
MAINTENANCE TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORTING OPERATIONAL READINESS
The Committee supports the development and application of crit-
ical maintenance technologies across the areas of shipboard repair,
material availability, and inspection. Through the application of
automated tooling, advanced manufacturing, augmented or virtual
reality and improved inspection technologies, it is imperative that
the Navy’s investments in maintenance technologies keep pace
with the developments made in commercial production lines and
repair facilities. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Sec-
retary of the Navy to ensure that sufficient investment is made to
advance remote support capabilities, streamline maintenance proc-
esses, and enhance operational readiness across the Navy.
RAPID ADVANCED DEPOSITION
The Committee strongly supports the development of the Rapid
Advanced Deposition research that will allow for the reliable and
consistent rapid production of additive manufactured produced
parts and materials developed in support of the warfighter.
COASTAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
The Committee understands the importance of the littoral region
to Navy operations worldwide and believes that testing and train-
ing must take place at secured research and development, and test
and evaluation facilities and replicate the operational and threat
environments that U.S. Navy assets are likely to encounter. Re-
search is needed to study seabed phenomenology and develop tech-
nologies for continuous monitoring and detection of encroachment
threats to reduce seabed vulnerabilities at or near U.S. Navy crit-
ical ocean test and evaluation facilities. The Committee believes
that additional research on the underwater signatures and ocean
hydrodynamics in the littoral regions and the development of pre-
dictive techniques to ensure stealth superiority would be beneficial
for naval operations. The Committee encourages the Navy to con-
duct additional research in this area.

AIR FORCE RESOURCE ALLOCATION
The Committee believes that historical Air Force resource alloca-
tion processes and practices have not been optimized for planning,
programming, and budgeting for requirements across capability
groups. The Committee also shares the Air Force’s assessment that
the status quo will not provide the airpower necessary for future
high-end conflicts.
The Committee recommendation includes substantial funding for
efforts that will continue to require considerable investment, in-
cluding the B–21 Raider, the Next Generation Air Dominance Fam-
ily of Systems, along with other air platforms. The Committee
notes that it is awaiting an updated timeline and details of a re-
phased funding profile for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent
following the programs’ Nunn-McCurdy breach. With these endeav-
ors, along with the development and implementation of the Air
Force’s force design, the Committee strongly believes a healthier
resource allocation process will hinge upon the Air Force’s ability
to more realistically identify and prioritize capabilities required for
successful Air Force and joint missions.
For this reason, the Committee is particularly interested in the
formation of the Integrated Capabilities Command, Integrated Ca-
pabilities Office, and the Integrated Development Office to meet
the desired end state of defining future Air Force needs, developing
modernization plans, ensuring technical feasibility, and executing
realistic acquisitions to meet the needs of the warfighter. To main-
tain oversight of these developing organizations, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, to the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees on the status of these organizations, to
include phasing of associated reorganization along with cost esti-
mates to implement each phase; a proposed laydown of new offices,
commands, or centers, and whether the strategic basing process is
required for their establishment; a description of impacts to mili-
tary and civilians positions by location; and the programmatic im-
pacts of such decisions. The Committee further directs the Director
of the Integrated Development Office and the Commander of the
Integrated Capabilities Command to jointly provide semi-annual
briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on
how each is working to achieve strategic modernization, recapital-
ization, and resourcing for the Air Force.
SENTINEL
The Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program was pro-
vided $3,197,024,000 in the enacted fiscal year 2025 bill. Section
1422 of the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions
Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4) directed the Department of Defense
to consult with the Committee in preparing a spending plan for im-
plementing the fiscal year 2025 enacted amounts. The spend plan
submitted by the Air Force reduced the GBSD budget by an addi-
tional $1,191,00,000, leaving the program $2,006,044,000 for fiscal
year 2025. An adjustment of this magnitude should have been ac-
companied by proactive communications including robust details on

a rephasing plan. The Committee notes that many of these details
remain outstanding.
The Committee recommends for GBSD in fiscal year 2026
$2,031,551,000 and understands additional funds may be available
through reconciliation. Given significant cost changes projected for
this effort, the Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide an
update as soon as possible on the current status of the replan, in-
cluding robust details and associated spending plans. Further, the
Committee directs that the Secretary of the Air Force continue pro-
viding quarterly briefings on the program to the congressional de-
fense committees. The briefings shall include obligation and ex-
penditure data, updated plans for the program, interim schedules,
and updated benchmarks, milestones, and defense industrial base
requirements to achieve a fully Integrated Master Schedule.
NEXT GENERATION AIR DOMINANCE
The Committee is pleased that in March 2025 the Air Force
down-selected and awarded a contract for the F–47, Next Genera-
tion Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $3,194,315,000 in Research, Development,
Test and Evaluation, Air Force for this sixth-generation fighter
platform in fiscal year 2026.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide
the congressional defense committees quarterly briefings, beginning
the quarter following the enactment of this Act, on the status of
the NGAD program. These briefings shall provide programmatic
updates on schedule and funding.
COLLABORATIVE COMBAT AIRCRAFT
The Committee notes persistent concern that in prior years’
budget requests the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fund-
ing line included funding for the Collaborative Combat Aircraft
(CCA) program. The comingling of two significant acquisition pro-
grams limited Congress’ ability to track how funding was allocated
between NGAD and CCA efforts within the year-of-execution. In
order to ensure visibility into cost and performance, and to clearly
trace execution of appropriations, the project level adjustment ta-
bles that accompanied Division A, Title IV, for the Department of
Defense, Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act,
2025 (Public Law 119–4) moved the CCA budget program activity
into a separate and distinct line from NGAD. The Committee rec-
ommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes $494,896,000 for CCA
and understands that additional resources may be made available
through reconciliation.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide
the congressional defense committees quarterly briefings, beginning
the quarter following the enactment of this Act, on the status of
the CCA program. These briefings shall provide programmatic up-
dates on schedule and funding.
B–52 HIGH FIDELITY SIMULATOR MODERNIZATION

aware that the high cost of live flight training and associated main-
tenance and sustainment activities would be offset by capabilities
available by training in a high-fidelity simulator. The Committee
recommendation includes $26,200,000 for the Air Force to collect,
analyze and prepare flight simulation and modeling for the B–52H
flight data model. This funding also provides for associated engi-
neering of new high-fidelity devices and weapons training systems.
Further, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to
submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than 90 days following enactment of this Act, that provides a strat-
egy to develop, test, and procure modernized B–52H high fidelity
flight simulators. This report shall include, by fiscal year, a cost es-
timate by appropriation, budget line item, to procure B–52H high
fidelity flight simulators.

SPACE FORCE ACQUISITION
Space capabilities are increasingly indispensable to national se-
curity. National leadership, combatant commands, and the intel-
ligence community rely on space to provide real-time global situa-
tional awareness. Space also provides the communications, naviga-
tion, and sensing capabilities that enable the United States to
project military power on a global scale and, if necessary, to prevail
in conflict. In fact, much of the force structure across the other
services are designed and sized to rely on space to communicate,
navigate and operate with precision, speed, and accuracy. Without
space capabilities, we would need many more bombs, bullets,
tanks, ships, and planes. Reliable and resilient space capabilities
are essential. However, unlike any other military service the vast
majority of the Space Force’s budget is dedicated to acquisition, a
trend that is expected to increase, especially to support Golden
Dome. Therefore, expertise in space technology and systems engi-
neering and what it enables for space operations are critical core
skills for Space Force Guardians and civilians. Senior leaders must
focus more attention on developing and promoting Guardians with
technical expertise and acquisition experience. To this end, the
Committee has directed the Secretary of Defense, as described in
the front matter of this report, to propose a plan for a pilot pro-
gram in the Space Force to organize its programs and people by
mission area and to require those assigned to each mission area to
serve for substantially longer tours of service in order to develop
and build the technical skills commensurate with the acquisition
and program management challenges they face. The objective is to
build technical competency through real-world experience and
greater depth and breadth of experience to better prepare program
managers and leaders to make wise decisions in managing and de-
livering the capabilities the warfighter needs.
FIXED PRICE CONTRACTING
The Committee notes that in recent years the Space Force has
been more willing to challenge old ways of doing business and has
been more open to taking technical and contracting risks to deliver
more innovative solutions from a broader range of suppliers. The
Committee supports this progress. However, the Committee is con-
cerned that too much emphasis has been put on the use of fixed
price contracts when a program is in the early phase of develop-
ment with significant unknowns and high technical risks. While
fixed price contracts are appealing from a budget perspective, they
are not a panacea and can lead to inappropriate incentives and
even suppress risk taking and innovation. To be clear, fixed price
contracts are an excellent approach when cost, technical risk and
other factors are well known, such as in production runs of the
same or very similar units. The Committee will be very skeptical
of contracting strategies that rely on fixed price contracts for first
articles of new systems or on high-risk developments. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Air Force through the Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration to
continue to provide monthly updates to the House and Senate De-

fense Appropriations Committees on the technical, cost, and sched-
ule status of ongoing acquisition programs.
RESILIENT POSITION NAVIGATION AND TIMING (PNT)
The Committee recognizes the vital importance of enhancing the
resilience of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services pro-
vided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) to ensure its avail-
ability for military operations, particularly in highly contested en-
vironments against sophisticated adversaries. The Committee also
recognizes that GPS has become a critical component of our na-
tion’s infrastructure affecting commerce, transportation, energy dis-
tribution, and agriculture. The loss of GPS, even temporarily,
would cause catastrophic damage to the nation while also severely
impacting military effectiveness. The Committee recommendation
provides $15,000,000 to continue the development of resilient GPS
space systems. However, the Committee is very disappointed that
the Department of Defense has not taken any significant actions to
address the findings and recommendations of the Defense Science
Board’s (DSB) May 2024 classified final report on Position, Naviga-
tion and Timing, which highlights many, but not all, the issues
that must be addressed to make PNT services more resilient, such
as accelerating the delivery of jam resistant user equipment and
increasing resilience of the ground control segment. Therefore, the
Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than 90 days after enactment
of this Act, with a comprehensive written plan of action and mile-
stones for investments in more resilient capabilities across space,
ground, and user equipment segments. This plan shall specifically
address each of the findings and recommendations of the DSB re-
port, as well as provide investments by Service and Agency and by
fiscal year.
STRATEGIC SATCOM ACQUISITION
The Space Force is responsible for delivering several systems
that are critical to the nation’s strategic deterrent and nuclear ca-
pability, including the Evolved Strategic Satellite Communications
(ESS) program. As the critical assured communications system for
senior leadership to carry out orders for nuclear command and con-
trol, the acquisition of the ESS is of utmost importance and must
be done with deep rigor and in close coordination across the other
elements of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications
(NC3) enterprise. The Committee is concerned that the Space Force
is considering using middle-tier acquisition authorities (MTA) rath-
er than implementing the program as a major defense acquisition
program for the development and acquisition of ESS. MTA authori-
ties are for rapid prototyping and rapid fielding of new types of ca-
pabilities and are not an appropriate pathway for a program of the
cost, complexity, and criticality to national security as the ESS sys-
tem. Therefore, the Committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in consultation with the Di-
rector, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, to review the
Space Force acquisition strategy for ESS and make a recommenda-
tion to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Sub-
committee, not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, on

an appropriate path forward that is most likely to lead to mission
success.
NEXT GENERATION OVERHEAD PERSISTENT INFRARED
The Committee continues to strongly support the pivot to pro-
liferated missile warning/missile tracking systems in low-Earth
orbit and medium-Earth orbit, as these systems will provide great-
er resilience and coverage for tactical use. However, these systems,
and their associated ground processing systems are not designed to
meet the strategic indications and warning requirements of the Nu-
clear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) enterprise.
Given the lack of a clear plan to meet strategic NC3 requirements
after the current legacy Space-Based Infrared systems age out, the
Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to re-examine
plans to curtail the current Next Generation Overhead Persistent
Infrared systems for geosynchronous and polar orbits and address
the need for additional spacecraft and updated ground systems to
meet validated national security needs. The Secretary of the Air
Force shall provide a report to the House and Senate Defense Ap-
propriations Committees with findings and recommendations on
the future of strategic systems to meet NC3 requirements not later
than 180 days after the enactment of this Act.
TACTICAL SURVEILLANCE, RECONNAISSANCE, AND TRACKING
The Committee recognizes the increasingly broad range of high-
quality commercial data available to support Space Force missions,
especially space domain awareness. The Committee notes that
Space Force has not requested funding for Tactical Surveillance,
Reconnaissance and Tracking (TacSRT) in previous budget re-
quests and is concerned that funding the project solely through
congressional increases does not enable the project to plan beyond
the year of execution. Therefore, the Committee directs the Direc-
tor of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) to review
the program, its mission use cases and objectives, and its con-
tracting mechanisms; identify and make recommendations for the
pilot project’s organization, its operations, and its use of contracts
with commercial vendors; and identify and make recommendations.
The Director of CAPE shall provide a briefing with the findings
and recommendations of this review to the congressional defense
and congressional intelligence committees not later than 180 days
after the enactment of this Act.
Further, the Committee notes the recently signed memorandum
of agreement between the Space Force and the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and directs the Space Force
to continue to coordinate and collaborate with the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) on the TacSRT pilot project.
The Director of NGA is directed to continue to provide a semi-
annual assessment of the TacSRT pilot program to the congres-
sional defense committees and congressional intelligence commit-
tees.

CYBERSECURITY OF WEAPONS PLATFORMS
The Committee is concerned about potential cyber vulnerabilities
of Department of Defense weapon system platforms, especially
fielded platforms with outdated and unmonitored electronic sys-
tems and data buses. The lack of real-world data to perform on-
board monitoring leaves gaps in understanding the full extent of
the threat environment. Therefore, the Committee recommendation
includes $10,000,000 in Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Defense-Wide for real-time monitoring of weapons systems cy-
bersecurity to implement on-board, near real-time, monitoring ca-
pabilities on high priority weapon system platforms.
ARMSTRONG TEST FACILITY
The Committee is closely monitoring the progress of the Depart-
ment’s programs regarding hypersonic weapons, satellites, space
vehicles, and other national security space developments. The Com-
mittee is aware of the assistance that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration’s (NASA) Neil Armstrong Test Facility (ATF)
has provided to the Department on research and development pro-
grams in these areas and encourages the Department to assist
NASA in providing the ATF with cyber security, physical security,
and other necessary upgrades that will allow the Department con-
tinued access to ATF’s world-class space, aeronautics, and
hypersonic assets.
ALL-DOMAIN ANOMALY RESOLUTION OFFICE
The Committee recognizes the importance of the All-domain
Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in providing the Congress and
the public with transparency and improved understanding of un-
identified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The Committee continues
to support AARO and its mission to improve national security and
public understanding of UAP data through a rigorous scientific
framework and data-driven approach.
FACILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS
The Committee recognizes the Department’s effort to identify
new mechanisms that reduce administrative burdens, increase
transparency, and save taxpayer dollars. We encourage the Depart-
ment to work closely with the extramural research community to
develop an optimized Facilities and Administrative (F&A) cost re-
imbursement solution for all parties that ensures the nation re-
mains a world leader in innovation.
INDOOR AIR QUALITY AT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FACILITIES
The Committee encourages the Department to conduct studies on
how indoor air quality impacts pathogen transmission and the
health of our military personnel. Such studies may include in-
creased use of outdoor air ventilation, high-efficiency particulate
air (HEPA) filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light.

TEST AND EVALUATION ACTIVITIES
The Committee notes the Director of Operational Test and Eval-
uation (DOTE) Strategy Implementation Plan consisted of five stra-
tegic pillars that sought to ‘‘collaboratively and cooperatively trans-
form the Department’s infrastructure, tools, processes, and work-
force.’’ Additionally, since the implementation plan was published,
a Task Force on Test and Evaluation supported approaches out-
lined in the strategy and implementation plan, including reimag-
ining a mission-focused approach to test and evaluation activities
(‘‘test the way we fight’’), leveraging commercial technologies and
best practices, as well as enhancing the use of digital engineering.
The Committee notes DOTE authored a manual on Modeling and
Simulation (M&S) Verification, Validation, and Accreditation
(VV&A), ensuring digital engineering tools effectively support the
evaluation process. The Committee commends DOTE for early rec-
ognition that a transformation in operational test activities would
be needed to meet the accelerating pace of technological adoption,
including the use of digital twins and cloud-at-the-edge computing.
Although digital engineering offers immense potential to early
and continuous test—retest activities, digital engineering will not
replace the need for live testing. Furthermore, it is widely under-
stood that there is increasing need for independent operational test
and evaluation activities required for cyber and electromagnetic
realms. The Committee is concerned that the Department is reor-
ganizing the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evalua-
tion, which includes significant reduction-in-force (RIF), at a time
when the test and evaluation community is transforming to sup-
port unprecedented production and fielding requirements.
Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to, not later than
30 days after the enactment of this Act, submit a detailed report
and provide a briefing, to the congressional defense committees, de-
tailing the impacts to operational test activities currently under-
way, the list of discontinued activities, and the list of activities that
will continue. Additionally, the report should include a detailed
plan for how the Department intends to meet the demand for inde-
pendent test and evaluation, and validating new capabilities ex-
pected to come online in the Future Years Defense Program.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM
The Act includes a general provision which caps the funds avail-
able for Private Sector Care under the TRICARE program subject
to prior approval reprogramming procedures. The general provision
and accompanying report language should not be interpreted as
limiting the amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-
House Care budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities
within the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the
In-House Care and Private Sector Care budget sub-activities are
designated as congressional special interest items. Any transfer of
funds in excess of $15,000,000 into or out of these sub-activities re-
quires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior approval reprogram-
ming procedures for operation and maintenance funds.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide writ-
ten notification to the congressional defense committees of cumu-
lative transfers in excess of $15,000,000 out of the Private Sector
Care budget sub-activity not later than 15 days after such a trans-
fer. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense
to submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, that delineates
transfers of funds, and the dates any transfers occurred, from the
Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to any other budget sub-ac-
tivity.
Additionally, the Committee remains concerned with funding for
Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (FSRM)
being repurposed throughout the fiscal year. Deferring FSRM in
favor of more immediate needs of the Defense Health Program may
seem prudent at the time but comes with costly, severe, and endur-
ing ramifications. For this reason, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide written notification to the congres-
sional defense committees of cumulative transfers in excess of
$15,000,000 out of the Base Operations and Communications budg-
et sub-activity not later than 15 days after such a transfer.
The Committee further directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Health Affairs to provide quarterly briefings to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than 30 days after the end of
each fiscal quarter, on budget execution data for all Defense Health
Program budget activities, and to adequately reflect changes to the
budget activities requested by the Services in future budget sub-
missions. These reports shall also be provided to the Government
Accountability Office.
CARRYOVER
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee recommends one percent car-
ryover authority for the operation and maintenance account of the
Defense Health Program. The Committee directs the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs to submit a detailed spending
plan for any fiscal year 2025 designated carryover funds to the con-
gressional defense committees not less than 30 days prior to exe-
cuting the carryover funds.

MILITARY MEDICAL MANPOWER
The Committee remains concerned that the Department’s han-
dling of military medical billet reductions, in response to the re-
forms mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2017, has negatively impacted access to quality healthcare
services for servicemembers and their beneficiaries, particularly in
areas deemed high risk and health shortage areas by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services.
In addition, the Committee continues to direct the Services’ Sur-
geons General to submit vacancy rates by occupational code to the
congressional defense committees on a quarterly basis and further
directs the Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to submit
vacancy rates among military and civilian medical personnel by lo-
cation and specialty to the congressional defense committees on a
quarterly basis.
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS
The Committee continues to support efforts the Department of
Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have undertaken
with regard to electronic health records and the health record sys-
tem. It is the Committee’s ongoing expectation that the Depart-
ments’ electronic health record systems will be interoperable with
seamless compatibility. The Committee directs the Director of the
Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) pro-
gram office to continue to submit quarterly reports on the progress
of interoperability between the two Departments to the House and
Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the House and
Senate Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations Subcommittees.
The Program Executive Officer of Defense Healthcare Manage-
ment Systems (PEO DHMS), in conjunction with the Director of
the FEHRM and the Director of the Defense Health Agency, is di-
rected to submit quarterly reports to the congressional defense
committees on the cost of the program, including any indirect costs
funded outside of the DHMS Modernization Electronic Health
Record program; and the schedule of the program, to include mile-
stones, knowledge points, and acquisition timelines, as well as
quarterly obligations. In addition, the Committee directs the PEO
DHMS to continue to brief the House and Senate Defense Appro-
priations Subcommittees on a quarterly basis, coinciding with the
report submission.
The Department of Defense’s electronic health record system,
MHS GENSIS, completed full deployment and is transitioning into
the Capability Support phase focused on end user experience. The
Committee directs the Comptroller General to continue quarterly
performance reviews of MHS GENESIS with a focus on whether
the program is meeting expected cost, schedule, scope, quality, and
risk mitigation expectations, to include system enhancements, and
expects the PEO DHMS will provide the Comptroller General reg-
ular and in-depth access to the program to facilitate these reviews.

MEDICAL RESEARCH
The Committee continues to monitor the transition of medical re-
search conducted by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel
Command to the Defense Health Agency Research and Develop-
ment organization to ensure that core medical research funding is
responsive to the needs of servicemembers. Additionally, the Com-
mittee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes $700,000,000
for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs
(CDMRP) to fund high-risk, high-reward medical research. The
Committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health
Affairs to submit to the House and Senate Appropriations Commit-
tees a request for prior approval for any changes in management
structure; functional alignment; or the two-tiered, peer-reviewed
process proposed for the CDMRP program, not less than 30 days
prior to any proposed changes taking place.
Additionally, the Committee continues to support the use of agile
contracting methods, such as other transaction agreements, that
may help mitigate the impacts on medical readiness through pub-
lic-private partnerships and encourages the Department to con-
tinue to leverage these mechanisms to ensure expeditious delivery
of medical solutions.
PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Committee recommends $130,000,000 for the peer-reviewed
breast cancer research program, $75,000,000 for the peer-reviewed
prostate cancer research program, $15,000,000 for the peer-re-
viewed kidney cancer research program, $45,000,000 for the peer-
reviewed ovarian cancer research program, $15,000,000 for the
peer-reviewed lung cancer research program, $17,500,000 for the
peer-reviewed rare cancers research program, $15,000,000 for the
peer-reviewed pancreatic cancer research program, and
$180,000,000 for the peer-reviewed cancer research program that
would research cancers not addressed in the aforementioned pro-
grams currently executed by the Department of Defense.
The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research pro-
gram are directed to be used to conduct research in the following
areas: bladder cancer; blood cancers; brain cancer (including glio-
blastoma); colorectal cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer;
germ cell cancers; liver cancer; lymphoma; metastatic cancers;
melanoma and other skin cancers; myeloma; neuroblastoma; pedi-
atric brain tumors; pediatric, adolescent, and young adult cancers;
sarcoma; stomach cancer; and thyroid cancer. The inclusion of the
individual rare cancers research program shall not prohibit the
peer-reviewed cancer research program from funding the previously
mentioned cancers or cancer subtypes that may be rare by defini-
tion.
The funds provided under the peer-reviewed cancer research pro-
gram shall be used only for the purposes listed above. The Com-
mittee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs
to submit a report, not later than 180 days after the enactment of
this Act, to the congressional defense committees on the status of
the peer-reviewed cancer research program. For each research
area, the report shall include the funding amount awarded, the

progress of the research, and the relevance of the research to
servicemembers and their families.
The Committee commends the Department of Defense for ensur-
ing that projects funded through the various peer-reviewed cancer
research programs maintain a focus on issues of significance to
military populations and the warfighter. This includes promoting
collaborative research proposals between Department of Defense
researchers and non-military research institutions. These collabora-
tions leverage the knowledge, infrastructure, and access to clinical
populations that the partners bring to the research effort. Addition-
ally, promoting these collaborations provides a valuable recruit-
ment and retention incentive for military medical and research per-
sonnel. The Committee encourages the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs to continue to emphasize the importance
of these collaborations between military and non-military research-
ers throughout the peer-review process.
PEER-REVIEWED ALS RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Committee notes that there is a well-documented correlation
between military service and the development of amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis (ALS). Servicemembers are twice as likely to develop
ALS as the general population, although the etiology of ALS and
its linkage to military service remains largely unknown. Therefore,
the Committee recommendation includes $40,000,000 for the peer-
reviewed ALS research program, and encourages the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs to prioritize research that can
bring effective treatments to people living with ALS as soon as pos-
sible.
PEER-REVIEWED TOXIC EXPOSURES RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Committee is concerned by the number of known and un-
known toxins servicemembers are exposed to as part of their mili-
tary service. The Committee remains committed to veterans af-
fected by Gulf War Illness and acknowledges a commonality be-
tween this community and others exposed to substances, including
burn pit exposure, that result in multiple, diverse symptoms and
health abnormalities. Therefore, the Committee recommends
$15,000,000 for the peer-reviewed toxic exposures research pro-
gram. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is di-
rected to select research projects of clear scientific merit and direct
relevance to military exposures to toxic substances, including toxic
industrial chemicals, materials, metals, and minerals. The inclu-
sion of the toxic exposures research program shall not prohibit re-
search in any other congressionally directed research program that
may be associated with conditions or health abnormalities linked
to toxic exposures.
As with other research programs, the Committee expects projects
funded through the peer-reviewed toxic exposures research pro-
gram to maintain a focus on issues of significance to military popu-
lations and the warfighter and that the program shall promote col-
laborative research proposals between Department of Defense re-
searchers and non-military research institutions.

PEER-REVIEWED ARTHRITIS RESEARCH
The Committee remains concerned by the detrimental impact of
arthritis on servicemembers and notes its impact on retention.
Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $10,000,000 for
the peer-reviewed arthritis research program. Funding provided in
the peer-reviewed arthritis research program shall be used to con-
duct research on all forms of arthritis including osteoarthritis,
posttraumatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Further, arthri-
tis research shall not be provided for in other peer-reviewed re-
search programs, and the inclusion of the peer-reviewed arthritis
research program shall not prohibit research in any other congres-
sionally directed research program that may be associated with
conditions or health abnormalities related to arthritis.
ADVANCED ORTHOPEDIC SURGICAL TRAINING FOR MILITARY
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS
The Committee recognizes the importance of utilizing partner-
ships with public, private, and non-profit organizations and institu-
tions to provide short-term specialized medical training to advance
arthroscopic surgical skills and capabilities of military medical pro-
viders. Delivery of direct training based on best practices related
to orthopedic procedures not only increases the proficiency of mili-
tary orthopedic health professionals to improve quality of care and
address readiness issues related to musculoskeletal injuries, but
also may lead to higher rates of retention among military medical
providers.
To address these gaps, Congress has previously appropriated re-
sources beginning in fiscal year 2019 to develop military-civilian
partnerships to ensure military orthopedic health professionals are
provided with advanced surgical training in, and best practices re-
lated to, arthroscopic surgery and techniques. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs
to submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, that outlines a
set of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Further,
the Committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs to submit a report to the congressional defense com-

ment survey, physical readiness test data, and postoperative sur-
vey data collected after musculoskeletal intervention.

ages the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to facili-
tate inclusion of Food and Drug Administration approved, non-ad-
dictive alternatives to opioids on the formulary. In addition, the
Committee supports efforts of the Department to promote and in-

BLOOD PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT
The Committee is concerned of the potential impact to readiness
and military heath care operations resulting from a lack of quality
blood products and supply. The Committee notes the military’s de-
pendency on civilian blood donations to maintain an adequate sup-
ply of blood and blood products, and encourages the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Director of the Defense
Health Agency to explore the adoption of innovative blood products
with increased shelf life and broadened storage parameters, such
as freeze-dried platelet-derived hemostatic products, and enable
such use throughout the continuum of care.
TRICARE–5 TRANSITION
The Committee recognizes there have been widely reported
issues impacting beneficiary experience and beneficiary health cov-
erage, including significant delays in customer service response
times and provider reimbursement requests as part of the transi-
tion to the TRICARE T–5 contract. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the Director of the Defense Health Agency to provide a brief-
ing to the congressional defense committees, not later than 90 days
after the enactment of this Act, detailing the actions the Defense
Health Agency, and the two regional T–5 Managed Care Support
Contractors, have taken to improve patient experience, minimize
delays in customer service response times, and review and approve
provider reimbursement requests.
ROUTINE MONITORING OF PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS
The Committee notes the importance of mental health screening
during the perinatal period in identifying potential mental health
conditions during and after pregnancy that may increase the risk
of maternal death.
The Committee encourages the Director of the Defense Health
Agency to educate providers and TRICARE beneficiaries on the im-
portance and availability of perinatal mental health screenings, de-
velop and implement a process to routinely monitor the frequency
of perinatal mental health screenings in direct and private care set-
tings, and establish corrective actions for improvement to prevent
undiagnosed and untreated mental health conditions.
MATERNAL HEALTH PROVIDER SUPPORT
The Committee remains concerned about the shortage of current
and prospective maternal health care professionals for
servicemembers and their families, particularly obstetrician/gyne-
cologists and midwives. Therefore, the Committee encourages the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to seek avenues
to expand the number of maternal health-related scholarships
granted by the Health Professions Scholarship Program.
METASTATIC CANCER RESEARCH
Existing research suggests a genetic basis for susceptibility to
metastatic cancer or resistance to metastasis. However, the Com-
mittee believes more research and data are required to develop a
comprehensive understanding of this complex process. Clinical

trials are an important aspect of that process, and a diverse rep-
resentation of patients in clinical trials is integral to the develop-
ment of medications and therapies that effectively treat disease.
Therefore, the Committee encourages the Director of the Con-
gressionally Directed Medical Research Programs to continue to
partner with outside experts and other federal agencies to imple-
ment recommendations from the April 2018 Metastatic Cancer
Task Force Report to Congress concerning diverse enrollments in
clinical trials. In addition, the Committee directs the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs to provide a briefing to the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees, not later than 180
days after the enactment of this Act, on the progress of imple-
menting recommendations contained in the April 2018 report.
ADVANCED OPERATIONAL MEDICAL READINESS REQUIREMENTS
The Committee recognizes the importance of integrated, inter-
operable, and mobile life-support and critical care capabilities for
effective deployed battlefield medicine and enroute care across do-
mains. To meet operational medical readiness requirements, the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs must prioritize
the use of equipment that addresses resupply and evacuation-con-
strained forward scenarios, and operational medical logistic limita-
tions such as reliable oxygen sources, theater-controlled substances
and cold chain items. Therefore, the Committee directs the Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with
the Director of the Defense Health Agency and the Services’ Sur-
geons Generals, to provide a briefing to the congressional defense
committees on an implementation plan that shall identify potential
equipment for procurement, educational training programs, and
sustainment requirements.
PREVENTING DEADLY AND COSTLY RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN
MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITIES
The Committee recognizes the public health crisis caused by
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and that respiratory infec-
tions are the number one contributor to HAIs. Servicemembers
treated by the Military Health System for a condition or injury
should not be subject to an additional infection developed during
their stays at military treatment facilities. The Committee notes
that preventable HAIs lead to unnecessary losses of life, increase
defense healthcare costs, and that past efforts to reduce respiratory
HAIs have had little success.
Therefore, the Committee encourages the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Health Affairs, in conjunction with the Director of the
Defense Health Agency, to prioritize the development of ultraviolet
respirators that allow for increased breathability for use by pa-
tients at military treatment facilities with respiratory infections to
eliminate pathogens in exhaled breath and prevent the spread of
infection.

REPORT ON OVERSIGHT OF REPAIRS AND EXECUTION OF FUNDS MADE
AVAILABLE TO WILLIAM BEAUMONT ARMY MEDICAL CENTER
The Committee understands that William Beaumont Army Med-
ical Center, located on Fort Bliss, Texas, has sustained a series of
publicly reported water restrictions and water leaks which have, at
times, negatively impacted patient experience and posed a risk to
facility servers located within the hospital. Given these issues to
the facility, the Committee directs the Director of the Defense
Health Agency to provide a report, not later than 60 days after the
enactment of this Act, to the congressional defense committees that
details actions undertaken to address these repair requirements.

The Committee remains concerned regarding the scourge of illicit
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids that kill thousands of Ameri-
cans every year. The Department of Defense has a key role in help-
ing to combat this crisis through its drug-interdiction and counter-
drug programs. The Committee, therefore, has increased funding
for the program over the fiscal year 2025 enacted levels. This in-
cludes additional funding for the National Guard and to facilitate
interdiction efforts by United States Southern Command.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure that international
programs requested and supported by this account do not duplicate
programs funded by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in
the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account. Any con-
gressional notification submitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 284 shall
identify any resources within the Operation and Maintenance, De-
fense-Wide account that are allocated for similar or related pur-
poses.
PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ZONE MAPS
The Committee acknowledges the Department of Defense has es-
tablished certain National Defense Zones. The Committee also rec-
ognizes that maps outlining the boundaries of these National De-
fense Zones must be easily accessible to the public, such that local
communities may deconflict recreational activities or other tradi-
tional usage of these recently designated lands. Therefore, the
Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to publicly release and
maintain web-accessible maps identifying all current or future Na-
tional Defense Zones, to include a Community Liaison Point of
Contact for public inquiries.
OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

MINORITY VIEWS
The Fiscal Year 2026 Defense Appropriations Act totals $831.5
billion. Though the bill is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level, we have deep concerns about how the bill will impact our
military’s readiness since the bill repeats, yet again, the same mis-
takes as the fiscal year 2024 and 2025 House proposals.
Truly disturbing, however, has been the inability of the new Ad-
ministration to provide the Committee with detailed budgetary in-
formation in a timely fashion. It is still a question as to why this
is the case—incompetence, ignorance or outright obstruction. As
the bill is now being reported to the House of Representatives for
consideration, the Committee has been provided only funding levels
and no justification documents have been transmitted for analysis.
The Defense Appropriations Act is the Appropriation Commit-
tee’s largest discretionary funding bill. It is an incredibly complex
piece of legislation and deals with a wide range of national security
issues. Failure to provide annual budget justification documents
impinges on Congress’ oversight responsibilities.
In particular, the budgets for Procurement programs, and the Re-
search and Development efforts required to support them—natu-
rally ebb and flow. Congress must review these 5-year funding pro-
files so that we can answer the questions that are fundamental to
our Subcommittee’s jurisdiction.
We must know what we are buying and why; what we aren’t
buying and why; and what phase research and development efforts
are at.
The Administration has indicated that any increases in Defense
spending in fiscal year 2026 will be enacted through the proposed
Reconciliation Bill, which includes $150 billion of defense funds.
We understand the importance of the investments we make in
our nation’s defense. But, it’s irresponsible to assume Defense pro-
grams can be funded through an unstable reconciliation process,
and when considering the Reconciliation bill, there is a bigger pic-
ture here.
The cost-of-living crisis is felt by every American family—and
that includes military families. The President is not laser focused
on the cost-of-living crisis, which he is actually making worse. This
Administration and the majority are attacking programs that help
families make ends meet in order to give billionaires a tax break.
Safety net programs and other basic services that have been at-
tacked by the Administration and defunded in the Reconciliation
bill not only help with the cost-of-living—they are critical for na-
tional security.
The bill again includes partisan social policy riders that were re-
jected in the fiscal year 2024 conference agreement. The inclusion
of those riders in the process last year, led to a full year Con-

tinuing Resolution and will continue to inhibit the ability to enact
a full year appropriations bill.
It is unfortunate that the majority felt the need to include these
poison pills given the numerous executive orders the President has
issued since his inauguration. Yet the attacks against equality for
women, the LGBTQI community and diversity continue.
Specifically, the bill, again, limits the ability of Service personnel
and their families to receive the reproductive health care they de-
serve. Women make up almost 20% of the military services. And
approximately 80,000 women service members live in a state that
has limited or banned access to reproductive health care. Service
members do not get to choose where they are stationed, and their
duty station should not determine the type of health care they re-
ceive.
Also, there are provisions that disenfranchise lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual and transgender service members rather than making our mili-
tary a welcoming and inclusive place for all those who wish to
serve our country. We should not turn away the talent our military
and our nation needs.
There are provisions included in this bill that continue to need-
lessly attack diversity and inclusion efforts. Though the Adminis-
tration has dismantled all of these types of programs across the
government, they should be reminded that our military is the insti-
tution in our country that most broadly reflects the entire Amer-
ican population. That includes the 33% of active-duty service mem-
bers who identify with a minority group.
Beyond contentious social policy, there are other elements of this
bill that we cannot support.
The bill continues to abandon the needs of an ally, Ukraine. The
bill eliminates funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initia-
tive. This bill should include the long-term assistance that Ukraine
needs. As we have seen over the past year, Putin only becomes
more emboldened as funding is delayed, paused or discontinued.
Our NATO allies continue to provide assistance, but without the
support of the United States, we continue to play into Putin’s
hands.
To add some context, during the President’s first term, House Re-
publicans crafted a Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019
that passed the Committee, 48–4, with overwhelming bipartisan
support. It was a bill that included $250 million for the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative, and did not include the divisive so-
cial policy riders. Chairman Cole and Chairman Calvert voted for
that bill as did we—and a bill like that is a more appropriate start-
ing point for the House of Representatives to conference with the
Senate.
This bill again limits the ability for our government to address
disinformation. Our foreign adversaries are constantly using social
media to spread disinformation here at home in the United States.
This bill deprives the Department of Defense of their responsibility
to set facts straight. This is dangerous, and it would have real na-
tional security implications here at home and abroad.
During full committee consideration, the Committee adopted
amendments offered by the minority to uphold the Posse Comitatus
Act, secure funds for forensic support for victims of sexual assault

and prohibit funds for the transmission of classified material over
unsecured networks. We look forward to working with the majority
to ensure they are enacted into law. Chairman Calvert also indi-
cated a willingness to work with us in conference to restore funds
for life saving DoD medical research programs.
Finally, this bill has been considered during a time of remark-
able upheaval for the Committee. Since the change of Administra-
tion in January 2025 the executive branch has been engaged in a
rampant, unlawful, and unconstitutional disregard for spending
laws. In particular, the Office of Management and Budget has been
at the center of a government-wide effort to thwart the intent of
this Committee’s laws in its actions, while also unlawfully refusing
to publish the agency’s legally-binding budget decisions (known as
apportionments) in contravention of an unambiguous and constitu-
tionally sound assertion of the Congress’s authority to impose
transparency requirements upon the executive branch.
The current administration has stated—at times—an inherent
Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was ap-
proved over the objection of almost all Democrats on the Com-
mittee, the debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just
as former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
William Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney
General with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of the Congress’s constitutional power of
the purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the
Committee places on spending authority through the Congress’s
Article I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict
the purpose for any purpose in the bill, so too does the Committee
decide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is the Congress’s clear
intent to be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
In closing, regrettably at this time, we will be unable to support
passage of this bill, but we look forward to working with the major-
ity to enact a bipartisan bill that strengthens our national security.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT
The Subcommittee on Defense held six oversight hearings and
seven classified sessions during the period of February to June
2025. Hearings were held in open session, except when the security
classification of the material to be discussed presented no alter-
native but to conduct those hearings in executive or closed session.
INTRODUCTION
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 Department
of Defense discretionary funding is $831,513,000,000 which is equal
to the fiscal year 2025 enacted regular appropriation. The rec-
ommendation invests in America’s military superiority, shapes a
more efficient and effective Department of Defense, protects from
threats at America’s border, and takes care of servicemembers and
their families.
The Committee recommendation is fiscally responsible and ad-
heres to the discretionary budget topline put forward by the Ad-
ministration in the abbreviated budget proposal. This recommenda-
tion was developed to complement the defense investments moving
on a parallel legislative track through the reconciliation process.
While these efforts are coordinated, the mandatory spending pro-
posals in the Administration’s budget fall outside the jurisdiction
of this Committee. Taken together these spending proposals rep-
resent the first $1 trillion budget request for defense.
These national security investments represent a historic step for-
ward in enhancing readiness, modernizing the force, shoring up
munitions stockpiles, revitalizing necessary shipbuilding capacity
and production, protecting the nation’s borders from illegal traf-
ficking of people and dangerous drugs and materials, initiating a
Golden Dome for America by enhancing our air and missile defense
research and development, taking care of our service members, and
fostering innovation in the industrial base.
Importantly, enhancing our investments in national defense is
not just about additional funding, it is also about resourcing the
right things. The Committee appreciates the Administration’s
shared dedication to eliminating waste and pursuing governmental
efficiency within the Department of Defense and the Intelligence
Community.
Furthermore, this recommendation realizes true budget savings
resulting from the Administration’s immediate and diligent efforts
by legislating funding reductions and efficiencies. However, the
Committee’s effort to support this goal was hampered by the lack
of a full budget proposal and detailed justification material. This
lack of information meant that the Committee was unable to exam-
ine up-to-date program execution data, in the context of a full fiscal
year 2026 request. Nonetheless, the Committee offers its rec-
ommendation on a timeline to allow for on-time consideration and
enactment. Funding a program must be timely (Kelly Johnson’s
Rule #11).
Despite the lack of information, the Committee maintained its
long-standing tradition of producing a bill in a bipartisan manner
to ensure the appropriate use of valuable taxpayer funds. This
Committee has produced a bill that meets our obligations to the

warfighter and to keep this nation safe from ever-growing threats
by making tough choices.
DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY
For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit
Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of
1987 (Public Law 100–119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of
1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘program, project, and activ-
ity’’ for appropriations contained in this Act shall be defined as the
most specific level of budget items identified in the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act, 2026, the related classified annexes
and Committee reports, and the P–1 and R–1 budget justification
documents as subsequently modified by congressional action.
The following exception to the above definition shall apply: the
military personnel and the operation and maintenance accounts,
for which the term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is defined as the
appropriations accounts contained in the Department of Defense
Appropriations Act.
At the time the President submits the budget request for fiscal
year 2027, the Secretary of Defense is directed to transmit to the
congressional defense committees budget justification documents to
be known as the M–1 and O–1, which shall identify, at the budget
activity, activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts
requested by the President to be appropriated to the Department
of Defense for military personnel and operation and maintenance
in any budget request, or amended budget request, for fiscal year
2027.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE
The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the re-
programming guidance for acquisition accounts as specified in the
report accompanying the House version of the Department of De-
fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–
279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall be
$15,000,000 for military personnel and operation and maintenance;
and $15,000,000 for procurement and research, development, test
and evaluation.
Additionally, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is di-
rected to continue to provide the congressional defense committees
annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II and quarterly,
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III
and IV shall comply with guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropria-
tions Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogramming actions are set at either
the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or
research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less.
These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined
value of transfers into or out of a military personnel (M–1); an op-
eration and maintenance (O–1); a procurement (P–1); or a research,
development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval

reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addi-
tion, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming
procedures for congressional special interest items are established
elsewhere in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in the tables for each appropria-
tion account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indi-
cated in the tables.
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been provided or items for
which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the project level
tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in
this report are congressional special interest items for the purpose
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these
items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount,
as specifically addressed in the Committee report.
FISCAL YEAR 2025 ENACTED POSITIONS
The fiscal year 2025 enacted position detailed in this report re-
flects the amount enacted in the Full-Year Continuing Appropria-
tions and Extensions Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4), which was
transmitted to the Department of Defense as part of consultations
prescribed in section 1422 and do not reflect subsequent changes
made by the Department as established in its baseline for re-
programming.

DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM
The Committee recommends a total of $40,917,184,000 for the
Defense Health Program to support worldwide medical and dental
services for active forces and other eligible beneficiaries.
GOLDEN DOME
On January 27, 2025, the President signed an executive order
creating the Iron Dome for America, more commonly called the
Golden Dome for America, to develop a next-generation missile de-
fense shield to protect the American people from the growing
threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles, and
other advanced weapon systems. Providing for the common defense
of the Nation is a fundamental responsibility of the United States
Government and the Committee strongly supports the goals and
objectives of Golden Dome. Importantly, such an ambitious endeav-
or will require a comprehensive national effort and a clear common
understanding between the Department of Defense and the Com-
mittee of the detailed plans, cost, tradeoffs, and risks involved in
developing and fielding such a complex system.
To date, the Department of Defense has yet to provide informa-
tion on what exactly it entails and how it intends to implement
Golden Dome or to make the case that it is feasible or affordable.
The Committee applauds the Department for naming a highly
qualified senior military officer to lead this effort, but the Com-
mittee will need a detailed understanding of the overall architec-
ture and capabilities envisioned for Golden Dome, both in the near-
term—the next three years—and at full operational capability. The
Department of Defense must clearly articulate to the Committee
what current programs across the Department are part of Golden
Dome and how they will be augmented and integrated to support
it. Furthermore, the Committee will require detailed proposals, re-
alistic cost estimates, and risk assessments of new investments and
new technologies for Golden Dome. In addition, the Committee
needs to understand the role, responsibility, and resources provided
by key allies and partners in Golden Dome.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees,
not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act and quar-
terly updates thereafter, with a comprehensive plan, in classified
form if necessary, that addresses the reference architecture, capa-
bilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the
next-generation missile defense shield. In addition, the Committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a separate budget jus-
tification volume with the fiscal year 2027 budget request specifi-

cally detailing the program descriptions, justifications, and budget
requests associated with Golden Dome, including a crosswalk of
funds requested for Golden Dome-related programs executed across
the Department.
F/A–XX
The Committee is deeply concerned by the Navy’s declining in-
vestment in strike fighter aircraft, particularly at a time when car-
rier air wings are sustaining high operational tempo across global
theaters. This shortfall comes as the People’s Republic of China is
rapidly out-producing the United States in advanced fighters and
threatens to surpass U.S. air superiority in the Indo-Pacific, as the
Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command recently testified. Chi-
na’s continued advancements in carrier aviation underscores the
urgent need to modernize and enhance the Navy’s carrier air wing.
The Committee continues to strongly support the Navy’s efforts
to develop the F/A–XX, a next-generation, carrier-capable strike
fighter to replace the aging F/A–18E/F Super Hornet fleet. The
Committee recognizes the unique capability that Navy’s F/A–XX
program will provide in terms of air superiority to the fleet, includ-
ing greater operational range, speed, stealth, and enhanced surviv-
ability. The Committee understands the Navy’s requirement for a
sixth-generation fighter remains unchanged and emphatically notes
that the Air Force’s F–47 program is not interchangeable with
Navy’s carrier-capable program. The Committee notes that both
programs are necessary parts of the future joint fight and failure
to pursue Navy’s F/A–XX program risks leaving the U.S. dan-
gerously outmatched in a high-end conflict.
The Committee is dismayed by recent actions within the Depart-
ment to pause or delay progress on this critical program, despite
strong bipartisan and bicameral congressional support. In fiscal
year 2025, Congress provided $453,828,000 with the clear expecta-
tion that the Navy would award an Engineering and Manufac-
turing Development (EMD) contract. To date, no contract has been
awarded, which the Committee considers a failure to execute con-
gressional intent.
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes
$971,580,000 to continue development of the F/A–XX program and
directs the Secretary of Defense to obligate these and any prior
funds in a manner that supports accelerated design, system inte-
gration, and risk reduction activities to achieve an accelerated Ini-
tial Operational Capability (IOC).
Further, the Secretary of the Navy is directed, not later than Au-
gust 12, 2025, to submit a report to the congressional defense com-
mittees that details: (1) the current acquisition strategy and up-
dated schedule for awarding the EMD contract; (2) a revised devel-
opment and fielding timeline for the F/A–XX program to meet an
accelerated IOC; (3) any programmatic, budgetary, or policy bar-
riers that have delayed execution of prior-year funds.
ARMY TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE
In pursuit of transformation and acquisition reform, on April 30,
2025, the Secretary of Defense directed the Secretary of the Army
to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy to accel-
erate delivery of critical capabilities, optimize force structure, and

divest of programs deemed obsolete or inadequate to meet the re-
quirements of future fights.
While the Committee supports the Army’s intent to become a
leaner, more lethal, and adaptive force; the Committee is dis-
concerted by the manner in which the Army has chosen to present
its plans and rationale to achieve the objectives set out in the Army
Transformation Initiative (ATI) to the congressional defense com-
mittees. To date, the Army has yet to provide complete budgetary
details, tradeoffs, and risk assessments of proposed divestments
and investments of capabilities and programs associated with ATI.
In addition, the Committee must be informed of the Army’s future
force structure and end strength targets in its pursuit of elimi-
nating waste and optimization. Consequently, in drafting its rec-
ommendation, the Committee is unable to take the Army Trans-
formation Initiative proposal into full consideration until further
details have been provided.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Army and
the Chief of Staff of the Army to provide a briefing to the House
and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees, not later than
July 31, 2025, that addresses fiscal year 2026 budgetary impacts
and funding requirements across the future years defense program,
capability-based requirements and identification of capability gaps
as a result of planned divestments, and an implementation plan for
Army Transformation Initiative efforts. In addition, the Committee
directs the Secretary of the Army to inform the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than 30 days prior to implementation,
of any additional proposed changes taking place as part of the
Army Transformation Initiative or broader transformation efforts.
DIVERSIFIED CAPABILITIES
The Committee strongly supports fielding and maintaining an
array of capabilities to enable combatant commanders to create di-
lemmas, sow doubt, and increase strategic and operational com-
plexity for the adversary. Previous ‘divest to invest’ strategies have
led to funding tradeoffs between emerging and existing capabilities,
often leading to premature divestment or retirement of platforms.
The Committee believes the U–2 Dragon Lady continues to offer
combatant commanders with intelligence, surveillance, and recon-
naissance critical to their overall intelligence picture. The Com-
mittee remains concerned about timely follow-on capabilities, and
therefore includes a general provision that prohibits divestment of
the majority of the U–2 fleet and provides $55,000,000 in Oper-
ation and Maintenance, Air Force, to support U–2 programmed
depot maintenance.
Further, the Committee firmly believes that a combination of air
and space assets for mission sets such as early warning are nec-
essary today and will be required well into the future. Therefore,
the Committee recommendation includes $500,000,000 in Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force for the E–7 Wedgetail
that will replace airborne capability lost by the retirement of the
E–3 Airborne Warning and Control System.

heading the ‘‘Munitions Stock,’’ directed the Secretary of Defense
and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to jointly submit a report
on current and future munitions shortfalls. The Committee directs
the Secretary of Defense and Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff to
submit an updated report, following the same parameters, to the
congressional defense committees, not later than 120 days after en-
actment of this Act. The report shall be submitted in an unclassi-
fied form and may include a classified annex.
The Committee notes that significant sums have been provided
for munitions in prior years through Department of Defense Appro-
priations Acts, Supplemental Appropriations Acts, and replenish-
ment funds. A comprehensive view of munitions procurement
across funding sources is required to ensure an accurate picture of
industrial base health and capacity. The Committee directs the
chiefs of staff for each of the military services to submit quarterly
reports to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, start-
ing not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, on the
services’ total munitions requirements. In addition to providing a
table listing the total munitions requirements, this report shall in-
clude production quantities by fiscal year, noting the source of the
funds being used to procure those quantities; the total capacity of
the line; and changes in projected quantities and capacity from the
previous quarter’s report. The report shall be submitted in an un-
classified form and may include a classified annex.
Lastly, the Committee notes that 10 U.S.C. 222c, Chapter 9, di-
rects an annual report to the congressional defense committees on
outyear unconstrained total munitions requirements and outyear
inventory numbers. The Committee reminds the chiefs of staff of
each of the military services that this report shall accompany the
annual President’s budget request.
LEVERAGING COMMERCIAL DEFENSE ACQUISITION SOFTWARE-AS-
SERVICE
The Committee notes the significant investment in the defense
industrial base, none more so than the shipbuilding industrial base
where substantial investments are being made to strengthen and
expand manufacturing capabilities throughout the supply chain,
up-to and including additional super module production locations.
Despite this investment, the government still employs legacy stove-
piped supply chain management systems and processes that are
not capable of the active supply chain management that is required
across the life cycle of a program.
Further, the Committee notes that commercial off-the-shelf sup-
ply chain management software is currently available, and in some
cases employed at the program level. Program managers that are
leveraging these commercial tools should be commended for their
willingness to innovate and proactively anticipate and mitigate
supply chain challenges. However, the disaggregated employment
of these solutions limits their potential impact. Today’s supply
chains are global, complex, and shared across industries and gov-
ernment weapons systems of all types.
Therefore, the Committee urges the Secretary of the Navy to ex-
plore enterprise-wide opportunities to employ and scale firm-fixed-

weapon systems across their life-cycle. These defense acquisition
cost and schedule challenges expressly include supply chain risk
and assurance, obsolescence part management, alternative
sourcing, foreign ownership due diligence, science and technology
scouting, small business utilization, prototyping and rapid fielding,
and modernization. The firm-fixed price commercial off-the-shelf
defense acquisition SaaS shall integrate real-time defense and com-
mercial data, leverage artificial intelligence, automate tasks and
reporting, and align acquisition timelines with operational de-
mands.
Further, the Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide a report
to the congressional defense committees, not later than 90 days fol-
lowing enactment of this Act, that details the current supply chain
management systems employed by program managers, to include
the fiscal year 2026 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)
resourcing profile for each system. The report shall also detail a
plan for employment of modern commercial software technology to
improve program supply chain management, including a resourcing
profile across the FYDP.
TECHNICAL COMPETENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE—SPACE
FORCE PILOT PROGRAM
The Committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense continues to struggle with delivering critical capabilities on-
time and on-budget. Earlier this year, the President signed an ex-
ecutive order directing the Secretary of Defense to review the anti-
quated defense acquisition process, address burdensome regula-
tions, and make recommendations to incentivize the acquisition
workforce to utilize innovative acquisition authorities and take
measured risks. The Committee supports this review and looks for-
ward to receiving the recommendations resulting from it. However,
the Committee would like to add that it believes a major contrib-
utor and perhaps the root cause of the Department’s failed acquisi-
tion system is less an issue of process and authorities but is fun-
damentally caused by the military rotation system where program
managers are replaced every two to three years and rarely in the
job long enough to become effective.
Admiral Hyman Rickover—Father of the Nuclear Navy—testified
before the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee nearly 50
years ago about the core problem in managing complex develop-
ment programs. Rickover stated that due to the short duration in
the job, program managers ‘‘have only the shallowest knowledge of
the theory of the techniques they must deal with and little experi-
ence with the practical problems involved. And they are never kept
long enough on the job to acquire such skill and knowledge. Before
the results are in, the manager will have moved and a new man-
ager, equally unqualified technically, will take his place.’’ Rickover
continued, ‘‘naturally the new manager will feel no responsibility
for prior decisions and actions; his primary ambition will be to keep
the project moving in the hope that it will not fail during his own
tour. Thus, responsibility cannot be fixed and there is bound to be
little continuity in technical direction for most of the defense devel-
opments underway today.’’
Rickover’s assessment is as true today as it was 50 years ago.
The Committee notes that statutes have been in place for years re-

quiring tenure of program managers, but sadly the Department
routinely ignores the statute, favoring instead to rotate officers fre-
quently in order to better position them for promotion. The Com-
mittee feels strongly that promotions should be based on merit and
accomplishment, not based on getting the plum assignments to
‘‘punch the right tickets.’’ The Committee strongly encourages the
Department to take Rickover’s assessment to heart and require
program managers to stay in their position until the job is done.
The issue of program manager technical competency is more crit-
ical than ever as defense systems and weapons platforms are more
technologically complex than ever, such as with space systems.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
pose to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees,
not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, a plan for
a pilot program in the Space Force to organize its programs and
people by mission area. The Committee encourages the Department
to require those assigned to each mission area to serve for substan-
tially longer tours of service so that they may develop and build the
technical skills commensurate with the challenges they face. While
the Committee is aware of the Space Force’s Integrated Mission
Delta (IMD) concept, it does not go far enough in eliminating the
seam between the operations community and the acquisition com-
munity. The intent of the pilot program is to implement mission
area program offices with responsibility, authority and account-
ability for the entire life-cycle of a mission, from system concept,
through acquisition, development, fielding, and operational life.
Furthermore, the Space Force pilot program should examine com-
bining the enlisted and officer ranks into a single system with
fewer ranks, elimination of the current occupational specialty cat-
egories, such as acquirers or operations, in favor of specializations
focused on mission areas, such as missile warning or satellite com-
munications, with assignments focused on developing deep exper-
tise in all aspects of a mission area. The objective is to build tech-
nical competency and depth in mission areas that will be better po-
sitioned to make wise decisions in managing and delivering the ca-
pabilities the warfighter needs.
SPACE FORCE MISSION AREA BUDGET REPORT
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to continue
to submit a report for Space Force programs that organizes and
aligns all budget lines for programs, projects, and activities into
mission areas, such as missile warning, satellite communications,
and position, navigation, and timing. The report shall also include
separate mission areas for enterprise management, enterprise in-
formation technology, and facilities and logistics. Each mission area
shall include a clear statement of the mission goals and plans, a
detailed and compelling justification for the requested budget,
number of military and civilian personnel required to carry out
each mission area, and an alignment of all the relevant individual
budget line items without further consolidation from the traditional
budget exhibits and activity groups of the various types of appro-
priations. The Committee notes that the Space Force has in the
past funded a significant portion of its overhead expenses through
taxes on programs in the procurement and the research, develop-
ment, test and evaluation accounts. This practice distorts the budg-

ets for the programs in these accounts and obscures the true over-
head cost of the Space Force. Therefore, the report shall clearly ac-
count for Space Force overhead costs in the appropriate mission
areas without taxes being levied on programs. The Secretary of the
Air Force is directed to submit a fully completed report with the
submission of the fiscal year 2027 President’s budget request.
DEFENSE INNOVATION UNIT AND DEFENSE INNOVATION COMMUNITY
OF ENTITIES
The Committee views innovation as foundational to high per-
forming teams and high performing teams are the fabric of high
performing organizations. The Committee is encouraged the De-
partment has recognized the value of the Defense Innovation Unit
(DIU) as a contributor to acquisition improvements within existing
authorities. Specifically, the Committee notes the Department’s
early emphasis to scale adoption of Software Acquisition Pathway
wherein the Secretary of Defense directed collaboration between
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
and DIU to develop an implementation plan utilizing Commercial
Solutions Openings (CSO) as the default solicitation approach for
software acquisitions. The Committee applauds the Department for
increasing opportunities for commercial solutions. The Department
cannot afford to make decisions that result in vendor-lock on capa-
bilities and enabling activities in any domain, hardware or soft-
ware. The Committee looks forward to understanding more about
the implementation plan to scale adoption of the Software Acquisi-
tion Pathway approach.
The Committee believes the Department continues to make sig-
nificant progress in facilitating collaborative innovation environ-
ments and recognizes a review of organizations in the innovation
ecosystem is underway. The Committee anticipates the review to
be thorough and thoughtful, and that the DIU, as an organization
and leader of the Defense Innovation Community of Entities
(DICE), retains uninhibited access to Department leadership. As
evidenced by the Committee’s recommendations for fiscal year
2026, the Committee continues to support Accelerate the Procure-
ment and Fielding of Innovative Technologies (APFIT), DIU, Office
of Strategic Capital (OSC), and many efforts led by DICE organiza-
tions. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Department to
implement recommendations outlined in the Government Account-
ability Office report GAO–25–106856 fortwith. Implementation of
the recommendations would facilitate enhanced DICE synergy, pro-
vide strategic focus to investments in innovation, and promote best
practices in leveraging commercial technology.
INDUSTRIAL BASE POLICY
The Committee is pleased that the Office of Industrial Base Pol-
icy published a National Defense Industrial Strategy and Imple-
mentation Plan that can begin to address long-standing crevasses
in the defense industrial base. The Committee believes the Depart-
ment has not properly resourced the defense industrial base and
arguably, until relatively recently, was laissez-faire in thoroughly
understanding relationships, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities in the
supply chain that if understood, and valued, would have resulted
in prioritized budgeting and greater resources. The Department

14
can no longer afford to avoid issues and must act with urgency to
shore up critical gaps in the industrial base.
The Committee is cautiously optimistic that the Department is
motivated to address the range of issues spanning from dependence
on foreign sources of critical minerals to single points of failure
within a supply chain. The Committee urges utilization of commer-
cially available data and analytic tools as well as federally funded
research and development centers to intensely analyze, illuminate,
and subsequently resource a combination of traditional and emerg-
ing technologies to dramatically reduce supply chain
vulnerabilities, radically strengthen domestic manufacturing, and
significantly elevate advanced and emerging manufacturing tech-
nologies.
Furthermore, the Committee applauds the Department’s actions
to prioritize and tackle programs experiencing systemic perform-
ance difficulty in delivering capabilities on time and on budget. The
Committee is interested in understanding the Department’s anal-
yses of what is fully uncovered by detailed program reviews cur-
rently underway. Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to,
not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, submit a
report to the congressional defense committees, on the drivers of
schedule delays, cost overruns, and performance difficulty on meet-
ing technical requirements for all programs identified as requiring
Department leadership to formulate a ‘‘turn-around’’ strategy. This
report shall minimally include trends, if any, relating to defense in-
dustrial base weaknesses, supply chain vulnerabilities, and work-
force constraints. Furthermore, the report shall attempt to cal-
culate cost estimates relating to schedule delays, specifically.
U.S. TRANSFORMATION AND TRAINING COMMAND
The Committee is aware of the Army’s decision to consolidate
Training and Doctrine Command and Army Futures Command into
a single Transformation and Training Command, and looks forward
to a detailed plan on the consolidation of force generation, force de-
sign, and force development under one headquarters.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later than
July 25, 2025, on the Army’s plan to merge the two major com-
mands. The briefing shall include: (1) the roles, responsibilities,
and authorities to be assigned to the Commander of the Trans-
formation and Training Command; (2) a description of the relation-
ship between such authorities and the authorities of the estab-
lished Army acquisition enterprise; (3) resources to be realigned
from the Army Training and Doctrine Command and Army Futures
Command, to include any costs associated with the consolidation;
and (4) a description of proposed force structure changes.
CONTRACTING STRATEGIES AND GUIDANCE RELATING TO
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Committee recognizes the Department recently published
contracting strategies and guidance relating to Intellectual Prop-
erty (IP). The Committee values an approach focused on tailored IP
rights and balancing the interests of industry and the Department.
The Committee is optimistic that the Department and industry,
alike, recognize the complementary nature of IP rights and Mod-

ular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and agree increased lethality
and value to the taxpayer are the outcomes of harmonizing IP
rights and MOSA. The Committee looks forward to collaborating
with the Department to ensure resources are available to support
the Federated IP Cadre and acquisition professionals to scale pro-
ficiency in negotiating data rights to ensure taxpayer dollars are
spent wisely.
OPERATIONAL ENERGY
The Committee expects the Department to recognize the value in
uninterrupted access to energy to improve lethality as well as op-
portunities to reduce operating costs. There is direct correlation be-
tween resilient, enduring energy access and decisive advantage.
The Committee notes, consistent with other industrial base policy
concerns that have received anemic resourcing year-after-year,
operational energy efforts are often not prioritized. Therefore, the
Secretary of Defense is directed to submit biannual reports on ad-
vancements in operational energy efforts to the House and Senate
Defense Appropriations Committees, beginning not later than 60
days after enactment of this Act. The reports shall include a de-
tailed breakout of all investments underway throughout the De-
partment that contribute to the current Department of Defense
Operational Energy Strategy as well as new focus areas that may
have emerged since the strategy was published in 2023.
BUDGET OR APPROPRIATIONS LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
Title II of this Act includes a provision that prohibits the use of
funds in this Act to plan or implement the elimination or consolida-
tion of a budget or appropriations liaison office of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military de-
partment, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed Forces
into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison office. The House Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Defense relies heavily on these of-
fices to conduct its oversight responsibilities and make funding rec-
ommendations for the Department of Defense. The Committee
notes that while the separate offices of legislative affairs within the
Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments
offer assistance to the authorizing committees and individual mem-
bers of Congress, such assistance is provided on a parallel and sep-
arate track from the assistance provided to this Committee and its
Members by the budget or appropriations liaison office of the Office
of the Secretary of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military
department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed
Forces. As the offices of legislative affairs do not possess the exper-
tise and direct relationship to the Financial Management and
Comptroller organizations, which are essential to the effective com-
munication between the Department and the Committees on Ap-
propriations, it is critical that the budget or appropriations liaison
offices remain independent from the legislative liaison offices, have
organizational parity, and retain the authority to respond directly
and promptly with the information required by the Committee and
its Members.
Furthermore, with a reduction in personnel across the Depart-
ment and an apparent increase in congressional advisors who at-

tempt to supplant the budget or appropriations liaison offices, the
Committee is concerned that the ability of budget and appropria-
tions liaison offices to exercise their responsibility towards the
Committee is negatively impacted. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries to pro-
vide appropriations liaison offices with organizational parity and
proper resourcing, ensure that these offices have tasking authority,
and serve as the primary advisors to senior leaders in the Depart-
ment of Defense on appropriations and budget related matters.
INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
The Committee recognizes the importance of international initia-
tives and the trilateral AUKUS security partnership in particular.
The AUKUS security partnership helps create a more lethal force
that further integrates the United States, United Kingdom, and
Australian forces, as well as lifts the domestic defense industrial
base under the regulatory framework authorized under the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024 (Public Law
118–31). Given the strategic nature of international initiatives,
AUKUS in particular, the Committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense to provide the congressional defense committees a report, not
later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act and quarterly
updates thereafter, on the progress of Pillar 2 technology efforts re-
lating undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, artificial intel-
ligence and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-
hypersonic capabilities, electronic warfare, innovation and any fu-
ture efforts/initiatives being considered. The report will include
budget profiles and schedules, a full list of industry performers con-
tributing to ongoing efforts, and challenges that are slowing col-
laboration and progression to deliver capabilities.
COUNTER-UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS
The Committee remains concerned about the escalating threat
posed by unmanned aerial systems (UAS), including the potential
for loitering munitions and other advanced drone technologies to
undermine U.S. defense capabilities and jeopardize national secu-
rity. The Committee supports the Department’s efforts to advance
Counter-UAS (C–UAS) capabilities. Accordingly, the Secretary of
Defense is directed to, not later than 90 days after the enactment
of this Act, submit a report to the congressional defense committees
on research, development, test, and evaluation of C–UAS tech-
nologies throughout the Department. The report shall outline the
Department’s current and planned C–UAS initiatives, including an
assessment of existing systems’ effectiveness against emerging
threats, coordination with interagency partners, allies, academia,
and industry to advance C–UAS efforts, and illuminate challenges
integrating C–UAS solutions into air defense systems in complex
environments, such as urban or highly rural areas. Additionally,
the report shall include funding provided to date, broken out by
Service, component, or agency, as well as a full list of industry per-
formers contributing to ongoing efforts.

DOD REPORT ON SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION
The Committee supports the Department of Defense Integrated
Primary Prevention (IPP) workforce, Sexual Assault Prevention
and Response (SAPR), and related support staff who are tasked
with reducing harmful behaviors, preventing sexual assault and
harassment, and providing specialized response services. The Com-
mittee seeks to understand if recent workforce actions have had
any impact on command climates and prevention and response to
combat sexual assault and harassment. As such, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary of Defense to submit a report within 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act to the House and Senate Ap-
propriations Committees that includes: the total number of billets
designated to IPP, SAPR, and related roles at the start of the cal-
endar year 2025; the number of vacant positions that have been
open over one year; details on any exemptions designated to hiring
IPP, SAPR, and related roles; and the number of staff who have
opted to accept the deferred resignation program, disaggregated by
month of acceptance.
CIVIL RESERVE MANUFACTURING NETWORK
The Committee is deeply concerned about the national security
implications of China’s global manufacturing dominance. The abil-
ity of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to scale and field sys-
tems quickly has highlighted the calcification of the United States
defense acquisition system which struggles to deliver systems on
time and on budget. Action is needed to immediately accelerate the
Department’s adoption of commercially available artificial intel-
ligence (AI)-driven additive manufacturing factories to preserve
America’s military advantage. The Department has an exceptional
opportunity to scale advanced manufacturing technologies in a way
that bolsters the defense industrial base and the broader American
industrial base. A network of dual-use factories would have the
ability, with the same tooling on the same day, to adaptively use
metallic additive manufacturing for structural components required
in ships, submarines, munitions, ground vehicles, aircraft, or space-
craft. By qualifying such factories, the Department would establish
a model for a broader Civil Reserve Manufacturing Network
(CRMN) that could have qualified capacity to rapidly scale weapons
during wartime, while reducing taxpayer burden by manufacturing
commercial goods during peacetime, with no capital expenditure
when transitioning between products. The taxpayer expects the De-
partment to maximize every dollar. To emphasize the need for a
CRMN, the Committee recommends more than $131,700,700 in
Army, Air Force, and Defense-Wide Research, Development, Test
and Evaluation accounts to initiate the establishment of a CRMN.
Furthermore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a report and brief to the congressional defense committees,
not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, outlining
a plan to qualify the first factory in Fiscal Year 2026. This briefing
and report will also include a path for transitioning existing pro-
duction approaches to these advanced manufacturing techniques
that are capable of scaling through direct government purchase of
system hardware structures as ‘‘Government Furnished Equip-
ment’’ for integrators, with improved government data rights that

enable agile broadening of the supply chain for subcomponents to
improve supply chain resiliency. This plan should include ap-
proaches to government efficiency like stimulating the use of ad-
vanced manufacturing through application of Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 48, Value Engineering, to reduce cost without sac-
rificing performance, reliability, qualify, or safety. The plan should
also identify statutory constraints and recommendations to stream-
line the establishment of the CRMN.

MILITARY PERSONNEL OVERVIEW
The Committee recommendation provides $176,171,154,000 for
the military personnel accounts, which fund military pay and al-
lowances, recruitment and retention initiatives, and overall quality
of life programs for active duty, National Guard, and reserve per-
sonnel. The recommendation provides an increase in basic pay for
all military personnel by 3.8 percent, effective January 1, 2026.
The Committee continues to encourage constructive evaluations of
recruitment and retention programs, bonus and special pay incen-
tives, and personnel benefit programs for fiscal year 2026. The
Committee remains supportive of programs intended to enhance
the morale and quality of life of military personnel and their fami-
lies.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for Re-
programming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2026 ap-
propriations accounts not later than 60 days after the enactment
of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from executing
any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other than
originally appropriated until the aforementioned report is sub-
mitted to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Sub-
committees.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal prior ap-
proval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in the Services’
military personnel accounts between budget activities in excess of
$15,000,000.
MILITARY PERSONNEL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been provided or have
been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in
paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report
are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base
for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be
carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically
addressed in the Committee report. Below threshold
reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or reduce fund-
ing from congressional special interest items as identified on the
DD Form 1414.
PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION
The Committee commends the Secretary of Defense for directing
the formation of a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Task Force
to ‘‘ensure that the Department of Defense provides the highest
quality moving services for our warriors, civilian employees, and
their families.’’ The Committee is concerned that the PCS process
is inefficient, too costly, and severely impacts morale, quality of
life, and readiness of service members and their families.
Relatedly, the Department continues to struggle to keep many of
its critical acquisition programs on schedule and at cost. In recent
hearings, the Committee has noted that this is not a new issue and
pointed to the nearly 50-year-old testimony of Admiral Hyman
Rickover before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on De-

fense concerning the pitfalls of an acquisition system that replaces
program managers every two or three years.
Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes a reduction
of $662,872,000 for rotational travel across the active-duty compo-
nents. The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide
a briefing within 90 days after the enactment of this Act to the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the findings of
the PCS Task Force with emphasis on quality of life improvements
and stability across the Department’s acquisition programs.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a
baseline report that shows the Special Operations Command’s oper-
ation and maintenance funding by subactivity group for the fiscal
year 2026 appropriation not later than 60 days after the enactment
of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is further directed to submit
quarterly execution reports to the congressional defense committees
not later than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter that ad-
dresses the rationale for the realignment of any funds within and
between budget subactivities and the movement of any base funds
used to support overseas contingency operations. Finally, the Sec-
retary of Defense is directed to notify the congressional defense
committees 30 days prior to the realignment of funds in excess of
$15,000,000 between subactivity groups.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been provided or have
been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in
paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report
are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base
for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be
carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically
addressed in this report. Below threshold reprogrammings may not
be used to either restore or reduce funding from congressional spe-
cial interest items as identified on the DD Form 1414.
QUARTERLY OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE UPDATES
Regular interaction with each of the Services’ financial manage-
ment offices enhances the ability of the Committee to perform its
essential oversight responsibilities. The Committee notes the suc-
cessful quarterly meetings this year with each of the Services and
directs the Director of each of the Service’s Operations Divisions
(Financial Management and Budget) to continue to provide quar-
terly briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
on their respective operation and maintenance execution rates in
fiscal year 2026.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET EXECUTION DATA
The Secretary of Defense and Service Secretaries are directed to
provide the congressional defense committees with quarterly budg-
et execution data. Such data should be provided not later than 45
days after the close of each quarter of the fiscal year and should
be provided for each O-1 budget activity, activity group, and sub-
activity group for each of the active, defense-wide, reserve, and Na-
tional Guard components. For each O-1 budget activity, activity
group, and subactivity group, these reports should include the
budget request and actual obligations amount, the distribution of
unallocated congressional adjustments to the budget request, all
adjustments made by the Department in establishing the Base for
Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) report, all adjustments resulting
from below threshold reprogrammings, and all adjustments result-
ing from prior approval reprogramming requests.
SOLAR MODULES AND INVERTERS
The Committee is concerned that solar modules and inverters
manufactured by Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC), as defined
by section 9901(6) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, could undermine
United States national security. Therefore, the Committee urges
the Secretary of Defense not to award federal financial assistance
or contracts for the purchase of solar modules or inverters manu-
factured by FEOCs. The Committee also urges the Secretary of De-
fense not to procure electricity from a solar energy system con-
taining solar modules or inverters manufactured by an FEOC.
VIEQUES AND CULEBRA
The Committee remains concerned by the pace and scope of envi-
ronmental restoration on the island municipalities of Vieques and
Culebra in Puerto Rico. The Committee directs the Secretaries of
the Army and Navy, in collaboration with the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the
Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, and other local stake-
holders, to submit a report to the congressional defense committees
no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. The report
shall provide a detailed status update on current cleanup activities,
a plan for addressing remaining contamination and unexploded or-
dinance hazards, a projected time horizon for completion of the
cleanup; and a funding plan outlining annual requirements and
planned contracting actions to achieve a thorough decontamination
result on both islands.
PUEBLO OF ISLETA UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE REMEDIATION
The Committee remains concerned with the pace and scope of
munitions and unexploded ordnance (UXO) removal on Pueblo of
Isleta. The Committee encourages the Assistant Secretaries of the
Air Force and the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment
to work closely with the National Nuclear Security Administration,
Department of Energy, and the officials from Pueblo of Isleta to
continue tribal consultation, participation, and transparency in the
survey and removal of munitions and UXO to achieve a thorough

and expedited removal process. This should include any informa-
tional gaps on types and amounts of debris and/or ordnance that
might threaten public health.
The Committee directs the Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force
and Army for Installations, Energy and Environment to submit a
report to the congressional defense committees not later than 90
days after the enactment of this Act detailing all respective muni-
tions, UXO removal, decontamination authorities, and plans appli-
cable to Pueblo of Isleta.
To fully address the issue, the Committee encourages each of the
Assistant Secretaries for Installations, Energy and Environment to
work collaboratively with other agencies who have conducted weap-
ons-related activity on and around native lands to ensure all muni-
tions, UXOs, and hazardous materials are surveyed. Where weap-
ons-related activity between the Services and other agencies over-
lap, both now and in the past, the Committee directs the Assistant
Secretaries for Installations, Energy and Environmental to provide
a report 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act to the con-
gressional defense committees providing the site, the amount and
type of munitions/remnants found that are under the jurisdiction
of that specific Service, and the cost and plan to remove it.
AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND CV–22 OSPREY MISHAPS
Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the Commander, Special Operations Command shall submit to
the House of Representatives and Senate Appropriations Sub-
committees on Defense a report, with a follow-on briefing, that in-
cludes the results of accident investigations pertaining to any crash
of the CV–22 Osprey since the introduction of the aircraft or other
mishap findings involving the failure of the single high-speed plan-
etary pinion gear.
FOOD INSECURITY
The Committee recognizes the steps the Department of Defense
has taken to address food insecurity, including those outlined in
the ‘‘Strengthening Food Security in the Force: Building on Our
Progress’’ report delivered, in December 2023. The Committee ac-
knowledges the findings of registered dieticians embedded within
the 62nd Medical Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, who cre-
ated a food pantry to address food insecurity affecting the health
and readiness of Service members and families and encourages the
Department to support other units who are seeking to emulate the
food pantry initiative. The Committee further encourages the De-
partment to educate units on the benefits of creating a food pantry
to address food insecurity.
MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT
The Committee recognizes the need for comprehensive data
measuring employment among military spouses over time. The
Committee encourages the Department of Defense to engage with
the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collaborate in assessing the po-
tential for measuring labor market outcomes and characteristics of

military spouses with existing survey data and explore options for
modifying such surveys to capture this population.
MILITARY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE ORGANIZATIONS
The Committee encourages the Service Secretaries to fully fund
each military criminal investigative organization (MCIO) commen-
surate with their increased caseloads. The Committee directs the
Service Secretaries to provide a briefing within 120 days after the
enactment of this Act to the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees on the ongoing efforts to improve the MCIOs, including
the need for updated case management systems, improved cold
case units, and staffing of hard to fill posts.
MEDIA COMPANIES
The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the
United States, the federal government should work to ensure fair
access to its advertising contracts for small, disadvantaged busi-
nesses and businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, minori-
ties, and women. The Committee directs each agency under juris-
diction of this Act to include the following information in its fiscal
year 2027 budget justification: expenditures for fiscal year 2026
and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2027 for all contracts for
advertising services; contracts for the advertising services of so-
cially and economically disadvantaged small businesses concerns
(as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.
637 (a)(4)); and contracts for the advertising services of service-dis-
abled veteran-, women-, and minority-owned businesses.
QUANTUM WORKFORCE STUDY
The Committee recognizes the importance of developing a strong
quantum workforce and encourages the Department of Defense to
work with the National Science Foundation in developing a pipe-
line of quantum talent to address our national security needs. The
Committee expects the Department of Defense, through the Office
of the Under Secretary of Research and Engineering, to develop a
workforce that covers each area of the Science, Technology, Engi-
neering and Mathematics (STEM) fields to employ physicists, com-
puter science engineers, chemists, and mathematicians. To ensure
this workforce is developed, the Committee directs the Secretary of
Defense to provide a report to the congressional defense committees
that provides the numbers of STEM personnel on staff across the
Department for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 and the numbers budg-
eted for in fiscal year 2026 within 45 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act.
COORDINATION WITH TRIBAL NATIONS
The Committee is pleased that the Department of Defense has
entered into partnerships with Tribal Nations to coordinate proving
grounds and testing ranges for active duty and National Guard
troops in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Plains States. The
Committee encourages the Department to consider additional part-
nership agreements and expand coordination where practicable.

U.S. OVERSEAS INSTALLATION COMMISSARIES
The Committee is concerned by the limits foreign countries place
on U.S. products in commissaries located on U.S. overseas installa-
tions. In particular, the Committee notes that undue restrictions
have been placed prohibiting the transit of poultry to commissaries
on U.S. overseas installations based on outbreaks of avian influ-
enza in the United States. These restrictions are even stricter than
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) restrictions within the
United States. The Committee believes that products that meet
U.S. regulatory standards that have been deemed safe for com-
merce by USDA and identified for military use should be consid-
ered for exemptions. The Committee encourages the Secretary of
Defense, in concurrence with the Secretary of State, to work with
the Secretary of Agriculture to negotiate with foreign governments
that host U.S. overseas installations to allow exemptions to transit
products to the commissaries in such foreign countries.

eration and Maintenance, Army:

NAVAL AIR STATION OCEANA
The Committee remains concerned about the facility conditions of
Naval Air Station Oceana, the Navy’s primary location for force de-
velopment and force generation of strike fighter capability for east
coast-based carrier air wings and strike groups. While the Com-
mittee appreciates the Navy’s increased emphasis on investment in
infrastructure, particularly for enablers of fleet readiness, there re-
mains a lack of focus on sustaining long-term investments to im-
prove readiness. Further, continued reliance on traditional ap-
proaches and solutions will not solely contribute to increased facil-
ity conditions and improved readiness. Given the magnitude of cost
and scope of outstanding repairs as well as the cost and schedule
of new military construction, the Committee encourages the Navy
to determine the suitability of tension fabric structures, particu-
larly for large facilities such as hangars.
KENNEBEC RIVER FEDERAL NAVIGATION CHANNEL
The Committee supports the Memorandum of Agreement signed
in January 2020 denoting the responsibilities of the Department of
the Army and the Department of the Navy for the regular mainte-
nance of the Kennebec River Federal Navigation Channel. The
Committee is concerned that the channel is not currently being
maintained to the required depth on an annual basis, affecting the
movement of Navy surface combatants, and encourages the Sec-
retary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy to respond with
the appropriate resources and planning to ensure that the channel
is passable annually, per the Memorandum of Agreement, to en-
sure the navigability of the Kennebec River for the test, trial and
delivery of newly constructed Navy surface combatants to the At-
lantic Ocean. The Committee directs the Secretaries of the Army
and Navy to provide a briefing to the congressional defense com-
mittees on progress to achieve the goals outlined in the Memo-
randum within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
MARINE INVASIVE SPECIES AT JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR HICKAM
Marine invasive species pose a potential threat to the unique ma-
rine ecosystems and operational readiness at Joint Base Pearl Har-
bor-Hickam. These non-native organisms can damage naval infra-
structure by clogging cooling systems, damaging hulls, and increas-
ing maintenance costs. Removal and control of invasive species en-
sures mission readiness and preserves the base’s strategic capabili-
ties.
The Secretary of the Navy is encouraged to support a program
to control and eradicate invasive coral at domestic naval installa-
tions. These efforts should consider carrying out invasive coral con-
trol and eradication programs, supporting interagency and inter-
governmental responses, and carrying out an education program to
help prevent the introduction of new invasive marine species into
the waters of military installations.
TREATMENT OF LIVESTOCK GRAZING PERMITS
The Committee is increasingly concerned about the Navy’s treat-
ment and proposed compensation for livestock grazing permitees

impacted by the expansion of the Fallon Range Training Complex.
The Committee reminds the Navy that Section 2993 of Public Law
117–263 was intended to compensate impacted grazing permittees
for the generational loss of their operations at full market rates.
The Committee further reminds the Navy that Section 2993 of Pub-
lic Law 117–263 did not provide any discretion for the Navy to use
depreciated loss calculations when determining how to make full
and complete payments to impacted parties for all losses suffered.
Consistent with the law, in the event that replacement forage can-
not be identified, the Committee expects the Navy to make pay-
ments to impacted parties to cover all losses suffered by the loss
of their ranching at full market values for their cattle over a 100-
year time period.

DEFENSE SECURITY COOPERATION AGENCY PROGRAMS
The Secretary of Defense shall, not later than 30 days after the
enactment of this Act, submit to the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees a detailed spend plan for amounts made avail-
able for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The plan shall
include amounts for each program listed in the budget justification
documents and, for International Security Cooperation Programs,
amounts provided in the prior two fiscal years and planned for fis-
cal year 2026 by combatant command, country, and authority. The
plan shall only reflect the amounts requested in the fiscal year
2026 budget justification materials as modified by fiscal year 2025
appropriations. A similar document with requested amounts shall
be provided to such Committees concurrent with the submission of
the fiscal year 2027 President’s budget request.
Of the amount provided for Defense Security Cooperation Agen-
cy, the recommendation includes $1,274,174,000 for International
Security Cooperation Programs. The Committee directs that con-
gressional notifications for these funds specify the fiscal year,
whether funds support ongoing or new programs, and the duration
and expected cost over the life of each program.
The recommendation also includes $500,000,000 for the Taiwan
Security Cooperation Initiative, which is $100,000,000 above the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level. Such funds are provided to increase
Taiwan’s defense, readiness, and deterrence capabilities. The Com-
mittee expects these programs to be integrated with other security
assistance programs in a manner that complements, rather than
duplicates, efforts and directs the Secretary of Defense to submit
a spend plan to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act.
The Committee also includes a provision that transfers Mexico
from the United States Northern Command area of responsibility
to the United States Southern Command area of responsibility.
This transfer is necessary to enable better coordination and
prioritization between countries within the United States Southern
Command area of responsibility. United States Southern Command
is best positioned to address the shared security challenges be-
tween Mexico and its Central and South American neighbors, par-
ticularly on the issues of drug trafficking and illegal immigration.
NORTHERN TRIANGLE COUNTRIES
The Committee remains interested in evaluations of security co-
operation programs with Northern Triangle countries and requests
that the Secretary of Defense keep the Committee apprised of such
evaluations. The Committee is also concerned about end-use moni-
toring of assistance provided under this heading and directs the
Department of Defense to provide a briefing, not later than 60 days
after the enactment of this Act, on the status of implementation of
recommendations contained in the of Government Accountability
Office report ‘‘Northern Triangle: DoD and State need improved
policies to address equipment misuse’’ (GAO–23–105856). The Com-
mittee is also interested in Army Security Force Assistance Brigade
deployments. Therefore, any congressional notification made pursu-
ant to 10 U.S.C. 321 or 10 U.S.C. 333 should include a description

of the number of individuals deployed and their training; the
amount, type, and purpose of the training and equipment to be pro-
vided to the recipient country’s security forces; the timeline and
source of funds; and how the proposed program would promote the
overall security cooperation goals of the brigade or country.
TANZANIA
The Committee recognizes that Tanzania has remained a stable
partner in the region, despite ongoing instability in neighboring
countries. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that the Depart-
ment of Defense and United States Africa Command (AFRICOM)
have invested in the U.S.-Tanzania partnership through civil-mili-
tary engagements and joint exercises with the Tanzania Peoples
Defense Forces (TPDF), as well as having added Tanzania to the
State Partnership Program. The Committee encourages strength-
ening the U.S.-Tanzania military partnership by continuing their
participation in multinational exercises such as Justified Accord, as
well as military intelligence and senior staff planning conferences.
To better understand the role of Tanzania in the Department’s
plans for the region, the Committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense, with support from the Commander, AFRICOM, to submit a
report not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act to the
congressional defense committees. The report should assess the
strategic importance of partnering with Tanzania, detail additional
military cooperation that can be achieved between U.S. military
forces and the TPDF and evaluate the impact that training with
the TPDF has on American readiness and lethality. The report
should also provide policy and funding recommendations that Con-
gress can adopt to achieve U.S. national security goals and
AFRICOM campaign objectives in Tanzania.
NORTHEAST ASIA
The Department of Defense must provide clarity and a vision re-
garding the enduring mission, force posture, capability develop-
ment, and resourcing priorities for United States Forces Japan
(USFJ), United States Forces Korea (USFK) and United Nations
Command (UNC), consistent with the Interim National Defense
Strategy, integrated deterrence objectives, and evolving regional
threats. U.S. force posture and command and control decisions in
Japan and Korea must reflect both current operational require-
ments and future strategic demands and must be clearly articu-
lated to our allies and partners, as well as to Congress to ensure
alignment with legislative priorities and oversight responsibilities.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command, the
Commander of United States Forces Korea, and the Commander of
United Nations Command, and the Commander of United States
Forces Japan to submit to the congressional defense committees an
assessment that: (1) articulates the interoperability of USFJ,
USFK, and UNC within the context of the most recent Interim Na-
tional Defense Strategy and posture planning documents; (2) evalu-
ates posture, logistics, and command and control challenges that
may inhibit the responsiveness or effectiveness of USFJ, USFK and
UNC, including prepositioned stocks, limitations in strategic mobil-

ity, and operational access; (3) outlines a framework that drives the
capabilities required; and (4) assesses whether current and pro-
grammed force posture, command and control, capabilities, logis-
tics, and infrastructure in Japan and the Republic of Korea are suf-
ficient to support deterrence, warfighting, and integrated cam-
paigning requirements. This assessment shall account for all exist-
ing Host Nation Agreements and shall be delivered to the congres-
sional defense committees by April 1, 2026.
WORKFORCE WITH SECURITY CLEARANCES
The Committee is concerned that the rapid technological progress
in artificial intelligence and other fields has markedly increased
competition for professionals with advanced science, technology, en-
gineering, and math credentials. Current education-to-hire pipeline
programs have shown recruiting success, and the Committee recog-
nizes the progress the Department continues to make in the Trust-
ed Workforce 2.0 initiative. Additionally, the Committee commends
efforts by the Department to partner with academia in creating a
pipeline of students with security clearances, enabling immediate
employment upon graduation, and encourages the Department to
further expand these partnerships across Department of Defense
laboratories, ranges, and installations. The Committee directs the
Secretary of Defense to continue providing Trusted Workforce quar-
terly progress reports to the congressional defense committees.
COUNTER-ISIS TRAIN AND EQUIP FUND
The Committee recommends the following appropriations for the
Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund:
The Committee recommendation continues support for the Iraqi
Security Forces, Kurdish Peshmerga, and the Syrian Democratic
Forces to participate in activities to counter the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria. The Committee directs that congressional notifica-
tions for funds provided under this heading include a description
of the amount, type, and purpose of assistance to be funded, and
the recipient of the assistance; the budget and implementation
timeline, with anticipated delivery schedule for assistance; and a
description of any material misuse of assistance since the last noti-
fication was submitted, along with a description of any remedies
taken.
The Committee commends the Department on reducing the foot-
print of U.S. forces in Syria, enabling them to operate from a more
defensible posture. The Committee, however, is concerned about
the integration of Syrian Democratic Forces into the new Syrian
government’s security forces. The Committee also remains con-

cerned about progress under the Al Hol Action Plan. The Com-
mittee, therefore, directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. The

Forces into the new Syrian government security force and evaluate
progress made under the Al Hol Action Plan.

MATERNAL CARE RESPONSE DURING EMERGENCIES
The Committee recognizes the critical role that the National
Guard plays in support of local, state, and federal agencies in pre-
paring for and responding to public health emergencies and domes-
tic disasters. To better prepare National Guard members, the Com-
mittee encourages the Department of Defense within 120 days
after the enactment of this Act to convene a meeting of federal;
state, local, or territorial public health officials; Tribal public
health officials; and public stakeholders representing maternity
care providers, maternal health focused community based organiza-
tions, and patient voices to discuss measures to detect maternal
and child health needs and measures to facilitate access and deliv-
ery of maternal and child healthcare during public health emer-
gencies and domestic disasters. Additionally, the Department
should consider a process for the routine creation, dissemination,
and update of materials related to safe maternity care during pub-
lic health emergencies and domestic disasters.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the re-
programming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the
House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for
Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar
threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $15,000,000 for pro-
curement and research, development, test and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to
continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly,
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III
and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropria-
tions Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogramming actions are set at either
the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or
research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less.
These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined
value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research,
development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addi-
tion, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming
procedures for congressional special interest items are established
elsewhere in this report.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided
only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables.
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been recommended or
items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the
project level tables detailing recommended adjustments or in para-
graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report are
congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for
Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically ad-
dressed elsewhere in this report.

DIVERSIFYING ADVANCED COUNTER-UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM
INVENTORY
The Committee remains concerned about the evolving threat
from advanced, adversarial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and
the Army’s ability to rapidly incorporate novel solutions into their
formal acquistion framework. To support the development of an ac-
quisition framework of innovative counter-UAS (C–UAS) capabili-
ties, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide
a spend plan, not later than 90 days after the enactment of this
Act, to diversify and expand C–UAS systems. The spend plan shall
include detect and track systems, combat-validated C–UAS inter-
ceptors, and any other capabilities as determined by the Secretary.
ARMY INTEGRATED TACTICAL NETWORK AND CRYPTO MODERNIZATION
REQUIREMENTS
The Committee supports the Army’s investments in the
Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) programs, and
recognizes the importance of procuring systems that conform to se-
curity, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities
through the Risk Management Framework process. The Committee
encourages the Secretary of the Army to ensure such levels of secu-
rity are met in current and future tactical radio system procure-
ments.

NAVY ADVERSARY AIRCRAFT FOR TRAINING PURPOSES
The Committee notes the growing requirement for near-peer rep-
resentative air-to-air training using aggressor aircraft with capa-
bilities similar to that of advanced adversaries. The Committee re-
mains supportive of ongoing efforts to increase capabilities of air-
craft assigned to aggressor squadrons; however, the Committee re-
mains concerned about the overuse of some legacy aircraft to carry
out this mission in the long-term. To maintain strategic Navy Re-
serve air strike fighter and air aggressor capability, the Committee
encourages the Secretary of the Navy to transition deployable F/A–
18E/F aircraft considered for divestment, as available, from the Ac-
tive Component to Navy Reserve aviation squadrons.

SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION
The Committee believes full funding is critical for the stability of
the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB) and provides for increased ac-
countability to best ensure the delivery of on-time, on-budget sub-
marines to the fleet. In a time where the industrial base is already
challenged to meet the critical 2030 delivery schedule of the lead
Columbia-class submarine to fulfill the nation’s strategic nuclear
requirement, the Committee believes that incremental funding will
only create further risk to the program. Therefore, the Committee
recommendation includes full funding for one Columbia-class sub-
marine and two Virginia-class submarines.
The Committee notes the Navy’s 45-day Shipbuilding Review
found significant delays, cost overruns, and workforce recruitment
and retention challenges to several critical shipbuilding programs,
but notably reported 12–16 months delay in lead boat construction
of the Columbia-class submarine construction and 24–36 months
delay in Virginia-class construction. Delays in submarine construc-
tion present a significant risk to strategic deterrence, seriously
erode undersea superiority, and negatively impact operational
availability and long-term readiness.
The Committee recognizes that the health of the MIB is vital to
achieving the ‘‘1+2’’ production rate for the Columbia and Virginia-
class programs and meeting national security requirements. There-
fore, the Committee recommendation includes $1,532,000,000 for
the MIB to drive gains in critical areas including supplier capacity
and capability, strategic outsourcing, workforce training, and tech-
nology and infrastructure. This funding is in addition to the
$9,724,700,000 provided since 2018 to revitalize the maritime in-
dustrial base and restore domestic shipbuilding. The Committee
recognizes that the success of this effort requires more than just
funding and that an undertaking of this scale necessitates strategic
and timely investment and rigorous oversight. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
congressional defense committees, not later than 45 days after the
enactment of this Act and semi-annually thereafter, that details
the Navy’s oversight strategy for administering all phases of MIB
funding, including the identification of gaps, selection of projects,
oversight of funding execution, and determining the return on in-
vestment.
After significant subcommittee engagement in the form of official
briefings with the Navy and the prime nuclear shipyards, in De-
cember 2024, Congress provided $2,212,410,000 in supplemental
funding to address infrastructure and workforce limitations at the
private nuclear shipyards. The Committee believes these invest-
ments are necessary to achieving and sustaining the required sub-
marine cadence in the long-term and maintaining international
commitments under the trilateral Australia, United Kingdom,
United States (AUKUS) security partnership. To that end, the
Committee recommendation includes $1,641,160,000 for produc-
tivity enhancements and $521,00,000 for wage enhancements at
the private nuclear shipyards. The Committee directs the Secretary
of the Navy to submit a spend plan for wage and productivity en-
hancement funding provided in this and prior acts not later than

plans.

SPACE FORCE PROCUREMENT QUANTITIES
The Committee recommendation provides $1,356,700,000 to pro-
cure four space launch services under the National Security Space
Launch program line; $641,120,000 to procure seven space launch
services under the Space Development Agency Launch program
line; and $679,350,000 to procure two Global Positioning System III
Follow-On spacecraft. Quantities for other end items funded in the
Space Force procurement account for fiscal year 2026 are the quan-
tities as planned for fiscal year 2026 in the fiscal year 2025 future
years defense program.
NATIONAL SECURITY SPACE LAUNCH INFRASTRUCTURE
Access to space remains critical to national security. In 2024, the
United States conducted a record high of nearly 150 successful
space launches. The Space Force estimates that the tempo of
launches will increase by 25 percent or more over the next few
years. Further, the commercial industry is readying new and larger
heavy-lift launch vehicles to begin regular operations soon. The
limited capacity of the current space launch range infrastructure,
to include processing facilities, launch pads and related infrastruc-
ture, range instrumentation, communication capabilities, utilities,
and roads requires urgent investment and a long-term strategy to
efficiently and effectively meet the demand and maintain U.S. lead-
ership in space. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of
the Air Force to submit to the congressional defense committees,
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, with a long-term
strategy, including a plan of action and milestones, to make invest-
ments and modernize U.S. space launch ranges. In addition, the
strategy and plan shall specifically address Space Force’s projected
plans for commercial heavy-lift launch systems, to include what
sites it will make available for these vehicles, and how it intends
to ensure a competitive, transparent, and cost-effective process for
supporting commercial heavy-lift launch systems use of the ranges.
The strategy shall detail a five-year investment plan by fiscal year
to fully implement the strategy. The investment plan shall include
the use of any funds provided in the reconciliation process for space
launch infrastructure.

ADVANCED ANTICONVULSANT SYSTEM
The Committee applauds the Joint Program Executive Office for
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO–
CBRN) for successfully developing a Food and Drug Administration
approved next generation autoinjector to help forward deployed
personnel effectively respond to chemical weapons and nerve agent
exposure. Moreover, the Committee recognizes the successful tran-
sition from research, development, test and evaluation with JPEO–
CBRN to procurement through the Defense Logistics Agency. The
advanced anticonvulsant system will have wide-spread use by the
Services, both in training and as an essential piece of equipment
to be carried by forward deployed personnel. As the recently pub-
lished 2025 Annual Threat Assessment from the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence makes abundantly clear, the threat of chemical
weapons and nerve agents to our service members is all too real.
Accordingly, the Committee supports a funding level of $42,250,000
for the procurement of the advanced anticonvulsant system.
DEFENSE SUPPLY CHAIN PACKAGING
The Committee recognizes the critical importance of protective
packaging to ensure the safe transport and storage of military
equipment and goods. Packaging materials and solutions are spe-
cifically tailored based on detailed calculations for each require-
ment across the Department’s logistics supply chain. The Com-
mittee urges the Secretary of Defense to prioritize performance, ef-
ficiency, damage avoidance, domestic production, and cost-effective
preferences for protective packaging. Additionally, the Committee
urges the Secretary of Defense to avoid packaging preferences for
alternative or substitute packaging that could result in increased
damage, spoilage, or waste. The Committee directs the Secretary to
provide a combined list of packaging modernization focus areas for
fiscal year 2027 to the House and Senate Appropriations Commit-
tees along with the submission of the President’s budget for fiscal
year 2027.
INDO-PACIFIC AMMUNITION MANUFACTURING
The Committee is concerned with the lack of a forward staged
ammunition manufacturing facility in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore,
the Committee directs the Department of Defense to assess, in co-
ordination with the Department of State and the International De-
velopment Finance Corporation, the feasibility of establishing a
joint ammunition manufacturing and storage facility at United
States Naval Base Subic Bay. The facility would enable the for-
ward staging of ammunition stockpiles and related materials such
as nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and acid. The Committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to provide an update on the progress of
this feasibility study within 60 days of the enactment of this Act.

NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE EQUIPMENT ACCOUNT
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $800,000,000 for
the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account. Of that
amount, $250,000,000 is for the Army National Guard;
$235,000,000 is for the Air National Guard; $115,000,000 is for the
Army Reserve; $46,000,000 is for the Navy Reserve; $22,000,000 is
for the Marine Corps Reserve; and $132,000,000 is for the Air
Force Reserve to meet urgent equipment needs. This funding will
allow the National Guard and Reserve components to procure high
priority equipment used by these components for both their mili-
tary missions and missions in support of State governors. The
funding within this account is not to be used to procure equipment
designated as high-density critical equipment, major weapon sys-
tems, aircraft, and other equipment central to a unit’s ability to
perform its doctrinal mission. The funding within this account is
not to be used to procure equipment purchased by the senior Serv-
ice, to expand or accelerate current Service procurement plans, to
purchase expendable items, or to purchase facilities or equipment
for any requirement able to be satisfied elsewhere.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that
the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account is executed by
the Chiefs of the National Guard and Reserve components with pri-
ority consideration given to the following items: acoustic hailing de-
vices; aircraft survivability equipment and weapons training aids;
aviation status dashboards; cloud defense solutions; controlled hu-
midity preservation; crash-survivable UH–60 helicopter gunner
seats; degraded visual environment systems; emergency response
refuel equipment kits for C–130/135 aircraft; heavy dump trucks;
high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle modernization; im-
proved thermal acoustic blankets; internal auxiliary crashworthy,
ballistically tolerant auxiliary fuel systems for UH–60 helicopters;
KC–135 aircrew ground cooling units; land survey systems; light-
weight, rapidly deployable, computer-based artillery call for fire
training and simulation; litter stabilization systems; modular small
arms ranges and small arms training simulators and tools; NSA
compliant, multiple network configurable, secure tactical voice
bridge; secure enterprise, emergency, and social communication;
software defined radios; UH–72 Lakota mission equipment mod-
ernization; upgraded commercial off the shelf ground mapping for
C–130 aircraft; and vehicle-mounted, man-portable radiological nu-
clear detection systems.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS
The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the re-
programming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the
House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for
Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar
threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $15,000,000 for pro-
curement and research, development, test and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to
continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly,
spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-
wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III
and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropria-
tions Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogramming actions are set at either
the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or
research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less.
These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined
value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research,
development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified
threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval
reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addi-
tion, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming
procedures for congressional special interest items are established
elsewhere in this report.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided
only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST
ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been recommended or
items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the
project level tables detailing recommended adjustments or in para-
graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in this report are
congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for
Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically ad-
dressed elsewhere in this report.
LONG ENDURANCE AIRCRAFT
The Committee is aware of similar efforts by the Air Force and
U.S. Special Operations Command to develop a capability to meet
unmanned long range, long endurance intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance mission needs. While the requirements be-
tween the two organizations are not completely aligned, the Com-
mittee believes closer cooperation is critical to fielding a capable
and cost-effective platform. The Committee recommendation in-
cludes $15,000,000 in Air Force Research, Development, Test &
Evaluation to pursue this objective. Further, the Committee directs
the Secretary of the Air Force, in cooperation with the Commander,

JOINT READINESS TRAINING CENTER CATALYST PATHFINDER LAB
The Committee recognizes the strategic and training value that
the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Johnson provides the
Army in preparing soldiers for multi-domain operations and devel-
oping next-generation warfighting capabilities. To enhance its role,
the Committee encourages the Secretary of the Army to leverage
the JRTC as a Catalyst Pathfinder Lab in collaboration with re-
gional academic institutions.
In addition, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations
Committees, not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act,
on efforts to establish and expand partnerships between the Joint
Readiness Training Center and regional academic institutions. The
report shall identify potential collaborative research focus areas
aligned to capability-based requirements, and funding require-
ments associated with such efforts.
VAS AI/ML OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM
Modern combat requires visual superiority without cognitive bur-
den. Sophisticated Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS), designed
with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) optimization,
eliminate the need for on-the-fly manual adjustments, allowing op-
erators to stay mission-focused under demanding conditions. There-
fore, the Committee supports and encourages the Department of
the Army to review AI/ML augmented imaging and signal proc-
essing for visual augmentation systems.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION, NAVY
The Committee recommends the following appropriations for Re-
search, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy:

NAVAL TELEPHONY MODERNIZATION TO REDUCE MOUNTING
TECHNICAL DEBT
As the Navy evaluates options to modernize its legacy Time Divi-
sion Multiplexing (TDM)-based telephony infrastructure and mi-
grate to secure, scalable, and redundant IP-based technologies, the
Committee recognizes the critical importance of this initiative in
improving the Department of Defense’s (DoD) overall network per-
formance, security, resilience, redundancy, user experience, and
cost. The Committee encourages the Navy to promptly execute this
modernization initiative. The Committee views this as essential to
enhancing the security posture through modernization to DoD secu-
rity standards, maintaining operational readiness through im-
proved network resiliency and survivability, driving cost effi-
ciencies through infrastructure consolidation and transport unifica-
tion, and complying with DoD CIO modernization requirements in
the June 21, 2024 memorandum, ‘‘Technical Debt Reduction in the
DOD Information Network.’’
MAINTENANCE TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORTING OPERATIONAL READINESS
The Committee supports the development and application of crit-
ical maintenance technologies across the areas of shipboard repair,
material availability, and inspection. Through the application of
automated tooling, advanced manufacturing, augmented or virtual
reality and improved inspection technologies, it is imperative that
the Navy’s investments in maintenance technologies keep pace
with the developments made in commercial production lines and
repair facilities. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Sec-
retary of the Navy to ensure that sufficient investment is made to
advance remote support capabilities, streamline maintenance proc-
esses, and enhance operational readiness across the Navy.
RAPID ADVANCED DEPOSITION
The Committee strongly supports the development of the Rapid
Advanced Deposition research that will allow for the reliable and
consistent rapid production of additive manufactured produced
parts and materials developed in support of the warfighter.
COASTAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
The Committee understands the importance of the littoral region
to Navy operations worldwide and believes that testing and train-
ing must take place at secured research and development, and test
and evaluation facilities and replicate the operational and threat
environments that U.S. Navy assets are likely to encounter. Re-
search is needed to study seabed phenomenology and develop tech-
nologies for continuous monitoring and detection of encroachment
threats to reduce seabed vulnerabilities at or near U.S. Navy crit-
ical ocean test and evaluation facilities. The Committee believes
that additional research on the underwater signatures and ocean
hydrodynamics in the littoral regions and the development of pre-
dictive techniques to ensure stealth superiority would be beneficial
for naval operations. The Committee encourages the Navy to con-
duct additional research in this area.

AIR FORCE RESOURCE ALLOCATION
The Committee believes that historical Air Force resource alloca-
tion processes and practices have not been optimized for planning,
programming, and budgeting for requirements across capability
groups. The Committee also shares the Air Force’s assessment that
the status quo will not provide the airpower necessary for future
high-end conflicts.
The Committee recommendation includes substantial funding for
efforts that will continue to require considerable investment, in-
cluding the B–21 Raider, the Next Generation Air Dominance Fam-
ily of Systems, along with other air platforms. The Committee
notes that it is awaiting an updated timeline and details of a re-
phased funding profile for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent
following the programs’ Nunn-McCurdy breach. With these endeav-
ors, along with the development and implementation of the Air
Force’s force design, the Committee strongly believes a healthier
resource allocation process will hinge upon the Air Force’s ability
to more realistically identify and prioritize capabilities required for
successful Air Force and joint missions.
For this reason, the Committee is particularly interested in the
formation of the Integrated Capabilities Command, Integrated Ca-
pabilities Office, and the Integrated Development Office to meet
the desired end state of defining future Air Force needs, developing
modernization plans, ensuring technical feasibility, and executing
realistic acquisitions to meet the needs of the warfighter. To main-
tain oversight of these developing organizations, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, to the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees on the status of these organizations, to
include phasing of associated reorganization along with cost esti-
mates to implement each phase; a proposed laydown of new offices,
commands, or centers, and whether the strategic basing process is
required for their establishment; a description of impacts to mili-
tary and civilians positions by location; and the programmatic im-
pacts of such decisions. The Committee further directs the Director
of the Integrated Development Office and the Commander of the
Integrated Capabilities Command to jointly provide semi-annual
briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on
how each is working to achieve strategic modernization, recapital-
ization, and resourcing for the Air Force.
SENTINEL
The Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program was pro-
vided $3,197,024,000 in the enacted fiscal year 2025 bill. Section
1422 of the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions
Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4) directed the Department of Defense
to consult with the Committee in preparing a spending plan for im-
plementing the fiscal year 2025 enacted amounts. The spend plan
submitted by the Air Force reduced the GBSD budget by an addi-
tional $1,191,00,000, leaving the program $2,006,044,000 for fiscal
year 2025. An adjustment of this magnitude should have been ac-
companied by proactive communications including robust details on

a rephasing plan. The Committee notes that many of these details
remain outstanding.
The Committee recommends for GBSD in fiscal year 2026
$2,031,551,000 and understands additional funds may be available
through reconciliation. Given significant cost changes projected for
this effort, the Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide an
update as soon as possible on the current status of the replan, in-
cluding robust details and associated spending plans. Further, the
Committee directs that the Secretary of the Air Force continue pro-
viding quarterly briefings on the program to the congressional de-
fense committees. The briefings shall include obligation and ex-
penditure data, updated plans for the program, interim schedules,
and updated benchmarks, milestones, and defense industrial base
requirements to achieve a fully Integrated Master Schedule.
NEXT GENERATION AIR DOMINANCE
The Committee is pleased that in March 2025 the Air Force
down-selected and awarded a contract for the F–47, Next Genera-
tion Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes $3,194,315,000 in Research, Development,
Test and Evaluation, Air Force for this sixth-generation fighter
platform in fiscal year 2026.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide
the congressional defense committees quarterly briefings, beginning
the quarter following the enactment of this Act, on the status of
the NGAD program. These briefings shall provide programmatic
updates on schedule and funding.
COLLABORATIVE COMBAT AIRCRAFT
The Committee notes persistent concern that in prior years’
budget requests the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fund-
ing line included funding for the Collaborative Combat Aircraft
(CCA) program. The comingling of two significant acquisition pro-
grams limited Congress’ ability to track how funding was allocated
between NGAD and CCA efforts within the year-of-execution. In
order to ensure visibility into cost and performance, and to clearly
trace execution of appropriations, the project level adjustment ta-
bles that accompanied Division A, Title IV, for the Department of
Defense, Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act,
2025 (Public Law 119–4) moved the CCA budget program activity
into a separate and distinct line from NGAD. The Committee rec-
ommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes $494,896,000 for CCA
and understands that additional resources may be made available
through reconciliation.
The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide
the congressional defense committees quarterly briefings, beginning
the quarter following the enactment of this Act, on the status of
the CCA program. These briefings shall provide programmatic up-
dates on schedule and funding.
B–52 HIGH FIDELITY SIMULATOR MODERNIZATION

aware that the high cost of live flight training and associated main-
tenance and sustainment activities would be offset by capabilities
available by training in a high-fidelity simulator. The Committee
recommendation includes $26,200,000 for the Air Force to collect,
analyze and prepare flight simulation and modeling for the B–52H
flight data model. This funding also provides for associated engi-
neering of new high-fidelity devices and weapons training systems.
Further, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to
submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than 90 days following enactment of this Act, that provides a strat-
egy to develop, test, and procure modernized B–52H high fidelity
flight simulators. This report shall include, by fiscal year, a cost es-

SPACE FORCE ACQUISITION
Space capabilities are increasingly indispensable to national se-
curity. National leadership, combatant commands, and the intel-
ligence community rely on space to provide real-time global situa-
tional awareness. Space also provides the communications, naviga-
tion, and sensing capabilities that enable the United States to
project military power on a global scale and, if necessary, to prevail
in conflict. In fact, much of the force structure across the other
services are designed and sized to rely on space to communicate,
navigate and operate with precision, speed, and accuracy. Without
space capabilities, we would need many more bombs, bullets,
tanks, ships, and planes. Reliable and resilient space capabilities
are essential. However, unlike any other military service the vast
majority of the Space Force’s budget is dedicated to acquisition, a
trend that is expected to increase, especially to support Golden
Dome. Therefore, expertise in space technology and systems engi-
neering and what it enables for space operations are critical core
skills for Space Force Guardians and civilians. Senior leaders must
focus more attention on developing and promoting Guardians with
technical expertise and acquisition experience. To this end, the
Committee has directed the Secretary of Defense, as described in
the front matter of this report, to propose a plan for a pilot pro-
gram in the Space Force to organize its programs and people by
mission area and to require those assigned to each mission area to
serve for substantially longer tours of service in order to develop
and build the technical skills commensurate with the acquisition
and program management challenges they face. The objective is to
build technical competency through real-world experience and
greater depth and breadth of experience to better prepare program
managers and leaders to make wise decisions in managing and de-
livering the capabilities the warfighter needs.
FIXED PRICE CONTRACTING
The Committee notes that in recent years the Space Force has
been more willing to challenge old ways of doing business and has
been more open to taking technical and contracting risks to deliver
more innovative solutions from a broader range of suppliers. The
Committee supports this progress. However, the Committee is con-
cerned that too much emphasis has been put on the use of fixed
price contracts when a program is in the early phase of develop-
ment with significant unknowns and high technical risks. While
fixed price contracts are appealing from a budget perspective, they
are not a panacea and can lead to inappropriate incentives and
even suppress risk taking and innovation. To be clear, fixed price
contracts are an excellent approach when cost, technical risk and
other factors are well known, such as in production runs of the
same or very similar units. The Committee will be very skeptical
of contracting strategies that rely on fixed price contracts for first
articles of new systems or on high-risk developments. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Air Force through the Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration to
continue to provide monthly updates to the House and Senate De-

fense Appropriations Committees on the technical, cost, and sched-
ule status of ongoing acquisition programs.
RESILIENT POSITION NAVIGATION AND TIMING (PNT)
The Committee recognizes the vital importance of enhancing the
resilience of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services pro-
vided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) to ensure its avail-
ability for military operations, particularly in highly contested en-
vironments against sophisticated adversaries. The Committee also
recognizes that GPS has become a critical component of our na-
tion’s infrastructure affecting commerce, transportation, energy dis-
tribution, and agriculture. The loss of GPS, even temporarily,
would cause catastrophic damage to the nation while also severely
impacting military effectiveness. The Committee recommendation
provides $15,000,000 to continue the development of resilient GPS
space systems. However, the Committee is very disappointed that
the Department of Defense has not taken any significant actions to
address the findings and recommendations of the Defense Science
Board’s (DSB) May 2024 classified final report on Position, Naviga-
tion and Timing, which highlights many, but not all, the issues
that must be addressed to make PNT services more resilient, such
as accelerating the delivery of jam resistant user equipment and
increasing resilience of the ground control segment. Therefore, the
Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than 90 days after enactment
of this Act, with a comprehensive written plan of action and mile-
stones for investments in more resilient capabilities across space,
ground, and user equipment segments. This plan shall specifically
address each of the findings and recommendations of the DSB re-
port, as well as provide investments by Service and Agency and by
fiscal year.
STRATEGIC SATCOM ACQUISITION
The Space Force is responsible for delivering several systems
that are critical to the nation’s strategic deterrent and nuclear ca-
pability, including the Evolved Strategic Satellite Communications
(ESS) program. As the critical assured communications system for
senior leadership to carry out orders for nuclear command and con-
trol, the acquisition of the ESS is of utmost importance and must
be done with deep rigor and in close coordination across the other
elements of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications
(NC3) enterprise. The Committee is concerned that the Space Force
is considering using middle-tier acquisition authorities (MTA) rath-
er than implementing the program as a major defense acquisition
program for the development and acquisition of ESS. MTA authori-
ties are for rapid prototyping and rapid fielding of new types of ca-
pabilities and are not an appropriate pathway for a program of the
cost, complexity, and criticality to national security as the ESS sys-
tem. Therefore, the Committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in consultation with the Di-
rector, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, to review the
Space Force acquisition strategy for ESS and make a recommenda-
tion to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Sub-
committee, not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, on

an appropriate path forward that is most likely to lead to mission
success.
NEXT GENERATION OVERHEAD PERSISTENT INFRARED
The Committee continues to strongly support the pivot to pro-
liferated missile warning/missile tracking systems in low-Earth
orbit and medium-Earth orbit, as these systems will provide great-
er resilience and coverage for tactical use. However, these systems,
and their associated ground processing systems are not designed to
meet the strategic indications and warning requirements of the Nu-
clear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) enterprise.
Given the lack of a clear plan to meet strategic NC3 requirements
after the current legacy Space-Based Infrared systems age out, the
Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to re-examine
plans to curtail the current Next Generation Overhead Persistent
Infrared systems for geosynchronous and polar orbits and address
the need for additional spacecraft and updated ground systems to
meet validated national security needs. The Secretary of the Air
Force shall provide a report to the House and Senate Defense Ap-
propriations Committees with findings and recommendations on
the future of strategic systems to meet NC3 requirements not later
than 180 days after the enactment of this Act.
TACTICAL SURVEILLANCE, RECONNAISSANCE, AND TRACKING
The Committee recognizes the increasingly broad range of high-
quality commercial data available to support Space Force missions,
especially space domain awareness. The Committee notes that
Space Force has not requested funding for Tactical Surveillance,
Reconnaissance and Tracking (TacSRT) in previous budget re-
quests and is concerned that funding the project solely through
congressional increases does not enable the project to plan beyond
the year of execution. Therefore, the Committee directs the Direc-
tor of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) to review
the program, its mission use cases and objectives, and its con-
tracting mechanisms; identify and make recommendations for the
pilot project’s organization, its operations, and its use of contracts
with commercial vendors; and identify and make recommendations.
The Director of CAPE shall provide a briefing with the findings
and recommendations of this review to the congressional defense
and congressional intelligence committees not later than 180 days
after the enactment of this Act.
Further, the Committee notes the recently signed memorandum
of agreement between the Space Force and the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and directs the Space Force
to continue to coordinate and collaborate with the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) on the TacSRT pilot project.
The Director of NGA is directed to continue to provide a semi-
annual assessment of the TacSRT pilot program to the congres-
sional defense committees and congressional intelligence commit-
tees.

CYBERSECURITY OF WEAPONS PLATFORMS
The Committee is concerned about potential cyber vulnerabilities
of Department of Defense weapon system platforms, especially
fielded platforms with outdated and unmonitored electronic sys-
tems and data buses. The lack of real-world data to perform on-
board monitoring leaves gaps in understanding the full extent of
the threat environment. Therefore, the Committee recommendation
includes $10,000,000 in Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Defense-Wide for real-time monitoring of weapons systems cy-
bersecurity to implement on-board, near real-time, monitoring ca-
pabilities on high priority weapon system platforms.
ARMSTRONG TEST FACILITY
The Committee is closely monitoring the progress of the Depart-
ment’s programs regarding hypersonic weapons, satellites, space
vehicles, and other national security space developments. The Com-
mittee is aware of the assistance that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration’s (NASA) Neil Armstrong Test Facility (ATF)
has provided to the Department on research and development pro-
grams in these areas and encourages the Department to assist
NASA in providing the ATF with cyber security, physical security,
and other necessary upgrades that will allow the Department con-
tinued access to ATF’s world-class space, aeronautics, and
hypersonic assets.
ALL-DOMAIN ANOMALY RESOLUTION OFFICE
The Committee recognizes the importance of the All-domain
Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in providing the Congress and
the public with transparency and improved understanding of un-
identified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The Committee continues
to support AARO and its mission to improve national security and
public understanding of UAP data through a rigorous scientific
framework and data-driven approach.
FACILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS
The Committee recognizes the Department’s effort to identify
new mechanisms that reduce administrative burdens, increase
transparency, and save taxpayer dollars. We encourage the Depart-
ment to work closely with the extramural research community to
develop an optimized Facilities and Administrative (F&A) cost re-
imbursement solution for all parties that ensures the nation re-
mains a world leader in innovation.
INDOOR AIR QUALITY AT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FACILITIES
The Committee encourages the Department to conduct studies on
how indoor air quality impacts pathogen transmission and the
health of our military personnel. Such studies may include in-
creased use of outdoor air ventilation, high-efficiency particulate
air (HEPA) filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light.

TEST AND EVALUATION ACTIVITIES
The Committee notes the Director of Operational Test and Eval-
uation (DOTE) Strategy Implementation Plan consisted of five stra-
tegic pillars that sought to ‘‘collaboratively and cooperatively trans-
form the Department’s infrastructure, tools, processes, and work-
force.’’ Additionally, since the implementation plan was published,
a Task Force on Test and Evaluation supported approaches out-
lined in the strategy and implementation plan, including reimag-
ining a mission-focused approach to test and evaluation activities
(‘‘test the way we fight’’), leveraging commercial technologies and
best practices, as well as enhancing the use of digital engineering.
The Committee notes DOTE authored a manual on Modeling and
Simulation (M&S) Verification, Validation, and Accreditation
(VV&A), ensuring digital engineering tools effectively support the
evaluation process. The Committee commends DOTE for early rec-
ognition that a transformation in operational test activities would
be needed to meet the accelerating pace of technological adoption,
including the use of digital twins and cloud-at-the-edge computing.
Although digital engineering offers immense potential to early
and continuous test—retest activities, digital engineering will not
replace the need for live testing. Furthermore, it is widely under-
stood that there is increasing need for independent operational test
and evaluation activities required for cyber and electromagnetic
realms. The Committee is concerned that the Department is reor-
ganizing the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evalua-
tion, which includes significant reduction-in-force (RIF), at a time
when the test and evaluation community is transforming to sup-
port unprecedented production and fielding requirements.
Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to, not later than
30 days after the enactment of this Act, submit a detailed report
and provide a briefing, to the congressional defense committees, de-
tailing the impacts to operational test activities currently under-
way, the list of discontinued activities, and the list of activities that
will continue. Additionally, the report should include a detailed
plan for how the Department intends to meet the demand for inde-
pendent test and evaluation, and validating new capabilities ex-
pected to come online in the Future Years Defense Program.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM
The Act includes a general provision which caps the funds avail-
able for Private Sector Care under the TRICARE program subject
to prior approval reprogramming procedures. The general provision
and accompanying report language should not be interpreted as
limiting the amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-
House Care budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities
within the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the
In-House Care and Private Sector Care budget sub-activities are
designated as congressional special interest items. Any transfer of
funds in excess of $15,000,000 into or out of these sub-activities re-
quires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior approval reprogram-
ming procedures for operation and maintenance funds.
The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide writ-
ten notification to the congressional defense committees of cumu-
lative transfers in excess of $15,000,000 out of the Private Sector
Care budget sub-activity not later than 15 days after such a trans-
fer. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense
to submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, that delineates
transfers of funds, and the dates any transfers occurred, from the
Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to any other budget sub-ac-
tivity.
Additionally, the Committee remains concerned with funding for
Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (FSRM)
being repurposed throughout the fiscal year. Deferring FSRM in
favor of more immediate needs of the Defense Health Program may
seem prudent at the time but comes with costly, severe, and endur-
ing ramifications. For this reason, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide written notification to the congres-
sional defense committees of cumulative transfers in excess of
$15,000,000 out of the Base Operations and Communications budg-
et sub-activity not later than 15 days after such a transfer.
The Committee further directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Health Affairs to provide quarterly briefings to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than 30 days after the end of
each fiscal quarter, on budget execution data for all Defense Health
Program budget activities, and to adequately reflect changes to the
budget activities requested by the Services in future budget sub-
missions. These reports shall also be provided to the Government
Accountability Office.
CARRYOVER
For fiscal year 2026, the Committee recommends one percent car-
ryover authority for the operation and maintenance account of the
Defense Health Program. The Committee directs the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs to submit a detailed spending
plan for any fiscal year 2025 designated carryover funds to the con-
gressional defense committees not less than 30 days prior to exe-
cuting the carryover funds.

MILITARY MEDICAL MANPOWER
The Committee remains concerned that the Department’s han-
dling of military medical billet reductions, in response to the re-
forms mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2017, has negatively impacted access to quality healthcare
services for servicemembers and their beneficiaries, particularly in
areas deemed high risk and health shortage areas by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services.
In addition, the Committee continues to direct the Services’ Sur-
geons General to submit vacancy rates by occupational code to the
congressional defense committees on a quarterly basis and further
directs the Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to submit
vacancy rates among military and civilian medical personnel by lo-
cation and specialty to the congressional defense committees on a
quarterly basis.
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS
The Committee continues to support efforts the Department of
Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have undertaken
with regard to electronic health records and the health record sys-
tem. It is the Committee’s ongoing expectation that the Depart-
ments’ electronic health record systems will be interoperable with
seamless compatibility. The Committee directs the Director of the
Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) pro-
gram office to continue to submit quarterly reports on the progress
of interoperability between the two Departments to the House and
Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the House and
Senate Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations Subcommittees.
The Program Executive Officer of Defense Healthcare Manage-
ment Systems (PEO DHMS), in conjunction with the Director of
the FEHRM and the Director of the Defense Health Agency, is di-
rected to submit quarterly reports to the congressional defense
committees on the cost of the program, including any indirect costs
funded outside of the DHMS Modernization Electronic Health
Record program; and the schedule of the program, to include mile-
stones, knowledge points, and acquisition timelines, as well as
quarterly obligations. In addition, the Committee directs the PEO
DHMS to continue to brief the House and Senate Defense Appro-
priations Subcommittees on a quarterly basis, coinciding with the
report submission.
The Department of Defense’s electronic health record system,
MHS GENSIS, completed full deployment and is transitioning into
the Capability Support phase focused on end user experience. The
Committee directs the Comptroller General to continue quarterly
performance reviews of MHS GENESIS with a focus on whether
the program is meeting expected cost, schedule, scope, quality, and
risk mitigation expectations, to include system enhancements, and
expects the PEO DHMS will provide the Comptroller General reg-
ular and in-depth access to the program to facilitate these reviews.

MEDICAL RESEARCH
The Committee continues to monitor the transition of medical re-
search conducted by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel
Command to the Defense Health Agency Research and Develop-
ment organization to ensure that core medical research funding is
responsive to the needs of servicemembers. Additionally, the Com-
mittee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 includes $700,000,000
for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs
(CDMRP) to fund high-risk, high-reward medical research. The
Committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health
Affairs to submit to the House and Senate Appropriations Commit-
tees a request for prior approval for any changes in management
structure; functional alignment; or the two-tiered, peer-reviewed
process proposed for the CDMRP program, not less than 30 days
prior to any proposed changes taking place.
Additionally, the Committee continues to support the use of agile
contracting methods, such as other transaction agreements, that
may help mitigate the impacts on medical readiness through pub-
lic-private partnerships and encourages the Department to con-
tinue to leverage these mechanisms to ensure expeditious delivery
of medical solutions.
PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Committee recommends $130,000,000 for the peer-reviewed
breast cancer research program, $75,000,000 for the peer-reviewed
prostate cancer research program, $15,000,000 for the peer-re-
viewed kidney cancer research program, $45,000,000 for the peer-
reviewed ovarian cancer research program, $15,000,000 for the
peer-reviewed lung cancer research program, $17,500,000 for the
peer-reviewed rare cancers research program, $15,000,000 for the
peer-reviewed pancreatic cancer research program, and
$180,000,000 for the peer-reviewed cancer research program that
would research cancers not addressed in the aforementioned pro-
grams currently executed by the Department of Defense.
The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research pro-
gram are directed to be used to conduct research in the following
areas: bladder cancer; blood cancers; brain cancer (including glio-
blastoma); colorectal cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer;
germ cell cancers; liver cancer; lymphoma; metastatic cancers;
melanoma and other skin cancers; myeloma; neuroblastoma; pedi-
atric brain tumors; pediatric, adolescent, and young adult cancers;
sarcoma; stomach cancer; and thyroid cancer. The inclusion of the
individual rare cancers research program shall not prohibit the
peer-reviewed cancer research program from funding the previously
mentioned cancers or cancer subtypes that may be rare by defini-
tion.
The funds provided under the peer-reviewed cancer research pro-
gram shall be used only for the purposes listed above. The Com-
mittee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs
to submit a report, not later than 180 days after the enactment of
this Act, to the congressional defense committees on the status of
the peer-reviewed cancer research program. For each research
area, the report shall include the funding amount awarded, the

progress of the research, and the relevance of the research to
servicemembers and their families.
The Committee commends the Department of Defense for ensur-
ing that projects funded through the various peer-reviewed cancer
research programs maintain a focus on issues of significance to
military populations and the warfighter. This includes promoting
collaborative research proposals between Department of Defense
researchers and non-military research institutions. These collabora-
tions leverage the knowledge, infrastructure, and access to clinical
populations that the partners bring to the research effort. Addition-
ally, promoting these collaborations provides a valuable recruit-
ment and retention incentive for military medical and research per-
sonnel. The Committee encourages the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs to continue to emphasize the importance
of these collaborations between military and non-military research-
ers throughout the peer-review process.
PEER-REVIEWED ALS RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Committee notes that there is a well-documented correlation
between military service and the development of amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis (ALS). Servicemembers are twice as likely to develop
ALS as the general population, although the etiology of ALS and
its linkage to military service remains largely unknown. Therefore,
the Committee recommendation includes $40,000,000 for the peer-
reviewed ALS research program, and encourages the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs to prioritize research that can
bring effective treatments to people living with ALS as soon as pos-
sible.
PEER-REVIEWED TOXIC EXPOSURES RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Committee is concerned by the number of known and un-
known toxins servicemembers are exposed to as part of their mili-
tary service. The Committee remains committed to veterans af-
fected by Gulf War Illness and acknowledges a commonality be-
tween this community and others exposed to substances, including
burn pit exposure, that result in multiple, diverse symptoms and
health abnormalities. Therefore, the Committee recommends
$15,000,000 for the peer-reviewed toxic exposures research pro-
gram. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is di-
rected to select research projects of clear scientific merit and direct
relevance to military exposures to toxic substances, including toxic
industrial chemicals, materials, metals, and minerals. The inclu-
sion of the toxic exposures research program shall not prohibit re-
search in any other congressionally directed research program that
may be associated with conditions or health abnormalities linked
to toxic exposures.
As with other research programs, the Committee expects projects
funded through the peer-reviewed toxic exposures research pro-
gram to maintain a focus on issues of significance to military popu-
lations and the warfighter and that the program shall promote col-
laborative research proposals between Department of Defense re-
searchers and non-military research institutions.

PEER-REVIEWED ARTHRITIS RESEARCH
The Committee remains concerned by the detrimental impact of
arthritis on servicemembers and notes its impact on retention.
Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $10,000,000 for
the peer-reviewed arthritis research program. Funding provided in
the peer-reviewed arthritis research program shall be used to con-
duct research on all forms of arthritis including osteoarthritis,
posttraumatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Further, arthri-
tis research shall not be provided for in other peer-reviewed re-
search programs, and the inclusion of the peer-reviewed arthritis
research program shall not prohibit research in any other congres-
sionally directed research program that may be associated with
conditions or health abnormalities related to arthritis.
ADVANCED ORTHOPEDIC SURGICAL TRAINING FOR MILITARY
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS
The Committee recognizes the importance of utilizing partner-
ships with public, private, and non-profit organizations and institu-
tions to provide short-term specialized medical training to advance
arthroscopic surgical skills and capabilities of military medical pro-
viders. Delivery of direct training based on best practices related
to orthopedic procedures not only increases the proficiency of mili-
tary orthopedic health professionals to improve quality of care and
address readiness issues related to musculoskeletal injuries, but
also may lead to higher rates of retention among military medical
providers.
To address these gaps, Congress has previously appropriated re-
sources beginning in fiscal year 2019 to develop military-civilian
partnerships to ensure military orthopedic health professionals are
provided with advanced surgical training in, and best practices re-
lated to, arthroscopic surgery and techniques. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs
to submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, that outlines a
set of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Further,
the Committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs to submit a report to the congressional defense com-
mittees, not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, that
includes a list of entities the Department has established partner-
ships with under the program, and an assessment of the effective-
ness of the program based on physical health assessment data in-
cluding questions related to the electronic physical health assess-
ment survey, physical readiness test data, and postoperative sur-
vey data collected after musculoskeletal intervention.
NON-ADDICTIVE OPIOID ALTERNATIVES
The Committee is concerned about the continued use of opioids
in the military for the treatment of pain. The Committee encour-
ages the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to facili-
tate inclusion of Food and Drug Administration approved, non-ad-
dictive alternatives to opioids on the formulary. In addition, the
Committee supports efforts of the Department to promote and in-
crease the utilization of such treatments.

BLOOD PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT
The Committee is concerned of the potential impact to readiness
and military heath care operations resulting from a lack of quality
blood products and supply. The Committee notes the military’s de-
pendency on civilian blood donations to maintain an adequate sup-
ply of blood and blood products, and encourages the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Director of the Defense
Health Agency to explore the adoption of innovative blood products
with increased shelf life and broadened storage parameters, such
as freeze-dried platelet-derived hemostatic products, and enable
such use throughout the continuum of care.
TRICARE–5 TRANSITION
The Committee recognizes there have been widely reported
issues impacting beneficiary experience and beneficiary health cov-
erage, including significant delays in customer service response
times and provider reimbursement requests as part of the transi-
tion to the TRICARE T–5 contract. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the Director of the Defense Health Agency to provide a brief-
ing to the congressional defense committees, not later than 90 days
after the enactment of this Act, detailing the actions the Defense
Health Agency, and the two regional T–5 Managed Care Support
Contractors, have taken to improve patient experience, minimize
delays in customer service response times, and review and approve
provider reimbursement requests.
ROUTINE MONITORING OF PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS
The Committee notes the importance of mental health screening
during the perinatal period in identifying potential mental health
conditions during and after pregnancy that may increase the risk
of maternal death.
The Committee encourages the Director of the Defense Health
Agency to educate providers and TRICARE beneficiaries on the im-
portance and availability of perinatal mental health screenings, de-
velop and implement a process to routinely monitor the frequency
of perinatal mental health screenings in direct and private care set-
tings, and establish corrective actions for improvement to prevent
undiagnosed and untreated mental health conditions.
MATERNAL HEALTH PROVIDER SUPPORT
The Committee remains concerned about the shortage of current
and prospective maternal health care professionals for
servicemembers and their families, particularly obstetrician/gyne-
cologists and midwives. Therefore, the Committee encourages the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to seek avenues
to expand the number of maternal health-related scholarships
granted by the Health Professions Scholarship Program.
METASTATIC CANCER RESEARCH
Existing research suggests a genetic basis for susceptibility to
metastatic cancer or resistance to metastasis. However, the Com-
mittee believes more research and data are required to develop a
comprehensive understanding of this complex process. Clinical

trials are an important aspect of that process, and a diverse rep-
resentation of patients in clinical trials is integral to the develop-
ment of medications and therapies that effectively treat disease.
Therefore, the Committee encourages the Director of the Con-
gressionally Directed Medical Research Programs to continue to
partner with outside experts and other federal agencies to imple-
ment recommendations from the April 2018 Metastatic Cancer
Task Force Report to Congress concerning diverse enrollments in
clinical trials. In addition, the Committee directs the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Health Affairs to provide a briefing to the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees, not later than 180
days after the enactment of this Act, on the progress of imple-
menting recommendations contained in the April 2018 report.
ADVANCED OPERATIONAL MEDICAL READINESS REQUIREMENTS
The Committee recognizes the importance of integrated, inter-
operable, and mobile life-support and critical care capabilities for
effective deployed battlefield medicine and enroute care across do-
mains. To meet operational medical readiness requirements, the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs must prioritize
the use of equipment that addresses resupply and evacuation-con-
strained forward scenarios, and operational medical logistic limita-
tions such as reliable oxygen sources, theater-controlled substances
and cold chain items. Therefore, the Committee directs the Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with
the Director of the Defense Health Agency and the Services’ Sur-
geons Generals, to provide a briefing to the congressional defense
committees on an implementation plan that shall identify potential
equipment for procurement, educational training programs, and
sustainment requirements.
PREVENTING DEADLY AND COSTLY RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN
MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITIES
The Committee recognizes the public health crisis caused by
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and that respiratory infec-
tions are the number one contributor to HAIs. Servicemembers
treated by the Military Health System for a condition or injury
should not be subject to an additional infection developed during
their stays at military treatment facilities. The Committee notes
that preventable HAIs lead to unnecessary losses of life, increase
defense healthcare costs, and that past efforts to reduce respiratory
HAIs have had little success.
Therefore, the Committee encourages the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Health Affairs, in conjunction with the Director of the
Defense Health Agency, to prioritize the development of ultraviolet
respirators that allow for increased breathability for use by pa-
tients at military treatment facilities with respiratory infections to
eliminate pathogens in exhaled breath and prevent the spread of
infection.

The Committee remains concerned regarding the scourge of illicit
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids that kill thousands of Ameri-
cans every year. The Department of Defense has a key role in help-
ing to combat this crisis through its drug-interdiction and counter-
drug programs. The Committee, therefore, has increased funding
for the program over the fiscal year 2025 enacted levels. This in-
cludes additional funding for the National Guard and to facilitate
interdiction efforts by United States Southern Command.
The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure that international
programs requested and supported by this account do not duplicate
programs funded by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in
the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account. Any con-
gressional notification submitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 284 shall
identify any resources within the Operation and Maintenance, De-
fense-Wide account that are allocated for similar or related pur-
poses.
PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ZONE MAPS
The Committee acknowledges the Department of Defense has es-
tablished certain National Defense Zones. The Committee also rec-
ognizes that maps outlining the boundaries of these National De-
fense Zones must be easily accessible to the public, such that local
communities may deconflict recreational activities or other tradi-
tional usage of these recently designated lands. Therefore, the
Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to publicly release and
maintain web-accessible maps identifying all current or future Na-
tional Defense Zones, to include a Community Liaison Point of
Contact for public inquiries.

MINORITY VIEWS
The Fiscal Year 2026 Defense Appropriations Act totals $831.5
billion. Though the bill is equal to the fiscal year 2025 enacted
level, we have deep concerns about how the bill will impact our
military’s readiness since the bill repeats, yet again, the same mis-
takes as the fiscal year 2024 and 2025 House proposals.
Truly disturbing, however, has been the inability of the new Ad-
ministration to provide the Committee with detailed budgetary in-
formation in a timely fashion. It is still a question as to why this
is the case—incompetence, ignorance or outright obstruction. As
the bill is now being reported to the House of Representatives for
consideration, the Committee has been provided only funding levels
and no justification documents have been transmitted for analysis.
The Defense Appropriations Act is the Appropriation Commit-
tee’s largest discretionary funding bill. It is an incredibly complex
piece of legislation and deals with a wide range of national security
issues. Failure to provide annual budget justification documents
impinges on Congress’ oversight responsibilities.
In particular, the budgets for Procurement programs, and the Re-
search and Development efforts required to support them—natu-
rally ebb and flow. Congress must review these 5-year funding pro-
files so that we can answer the questions that are fundamental to
our Subcommittee’s jurisdiction.
We must know what we are buying and why; what we aren’t
buying and why; and what phase research and development efforts
are at.
The Administration has indicated that any increases in Defense
spending in fiscal year 2026 will be enacted through the proposed
Reconciliation Bill, which includes $150 billion of defense funds.
We understand the importance of the investments we make in
our nation’s defense. But, it’s irresponsible to assume Defense pro-
grams can be funded through an unstable reconciliation process,
and when considering the Reconciliation bill, there is a bigger pic-
ture here.
The cost-of-living crisis is felt by every American family—and
that includes military families. The President is not laser focused
on the cost-of-living crisis, which he is actually making worse. This
Administration and the majority are attacking programs that help
families make ends meet in order to give billionaires a tax break.
Safety net programs and other basic services that have been at-
tacked by the Administration and defunded in the Reconciliation
bill not only help with the cost-of-living—they are critical for na-
tional security.
The bill again includes partisan social policy riders that were re-
jected in the fiscal year 2024 conference agreement. The inclusion
of those riders in the process last year, led to a full year Con-

tinuing Resolution and will continue to inhibit the ability to enact
a full year appropriations bill.
It is unfortunate that the majority felt the need to include these
poison pills given the numerous executive orders the President has
issued since his inauguration. Yet the attacks against equality for
women, the LGBTQI community and diversity continue.
Specifically, the bill, again, limits the ability of Service personnel
and their families to receive the reproductive health care they de-
serve. Women make up almost 20% of the military services. And
approximately 80,000 women service members live in a state that
has limited or banned access to reproductive health care. Service
members do not get to choose where they are stationed, and their
duty station should not determine the type of health care they re-
ceive.
Also, there are provisions that disenfranchise lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual and transgender service members rather than making our mili-
tary a welcoming and inclusive place for all those who wish to
serve our country. We should not turn away the talent our military
and our nation needs.
There are provisions included in this bill that continue to need-
lessly attack diversity and inclusion efforts. Though the Adminis-
tration has dismantled all of these types of programs across the
government, they should be reminded that our military is the insti-
tution in our country that most broadly reflects the entire Amer-
ican population. That includes the 33% of active-duty service mem-
bers who identify with a minority group.
Beyond contentious social policy, there are other elements of this
bill that we cannot support.
The bill continues to abandon the needs of an ally, Ukraine. The
bill eliminates funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initia-
tive. This bill should include the long-term assistance that Ukraine
needs. As we have seen over the past year, Putin only becomes
more emboldened as funding is delayed, paused or discontinued.
Our NATO allies continue to provide assistance, but without the
support of the United States, we continue to play into Putin’s
hands.
To add some context, during the President’s first term, House Re-
publicans crafted a Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019
that passed the Committee, 48–4, with overwhelming bipartisan
support. It was a bill that included $250 million for the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative, and did not include the divisive so-
cial policy riders. Chairman Cole and Chairman Calvert voted for
that bill as did we—and a bill like that is a more appropriate start-
ing point for the House of Representatives to conference with the
Senate.
This bill again limits the ability for our government to address
disinformation. Our foreign adversaries are constantly using social
media to spread disinformation here at home in the United States.
This bill deprives the Department of Defense of their responsibility
to set facts straight. This is dangerous, and it would have real na-
tional security implications here at home and abroad.
During full committee consideration, the Committee adopted
amendments offered by the minority to uphold the Posse Comitatus
Act, secure funds for forensic support for victims of sexual assault

and prohibit funds for the transmission of classified material over
unsecured networks. We look forward to working with the majority
to ensure they are enacted into law. Chairman Calvert also indi-
cated a willingness to work with us in conference to restore funds
for life saving DoD medical research programs.
Finally, this bill has been considered during a time of remark-
able upheaval for the Committee. Since the change of Administra-
tion in January 2025 the executive branch has been engaged in a
rampant, unlawful, and unconstitutional disregard for spending
laws. In particular, the Office of Management and Budget has been
at the center of a government-wide effort to thwart the intent of
this Committee’s laws in its actions, while also unlawfully refusing
to publish the agency’s legally-binding budget decisions (known as
apportionments) in contravention of an unambiguous and constitu-
tionally sound assertion of the Congress’s authority to impose
transparency requirements upon the executive branch.
The current administration has stated—at times—an inherent
Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was ap-
proved over the objection of almost all Democrats on the Com-
mittee, the debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just
as former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
William Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney
General with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of the Congress’s constitutional power of
the purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the
Committee places on spending authority through the Congress’s
Article I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict
the purpose for any purpose in the bill, so too does the Committee
decide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is the Congress’s clear
intent to be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
In closing, regrettably at this time, we will be unable to support
passage of this bill, but we look forward to working with the major-
ity to enact a bipartisan bill that strengthens our national security.

Ranking Member.
