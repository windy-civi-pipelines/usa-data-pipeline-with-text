tive designees and the chair and ranking minority member of the

—Clause 4(a) of rule XIII, which prohibits the consideration of a
measure or matter reported by a committee until the proposed text
of the report has been available for 72 hours.
—Clause 3(e) of rule XIII, which requires the inclusion of a com-
parative print for a bill or joint resolution proposing to repeal or
amend a statute.
—Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII, which requires the inclusion of a
committee cost estimate in a committee report.
—Section 425 of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits
consideration of legislation that would increase the direct costs of
Federal intergovernmental mandates beyond $50,000,000 (adjusted
for inflation) unless the legislation provides for new budget author-
ity or the legislation appropriates sufficient funds to cover the new
costs.
The waiver of all points of order against provisions of H.R. 1, as
amended, includes:
—Clause 4 of rule XXI, which prohibits reporting a bill carrying
an appropriation from a committee not having jurisdiction to report
an appropriation.
—Clause 5(a) of rule XXI, which prohibits a bill or joint resolu-
tion carrying a tax or tariff measure from being reported by a com-
mittee not having jurisdiction to report tax or tariff measures.
Although the resolution provides that clause 5(b) of rule XXI
does not apply to this bill, the rule isolates only specified provisions
and does not look at the essential interactions of all the tax provi-
sions. While the bill as a whole provides broad tax relief, the provi-
sion is necessary because of the narrow focus of the rule.
