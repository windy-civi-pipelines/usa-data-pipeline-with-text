I. PURPOSE AND BILL SUMMARY
On February 26, 2025, Rep. Williams (TX–25), along with Rep.
Olszewski, Rep. Bresnahan, Rep. Tran, and Rep. Wied, introduced
H.R. 1642, the Connecting Small Businesses with Career and Tech-
nical Education Graduates Act of 2025. H.R. 1642 amends the
Small Business Act to include requirements for Small Business De-
velopment Centers (SBDC’s) and Women’s Business Centers
(WBC’s) to connect with graduates of career and technical edu-
cation programs.
II. NEED FOR LEGISLATION
This legislation aims to help fix some of the workforce issues fac-
ing small businesses. The Connecting Small Businesses with Ca-
reer and Technical Education Graduates Act of 2025 requires
SBDCs and WBCs to educate small businesses who are looking to
hire about Career and Technical Education (CTE) program, and
how CTE program graduates can fulfill small business hiring
needs. In addition to helping businesses find employees by edu-
cating them on relevant CTE programs, this legislation helps teach
CTE program graduates how to utilize the skills they learned to
create their own small businesses. This bill helps strengthen the
workforce and create more small businesses.
III. HEARINGS
On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Small Business held a
hearing examining matters related to H.R. 1642 titled ‘‘Hope on the
Horizon: Prioritizing Small Business Growth in the 119th Con-
gress.’’
IV. COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
The Committee on Small Business met in open session, with a
quorum being present, on March 5, 2025 and ordered H.R. 1642 fa-
vorably reported to the House of Representatives. During the
markup no amendments were offered.
V. COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the mo-
tion to report legislation and amendments thereto. The Committee
voted to favorably report H.R. 1642 to the House of Representatives

VI. SECTION-BY-SECTION OF H.R. 1642

Section 3:
Section 1—Short title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Connecting Small Businesses with
Career and Technical Education Graduates Act of 2025.’’

Section 4:
Section 2—Inclusion of Career and Technical Education
This section aims to help small businesses meet their hiring
needs by educating them about local CTE programs whose grad-
uates would be beneficial to a small business. Specifically, this sec-
tion amends the Small Business Act to direct SBDCs and WBCs to
provide information to small businesses on hiring graduates from
career and technical programs, including relevant programs that
may satisfy the hiring needs of the small business. SBDCs and
WBCs will also inform recent CTE program graduates about how
they might start a small business.
VII. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The
Committee has requested but not received from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office a cost estimate for the Committee’s
provisions.
VIII. NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX
EXPENDITURES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives and section 308(a)(I) of the Congressional Budg-
et Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following opinion and
estimate with respect to new budget authority, entitlement author-
ity, and tax expenditures. While the Committee has not received an
estimate of new budget authority contained in the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to Sec. 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee does not believe that there will be any additional costs at-
tributable to this legislation. H.R. 1642 does not direct new spend-
ing, but instead reallocates funding independently authorized and
appropriated.
IX. OVERSIGHT FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
In accordance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the over-
sight findings and recommendations of the Committee on Small
Business with respect to the subject matter contained in the H.R.
1642 are incorporated into the descriptive portions of this report.
X. PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, there are no perform-
ance goals and objectives of H.R. 1642 applicable.

cative of another Federal program, including any program that was

Law 111–139 or the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic As-
sistance.
XII. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND
LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House

tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives.
XIII. FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT

dominant in its field of operation.
(2) ESTABLISHMENT OF SIZE STANDARDS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—In addition to the criteria specified in
paragraph (1) and subject to the requirements specified
under subparagraph (C), the Administrator may specify
detailed definitions or standards by which a business con-
cern may be determined to be a small business concern for
the purposes of this Act or any other Act.
(B) ADDITIONAL CRITERIA.—The standards described in
paragraph (1) may utilize number of employees, dollar vol-
ume of business, net worth, net income, a combination
thereof, or other appropriate factors.
(C) REQUIREMENTS.—Unless specifically authorized by
statute, no Federal department or agency (including the
Administration when acting pursuant to subparagraph (A))
may prescribe a size standard for categorizing a business
concern as a small business concern, unless such proposed
size standard—
(i) is proposed after an opportunity for public notice
and comment;
(ii) provides for determining—
(I) the size of a manufacturing concern as meas-
ured by the manufacturing concern’s average em-
ployment based upon employment during each of

preceding 24 months;
(II) the size of a business concern providing
services on the basis of the annual average gross

clude from consideration in the average annual gross re-

essary in order to increase the amount of the grant to
the amount received by that State in fiscal year 2000,
or until such funds are exhausted, whichever first oc-

cal Year 2023, SBDCs served nearly 326,000 unique small
business clients, contributing to nearly 21,000 new business
starts and supporting over 1,303,000 jobs.1
• WBCs have more than 140 centers across the country that
offer a wide variety of services to women business owners,
which include personalized counseling and training, classes,
and technical assistance. Many WBCs offer flexible hours, in-
cluding weekends and evenings, to allow mothers to attend
programs and obtain services. In Fiscal Year 2023, WBCs
served 87,900 unique small business clients, contributing to
over 3,400 new business starts.2
Small firms have faced issues related to attracting and retaining
a skilled workforce. Career and technical education (CTE) opportu-
nities provide a competitive and practical career path and can help
address the current labor and skills shortage. At the Committee’s
February 5, 2025 hearing titled ‘‘Hope on the Horizon: Prioritizing
Small Business Growth in the 119th Congress,’’ Karl Hutter, CEO
of Nevada aerospace part manufacturer Click Bond, Inc., testified
that CTE was ‘‘essential’’ to addressing the shortage in skilled
labor for small businesses like his.3 Moreover, SBDCs and WBCs
can be valuable resource partners in supporting small businesses
in meeting their labor needs and finding skilled workers.

I. PURPOSE AND BILL SUMMARY
On February 26, 2025, Rep. Williams (TX–25), along with Rep.
Olszewski, Rep. Bresnahan, Rep. Tran, and Rep. Wied, introduced
H.R. 1642, the Connecting Small Businesses with Career and Tech-
nical Education Graduates Act of 2025. H.R. 1642 amends the
Small Business Act to include requirements for Small Business De-
velopment Centers (SBDC’s) and Women’s Business Centers
(WBC’s) to connect with graduates of career and technical edu-
cation programs.
II. NEED FOR LEGISLATION
This legislation aims to help fix some of the workforce issues fac-
ing small businesses. The Connecting Small Businesses with Ca-
reer and Technical Education Graduates Act of 2025 requires
SBDCs and WBCs to educate small businesses who are looking to
hire about Career and Technical Education (CTE) program, and
how CTE program graduates can fulfill small business hiring
needs. In addition to helping businesses find employees by edu-
cating them on relevant CTE programs, this legislation helps teach
CTE program graduates how to utilize the skills they learned to
create their own small businesses. This bill helps strengthen the
workforce and create more small businesses.
III. HEARINGS
On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Small Business held a
hearing examining matters related to H.R. 1642 titled ‘‘Hope on the
Horizon: Prioritizing Small Business Growth in the 119th Con-
gress.’’
IV. COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
The Committee on Small Business met in open session, with a
quorum being present, on March 5, 2025 and ordered H.R. 1642 fa-
vorably reported to the House of Representatives. During the
markup no amendments were offered.
V. COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the mo-
tion to report legislation and amendments thereto. The Committee
voted to favorably report H.R. 1642 to the House of Representatives
at 11:45 AM.

VI. SECTION-BY-SECTION OF H.R. 1642
Section 1—Short title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Connecting Small Businesses with
Career and Technical Education Graduates Act of 2025.’’
Section 2—Inclusion of Career and Technical Education
This section aims to help small businesses meet their hiring
needs by educating them about local CTE programs whose grad-
uates would be beneficial to a small business. Specifically, this sec-
tion amends the Small Business Act to direct SBDCs and WBCs to
provide information to small businesses on hiring graduates from
career and technical programs, including relevant programs that
may satisfy the hiring needs of the small business. SBDCs and
WBCs will also inform recent CTE program graduates about how
they might start a small business.
VII. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The
Committee has requested but not received from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office a cost estimate for the Committee’s
provisions.
VIII. NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX
EXPENDITURES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives and section 308(a)(I) of the Congressional Budg-
et Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following opinion and
estimate with respect to new budget authority, entitlement author-
ity, and tax expenditures. While the Committee has not received an
estimate of new budget authority contained in the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to Sec. 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee does not believe that there will be any additional costs at-
tributable to this legislation. H.R. 1642 does not direct new spend-
ing, but instead reallocates funding independently authorized and
appropriated.
IX. OVERSIGHT FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
In accordance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the over-
sight findings and recommendations of the Committee on Small
Business with respect to the subject matter contained in the H.R.
1642 are incorporated into the descriptive portions of this report.
X. PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, there are no perform-
ance goals and objectives of H.R. 1642 applicable.

XI. STATEMENT OF DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS

cative of another Federal program, including any program that was
included in a report to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139 or the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic As-
sistance.
XII. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND
LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House

tain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited
tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives.
XIII. FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT

ume of business, net worth, net income, a combination
thereof, or other appropriate factors.

concern as a small business concern, unless such proposed
size standard—

and comment;

XVIII. MINORITY VIEWS
The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a variety of
services to help educate and counsel small businesses, including
Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) and Women’s Busi-
ness Centers (WBCs).
• With over 900 locations nationwide, SBDCs provide valu-
able resources to small businesses across the country, includ-
ing networking, counseling, and training. Through a partner-
ship with SBA, SBDCs are hosted by universities, colleges,
state economic development agencies, or private entities, and
their goal is to help launch and grow small businesses. In Fis-
cal Year 2023, SBDCs served nearly 326,000 unique small
business clients, contributing to nearly 21,000 new business
starts and supporting over 1,303,000 jobs.1
• WBCs have more than 140 centers across the country that
offer a wide variety of services to women business owners,
which include personalized counseling and training, classes,
and technical assistance. Many WBCs offer flexible hours, in-
cluding weekends and evenings, to allow mothers to attend
programs and obtain services. In Fiscal Year 2023, WBCs
served 87,900 unique small business clients, contributing to
over 3,400 new business starts.2
Small firms have faced issues related to attracting and retaining
a skilled workforce. Career and technical education (CTE) opportu-
nities provide a competitive and practical career path and can help
address the current labor and skills shortage. At the Committee’s
February 5, 2025 hearing titled ‘‘Hope on the Horizon: Prioritizing
Small Business Growth in the 119th Congress,’’ Karl Hutter, CEO
of Nevada aerospace part manufacturer Click Bond, Inc., testified
that CTE was ‘‘essential’’ to addressing the shortage in skilled
labor for small businesses like his.3 Moreover, SBDCs and WBCs
can be valuable resource partners in supporting small businesses
in meeting their labor needs and finding skilled workers.
