SEC. 2. ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR RURAL-AREA SMALL BUSINESSES.
Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (4)(C), by inserting ‘‘, rural-area small businesses’’ after
‘‘women-owned small businesses’’; and
(2) in paragraph (6)(B)(iii), by inserting ‘‘, rural-area small businesses’’ after
‘‘women-owned small businesses’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1190, the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Cre-
ators Act, was introduced on February 11, 2025, by Representative
Troy Downing (MT–02). H.R. 1190 requires the Advocate for Small
Business Capital Formation (Advocate) within the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) to add rural small business to the
categories of businesses for which it is required to identify prob-
lems faced by the identified categories of businesses when they are
securing access to capital.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Advocate is required to identify problems that small busi-
nesses face when securing access to capital and submit an annual
report to Congress. Currently, the Advocate’s list of applicable enti-
ties are minority-owned, women-owned, and disaster-stricken small
businesses. H.R. 1190 requires the Advocate to add rural small
businesses to its list of applicable entities, thereby directing critical
research and resources to a category of businesses that have been
overlooked for far too long.

atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
