PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on May 14, 2025, by Representative Barry
Loudermilk (GA–11), H.R. 3380, the Taking Account of Institutions
with Low Operational Risk (TAILOR) Act of 2025, requires federal
financial institutions regulatory agencies, including the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve Board (FRB), National Credit
Union Administration (NCUA), and Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB), to consider an institution’s risk profile and busi-
ness model when issuing new regulations or taking supervisory ac-
tions and to limit the regulatory burden on institutions in accord-
ance. H.R. 3380 requires disclosure of these tailoring efforts in
rulemaking and annual reports to Congress.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The current regulatory framework imposes a uniform, ‘‘one-size-
fits-all’’ set of requirements on financial institutions, regardless of
size, complexity, or risk. This approach, largely shaped by post-cri-
sis legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), fails to distinguish be-
tween global systemically important banks and small, community-
based institutions. While well-intentioned, these broad rules have
placed a disproportionate burden on community banks, which play
a critical role in serving rural areas, supporting small businesses,
and promoting local economic growth. Importantly, these institu-
tions were not responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. Recognizing
the need for proportional regulation, Congress passed the bipar-
tisan S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Con-
sumer Protection Act, in 2018, which directed regulators to tailor
requirements based on institutional risk. Unfortunately, in recent
years, federal financial institutions regulators have moved away
from that principle, reinstating rigid and overly broad standards.
The TAILOR Act reasserts the importance of aligning regulation
with risk and complexity. This bill reinforces accountability among
financial regulators, promotes efficiency in supervision, and en-
sures that community banks can focus their resources on serving
their communities. The bill also includes important measures to
streamline data reporting for eligible institutions and to evaluate
how regulatory agencies can modernize their supervisory practices

ments.

the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3380 is to reinforce account-
ability among financial regulators, promote efficiency in super-
vision, and ensure that community banks can focus their resources

COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3380. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause

estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section establishes the short title as the ‘‘Taking Account of
Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act of 2025’’ or the ‘‘TAILOR
Act of 2025.’’
Section 2. Tailoring regulation to business model and risk
This section defines ‘‘Federal financial institutions regulatory
agency’’ and ‘‘regulatory action.’’ It requires agencies to consider
the risk profiles and business models of institution subject to regu-
latory actions and to tailor those actions to limit burden appro-
priately. It requires agencies to consider the aggregate effect of all
applicable regulatory actions on the ability of institutions to flexi-
bly serve customers of the institutions and local markets; the po-
tential that implementation efforts may undercut tailoring; and the
statutory authority and policy goals behind the regulations.
This section also requires each Federal financial institutions reg-
ulatory agency to disclose and document the considerations in pro-
posed rulemakings. It requires congressional reports to be sub-
mitted by each such agency describing the specific actions taken to
effectuate the provisions of the bill within one year of enactment
and annually thereafter. It instructs each such agency to conduct
a review of all final regulations promulgated within the fifteen
years prior to enactment of the bill and apply the requirements of
the bill to such regulations within three years of enactment of the
bill.
Section 3. Short-form call reports for all banks eligible for the com-
munity bank leverage ratio
Section 3 requires appropriate Federal banking agencies to pro-
mulgate regulations establishing reduced reporting requirements
for all banks eligible for the Community Bank Leverage Ratio
when filing their first and third quarterly call reports each year.
Section 4. Report to Congress on modernization of supervision
Section 4 requires the appropriate Federal financial institutions
regulatory agencies, in consultation with State supervisors, to re-
port to Congress no later than 18 months after enactment of the
bill on modernization of bank supervision., The report must ad-

dress changes to bank business models, examiner workforce and
training, the supervisory structures within banking agencies, im-
provements in bank-supervisor communication and collaboration,
the use of supervisory technology, supervisory factors uniquely ap-
plicable to community banks, and statutory changes necessary to
achieve more effective supervision.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 3380 does not repeal or amend any section of a statute.
Therefore, the Office of Legislative Counsel did not prepare the re-
port required under clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the House of Rep-
resentatives.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill requires banking regulators and the CFPB to tailor all
regulations for all their regulated entities, not just community
banks, to account for a wide variety of risk profiles and industry
costs (but not benefits). We’ve seen how tailoring in Trump’s first
term led to regional bank failures in 2023. Moreover, instead of fo-
cusing on helping community banks, this sweeping deregulatory
bill would hamper financial regulators ability to promote safety
and soundness and ensure consumer protection.
Recent court rulings have made it easier for industry to block
rules through litigation, and Trump’s Administration has worked to
shutdown the CFPB while undermining the independence of finan-
cial agencies by requiring White House approval of all regulations.
This bill makes matters worse by making it hard for agencies to
issue any rules given the ambiguous tailoring standards they
would have to meet for each rule. Any one company out of thou-
sands could sue and block a rule if they felt it was not sufficiently
tailored to their firm’s unique business model and risk profile.
Moreover, regulators would not have to consider a rule’s benefits,
including safety and soundness or consumer protections. The bill
would severely stymie the rulemaking process, including when
agencies need to update old rules to adapt to an evolving market-
place.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act, among other statutes, already requires regulators to tier and
tailor regulatory standards based on risk, ensuring that compliance
burdens are minimized for community financial institutions and
regulatory attention is focused on activities that may cause the
greatest harm.1
During Trump’s first term, a somewhat similar bill was pre-
viously included in a large financial deregulatory package advanced
by former Chair Hensarling, the ‘‘Financial CHOICE Act of 2017’’
that passed by a party-line vote of 233–186,2 and then was later
passed as a standalone bill, the ‘‘TAILOR Act of 2017’’ sponsored
by Rep. Tipton, by a vote of 247–169.3 Congress later adopted the
‘‘Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection
Act’’ sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo in 2018,4 which among other
things tailored rules for regional banks, but Silicon Valley Bank
(SVB) and a couple other regional banks failed in 2023.5
Groups like Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Center for
Responsible Lending (CRL), and AARP oppose the bill. According
to Americans Financial Reform, ‘‘This sweeping mandate would

force regulators to prioritize the costs of regulations to financial in-
stitutions over the offsetting benefits to consumers and the general
public. The mandate implies that regulators would be unable to act
to protect the public if such action led to any significant costs to
Wall Street banks. Any regulated entity, including the largest
banks, could use this TAILOR Act language as the basis for a law-
suit to overturn a rule, simply by claiming a regulation had a sig-
nificant impact or cost for them. . . . This requirement is not only
dangerous but unnecessary. It ignores the fact that regulators are
already scaling rules to the size and business model of financial in-
stitutions.’’6
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3380.
