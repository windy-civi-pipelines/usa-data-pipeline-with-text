OVERVIEW
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 for activities
under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on National Security,
Department of State, and Related Programs includes
$46,218,000,000 in new discretionary budget authority for pro-
grams and activities within the Subcommittee’s purview, which is
22 percent below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The fiscal year 2026 National Security, Department of State, and
Related Programs Appropriations Act (‘‘this Act’’) demonstrates
clear support for an America First foreign policy, first and fore-
most, by dramatically reducing spending. With government debt
forecasted to grow from 100 percent to 200 percent of Gross Domes-
tic Product (GDP) within decades, the Committee is committed to
making the significant cuts required to help get our fiscal house in
order, consistent with the power of the purse authority as laid out
in Article I of the United States Constitution.
Within these cuts, the bill prioritizes funding effective and ac-
countable programs that support and protect the American people
and our national security interests abroad and ensure our country’s
allies are supported and enemies confronted. An America First for-
eign policy requires careful consideration of how American tax dol-

lars are spent abroad. The bill strengthens requirements for the
Secretary of State to consider, prior to providing funds, the voting
practices of other countries at the United Nations, as well as co-
operation on issues important to the United States, such as migra-
tion cooperation, opposing foreign adversaries, and burden sharing.
Further, this Act supports full implementation of key Executive
Orders that reflect a clear commitment to national sovereignty, se-
cure borders, limited government, and traditional American values.
These Executive Orders collectively address critical policy areas
and institutional reforms, including: Executive Order 14149, relat-
ing to Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censor-
ship; Executive Order 14151, relating to Ending Radical and
Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing; Executive
Order 14155, relating to Withdrawing the United States From the
World Health Organization; Executive Order 14162, relating to
Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements;
Executive Order 14165, relating to Securing Our Borders; Execu-
tive Order 14170, relating to Reforming the Federal Hiring Process
and Restoring Merit to Government Service; Executive Order
14173, relating to Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring
Merit-Based Opportunity; Executive Order 14187, relating to Pro-
tecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation; Execu-
tive Order 14203, relating to Imposing Sanctions on the Inter-
national Criminal Court; Executive Order 14218, relating to End-
ing Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders; and Executive Order
14312, relating to Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions.
NATIONAL SECURITY
The Committee looks forward to the beginning of a new era in
American foreign policy—one of strength and unapologetic leader-
ship. As in previous years, the Committee recommendation sup-
ports allies and partners of the United States while countering ad-
versaries and those countries and non-state actors that support
them. However, it is critical that our European and other partners
continue to show resolve in the face of rising security challenges,
including by taking material steps to strengthen their national de-
fense.
The Committee recommendation includes steadfast support for
Israel by providing $3,300,000,000 from funds made available
under Foreign Military Financing Program, consistent with the
United States-Israel Memorandum of Understanding.
While Israel’s recent military success against Iran and its prox-
ies, alongside American strategic kinetic action against key nuclear
sites, has left Iran and its proxies weakened and vulnerable, the
Committee remains deeply concerned about Tehran’s ballistic mis-
sile capability and nuclear program. The Committee recommenda-
tion continues to prohibit funding to implement or enforce any
agreement with Iran regarding its nuclear program, including re-
newal of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, unless such
agreement complies with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act
of 2015. In addition, the Committee prohibits the use of funds to
revoke the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Furthermore, the Committee
encourages increased vigilance and support to our partners facing
threats from the Iranian regime and its proxies in the region.

The Committee continues its longstanding focus on the multi-
dimensional challenge posed to United States national security in-
terests by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). This challenge is complicated and made
more acute by growing collaboration between the PRC and a range
of other hostile actors, including the Russian Federation, Iran,
Cuba, and North Korea. In addition, Communist China’s aggressive
military operations to project power over Taiwan—actions which
the United States commander in the Indo-Pacific describes as a ‘‘re-
hearsal’’ for forced unification—as well as its dangerous and coer-
cive behavior in the East and South China seas underscores the
need for modernized alliances with greater partner burden sharing
to ensure continued successful deterrence.
The Committee therefore supports efforts to counter such threats
by directing not less than $1,800,000,000 to advance United States
national security interests in the Indo-Pacific and to counter the
malign influence of the PRC, including by providing up to
$400,000,000 for the Countering PRC Influence Fund, and by pro-
viding funding above the request for the Indo-Pacific Strategy and
Pacific Islands countries (PICs).
The Committee notes the ongoing need to strengthen deterrence
across the Taiwan Strait and recommends $500,000,000 from funds
made available under Foreign Military Financing Program for Tai-
wan, as well as up to $2,000,000,000 in loans and loan guarantees
for such purpose, as authorized by section 5502(g) of the Taiwan
Enhanced Resilience Act (Public Law 117–263).
As Secretary of State Rubio has noted, ‘‘the United States is put-
ting our region, the Americas, first.’’ The Committee recommenda-
tion strongly supports such efforts, including strengthening ties
with friends and partners in our own hemisphere, including in the
Caribbean, to invest in, and promote, free markets, transparency,
stability, and regional cooperation. It prioritizes funding to combat
the flow of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs into the United
States and prohibits funds for other organizations that support the
movement of migrant caravans to the United States. In addition,
the Committee supports efforts by Federal agencies funded in this
Act to de-risk critical supply chains by diversifying away from reli-
ance on the PRC and nearshoring them to the Americas to support
enhanced economic growth and stability, opening new markets for
United States businesses.
The Committee remains committed to supporting freedom for the
people of Cuba and provides $35,000,000 for democracy programs
and $40,000,000 for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. The Com-
mittee recommendation continues strong support for democracy
programs for the people of Venezuela and Nicaragua and calls on
European partners seeking support for Ukraine to stand for free-
dom and democracy in the Western Hemisphere as well, especially
in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.
PROTECTING LIFE AND SUPPORTING AMERICAN VALUES
The Committee recommendation maintains support for global
health programs by including all longstanding pro-life protections,
including the prohibition on funds to pay for abortions. The Com-
mittee expands and strengthens additional requirements, including
by applying the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy,

which prohibits funds for any foreign nongovernmental organiza-
tions that promotes or performs abortion, with certain exceptions.
The Committee includes additional requirements to enhance
transparency on how funds are used and which organizations are
implementing programs. The Committee remains significantly con-
cerned over the Helms Amendment violation under the Biden Ad-
ministration and includes new requirements for oversight to ensure
this despicable violation never occurs again.
In addition, the Committee prioritizes funding for religious free-
dom programs abroad and religious freedom protections for faith-
based organizations (FBOs) delivering foreign assistance.
The Committee strengthens the prohibition on censorship to in-
clude all funds provided by this Act and prior acts making appro-
priations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and re-
lated programs. The Committee continues to strongly support the
protection of free speech and free press around the globe, especially
with respect to American citizens and businesses.
UNITED STATES ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND
AMERICAN CITIZEN SERVICES
The Committee recommendation supports a strong American
economy by strengthening a provision to enhance United States
diplomatic engagement on commercial diplomacy in support of
United States businesses abroad and in the resolution of foreign
commercial disputes involving American citizens and businesses.
The Committee also directs the Secretary of State to prioritize
consular services for American citizens, chiefly by ensuring reason-
able and predictable processing times for passports. Therefore, the
Committee provides $517,000,000 under Consular and Border Se-
curity Programs to continue reducing wait times and increasing
customer service.
The Committee recommendation underscores the importance of
prioritizing investments for the International Boundary and Water
Commission, the International Fisheries Commissions, and the
International Joint Commission, as these commissions directly im-
pact Americans and the United States economy. Further, the Com-
mittee highlights the urgency of resolving the water delivery deficit
from the Rio Grande, which is owed by Mexico to the United States
as required by the 1944 Water Treaty. It is imperative to the
agrarian economy along the Rio Grande Basin, including South
Texas, that such water deliveries are timely and dependable, and
the Committee recommendation reflects the critical nature of
promptly resolving this issue to safeguard the livelihoods and eco-
nomic stability of the region. The Committee applauds the Admin-
istration for prioritizing this issue in negotiations with Mexico and
welcomes collaboration on continued efforts to secure water deliv-
eries for Americans.
OVERSIGHT, TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Committee continues to prioritize proper management of
American tax dollars across all Federal agencies funded in the bill,
and this is particularly important for the Department of State and
other agencies charged with advancing the interests of the United
States around the world. Waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs
funded in this Act will not be tolerated. In this regard, the Com-

mittee looks forward to working with the Department of State on
their strategic realignment, including: (1) the streamlining of cer-
tain functions and the Department’s expanded role in management
of foreign assistance; and (2) an increased focus on foreign assist-
ance effectiveness and transparency, pursuant to section 7011 of
this Act.
The bill includes unprecedented oversight and accountability re-
lated to the United Nations and other international organizations,
including by withholding funds until any such organization funded
by this Act is in compliance with requirements on oversight access
agreements established by the Department of State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024. The Com-
mittee also requires the Inspectors General to update best practices
for conducting oversight, including in countries and regions at
higher risk for waste, fraud, and abuse, and for programs involving
multilateral organizations.
In global health assistance, the Committee encourages greater
emphasis on leveraging American technology and innovation along-
side closer cooperation with the private sector to instill outcome
and performance-based programming to boost effectiveness and ac-
countability. The Committee continues to support funding for the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and takes
the first step toward ensuring the long-term success and viability
of this important investment by directing a strategy to guide a suc-
cessful transition over time from United States support.
The Committee reduces reprogramming authorities to ensure
that funds are devoted to the highest priorities and carried out ex-
peditiously according to congressional intent. The Committee notes
that reprogramming notifications must be submitted subject to the
regular notification procedures of the Committees on Appropria-
tions.
For the purposes of this Act and this Report, ‘‘regular notification
procedures’’ means notification must be provided at least 15 days
in advance of the obligation of funds.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND
RELATED PROGRAMS
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The Committee recommendation for Administration of Foreign
Affairs provides funds for the broad range of activities necessary to
support the operations and activities of more than 270 diplomatic
and consular posts in 191 countries. The Committee recommends

State in fiscal year 2026. Of the total amount provided,
$12,368,115,000 is appropriated as discretionary funds by this Act

$5,771,528,000 for embassy security, which is the same as the fis-
cal year 2025 enacted level and $27,180,000 above the fiscal year

The Committee recommendation includes $8,966,278,000 for Dip-
lomatic Programs, including $3,758,836,000 for Worldwide Security
Protection (WSP).
Worldwide Security Protection
The Committee recommendation includes $3,758,836,000 for
WSP, of which $723,187,000 is for Human Resources and
$3,035,649,000 is for Security Programs.
The WSP program provides funding for the protection of life,
property, and information of the Department of State and supports
a worldwide guard force protecting over 270 overseas diplomatic
posts, including missions, residences, and other facilities, and 150
domestic sites. Funds also support enhanced high-threat protection,
security technology, cyber and information security, secure diplo-
matic courier operations, and protective services for the Secretary
of State, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, and
foreign dignitaries visiting the United States.
Armored vehicles.—Funds provided for WSP are available for the
procurement of the materials and equipment to provide protection
for United States Government personnel serving in high-threat en-
vironments, including the replacement and modernization of ar-
mored vehicles that have reached the end of their useful life. The
Committee encourages the Secretary of State to support armored
vehicle fleet modernization, including consideration of the Heavy-
Duty Sport Utility Vehicle, and directs the Secretary to include in
the operating plan required by section 7062(a) of this Act informa-
tion on the armored vehicle procurement plan for fiscal year 2026.
Enhanced video analytics.—Within the funds provided, the Com-
mittee encourages the Secretary of State to consider implementa-
tion of a pilot program testing the use of enhanced video analytics.
The Department of State should include in the operating plan re-
quired by section 7062(a) plans for embassy security moderniza-
tion, including any plans for the use of enhanced video analytics.

Safety of locally employed staff.—The Committee recognizes that
locally employed staff provide essential contributions at United
States diplomatic and consular posts around the world. In emer-
gency situations, the Secretary of State should use funds made
available to the Department of State to provide support to ensure
the safety and security of locally employed staff and their imme-
diate family members.
Visa and passport fraud investigation.—The Committee supports
the work carried out by the Visa and Passport Analysis Branch
within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to protect the national
security of the United States through the continuous identification
of emergent threats to United States travel documents by improv-
ing the Investigative Management System (IMS) data enhance-
ment, analytics, and governance, in addition to other capabilities.
Further, the Committee recommendation includes additional fund-
ing above the prior year level to continue IMS upgrades and en-
hancements.
Other Matters
Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region.—The Committee sup-
ports the work of the Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region to
advance United States policy in the Arctic, including ongoing en-
gagements with counterparts in Arctic and non-Arctic nations.
Once confirmed, the Secretary of State shall include in the oper-
ating plan required by section 7062(a) of this Act planned staffing
and funding levels in support of the work of the Ambassador-at-
Large.
Artificial intelligence (AI) utilization.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall consult
with the Committees on Appropriations on plans to increase train-
ing on, and utilization of, AI tools within the Department of State
for increased efficiency as well as options to facilitate collaboration
between state and local government and key foreign sub-national
level governments on AI research projects and policies.
Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy.—The Committee recog-
nizes the growing importance of cybersecurity capacity building
and the need for personnel experienced in cybersecurity issues. The
Committee directs that funding be made available for the Bureau
of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and for strengthening efforts to
advance security in cyberspace.
Bureau of Medical Services.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment of State to allocate resources for the Bureau of Medical
Services to support an integrated telemedicine platform to increase
the capacity of the Bureau to deliver timely healthcare, create cost
savings, increase efficiency, and improve the quality and accuracy
of medical care. Adding an expanded capability that includes the
integration of biomedical devices and remotely guided specialty
care should further the Department’s goal of promoting and safe-
guarding the health and well-being of Chief of Mission personnel
and their families and improve the continuity of care for the diplo-
matic community.
Combating antisemitism.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant work of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semi-
tism and directs not less than $2,500,000 be made available for the
Office, as authorized by the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of

2004 (Public Law 108–332). The Committee remains concerned by
the lack of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions within the Office
of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism and its
impact on the stability and continuity of operations of the Office.
Further, the Committee encourages the Department of State to en-
sure that FTEs hired with this funding are adequately assigned
across offices, including the Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor
and Combat Anti-Semitism which plays a critical role in ensuring
the safety and security of Jewish communities around the world.
Countering PRC’s strategic advances in AI.—The Committee re-
mains concerned by the PRC’s strategic objective to overtake the
United States as the global leader in AI by 2030. Accordingly, the
Committee directs the Secretary of State, in coordination with rel-
evant national security and science agencies, to expand diplomatic
engagement with allies to counter PRC technology theft, promote
democratic principles in AI governance, and secure critical emerg-
ing technologies. The Committee further encourages interagency ef-
forts to strengthen intellectual property protection and build trust-
ed supply chains.
Department of State training programs and partnerships.—The
Committee supports ongoing partnerships to improve the United
States Foreign Service (Foreign Service) by preparing both grad-
uate and undergraduate students for positions in the Foreign Serv-
ice, including support for the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs
Fellowship and Charles B. Rangel International Affairs programs.
The Committee also supports continuation of Department pro-
grams authorized by section 9201 of the Department of State Au-
thorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117–263), the Foreign Affairs
Information Technology Fellowship, and the William D. Clarke, Sr.
Diplomatic Security Fellowship.
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.—The Com-
mittee directs support for the continued implementation of the
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Public Law
114–328).
Holocaust issues.—The Committee recommendation includes up
to $1,500,000 to continue the important work of the Office of Holo-
caust Issues to bring a measure of justice and assistance to Holo-
caust victims and their families and to ensure that the Holocaust
is remembered appropriately and accurately. The Committee ac-
knowledges the work of the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues and
urges the authorizing committees of jurisdiction to expeditiously
take action to expressly authorize such position.
Innovative procurement policies.—The Committee is concerned
that existing procurement policies and procedures may be inter-
fering with delivering mission critical support to government agen-
cies and the constituents they serve. As technology develops at a
rapid pace, traditional methods of procurement can hamper the
ability to respond to changing needs. The Committee encourages
the Department of State to make use of smaller, targeted procure-
ments that utilize alternative contracting approaches to increase
competition and innovation and reduce risk of contract non-per-
formance, including the application of generative AI to further that
goal. Further, the Committee encourages the Department to focus
on holding contractors accountable to measurable results and,
where appropriate, utilize pilot projects and open competition to

identify contractors that can most readily meet the needs of the De-
partment.
International religious freedom.—The Committee continues to
support the work of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Re-
ligious Freedom, as authorized by the International Religious Free-
dom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–292).
Language training.—The Committee supports efforts by the De-
partment of State to recruit and train Foreign Service Officers and
Civil Service employees with the knowledge and language skills
needed to advance United States policies toward countering malign
activities of the PRC.
Monitoring and combating trafficking in persons.—The Com-
mittee directs $25,000,000 for the Office to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking in Persons, as authorized by the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act of 2000, as amended, including to support the co-
ordination of the President’s Interagency Task Force and Senior
Policy Operating Group, deployment of rapid response teams, pro-
duction of the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, implementation
of child protection compacts, diplomatic engagement and technical
assistance, and management and oversight of assistance provided
by this Act to combat trafficking in persons.
The Committee continues to support the Office’s mission and role
to: coordinate, through the Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and
Combat Trafficking in Persons, anti-trafficking activities across the
United States Government; produce the annual TIP report; and ad-
minister grants to promote United States national security by pre-
venting trafficking, prosecuting traffickers, and protecting victims
in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000,
as amended. The annual TIP report is a vital tool in combating
human trafficking. The Committee directs the Department of State
to explore whether producing printed copies of the report would
further enhance its effectiveness.
The Committee also directs the Secretary of State to ensure the
Office has the staffing necessary to carry out the responsibilities
described under this heading. Finally, the Secretary is directed to
publicly post resources for victims of human trafficking, including
hotlines and websites, in all United States embassies and con-
sulates in areas where visa applications are processed.
Office of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues.—The Com-
mittee directs funding for the continued operation of the Office of
the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to carry out the respon-
sibilities detailed in section 21(d) of the Foreign Relations Author-
ization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107–228).
Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for the Abraham Ac-
cords.—The Committee directs not less than $1,500,000 for the Of-
fice of the Special Presidential Envoy for the Abraham Accords, as
authorized by section 6407 of the Department of State Authoriza-
tion Act of 2023 (division F of Public Law 118–31).
Sanctions coordination and counter threat financing.—The Com-
mittee directs that funding be continued for staff dedicated to sanc-
tions implementation, coordination, and counter threat financing
and that particular focus be given to the Western Hemisphere. The
Committee directs that the operating plan required by section
7062(a) of this Act include the projected budget and staffing level

for the Office of Global Sanctions and Threat Finance and the Of-
fice of Policy and Implementation.
Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.—The Committee
continues to support the work of the Special Presidential Envoy for
Hostage Affairs, as authorized by the Robert Levinson Hostage Re-
covery and Hostage Taking Accountability Act (division FF, title
III, subtitle A of Public Law 116–260), which leads and coordinates
United States diplomatic engagements on overseas hostage-related
matters.
Study of international child abduction.—The Committee directs
that $1,000,000 be made available to carry out the study author-
ized by Section 202 of the Sean and David Goldman International
Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C.
9122).
Technology.—The Committee recognizes the need for education of
United States diplomats in technology diplomacy and urges the De-
partment of State to establish a training program to enable the ad-
vancement of freedom through trusted technology. The Secretary of
State should consider partnering with academic and other entities
with expertise in providing research and training to policymakers,
diplomats, and other key stakeholders on technologies critical to
United States foreign policy and national security interests.
Youth.—The Committee recognizes that youth represent almost a
quarter of the global population living in areas affected by conflict
and that prioritizing programming involving youth advances
United States national security interests, creates new markets, un-
dermines terrorist recruitment efforts, and promotes more durable
peace and stability. The Committee encourages the Secretary of
State to consider designating an experienced official within the Of-
fice of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs who will advise re-
gional bureaus on the incorporation of youth into United States
diplomatic and development initiatives and coordinate youth policy
within the Department of State.
Reports
Arctic.—The Committee commends efforts by the Secretary of
State to prioritize the United States Arctic Strategy and encour-
ages the Secretary to build on the Arctic strategy with expanded
diplomatic engagement with Arctic partners. Not later than 90
days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a re-
port to the appropriate congressional committees on United States
diplomatic priorities for the Arctic. The report should include stra-
tegic and security goals, plans to include all allied Arctic countries
in achieving United States interests in the Arctic, and how the De-
partment of State is working with other Federal agencies to
achieve those objectives.
Foreign adversaries.—The Committee is concerned that foreign
adversaries and affiliated non-state actors are conducting influence
campaigns featuring antisemitic symbols graffitied in public places,
antisemitic social media content, and threats made against Jewish
entities. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on any known incidents of such activities taking
place within the last calendar year, and whether, to what extent,
and to what end, foreign adversaries and affiliated non-state actors

ner, including the specific narratives, techniques, and organizations
targeted in these campaigns.
Indigenous engagement.—Not later than 90 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall update the report on inter-
national Indigenous persons engagement and diplomacy required
under this heading in House Report 118–146.
Presidential permit processing.—The Committee is concerned
that protracted review timelines and insufficient interagency co-
ordination have hampered efforts to improve and expand critical
infrastructure at United States land ports of entry. The Committee
directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with relevant inter-
agency partners, to review the process for evaluating and approv-
ing Presidential permits. Not later than 180 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committees
on Appropriations describing the review and recommendations for
steps to expedite permitting, ensure transparency for applicants,
and align permit reviews with national infrastructure priorities.
Funds for certain offices, advisors, and coordinators are allocated
in accordance with the following table, subject to sections 7015 and

The Committee recommendation makes available $517,000,000
in budget authority for Consular and Border Security Programs
from passport application and execution fees. The additional budget
authority is provided to increase operational capacity to reduce
wait times; address increased demand for passport, visa, and
United States citizen services; and accelerate the passport mod-
ernization system and other modernization efforts already under-
way.
Revenues from the Department of State’s retained consular fees
and surcharges are deposited into the Consular and Border Secu-
rity Programs account. Each consular fee or surcharge is used to
fund authorized consular activities, such as passport and visa proc-
essing and adjudication, fraud prevention and detection, and serv-
ices for American citizens overseas.
The Committee supports the Secretary of State’s commitment to
dedicate sufficient resources to ensure passport and visa applica-

tions are processed timely and efficiently to prevent unnecessary
delays affecting the public, including through the online passport
renewal program. The Committee directs the Department of State
to continue proactively seeking technological and procedural alter-
natives to streamline the processes where possible to enhance con-
sular services domestically and overseas. The Committee urges the
Secretary to put together a strategy outlining definitive steps to
improve coordination between passport agencies, ensure the timely
processing of passports, and avoid duplicates. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary to make every effort to use commercially avail-
able off-the-shelf technology and best practices to expedite the
passport issuance process, including identity authentication, while
protecting the integrity of the passport process, the privacy of pass-
port applicants, and the efficiency of processing passport issuance
requests. The Committee further requests that the Secretary en-
sure that Congressional offices receive timely updates to con-
stituent requests.
The Committee recommends that the Department of State pre-
pare to increase the capacity to process a wide range of tourist-re-
lated visas in advance of numerous high-profile sporting events
over the next several years.
The Committee notes that sections 7304, 7507, and 7508 of Pub-
lic Law 118–159 require significant reforms to the passport
issuance system. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
take all necessary steps to comply with the timelines described in
these sections, particularly timely submission of the interim action
plan described in section 7508(b)(3).
The Committee is aware of states, territories, and communities
that lack local access to passport agencies and passport acceptance
facilities. The Committee directs the Department of State to regu-
larly examine and identify high-demand, high-travel areas that
lack local, convenient access to passport agencies or acceptance fa-
cilities, which are essential for supporting residents’ travel and for
boosting the tourism economy. The Department should then assess
the most effective methods for supporting the establishment of
passport agencies or acceptance facilities to better support these
communities and travel hubs with timely, accessible passport serv-
ices.
The Committee directs the Department of State to improve agen-
cy customer experience, particularly regarding passport and visa
services. The Committee further urges the Department to ensure
that standards to measure and improve customer experience are in
place and are incorporated into the performance plans required
under 31 U.S.C. 1115.
The Committee recognizes the critical role temporary work visa
programs play in supporting key sectors of the United States econ-
omy. The Committee is concerned about ongoing delays in the proc-
essing of work visas and encourages the Department of State to
prioritize the timely adjudication of visa categories essential to fill-
ing urgent workforce gaps. The Committee directs the Department
to take all necessary steps to ensure the expeditious processing of
H–2A and H–2B visas. In addition, the Committee urges the De-
partment to improve processing of nonimmigrant visa categories
that allow employers in the United States to temporarily employ
high-skilled talent in critical sectors. The Committee further urges

The Committee encourages the Secretary of State to continue to
address the years of backlog of families of Special Immigrant Visa
(SIV) holders.

Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate
congressional committees on the plans underway to address the in-

clude the average costs to adoption service providers for accredita-
tion (including all fees paid to the accrediting entities to obtain and
maintain accreditation, including but not limited to site visits and
other travel fees) per year. The report shall include the total
amount of money each accrediting entity received, per year, per ac-
crediting entity, from adoption service providers. The report shall
also include a full list of fiscal year 2025 Department of State per-
sonnel in the Adoption Division of the Office of Children’s Issues,
including the number of staff with professional experience working
in the field of adoption before employment by the Department of
State.
Visa wait times.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
the timely processing of visas to the United States economy. The
Committee acknowledges that the Bureau of Consular Affairs has
made attempts to decrease wait times by employing critical tech-
nology, shifting resources between consulates, and improving trans-
parency, and believes significant additional efforts should be under-
taken to make the United States competitive in the market for pro-
spective travelers, including for appropriately vetted international
student applicants. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act, and on a quarterly basis thereafter until September 30, 2027,
the Secretary of State is directed to report to the appropriate con-
gressional committees on: (1) visa wait times; (2) the steps taken
to further reduce visa backlogs; and (3) the plan to reduce wait
times for visa processing.

tion, and maintenance of United States diplomatic facilities over-
seas.
The Secretary of State shall promptly inform the Committees on
Appropriations of Federal agencies that are delinquent in fulfilling

State in fiscal year 2026 for operations, maintenance, and construc-
tion and an accounting of the actual and anticipated proceeds of
sales or gifts for all projects in fiscal year 2025.
Operations.—The Committee recommendation includes
$812,836,000 for Operations, which provides support for the five
major organizational components of the Bureau of Overseas Build-
ings Operations: Planning and Real Estate; Program Development,
Coordination and Support; Construction, Facility and Security
Management; Operations; Resource Management; Domestic Ren-
ovations; and Minor Construction and Improvement of diplomatic
facilities.
Pacific Islands embassies.—Funds appropriated under this head-
ing are available to bolster security for embassies in the Indo-Pa-
cific region and to establish and maintain diplomatic facilities in
the Pacific Islands, as authorized by the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263). This in-
cludes the damaged embassy in Vanuatu, post establishment ef-
forts in Kiribati, and ongoing upgrades to posts in the Freely Asso-
ciated States. The Secretary of State is directed to develop a com-
prehensive plan to bolster, assess, modernize, and secure diplo-
matic facilities in PICs. This plan should address both existing and
planned facilities and include evaluations of structural conditions,
emergency preparedness, cybersecurity, and the capacity to support
increased interagency and classified engagement. Particular atten-
tion should be paid to ensuring the adequacy of telecommuni-
cations infrastructure, including secure and classified communica-
tions systems critical to mission operations.
Reports
Contingency savings.—The Committee understands, based on in-
formation included in notifications received in prior years, that the
Department of State has contingency savings on previously appro-
priated construction projects. The Committee directs the Secretary
of State to continue to submit a report to the Committees on Ap-
propriations at the end of each fiscal quarter on such contingency
savings.
Pacific Islands diplomatic infrastructure.—Not later than 120
days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the condition,
security, and functionality of embassy and consular facilities across
the Pacific Islands region. The report shall include: (1) a facility-
by-facility assessment of physical conditions, security
vulnerabilities, and technology infrastructure across both current
and planned diplomatic posts in the Pacific Islands; (2) a
prioritized list of maintenance, construction, and security upgrades,
including timelines and cost estimates; (3) an analysis of opportuni-

ment to the American Institute in Taiwan. The Committee rec-
ommendation supports operating expenses of the American Insti-
tute in Taiwan (AIT), and funds may also be made available for
special projects and consular upgrades, including support for the
Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF).
The Taiwan Relations Act requires that programs concerning
Taiwan be carried out by the AIT and authorizes funds to be appro-
priated to the Secretary of State to carry out the provisions of this
Act. The AIT administers programs in the areas of economic and
commercial services, cultural affairs, travel services, and logistics.
The Department of State contracts with the AIT to carry out these
activities.
Taiwan Fellowship Program.—The Committee recommendation
includes funds to support the Taiwan Fellowship Program and di-
rects the Secretary of State to implement the program expedi-
tiously.

The Committee recommendation includes $310,200,000 for Con-
tributions to International Organizations.
Funds made available under this heading are allocated according
to the following table and are subject to the requirements of sec-
tions 7015 and 7062 of this Act:
CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
[Budget authority in thousands of dollars]
Program/Activity Budget Authority
International Atomic Energy Agency .......................................................................................... $115,900
International Civil Aviation Organization ................................................................................... 19,800

International Telecommunication Union..................................................................................... 13,900

NATO Parliamentary Assembly ................................................................................................... 796
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ............................................................ 18,100
Organization of American States ............................................................................................... 46,504
The Committee recommendation does not include funding for as-
sessed contributions for certain United Nations agencies and other
international organizations, including the United Nations regular
budget. The Committee also prohibits funds to the World Health
Organization (WHO), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA), and other organizations under section 7048 of this Act.
The Committee remains concerned with the continued lack of
progress toward meaningful reforms at the United Nations. Such
reforms, at a minimum, should include increased fiscal trans-
parency; meaningful consequences for sexual misconduct by United
Nations officials and peacekeepers; protections for whistleblowers;
efforts to combat antisemitism and anti-Israel bias; and holding
member states accountable for undermining international security.
Reforms must also address due process and accountability within
the United States justice system for the mass atrocities carried out
by staff of UNRWA and supported by UNRWA leadership over the
past decade, including through the provision of material support
and partnership with designated terrorist organizations that con-
tributed to the October 7, 2023 attacks. The Committee strongly
condemns the United Nations General Assembly for undermining
peace and security between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples by
passing the ‘‘Status of Palestine in the United Nations’’ resolution
that provided the ‘‘State of Palestine’’ almost all the rights and
privileges of Member States. The Committee has concluded that
further assessed contributions to the United Nations are not justi-
fied and increased scrutiny and oversight must predicate any con-
sideration of a voluntary contribution to the United Nations or any
United Nations agency. The Committee provides additional direc-
tion on the United Nations in section 7048 of this report.
International Energy Agency.—The Committee finds that the
International Energy Agency, housed within the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has strayed from
its core mission of ensuring global energy security. The Committee
finds that the Agency has abandoned objectivity in the critical en-
ergy-supply information it produces and, instead, has pursued po-
liticized information to support climate policy advocacy. This well-
documented shift by the Agency undermines decision-making by
policymakers and threatens energy security and the economic in-

terests of the United States. Accordingly, the Committee provides
no funding in this Act for the International Energy Agency.
OECD.—The Committee recommendation does not include fund-
ing for assessed contributions to the OECD. The Committee does
not support the work of the OECD that promotes higher tax rates,
corporate tax floors, and digital tax schemes that target American
taxpayers.
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).—The Committee
recommendation does not include funding for PAHO. The Com-
mittee remains deeply concerned about PAHO’s prior involvement
in the trafficking of Cuban doctors and medical personnel under
the former Mais Me´dicos program in Brazil and expects PAHO to
fully account for its role in such program prior to receiving Amer-
ican tax dollars. This includes cooperating with ongoing litigation
in United States courts under the Trafficking Victims Protection
Act of 2000, as amended, and providing compensation in any re-
sulting judgments. PAHO must publish all relevant financial
records and contracts, including an assessment of whether such
contracts complied with local and international labor standards.
Additionally, PAHO must release internal analyses of its oper-
ational, administrative, and financial role in the Mais Me´dicos pro-
gram. These requirements also apply to any other programs involv-
ing Cuban medical professionals in which PAHO played a facili-
tating role. The Committee notes that claims of functional immu-
nity should not preclude accountability for any actions by PAHO of-
ficials that directly or indirectly facilitated human trafficking.
Reproductive health and family planning.—The Committee re-
mains deeply concerned by United Nations entities that consider
abortion as a foundational component of comprehensive health
care, sexual and reproductive rights, and reproductive health and
family planning resources by their own organizational definitions.
In the context of constrained resources, the Committee must be as-
sured, prior to supporting funds, that multilateral organizations
comply with statutory prohibitions and requirements related to
abortion included in this Act and prior acts.
WHO.—Section 7048(l)(1) prohibits funds appropriated by this
Act from being made available to the WHO. The WHO’s credibility
has been severely undermined by its failure to hold the PRC ac-
countable for obstructing transparency during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, including suppressing early warnings from Taiwan and de-
laying international investigations. The Committee endorses Exec-
utive Order 14155, relating to Withdrawing the United States
From the World Health Organization, signed on January 20, 2025,
which directs the withdrawal of the United States from the WHO
due to the organization’s persistent mismanagement of global
health crises, its lack of accountability, and its susceptibility to in-
appropriate political influence by certain member states. The Com-
mittee remains deeply concerned by the WHO’s reluctance to con-
demn the PRC’s actions, its shift away from core communicable dis-
ease functions, and adoption of deeply biased, anti-Israel resolu-
tions that perpetuate harmful and historically antisemitic nar-
ratives.

Reports
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of United States leadership in
ICAO in advancing global aviation safety and security. The Com-
mittee provides funding for the United States assessed contribution
under this heading and recommends that the Secretary of State
convene an interagency effort to ensure United States engagement
aligns with national security and domestic transportation prior-
ities. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act on priorities for ICAO engagement dur-
ing fiscal year 2026 and how United States funding will support
such priorities.
United Nations credits.—Not later than May 1, 2026, and 30
days after the end of fiscal year 2026, the Secretary of State shall
report to the Committees on Appropriations on any credits attrib-
utable to the United States, including from the United Nations Tax
Equalization Fund. The Secretary shall also provide updated fiscal
year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 United States assessments to the
United Nations Regular Budget and other international organiza-
tions, including any available credits and updated foreign currency
exchange rates, and indicate whether credits have been applied to
any assessed contributions or payment of arrearages.
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES

Change from enacted level ............................................................. ¥671,825,000
Change from request ...................................................................... +562,319,000
The Committee recommendation includes $562,319,000 for Con-
tributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The Com-
mittee recommends reduced funding for Contributions for Inter-
national Peacekeeping Activities to give the Secretary of State dis-
cretion to support missions, using funds subject to the 25 percent
statutory cap on peacekeeping assessments, that are effective and
aligned with United States national security interests, while with-
holding funding from missions that are ineffective or associated
with repeated cases of sexual abuse. The Committee urges stronger
oversight of peacekeeping performance, mandate relevance, and ac-
countability for troop-contributing countries whose personnel com-
mit abuses, including withholding reimbursements in order to sup-
port victims and encouraging enforcement of consequences.
Oversight.—The Committee supports independent oversight of
the United Nations to identify waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as
sexual abuse in peacekeeping operations, and the Committee sup-
ports reforms to ensure that such practices are eliminated. The
Committee expects the Department of State to increase oversight
of United Nations peacekeeping missions which must include more
effective mechanisms to ensure perpetrators are tracked and troop
contributing countries are held accountable, and victims receive
justice and support. The Committee provides additional direction
on United Nations peacekeeping in section 7048 of this report.

otherwise made available under this heading, the United States
Commissioner of the IBWC shall brief the Committees on Appro-
priations on the scope, timeline, and cost of such programs and
projects.
Amistad Dam repairs and modernization.—The Committee recog-
nizes the strategic importance of Amistad Dam—the largest inter-
national storage dam and reservoir on the Rio Grande—in sup-
porting flood control, water conservation, and hydroelectric power
generation. The Committee applauds efforts by the IBWC to repair
critical infrastructure at the Amistad Dam, including addressing
sinkholes and mitigating seepage. The Committee urges the IBWC
to prioritize and expeditiously complete these repairs to ensure
long-term dam safety and operational reliability.
Economic impact study.—Not later than 120 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the
United States Commissioner of the IBWC, shall submit a report to

Release of effluent.—The Committee remains concerned about the
adverse impact on communities in the United States from the re-
lease of effluent from Mexico, including from the Tijuana River.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State and the United
States Commissioner of the IBWC to continue engaging with the
Government of Mexico to take appropriate steps to facilitate long-
term solutions. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Commissioner shall update the report required under this
heading in House Report 118–146.
Water deliveries.—The Committee directs the Department of
State, in coordination with the IBWC, to implement the 1944
Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico in a manner
that assures reliable, annual water flow from Mexico to the United
States. It is critical for the agrarian economy that South Texas
farmers receive reliable, annual water flow from the Rio Grande in
accordance with the Treaty. The Committee notes that section
7045(h) of this Act includes limitations with respect to water deliv-
eries to the United States from Mexico.

The Committee notes that funds provided for the Inter-American
Tropical Tuna Commission are included in the table under Other
Marine Conservation Organizations.
Great Lakes Fishery Commission.—The Committee directs
$54,830,000 be made available for the Great Lakes Fishery Com-
mission (GLFC), including funds for the Commission to address
risks to its programs, fund its infrastructure strategy, control the
invasive sea lamprey, conduct science and research to aid cross-bor-
der fishery management, and control grass carp in the Great
Lakes. The amount includes not less than $1,000,000 to address
grass carp in the Great Lakes and $10,500,000 to continue support
for the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins and the
Lake Memphremagog fishery.
The Committee supports the steps being taken by GLFC to up-
date the Commission’s infrastructure plan, including the precise
assessment of annual Canadian infrastructure costs. It is critical to
the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem that the United States
and Canada continue to maintain and improve their respective in-
frastructure, which provides significant benefits to each country’s
economy. The Committee expects that Federal agencies adhere to

Section 4:
section 11 of the Great Lakes Fishery Act of 1956, including work-
ing with any and all duly appointed Commission staff. The Com-
mittee further directs that the GLFC take all appropriate steps to
ensure that the Convention mandate of the GLFC is executed fully
and in an efficient and timely manner. This includes a directive to
ensure sea lamprey control remains a priority Great Lakes pro-
gram as previously designated by the Committee.
Pacific Salmon Commission.—The Committee directs $6,500,000
for the Pacific Salmon Commission. Funds will support the United
States share of joint Commission expenses and enable the imple-
mentation of agreed stock management measures, including test
fishing needed to monitor the size and distribution of the various
salmon stocks.
International Pacific Halibut Commission economic impact
study.—Not later than 120 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State, in coordination with the United States Commis-
sioners of the International Pacific Halibut Commission, shall sub-
mit to the Committees on Appropriations a report consisting of a
comprehensive economic impact study on Pacific halibut. Such re-
port shall include the impact, including a sector-level analysis, of
Pacific halibut on the economies of the United States and Canada.

TITLE III—BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT
GLOBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS
Fiscal year 2025 enacted level........................................................... $10,030,450,000
Fiscal year 2026 request .................................................................... 3,797,000,000
Committee recommendation .............................................................. 9,518,712,000
Change from enacted level ............................................................. ¥511,738,000
Change from request ...................................................................... +5,721,712,000
The Committee recommendation includes $9,518,712,000 for
Global Health Programs.
Investments in global health programming are a fundamental
pillar of America’s national security agenda. It makes America
safer by supporting early detection and protection from dangerous
outbreaks of infectious diseases and by improving health infra-
structure to bolster prevention, preparedness, and response to
chronic and emergent health needs. It makes America stronger and
more prosperous by strengthening global economic stability, as well
as social cohesion, and unleashes American ingenuity in creating
medicines, treatment, technology, manufacturing, health education,
and more. Effective global health programs save and improve lives,
stabilize and secure international trade and global supply chains,
and accelerate prosperity at home and around the world.
Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.—The Committee in-
cludes language in section 7057(b) of this Act prohibiting funds for
any foreign nongovernmental organization that promotes or per-
forms abortion, with certain exceptions.
In addition, the Committee recommendation includes conditions
under this heading that do the following: (1) require that none of
the funds appropriated by this Act, or any unobligated balances,
may be made available to any organization or program, which as
determined by the President, supports or participates in the man-
agement of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary steriliza-
tion; (2) state that funds cannot be used to pay for the performance
of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce
any person to practice abortion; (3) specify that population funds
shall be available only to voluntary family planning projects that
offer, either directly or through referral, information about access
to a broad range of family planning methods and services; (4) re-
quire that in awarding grants for natural family planning under

Section 6:
section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, no applicant
shall be discriminated against because of such applicant’s religious
or conscientious commitment to offer only natural family planning;
and (5) require the provision of accurate information related to
condoms.
The Committee remains significantly concerned over the viola-
tion of the Helms Amendment under the previous Administration.
Therefore, the Secretary of State is directed to review guidance for
the Department of State, as well as for implementing partners,
with respect to the application of requirements under Global
Health Programs, section 7018, and section 7057 of this Act, to en-
sure full compliance with such requirements. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary to conduct stringent oversight to ensure full ad-
herence to requirements in law. The Committee expects that guid-

ance and training associated with such requirements will ensure
full awareness and compliance by implementing partners. The
Committee directs the Secretary to consult with the appropriate
congressional committees, not later than 30 days after enactment
of this Act, on additional staff, training, guidance, and regulations
to address compliance.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

Childhood cancer.—Funds appropriated under title III of this Act
may be made available for public-private partnerships, including in
coordination with relevant multilateral organizations and research
entities, to address childhood cancer. The Secretary of State is di-
rected to consult with the appropriate congressional committees not
later than 60 days after enactment of this Act on uses of funds for
such partnerships.
Diagnostics.—The Committee recognizes that accurate and swift
diagnostics are crucial for the early detection and containment of
infectious diseases of pandemic potential and a key part of the
global health security program. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to make funds available from its global health secu-
rity programming for the development of diagnostics for pathogens
of pandemic potential consistent with the limitations of section
7058(d).
Frontline health workers.—The Committee recognizes the key
role of frontline health workers in effective global health programs
and encourages support for frontline workers, particularly at the
community level, as part of existing efforts to combat infectious dis-
eases, prevent maternal and child deaths, and improve global
health outcomes.
Global health security.—The Committee supports continued ef-
forts to promote global health security, address emerging health
threats overseas, and prevent future pandemics, including support
to strengthen laboratory and surveillance capabilities.
The Committee remains concerned by the continuing commercial
trade in and markets for live wildlife for the purpose of human con-
sumption and the risk posed to global health. The Committee notes
the risks of zoonotic spillover posed by greater human contact with

wildlife and supports efforts to address threats posed by certain
wildlife markets and prioritize surveillance and spillover preven-
tion in global health security programs.
The Committee supports funding for the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations, at levels consistent with prior fiscal
years, to address emerging infectious diseases, deadly viruses, and
other pathogenic threats pursuant to section 6501 of Public Law
117–81. Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on the amount to be made available.
HIV/AIDS.—The Committee recommendation includes a new re-
quirement in section 7058(e) directing the Secretary of State to
submit a strategy on PEPFAR transition to gradually and respon-
sibly reduce United States funding for HIV/AIDS abroad through
the use of country transition plans, while prioritizing the safety
and health of beneficiaries.
The Committee commends the efforts of the Department of State
to support public-private partnerships expanding cervical cancer
screening and treatment for women living with HIV. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to brief the Committees on
Appropriations not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act
on a proposal to transition from visual inspection with acetic acid
(VIA) to molecular testing for high-risk human papillomavirus
(HPV) as the primary screening method.
The Committee supports the scale-up of long-acting injectable
antiretrovirals to reduce HIV transmission, expedite country tran-
sition from donor support, and lower costs. The Committee encour-
ages the Department of State to prioritize these technologies in
high-burden countries.
The Committee recommendation includes $1,500,000,000 for the
eighth replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber-
culosis and Malaria (Global Fund). The Committee commends the
efforts of the Global Fund to transition countries to fully funding
and implementing health programs independent of Global Fund
support. Oversight of the Global Fund remains a top priority, as
well as continued support for an independent Office of the Inspec-
tor General.
The Committee recommends continued support for microbicide
development and directs the Department of State to coordinate
with other Federal research agencies and donors to expedite
microbicide development and implementation.
Innovative technologies.—The Committee supports investments
in research, development, and introduction of innovative tech-
nologies related to child survival, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuber-
culosis (TB).
Neglected surgical conditions.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to support efforts to strengthen surgical health ca-
pacity to address such health issues as cleft lip and cleft palate,
club foot, cataracts, hernias, obstetric fistulas, untreated traumatic
injuries, and access to safe cesarean sections in underserved areas
in developing countries, including in regions without water or elec-
tricity. Strengthening surgical health systems includes the training
of local surgical teams, anesthesia teams, and assisting ministries
of health to develop and implement national surgical, obstetric,
trauma, and anesthesia plans. Not later than 90 days after enact-

ment of this Act, the Secretary shall brief the Committees on Ap-
propriations on the planned uses of funds for these purposes in fis-
cal year 2026.
Neglected tropical diseases.—The Committee supports continued
funding to treat neglected tropical diseases and the coordination of
neglected tropical disease programs with complementary develop-
ment and global health programs, including water, sanitation, and
hygiene.
Noncommunicable disease interventions.—The Committee sup-
ports efforts to decentralize and enhance the care for severe non-
communicable diseases, including among children and young adults
in sub-Saharan Africa, at first-level referral health facilities, in-
cluding through partnerships to improve diagnosis, treatment, and
training.
Nutrition.—The Committee supports effective nutrition interven-
tions and expects not less than 50 percent of nutrition funding be
devoted to the most cost-effective and evidence-based nutrition
interventions, including American-made Ready-to-Use Therapeutic
Foods (RUTF), breastfeeding support, prenatal vitamins, and vita-
min A supplementation.
RUTF.—The Committee notes the increase in cases of child wast-
ing globally and the shortage of therapeutic food treatments.
Therefore, the Committee also directs not less than $300,000,000
under title III of this Act be made available for American-made
RUTF. The Committee directs that RUTF already procured for
emergency responses be distributed quickly, prioritizing areas of
greatest need and taking expiration dates into account to avoid
waste.
Reproductive health and voluntary family planning.—Section
7058 of this Act includes a limitation of not more than
$461,000,000 for reproductive health and voluntary family plan-
ning programs funded by this Act.
Vulnerable children.—The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment of State to continue to align existing programs for vulnerable
children with the goals and objectives of the United States Govern-
ment Strategy on Advancing Protection and Care for Children in
Adversity and ensure that orphans and vulnerable children remain
a priority within PEPFAR country programs.
Reports
Disadvantaged geographies.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to submit a report to the appropriate congressional
committees not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on
how much of the assistance provided under bilateral Global Health
Programs during fiscal year 2024 was used to provide health serv-
ices to sub-national populations with an under-five mortality rate
higher than 80/1000 live births.
Health systems.—The Secretary of State shall submit a report to
the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 90 days after en-
actment of this Act, detailing progress on health systems strength-
ening activities. The report should include a description of how the
Department of State is designing efforts by operating unit, includ-
ing Washington-based programming, and the expected result on
improved performance of country health systems. Such report shall
also include how such investments result in country ownership

through decreased reliance on United States funding. Not later
than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Committees on Ap-

HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria treatments.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a

provided in fiscal year 2024. Such report shall include details on
funds expended to achieve such outcomes.
Oversight of implementing partners.—The Committee continues
to support rigorous monitoring and oversight of all uses of funds
provided under Global Health Programs, including full compliance
with statutory prohibitions on United States assistance and restric-
tions related to abortion included in this Act and prior acts. Not
later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations
listing all prime and sub-partners that received funds for global
health activities in fiscal year 2025. The report shall be
disaggregated by global health program and include, for each part-
ner, the amount of funding received, the activity description and
purpose, and the country or region for such activity. The sub-part-
ner information shall indicate the prime partner for each activity.
Preventing childhood deaths.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to include in annual maternal and child health re-
porting the amount spent each year on highest-impact, evidence-
based child health interventions in bilateral global health pro-
grams, disaggregated by intervention and outcomes achieved as a
result of United States assistance. The report shall include an ac-
counting of interventions provided, including treatment, for (1)
childhood pneumonia, (2) malaria, (3) diarrheal dehydration, (4) se-
vere acute malnutrition, (5) immunizations, (6) azithromycin provi-
sion, and (7) neonatal sepsis. The report shall also include an esti-
mation of funds expended to support the outcomes for each inter-
vention and the approximate number of mothers and infants who
received postnatal care within two days of childbirth as a result of
such assistance.

The Committee recommendation includes $5,000,000,000 for
International Humanitarian Assistance. Funding under this head-
ing is for life-saving humanitarian assistance and includes funding
and authorities previously made available under International Dis-
aster Assistance and Migration and Refugee Assistance.
This consolidated account will fund humanitarian relief, rehabili-
tation, and reconstruction in countries affected by natural and
man-made disasters, as well as support for disaster mitigation, dis-
aster risk reduction, prevention, and preparedness, and may not be
used to support climate change programs. This includes the pur-
chase of commodities, such as temporary shelter, blankets, and
supplementary and therapeutic food; potable water; medical sup-
plies; and agricultural rehabilitation. Program beneficiaries include
disaster victims, conflict victims, and internally displaced persons.
Funds are also provided for the Emergency Food Security Program,
as authorized in the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law
114–195). The majority of funds will support assistance for refugees
and other displaced people overseas with the goal of providing such
assistance as close to their countries of origin as possible until they
can safely and voluntarily return home.
Air transport.—The Committee recognizes the need to provide
swift humanitarian aid to save lives and ease suffering in the im-
mediate aftermath of a disaster. The Committee encourages the
Department of State to assess the efficacy of air drop technology
for large-scale humanitarian aid delivery for quicker response time.
Child protection.—The Committee recognizes the need for addi-
tional protection of children in conflict and crisis settings. The
Committee encourages the Secretary of State to play an increasing
leadership role to protect children in humanitarian crises and en-
sure that protection is integrated across other humanitarian sec-
tors, as applicable, consistent with the Global Child Thrive Act
(Public Law 116–283).
RUTF.—The Committee supports the allocation of funds under
this heading to increase the use of RUTF to save lives in emer-
gency food response. Further direction regarding the procurement
of RUTF is under Global Health Programs.

The Committee recommendation includes $6,890,170,000 for Na-
tional Security Investment Programs. The National Security In-
vestment Programs account consolidates bilateral economic assist-
ance accounts funded under prior acts making appropriations for
the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs
into a single account. Funds are appropriated to the National Secu-
rity Investment Programs account for necessary expenses to carry
out the provisions of: sections 103, 105, 106, 214, and sections 251
through 255, and chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961, chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
the FREEDOM Support Act (Public Law 102–511), and the Support
for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (Public Law
101–179).
In determining the allocation of funds made available under this
heading, the Secretary of State shall consider a recipient partner
country’s cooperation on United States priorities such as migration
issues, opposing foreign adversaries, burden sharing, and United
Nations votes.
Funds appropriated under this heading shall be allocated strate-
gically for programs that support United States national security
interests. In addition to specific geographic priorities, funds appro-
priated under this heading will fund key national security initia-
tives including programs related to economic resilience (section
7030), democracy (section 7032), international religious freedom
(section 7033), countering the flow of fentanyl and other synthetic
drugs (section 7036), women’s equality and empowerment (section
7059), education, conservation, food security and agricultural devel-
opment, combating trafficking in persons, and water and sanitation
(section 7060).
The Committee views recent changes with respect to the provi-
sion of United States foreign assistance as an opportunity to em-
brace innovative solutions for implementing programs that are in
the national security interest of the United States. The Committee
encourages the Secretary of State to consider implementing mile-
stone-based funding for innovative, cost-effective, and scalable ap-
proaches to development challenges in the United States national
interest, focusing on emerging technologies and evidence-based so-
lutions with a clear path to long-term financial sustainability.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

Congo and the Republic of Rwanda. Funds under this heading
should be used to support economic integration and investments in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda through conflict
recovery programs, with a focus on sectors vital to the national se-
curity of the United States, such as mining and critical minerals.
These investments, which should align with the June 2025 agree-
ment, support United States national security objectives and ad-
vance United States strategic interests by securing access to essen-
tial resources and promoting regional stability through responsible
development.

Cooperative development programs.—The Committee recognizes
the important role that United States cooperatives and credit
unions play in overseas programs to lift low-income people out of
poverty through their own efforts and resources by mobilizing eq-
uity and savings for durable community-based economic growth.
Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on
use of funds under this heading for cooperative development pro-
grams.
Countering the flow of fentanyl.—The Committee notes the ur-
gency of stopping fentanyl and other drugs from entering the
United States and supports the aggressive action by the Depart-
ment of State to respond to these deadly threats. Funds appro-
priated under this heading shall be used for programs to counter
the flow of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and other synthetic drugs
into the United States. Such programs shall be coordinated with
the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL)
Affairs in order to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. Additional
funds for this purpose are made available under International Nar-
cotics Control and Law Enforcement.
Cybersecurity capacity building.—The Committee directs that
funds under this heading be used to strengthen cybersecurity capa-
bilities in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Peru to counter
cyber threats, particularly from the PRC, in order to support demo-
cratic partners aligned with United States interests, including
those that recognize Taiwan, and help safeguard critical infrastruc-
ture.
Deepening strategic alliances in the Western Hemisphere.—Funds
under this heading should be used to support economic cooperation
with key democratic allies in the Western Hemisphere, including
Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru whose shared
commitment to free markets and open trade furthers regional sta-
bility and United States prosperity. Such funds should support pro-
grams that modernize energy systems, enhance infrastructure, and
support transparent governance to foster strong economies aligned
with United States strategic objectives.
Indo-Pacific.—The Committee directs that funds under this
heading be prioritized for countries and programs in the Indo-Pa-
cific to counter the malign influence of the PRC.
Jordan.—Section 7041(d)(1) directs not less than $1,650,000,000
be made available for Jordan from funds under titles III and IV,
including not less than $845,100,000 for budget support for the
Government of Jordan from funds under this heading. Section 7041
(d)(2) provides an additional $400,000,000 of funds appropriated
under this heading for Jordan to respond to extraordinary needs
resulting from the prolonged conflict in the Middle East. Jordan is
a key United States partner that provides indispensable support
for United States interests in the Middle East. Ensuring Jordan’s
stability, including through investments in water infrastructure, is
important to United States national security.
Microenterprise and microfinance.—The Committee supports mi-
croenterprise and microfinance programs to promote economic de-
velopment and urges the Secretary of State to look for ways to fur-
ther advance economic growth, including identifying financial and
employment opportunities, in communities throughout the devel-

available under this heading, not less than $5,000,000 shall be
made available to support evidence-based programs that assess the
implementation of peace agreements and peace accords using im-
partial methodologies and diverse information sources. The Com-
mittee notes that impartial standards and methodologies for meas-
uring the progress of peace in post-conflict settings by gathering in-
formation from public, private, and nongovernmental entities pro-
vide a valuable tool for the Department in assessing and moni-
toring peace accords and processes.
Philippines.—The Committee recommendation includes support
for the longstanding alliance between the United States and the
Republic of the Philippines, including continued development co-
operation on shared strategic priorities. The Committee directs
funds be made available to support projects related to: energy secu-
rity and critical infrastructure; strengthening information and com-
munication technology and logistics through enhanced digital
connectivity; bolstering efforts to prevent illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing; capacity building to support improved national
disaster risk management; and assistance in training and develop-
ment in critical industries, such as infrastructure, semiconductors
and electronics, nuclear energy, and advanced technologies.

Section 8:
Section 7030.—The Committee directs $155,000,000 for strategic
infrastructure, critical mineral supply chains, and cyber and tech-
nology investments to enhance United States national security
around the world and to be allocated and administered consistent
with the requirements in section 7030.
Taiwan.—Funds under this heading include the GCTF, which
continues to be a key mechanism for strengthening Taiwan’s rela-
tionships in the Indo-Pacific, and, increasingly, around the world.
Launched in 2015 by AIT and Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
GCTF builds support for Taiwan by demonstrating its capacity and
willingness to contribute to the global community. Since its incep-
tion, the program has engaged nearly 8,000 participants from 127
countries through GCTF workshops that showcase Taiwan’s exper-
tise, ability, and willingness to help address global problems across
a wide spectrum of topics.
Trade capacity building.—The Committee continues to support
capacity building activities in countries with free trade agreements
with the United States to ensure that American workers and busi-
nesses can compete on a level playing field. The Committee further
supports trade capacity building programs that advance United
States interests and values in the Western Hemisphere and Africa,
including to advance the goals of the African Continental Free
Trade Area by increasing intra-continental trade. The Committee
includes further direction under Reports under this heading.
United Nations Children’s Fund.—The Committee notes funds
may be made available for the United Nations Children’s Fund
under this heading instead of under International Organizations
and Programs pursuant to section 301 of the Foreign Assistance
Act.

Venezuela democracy programs.—The Committee directs that
funds under this heading shall be used to support democracy pro-
grams in Venezuela to restore democratic institutions, promote
civil society, and counter authoritarian repression. Such programs
bolster United States national security by advancing regional sta-
bility and supporting the Venezuelan people’s pursuit of democratic
governance.
Reports
FBOs.—The Committee notes the important role that FBOs play
in communities around the world, including in the provision of hu-
manitarian, development, and global health assistance. The Com-
mittee urges the Department of State to ensure that as the Depart-
ment assumes a greater role in the provision of foreign assistance,
the Department has tools and resources to collaborate with reli-
gious communities and FBOs. Not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate con-
gressional committees a report on how efforts to engage and part-
ner with FBOs are incorporated into the Department’s localization
approach. The Committee expects that the Department’s efforts to
enable involvement of local organizations extend to those whose or-
ganizational missions are tied to faith, religious freedoms, charity,
and religious-based humanitarian support, given the extensive
presence and experience of FBOs in the developing world.
Additionally, the Committee expects the Department of State to
ensure compliance with existing Federal laws protecting the rights
of FBOs, including rights related to employment practices, from
discrimination in competing for and administering projects funded
with United States foreign assistance.
Improving the effectiveness of foreign assistance.—The Committee
supports continued efforts to improve the effectiveness of United
States foreign assistance to ensure maximum return on investment
for every United States tax dollar spent overseas. Not later than
120 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations describing
the Department of State’s plans to implement pilot programs, par-
ticularly with respect to global health and food security, that would
provide performance-based payments for measurable, independ-
ently-verified development outcomes that are in line with United
States national security interests. Such report shall recommend a
proposal for the funding level for such pilot programs.
Locally led development.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of localization of humanitarian and development assistance
to increase self-reliance. Not later than 120 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the ap-
propriate congressional committees assessing the Department of
State’s progress in advancing locally led development and humani-
tarian response and outlining the Department’s plans to continue
advancing such locally led response, including the coordinated im-
plementation of relevant agency strategies and policies. The report
shall include information on: how the Department of State is ena-
bling more local leadership of State-funded programs through utili-
zation of internal systems, management, and process reforms; how
the Department is coordinating implementation of relevant agency
strategies and policies; and humanitarian and development funding

years 2024 and 2025, which may not include international organi-
zations or local representation of such organizations.

this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appro-
priate congressional committees on the actions taken over the pre-
vious 12 months to implement programs benefiting children and
youth, including infants and other children under school age, and
on steps being taken to improve the tracking and disaggregation of
funding benefiting children and youth, including for programs pri-
marily and secondarily related to the protection, education, sup-
port, and safety of children and youth.
Trade capacity building.—Not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a spend plan
to the Committees on Appropriations for trade capacity building ac-

Funding provided under this heading demonstrates the high pri-
ority the Committee places on democracy and human rights around
the world, at a moment when definitions of these terms are fre-
quently manipulated, and the concepts themselves are frequently
tested by autocrats, dictators, and malign powers. The Committee
believes strongly that defending democracy and human rights is
fundamental to United States national security.
Programs funded by Democracy Fund should prioritize free elec-
tions, rights of free speech and dissent, access to information, free-
dom to organize, assemble, compete politically, and worship along
with protection against attacks on these freedoms, and adherence
to the rule of law.
Religious freedom.—The Committee directs that $30,000,000
from funds under this heading be made available for international
religious freedom programs pursuant to section 7033 of this Act.
An additional $20,000,000 is included under National Security In-
vestment Programs for such purposes.

Cabo Verde.—The Committee encourages the Director of the
Peace Corps to evaluate the merits of reestablishing operations in
Cabo Verde.
Cybersecurity.—The Committee is concerned with the lack of
progress toward meaningful improvements to Peace Corps informa-
tion security. The Committee emphasizes that information security,
at a time when cyber incidents are on the rise, is a critical compo-
nent of the safety and security of volunteers. The Committee di-
rects the Director of the Peace Corps to prioritize investments to
improve information security, including the response to information
security events and consistent implementation of policies and pro-
cedures.

ess measures a country’s control of corruption and other good gov-
ernance factors to incentivize potential partners to address corrup-
tion in a serious manner before they become a candidate for an
MCC compact. The Committee expects MCC to uphold this stand-
ard in compact and threshold agreements and ensure mitigation
measures are properly incorporated.
Deobligation notification.—Consistent with section 7015(c) of this
Act, the reobligation of funds deobligated by the MCC is subject to
the regular notification procedures of the Committees on Appro-
priations. In any notification of reobligation, the MCC shall indi-
cate the compact or activity that is the source of the deobligation
and the year in which the deobligation occurred.
MCC mandate.—The Committee continues to direct the CEO of
the MCC to include the corresponding economic rate of return esti-
mated for each line item funded in the compact in congressional
notifications submitted for new compacts.
Oversight.—Concurrent with the annual release of country score-
cards, the CEO of the MCC shall submit a report to the appro-
priate congressional committees on MCC partner countries that did
not receive scorecards due to such countries’ income status. Such
report shall include detail on each MCC scorecard policy indicator
for each country.
Threshold program.—The CEO of the MCC shall consult with the
Committees on Appropriations if a planned threshold program will
cause the total amount obligated for purposes of carrying out sec-
tion 616 of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (Public Law 108–
199), as amended, to exceed 5 percent in fiscal year 2026.
Women’s economic empowerment.—The Committee supports the
MCC’s efforts to empower women, reduce poverty, and promote eco-
nomic growth. Not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act,

The Committee recommendation includes $1,897,469,000 for
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement.
The Committee notes the proliferation of fentanyl into America’s
neighborhoods as one of the greatest national security challenges
facing the United States. Within that context, the Committee urges
the Secretary of State to maximize focus and resources within this
account to counter fentanyl trafficking.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

bases have a unique capability to confirm identities and have prov-
en to be an effective tool in deterring and preventing human traf-
ficking. The Committee expects the Department of State to work in
partnership to further develop the capacity of the governments of
Central America and Mexico to utilize DNA forensic science and
databases to combat trafficking in persons. The Secretary of State
shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the use of
funds.
Fentanyl and opioids.—The Committee recognizes the prolifera-
tion of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids as one of the most ur-
gent national security and public health challenges facing the
United States. The Committee strongly supports increased Depart-
ment of State focus and aggressive action to address the flow of il-
legal opioids into the United States, including: (1) programs to as-
sist the Government of Mexico in securing its borders and reducing
poppy cultivation and heroin and synthetic drug production; (2)
programs to thwart transnational criminal organizations involved
in the trafficking of heroin and fentanyl; (3) diplomatic efforts to
strengthen precursor chemical control and training on inter-
national treaty obligations related to opioids; (4) measures to
strengthen the security of the international postal system to pre-
vent illegal shipments of opioids from entering the United States,
particularly from the PRC; and (5) global demand reduction pro-
grams.
The Committee supports recent actions by the Department to
designate dangerous cartels and transnational criminal organiza-
tions as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Des-
ignated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). The Committee encourages the
Secretary of State, in coordination with heads of other relevant
Federal agencies, to fully implement these designations and related
restrictive sanctions against FTOs and SDGTs, including cartels
and other transnational criminal organizations like Mara
Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Tren de Aragua (TdA), that generate
hundreds of millions of dollars annually from illegally trafficking
fentanyl and other opioids into the United States.
Fentanyl precursors.—The Committee supports continued efforts
and programs that support precursor disposal, forensic laboratory
analysis, port security, and training and equipment, including ca-
nine support.
Fentanyl screening.—The Committee is aware of ongoing efforts
with foreign governments to deploy passive, non-intrusive screen-
ing technologies to detect small quantities of person-borne opioids,
fentanyl, and other narcotics, including residue on United States
currency, related to drug trafficking. The Committee supports this
ongoing effort and expects the Department of State to expand these
efforts with international partners to other United States-bound
airports and pedestrian ports of entry.
Indo-Pacific.—The Committee directs that funds be made avail-
able at not less than the prior year level for partners in the Indo-
Pacific, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
PRC-linked scam centers.—The Committee is concerned by the
growth of PRC-linked scam centers across Southeast Asia and
notes that Americans are estimated to have lost $5,000,000,000 to
such scam centers in 2024 alone, an increase of 42 percent above
the previous year. The Committee directs that funds under this

heading be used to counter the threats posed by PRC-linked scam
centers in Southeast Asia, which fuel corruption, violence, human
trafficking, and massive economic fraud against the American pub-
lic.
Southern Cone.—The Committee supports continued program-
ming with key Southern Cone partners, including Argentina and
Paraguay, to build regional capacity to counter organized crime,
drug trafficking, and financial crime and disrupt transnational
criminal organizations.
Reports
Assessing PRC cooperation in countering fentanyl.—Not later
than 120 days after enactment of this Act, and every 90 days there-
after until September 30, 2026, the Secretary of State, in consulta-
tion with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall submit
a report to the appropriate congressional committees detailing and
assessing the cooperation of the PRC in countering the flow of
fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and other synthetic drugs, and de-
scribing actions taken by the United States in coordination with
other countries to engage the PRC on taking concrete and measur-
able steps to stop the flow of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and
other synthetic drugs from the PRC to other countries.

enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report
to the Committees on Appropriations on how funds made available
under this heading are being used for credibility assessment tech-
nology, the challenges being encountered, and plans to expand the
use of such technology for the next two fiscal years.
Disrupting fentanyl proliferation.—Not later than 120 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in consultation with
the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall submit a report
to the appropriate congressional committees detailing: (1) programs
and operations that contribute to disrupting fentanyl proliferation
into the United States; (2) Mexico’s level of cooperation and culpa-
bility in the proliferation of fentanyl across United States borders;
and (3) efforts to address fentanyl variants and opioid counterfeits.

tional funds above the prior year level for programs in Angola, Sri
Lanka, and Zimbabwe.

to explore CWD programs in parts of the Horn of Africa where
there is risk to civilians posed by degrading ammunition and en-
courages support for weapons security management programs to
address this humanitarian threat.
Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Initiative.—The Com-
mittee directs that $13,000,000 be made available to support the
Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation’s Artificial
Intelligence Safety and Security Initiative to counter chemical, bio-
logical, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons of mass destruc-
tion risks associated with AI model development. The Committee
supports the Department of State’s efforts to detect, plan, and re-
spond to AI-enabled CBRN threats, and to coordinate with allies
and partners to manage such threats. The Committee encourages
the Department to recruit and retain personnel with the relevant
expertise to address these emerging issues.
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.—The Committee directs $2,000,000
for humanitarian demining and unexploded ordnance clearance ac-
tivities in areas affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, subject
to prior consultation with the Committees on Appropriations.

mittee directs $30,000,000 for the Multinational Force and Observ-
ers Mission in the Sinai, including $6,000,000 for force protection

by the MFO in preserving stability in a very volatile part of the
world with relatively few personnel and a small budget. United
States leadership and participation in the MFO is important to the
national security interest of the United States.
Western Hemisphere.—The Committee supports the use of funds
under this heading to strengthen bilateral and regional security in
Latin America and the Caribbean in support of United States na-
tional security. This includes support for maritime security, cyber
capacity building, security sector governance, defense institution
reform, and efforts to counter the malign influence of the PRC and
the Russian Federation.

ing program to United States national security interests and main-
tains funding at the prior year level.

made available for the International Military Education and Train-
ing program should reflect the importance of the Indo-Pacific re-
gion, especially in enhancing military-to-military relationships with
key partners and allies, including Taiwan and PICs, and in
strengthening the professionalism and democratic values of secu-
rity partners in the Indo-Pacific.

Assistance provided under this heading helps facilitate strong
military-to-military cooperation; enables greater interoperability of
friends and allies with United States military forces; and increases
participation in coalition operations. By increasing demand for
United States systems, Foreign Military Financing Program fund-
ing also contributes to a strong industrial base, reduces the cost of
Department of Defense acquisitions, and supports American work-
ers. The program provides grant and loan assistance to partner
countries in coordination with the Department of Defense.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

East Asia and the Pacific.—The Committee remains concerned
about the military modernization of the PRC and their claims in
territorial disputes, including in the East and South China seas.
The Committee encourages the Secretary of State to continue to en-
gage with partners and allies in the region on the political, eco-
nomic, and military implications of the strategic rise of the PRC,
including through military assistance and sales programs. Funds
appropriated under this heading should emphasize building the se-
curity capabilities of United States partners in Southeast Asia and
the Pacific, including in PICs.
Oversight and accountability.—The Committee notes that the
Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires that certain standard
terms and conditions be incorporated into all Foreign Military
Sales cases. These relate in part to the obligations of the pur-
chasing country under International Humanitarian Law and
Human Rights Law, requirements for end-use monitoring, and re-
strictions on retransfer without prior United States consent. The
AECA also contains requirements for prompt notice to Congress of
violations. The AECA and Foreign Assistance Act contain numer-
ous additional requirements relating to oversight and account-
ability for arms transfers and provisions for notice to Congress.

thorizing committees of jurisdiction as they consider the request for
such fund and reauthorization of DFC.

than the prior year level for the DFC’s independent accountability
mechanism, including for the Office of Accountability.

mary of the objectives of such investment and the assessed or an-

ticipated in the prior year, current year, and budget year by: cat-

cilitating, as appropriate, the resolution of commercial disputes be-
tween United States businesses and host country governments.
The Committee directs the Secretary to include in the operating
plan required by section 7062(a) of this Act sufficient funds for the
Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs to fully
comply with the provisions of this section and sections 706(b),
708(c), and 708(d) of the Championing American Business Through
Diplomacy Act.
The Committee continues to be concerned by reports of commer-
cial disputes between United States entities and host governments,
including the governments of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Djibouti, Honduras, Kuwait, and Mexico. Of particular con-
cern are disputes over real property seized, held, or expropriated
by foreign governments. The Committee directs the Secretary of
State to utilize the various tools of diplomatic engagement to work
with such governments to facilitate the timely resolution of such
disputes.

Section 39:
Section 7030 (Economic Resilience Initiative)
This section includes language modified from the prior year mak-
ing funds available to advance economic security, promote the
adoption of secure communications networks, and enhance critical
mineral supply chain security. The Committee directs that
amounts appropriated under National Security Investment Pro-
grams and made available to carry out the purposes of this section
be allocated as follows: $55,000,000 for strategic infrastructure in-
vestments pursuant to subsection (a); $50,000,000 to enhance crit-
ical mineral supply chain security pursuant to subsection (b); and

by the PRC’s investments in digital infrastructure projects in low-
and middle-income countries in Latin America, the Indo-Pacific,
and Africa. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to update
the report required under this heading in House Report 118–146,
not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, identifying the
vulnerabilities of digital infrastructure in developing countries fi-
nanced by the PRC, especially public sector projects, and the threat
posed by continued PRC investments in digital infrastructure. Such
report shall also outline a unified United States response strategy
that leverages all tools and programs being used to combat PRC in-
vestments in digital infrastructure in Latin America, the Indo-Pa-
cific, PICs, and Africa, as well as identify any gaps in funding to
meet such requirements.

Section 40:
Section 7031 (Financial Management, Budget Transparency, and
Anti-Corruption)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding management of direct assistance to governments, budget
transparency of recipient countries, and corruption and human
rights violations.
For the purposes of subsection (a), the term ‘‘direct government-
to-government assistance’’ shall include cash transfers, non-project
sector assistance, and other forms of assistance where funds appro-
priated by this Act are provided directly to the recipient govern-
ment.
The Committee directs that any planned government-to-govern-
ment assistance should be included in the fiscal year 2027 CBJ and
should include the proposed funding amount, source of funds, and
type of assistance.
Subsection (a)(4) continues a prohibition on funds provided by
this Act for debt payments by foreign countries to the PRC.
For the purposes of subsection (b), ‘‘minimum requirements of
fiscal transparency’’ shall mean the public disclosure of a country’s
national budget, including income and expenditures by ministry,
and government contracts and licenses for natural resource extrac-
tion, including bidding and concession allocation practices. The re-
port required by this subsection should identify steps taken by a
government to disclose additional budget documentation, contracts,
and licenses, which are in addition to information disclosed in the
previous year, as well as recommendations of short- and long-term
steps such government should take to improve fiscal transparency.
The report should also include a description of how funds appro-

priated by this Act are being used to improve fiscal transparency
and identify benchmarks for measuring progress.
In making the determination or in considering whether or not
the Secretary of State has credible information pursuant to sub-

Section 41:
section (c) on significant corruption, the Secretary shall consider
such individuals’ or foreign officials’ involvement in narcotics traf-
ficking, campaign finance through narcotics trafficking, misuse of
official office, and obstruction of legal processes. Additionally, the
Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that adequate staffing
resources are available to carry out the authorities under sub-

Section 42:
section (c).
Pursuant to subsection (d)(1), the Committee does not support
denying critical mineral extraction in the United States while fund-
ing such activities in foreign countries.

Section 43:
Section 7032 (Democracy Programs)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding democracy programs funded by this Act. Funds made avail-
able pursuant to this section may only be made available for de-
mocracy programs in adversarial, anti-American countries, coun-
tries whose malign activities pose a national security threat to the
United States, or countries seeking to strengthen democratic insti-
tutions and processes.
Election assistance.—The Committee notes that funds made
available by this Act pursuant to this section are not to support
public commentary about United States elections or participation of
election observers of United States elections.
Free press and countering propaganda from adversaries.—Con-
sistent with section 7024 of this Act, none of the funds made avail-
able for democracy programs may be used to: characterize United
States independent news media companies as creators of
disinformation, misinformation, or malinformation; advocate or act
to censor, filter, or remove content from a United States entity on
social media platforms; or take any action designed to influence
consumer or advertising behavior toward United States media com-
panies or social network platforms.
The Committee supports assistance for free press, including mod-
els of support that address media sustainability in nascent democ-
racies. Programs that support the free flow of objective information
are fundamental pillars for strengthening democratic governance.
The Committee recommends funding for programs and activities
globally that strengthen free and open media; protect freedom of
expression; and support accurate and ethical independent report-
ing. Additionally, the Committee supports programs that counter
manipulation of information by adversaries. Such programming
should focus exclusively on countering manipulation of information
by adversaries abroad and not general misinformation or
malinformation, especially targeting American citizens and compa-
nies.
Public-private partnerships.—The Committee supports the estab-
lishment of public-private partnerships to support democracy pro-
grams. No later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on op-
portunities to implement public-private partnerships to support de-
mocracy programs in fiscal year 2026.

Section 44:
Section 7033 (International Religious Freedom)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding international religious freedom.
Subsection (a) directs that funds under Diplomatic Programs be
made available for the Office of International Religious Freedom,
and funds for the Office of International Religious Freedom shall
be made available for the continued development and implementa-
tion of an international religious freedom curriculum in accordance
with section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.
Subsection (b) provides that not less than $50,000,000 be made
available for religious freedom programs. Within that amount, the
Committee directs that not less than $20,000,000 shall be from Na-
tional Security Investment Programs and not less than $30,000,000
shall be from Democracy Fund. Such funds shall be the responsi-
bility of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Free-
dom, in consultation with other relevant United States Government
officials, and made available subject to prior consultation with the
Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee directs that funds made available for religious
freedom shall be made available in authoritarian countries like
Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, where faith-based communities
are drivers for democratic change.
Subsection (b)(2), directs that humanitarian assistance shall be
made available for vulnerable and persecuted religious minorities,
including victims of genocide designated by the Secretary of State
and other groups that have suffered crimes against humanity and
ethnic cleansing. The Committee urges the Secretary to: accelerate
the implementation of an immediate, coordinated, and sustained
response to provide humanitarian assistance; work to enhance pro-
tection of conflict victims, including those facing a dire humani-
tarian crisis and severe persecution because of their faith or eth-
nicity; help reestablish livelihoods for displaced and persecuted per-
sons in their communities of origin; and improve access to nearby
secure locations for obtaining humanitarian services.
Countries of particular concern.—If the United States Commis-
sion on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) recommends
the designation of a country as a Country of Particular Concern
(CPC) in its annual report, and such country is not designated as
a CPC by the Department of State, the Secretary of State shall pro-
vide the rationale for such decision to the appropriate congressional
committees within 30 days of such decision. The Committee notes
that Nigeria fits such criteria in 2023, 2024, and 2025.
Spend plan.—In submitting the spend plan required pursuant to

Section 45:
section 7062(b), the Secretary of State shall consider the rec-
ommendations of USCIRF in the allocations of funds made avail-
able pursuant to this section.
Report
The Committee remains concerned that vulnerable and per-
secuted religious minorities, including victims of genocide des-
ignated by the Secretary of State and other groups that have suf-
fered crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing are not receiv-
ing necessary assistance, despite congressional direction. Therefore,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to provide a report on
the status of the implementation of section 7033(b)(3) of the Con-
VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Jul 26, 2025 Jkt 061250 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6659 Sfmt 6602 E:\HR\OC\HR217.XXX HR217

solidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (division K of Public Law 115–
141). Specifically, the Committee requests information regarding
the status of small and medium-sized projects to benefit such vic-
tims, such as restoring residential services, including water, elec-
tricity, sewage, health, and education.

Section 46:
Section 7034 (Special Provisions)
This section includes language modified from the prior year in-
volving certain special authorities and limitations that apply to
funds made available by this Act.

Section 47:
Section 7035 (Law Enforcement and Security)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
lated to assistance, authorities, limitations, technical amendments,
and reports regarding law enforcement and security matters.
The Committee notes the longstanding need to update authori-
ties relating to the use of registration fees by the Directorate of De-
fense Trade Controls. The Committee encourages the authorizing
committees of jurisdiction to update relevant statute to permit use
of such fees for all management, licensing, compliance, and policy
activities in the defense trade controls function, including the facili-
tation of defense trade policy development and implementation, re-
view of commodity jurisdiction determinations, public outreach to
industry and foreign parties, and analysis of scientific and techno-
logical developments as they relate to the exercise of defense trade
control authorities, and contract personnel to assist in all such ac-
tivities.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to ensure that the
Department of State continuously provides all foreign policy assess-
ments to other Federal agencies within 90 days of the initial re-
quest to facilitate the importation of military firearms of special in-
terest and value to collectors and meeting the curio or relic defini-
tion in 27 C.F.R. 178.11.
The Committee supports efforts to increase capitalization of the
Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF) but notes that the type
of collections that can be paid into SDAF are limited by Article 51
of the AECA. The Committee directs the Secretary of State, in con-
sultation with the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, to work with stakeholders to explore legislative and policy
proposals to increase capitalization of the Fund, including by uti-
lizing existing authority under the AECA for the incremental
recoupment of nonrecurring costs on new Foreign Military Sales
cases.
Reports
Combat casualty care.—Not later than 90 days after enactment
of this Act, and following consultation with the Committees on Ap-
propriations, the Secretary of State shall update the report re-
quired under this section in House Report 118–146.
Security assistance coordination.—The Committee notes that re-
cent reports by the Government Accountability Office and the De-
partment of State OIG have highlighted persistent challenges in
the planning process for coordination on security cooperation pro-
grams funded by the Department of Defense for which the Sec-
retary of State has statutory concurrence authority, as well as in

the administration of Department of State-funded security assist-
ance. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, shall
brief the Committees on Appropriations on steps taken to address
these concerns, including project planning related to partner capac-
ity and sustainment as well as, with respect to Department of
State security assistance programs, staffing levels and efforts to
improve program oversight, planning, and management of such
funds.

Section 48:
Section 7036 (Countering the Flow of Fentanyl and Other Synthetic
Drugs)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
lated to assistance for countering the flow of fentanyl towards the
United States border.

Section 49:
Section 7037 (Palestinian Statehood)
This section includes language carried in the prior year estab-
lishing limitations on the use of funds in support of a Palestinian
state.

Section 50:
Section 7038 (Prohibition on Assistance to the Palestinian Broad-
casting Corporation)
This section includes language carried in the prior year restrict-
ing assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation.

Section 51:
Section 7039 (Oversight Requirements for the West Bank and Gaza)
This section includes language, which is substantively the same
as carried in the prior year, placing conditions on assistance for the
West Bank and Gaza.

Section 52:
Section 7040 (Limitation on Assistance for the Palestinian Author-
ity)
This section includes language carried in the prior year placing
limitations on any assistance for the Palestinian Authority and re-
garding Hamas.

Section 53:
Section 7041 (Middle East and North Africa)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding policies and countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Abraham Accords.—The Committee notes the increased under-
standing, cooperation, and interfaith dialogue brought about by
peace and normalization agreements between Israel and Arab
states, including the Abraham Accords, and encourages continued
progress to expand these agreements, the Negev Forum, and other
multilateral efforts. Following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 terrorist at-
tack on Israel, the urgent need for regional unity as well as eco-
nomic and security cooperation has become more apparent than
ever. The Committee further notes the need for dedicated resources
to implement the Israel Relations Normalization Act (division Z of
Public Law 117–103) to deepen ties between Israel and Arab and
Muslim-majority countries. The Committee directs the Secretary of
State to ensure resources are available to leverage, strengthen, and
expand existing peace and normalization agreements and establish
new ones. The Secretary shall consult with the appropriate con-

gressional committees on the availability of flexible resources and
intended uses of such funds.
Arab League boycott of Israel.—It is the sense of the Committee
that: (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary boy-
cott of American firms that have commercial ties with Israel, re-
main an impediment to trade and investment in the Middle East
and should be terminated immediately, as should the Central Of-
fice for the Boycott of Israel; (2) several Arab states and Israel
have made important progress toward peace through treaties and
normalization agreements, including the Abraham Accords, which
open a path toward a more stable and prosperous Middle East; (3)
all Arab League states should join Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan in establishing and nor-
malizing relations with Israel, in addition to promoting peace nego-
tiations, economic cooperation, and security cooperation between
Israelis and Palestinians; (4) the President and the Secretary of
State should continue to vigorously oppose the Arab League boycott
of Israel; and (5) the President should support broadening and
deepening participation in the Abraham Accords, and other nor-
malization agreements, and report annually to the appropriate con-
gressional committees on the United States strategy, including
steps being taken by the United States to encourage additional
Arab League and other Muslim-majority states to normalize rela-
tions with Israel, and the prospect of advancing peace between
Israelis and Palestinians.
Bahrain.—The Committee notes the important role that the
Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement (C–
SIPA) with Bahrain plays in facilitating cooperation between the
United States and Bahrain on areas of shared interest. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to prioritize diplomatic efforts
to increase membership in C–SIPA to benefit United States inter-
ests in the Middle East and the United States partnership with
Bahrain.
Boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) annual report.—The
Committee remains concerned about international efforts to stig-
matize and isolate Israel through the BDS movement. The Com-
mittee directs, as part of the report required under the heading
‘‘Arab League boycott of Israel’’, that the President add information
about the BDS campaign, which shall cover companies, inter-
national organizations, countries, and other organizations, includ-
ing state investment vehicles, that are involved in promoting the
movement and specific steps the Department of State has taken or
expects to take to discourage or end politically-motivated efforts to
boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel and Israeli entities. Such re-
porting requirement shall not be considered met by the require-
ments of section 909 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforce-
ment Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–125).
Combating antisemitism and promoting tolerance.—Since Hamas’
October 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, Jewish communities
around the world have been subject to significant increases in anti-
semitism and violent attacks. Countering antisemitism in all its
forms is in the national security interests of the United States. The
Committee supports educational and cultural exchange initiatives
that strengthen United States-Israel partnerships through institu-
tions dedicated to promoting tolerance, combating antisemitism,

and fostering cross-cultural understanding. Within the funds pro-
vided under the heading Educational and Cultural Exchange Pro-
grams, the Committee encourages support for programming that
engages students and community leaders in immersive, techno-
logically driven experiences focused on navigating conflict, under-
standing diverse perspectives, and building social cohesion. The
Committee recommends that the Department prioritize partner-
ships with institutions that demonstrate a commitment to edu-
cation, mutual respect, and citizen engagement between the United
States and Israel.
Compliance with the Taylor Force Act.—The Committee under-
scores the importance of full compliance with the restrictions of the
Taylor Force Act (title X of division S of Public Law 115–141) and
continued efforts to fully implement the law, including increasing
diplomatic efforts to end the Palestinian Authority’s practice of
paying salaries to terrorists in Israeli prisons and paying for acts
of terrorism. As described in section 7040 of this Act, and in com-
pliance with the Taylor Force Act, no funding made available by
this Act shall be provided to the Palestinian Authority.
Efforts to release hostages.—The Committee remains deeply con-
cerned that hostages continue to be held in Gaza by Hamas fol-
lowing the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack. The Committee com-
mends ongoing efforts to secure the safe release of those held cap-
tive and the return of the remains of those who were murdered.
The Committee affirms that securing the freedom of the remaining
hostages is a critical United States national security priority and
urges regional partners and allies to intensify their efforts toward
achieving this objective.
Egypt.—The Committee notes that the United States and Egypt
share a mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, eco-
nomic opportunity, and regional security. Since the Camp David
Accords, United States assistance to Egypt has played an impor-
tant role in the country’s economic and military development. The
Committee recognizes the enduring Egypt-Israel peace agreement
as well as Egypt’s ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and counter
Iran’s malign influence in the region. Supporting a stable, demo-
cratic, and prosperous Egypt continues to be a core objective of
United States foreign policy.
Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations re-
garding different options, including a memorandum of under-
standing, to augment long-term planning in the mutually beneficial
United States-Egypt partnership, particularly with respect to secu-
rity assistance.
The Committee directs not less than $1,425,000,000 for assist-
ance for Egypt. Pursuant to subsection (a)(2), an additional
$75,000,000 under Foreign Military Financing Program is included
to make up for prior year Foreign Military Financing Program
funds that expired or were reprogrammed rather than being made
available for the intended purpose. In addition to amounts provided
in subsection (a), the Committee directs that $2,000,000 be made
available from Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Re-
lated Programs and $2,000,000 be made available from Inter-
national Military Education and Training.

The Committee directs that $40,000,000 of the funds appro-
priated under National Security Investment Programs and made
available for assistance for Egypt be allocated for higher education
programs in Egypt, including $17,500,000 for scholarships for
Egyptian students with high financial need to attend not-for-profit
institutions of higher education in Egypt that are currently accred-
ited by a regional accrediting agency recognized by the United
States Department of Education or meet standards equivalent to
those required for United States institutional accreditation by a re-
gional accrediting agency recognized by such Department. Not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State
shall brief the Committees on Appropriations on implementation of
funds made available for scholarships in Egypt.
Iran.—Subsection (b)(1) carries language, which is substantively
the same as carried in the prior year, directing that funds appro-
priated under Diplomatic Programs, National Security Investment
Programs, and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Re-
lated Programs be made available to support: (1) the United States
policy to prevent Iran from achieving the capability to produce or
otherwise obtain a nuclear weapon; (2) an expeditious response to
any violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions or to
efforts that advance Iran’s nuclear program; (3) the implementa-
tion, enforcement, and renewal of sanctions against Iran for its
support of nuclear weapons development, terrorism, human rights
abuses, and ballistic missile and weapons proliferation; and (4) de-
mocracy programs for Iran. The Committee directs that $2,000,000
above the prior year level be made available for the implementa-
tion, enforcement, and renewal of sanctions against Iran.
Pursuant to subsection (b)(3), none of the funds appropriated by
this Act may be: (1) used to implement or enforce a nuclear agree-
ment with Iran in contravention of the Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act of 2015; (2) made available to any foreign entity that
is subject to United Nations or United States sanctions with re-
spect to the Government of Iran; and (3) used to revoke the des-
ignation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign
Terrorist Organization.
The Committee is gravely concerned by Iran’s escalatory nuclear
activities, before and after the June 2025 conflict. The Committee
notes that the International Atomic Energy Agency has found that
Iran is not in compliance with its obligations under the Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty and has consistently failed to provide information
about undeclared nuclear material and activities. The Committee
directs the Secretary of State to work with partners and allies to
address the threat of Iran’s nuclear program and any related fur-
ther proliferation risks, including through the snapback of UN
sanctions on Iran. The Committee continues to emphasize that pre-
venting Iran from achieving the capability to produce or otherwise
obtain a nuclear weapon is vital to United States national security
interests.
The Committee notes the significant loss of life and damage
caused by Iran’s ballistic missile and drone programs and support
for terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East. Any sanctions re-
lief provided to Iran could further Iran’s ability to fund these dan-
gerous lines of effort. The Committee urges the Secretary of State
to ensure that any agreement with Iran includes strict limitations

on missiles, drones, and support for terrorist proxies to prevent
Iran from being a threat to the United States, Israel, and our part-
ners and allies in the Middle East.
The Committee remains concerned by Iran’s ongoing efforts to
expand its regional influence and undermine United States and al-
lied interests through Iran’s support for a network of terrorist
groups including Hizballah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran-backed
militias in Iraq and Syria. Iran’s sustained backing of these
groups—through arms transfers, training, and financial support—
continues to threaten United States interests, regional stability,
and international security. The Committee directs the Secretary of
State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, to prioritize efforts to disrupt Iranian
malign influence, enhance the capabilities of partner forces, and
strengthen deterrence through coordinated diplomatic, security,
and intelligence initiatives.
The Committee continues to support the Iranian people’s desire
for democracy and fundamental freedoms, including the right to
elect the country’s leadership through free and fair elections. The
proven ability of Iranian women to bravely lead the demands for
rights and change is recognized and commended by this Committee
and met with a commitment to continue support from the Amer-
ican people.
Iraq.—The Committee continues to support assistance for Iraq in
support of United States national security interests, particularly
with respect to countering Iran’s malign activities and ensuring the
enduring defeat of ISIS. Funds should be made available for: bilat-
eral economic assistance and international security assistance, in-
cluding in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI); stabilization assist-
ance; humanitarian assistance, including in the KRI; programs to
protect and assist religious and ethnic minority populations; and
programs to increase United States private sector investment.
Funds appropriated by this Act under title III and made available
for bilateral economic assistance for Iraq may not be made avail-
able to an organization or entity which the Secretary of State has
credible information is controlled by the Badr Organization.
The Committee continues to support programming that assists in
the creation of conditions for minorities in Iraq and Syria who were
victims of genocide to safely return to, and remain in, their ances-
tral homeland.
The Committee directs the Department of State to ensure that
assistance, including security assistance, intended for the KRI can
be accessed and used in the KRI as planned.
Within the amount provided under National Security Investment
Programs, the Committee directs $15,000,000 be made available to
support American-style higher education institutions in Iraq, in-
cluding in the KRI, on an open and competitive basis. Such funds
should include support for non-degree and certificate granting pro-
grams at such institutions that equip graduates of universities, in-
stitutes, and secondary schools with the knowledge and skills re-
quired to obtain gainful employment in the private sector. The Sec-
retary of State shall include funds to be allocated for this purpose
in the spend plan submitted pursuant to section 7062(b) of this Act.
Israel.—Subsection (c) directs not less than $3,300,000,000 in

Program to Israel, which is the same as the budget request. Of the
funds provided, not less than $250,300,000 shall be available for
the procurement in Israel of defense articles and defense services
to the extent that the Government of Israel requests that funds be
used for such purposes, consistent with the 2016 United States-
Israel Memorandum of Understanding and the budget request. The
Committee expects the Secretary of State to prioritize additional
funds appropriated by this Act for Israel, as necessary, to address
urgent security requirements.
The Committee reaffirms its support of the 2016 United States-
Israel Memorandum of Understanding, which demonstrates the
United States’ unshakable commitment to the security of Israel
and to ensuring that Israel’s qualitative military edge and defense
capabilities are maintained. The Committee strongly believes in
the right and ability of Israel to defend itself against the wide
range of threats it faces and believes that a close United States-
Israel security partnership benefits the interests of both countries.
The Committee further believes that by contributing to a safe and
secure Israel, United States assistance positively contributes to any
progress towards peace achieved through direct negotiations be-
tween Israel and the Palestinians.
The Committee assesses that Hamas, even in a degraded state,
continues to pose a significant threat to the security and interests
of the United States, Israel, and regional partners. The Committee
reaffirms unwavering support for Israel’s right to self-defense and
endorses continued United States-Israel security and diplomatic co-
ordination to prevent the resurgence of violent extremism. The
Committee further supports efforts to fully dismantle Hamas’ mili-
tary and political infrastructure and urges the Department of State
to prioritize long-term strategies that promote regional stability
and prevent future conflict.
The Committee notes that Congress previously provided emer-
gency supplemental funds for Israel, including humanitarian as-
sistance. The Committee directs funds to be made available to ad-
dress humanitarian needs in Israel, such as safe medical transport,
in light of continued attacks on the civilian population, including
ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks from
Iran and the Houthis in Yemen.
The Committee supports historical, archaeological, and cultural
initiatives, including in Jerusalem, that strengthen and deepen the
United States-Israel special relationship. The Committee notes that
the City of David in Biblical Jerusalem has been recognized by the
United States Commission for the Preservation of America’s Herit-
age Abroad. Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on
plans to fund and implement such initiatives. The Committee di-
rects not less than $5,000,000 be directed to such initiatives.
Jordan.—The Committee notes the importance of the United
States relationship with the Kingdom of Jordan and the strong
leadership role that Jordan continues to play in advancing peace
and stability in the region. The Secretary of State shall continue
to support economic reforms, including through budget support, to
help ensure Jordan’s long-term stability and help mitigate the im-
pact of hosting large numbers of refugees.

Subsection (d)(1) directs not less than $1,650,000,000 for assist-
ance for Jordan. Of the total amount provided, the Committee di-
rects that not less than $2,500,000 be made available from Inter-
national Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, $10,400,000 be
made available from Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining
and Related Programs, and $3,800,000 be made available from
International Military Education and Training.
Subsection (d)(2) provides an additional $450,000,000 from funds
appropriated by this Act for assistance for Jordan to address ur-
gent needs resulting from the malign activities of Iran and its prox-
ies.
Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall consult with the appropriate congressional commit-
tees on humanitarian assistance for Jordan.
The Committee recognizes that Jordan continues to face eco-
nomic and security challenges in the Middle East, including limited
natural resources, regional conflict, and persistent humanitarian
pressures, which impact United States interests in the region. The
Committee directs the Secretary of State to engage with Jordan on
efforts to advance regional security and stability and to encourage
private-sector investment that strengthens critical sectors such as
water, energy, and infrastructure. The Committee also encourages
such discussions to include continued protection and preservation
of sites of religious significance including the Baptismal Site of
Jesus Christ and the surrounding region.
Lebanon.—Subsection (e) is modified from the prior year by de-
leting language making non-security assistance for Lebanon avail-
able notwithstanding any other provision of law. The bill continues
the requirement that certain conditions be met prior to the obliga-
tion of Foreign Military Financing Program funds for Lebanon. The
Committee intends that assistance provided to the Lebanese Armed
Forces (LAF) not be used against Israel and such assistance will
not affect Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region. The Com-
mittee notes that paragraph (1) of this subsection prohibits funds
for the Lebanese Internal Security Forces or the LAF if either orga-
nization is controlled by a foreign terrorist organization, and the
Committee directs the Secretary of State to regularly consult with
the Committees on Appropriations regarding the rigorous imple-
mentation of this provision, the activities of the LAF, and assist-
ance provided by the United States. The Committee includes fur-
ther language under Reports under this heading.
The Committee directs that support be continued at not less than
the prior year under National Security Investment Programs for
the Lebanon scholarship program and the undergraduate and grad-
uate scholarship program for refugees in Lebanon. The Secretary
of State is directed to consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on an ongoing basis regarding how the programs will be ad-
ministered by not-for-profit educational institutions in Lebanon
that meet the standards required for American accreditation and
other matters related to implementation.
The Committee notes the important and enduring partnerships
with institutions of higher education in Lebanon and directs the
Secretary of State to consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on funding for such institutions, including funding made
available pursuant to section 7060(a)(2).

Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI).—The Committee di-
rects funding for MEPI to support programs consistent with prior
fiscal years. The Committee further directs that, in an effort to
streamline programming and reduce redundancy, funds previously
provided for similar activities for Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon be
made available through MEPI. Not later than 60 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the Committees
on Appropriations on the allocation of funds provided under this
heading and funds made available pursuant to section 7060(a)(2) of
this Act.
Morocco.—The Committee continues to support assistance for
Morocco in support of United States national security interests and
directs not less than $20,000,000 under National Security Invest-
ment Programs and $20,000,000 under Foreign Military Financing
Program.
Muslim Brotherhood.—The Committee is deeply concerned by the
destabilizing role that the Muslim Brotherhood plays in the Middle
East and actions by Muslim Brotherhood entities in various coun-
tries that threaten United States interests in the region. Not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall sub-
mit a report to the appropriate congressional committees describing
the policies, including visa restrictions, the Department of State is
implementing to address the threats posed by the Muslim Brother-
hood. For the purposes of this paragraph, the appropriate congres-
sional committees shall also include the Committees on the Judici-
ary.
Syria.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to take all
practicable steps to ensure that mechanisms are in place for moni-
toring, oversight, and control of any assistance provided inside
Syria and notes that section 7015(j), which requires prompt notifi-
cation of any assistance diverted or destroyed, applies to funds
made available for such assistance for Syria. Pursuant to section
7015(f), funds may not be obligated or expended for assistance for
Syria except as provided through the regular notification proce-
dures of the Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee notes significant changes with respect to Syria
following the fall of the Assad regime and ongoing actions to lift
United States sanctions and other restrictions on Syria pursuant to
Executive Order 14312, relating to Providing for the Revocation of
Syria Sanctions. This Act contains a new requirement that any
new program or activity in Syria initiated in fiscal year 2026 shall
be subject to prior consultation with the appropriate congressional
committees.
Remnants of the Assad regime and associated forces remain in
Syria and continue to have financial interests within parts of Syria.
Any United States assistance made available for Syria should be
programmed in a way that does not benefit such entities.
The Committee supports efforts to de-escalate tensions across
Syria. The Committee opposes any actions that would inhibit ef-
forts to address the security threat and humanitarian challenges
posed by conditions at the al-Hol displacement camp and associated
ISIS-detention sites administered by the Syrian Democratic Forces.
The Committee recognizes the longtime efforts of local Syrian
and diaspora organizations, as well as relief organizations, to im-
plement lifesaving interventions in Syria, including support for

emergency medical and rescue response and chemical weapons in-
vestigations. The Committee urges the Secretary of State, within
the requirements of this Act, to work to ensure continued delivery
of humanitarian aid into and within Syria.
West Bank and Gaza.—Subsection (g) includes language modified
from the prior year regarding conditions related to the West Bank
and Gaza.
Monitoring, notification, and vetting.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to promptly inform the appropriate congressional
committees of any alleged incident involving any United States as-
sistance used in such a way that adversely affects or jeopardizes
such assistance. This includes any incidents where United States
assistance has directly or indirectly been provided to an individual
or organization with ties to terrorism or incitement of violence.
The BDS movement has engaged in the spread of anti-Israel sen-
timent and antisemitism. The Secretary of State shall expand vet-
ting policies and practices to ensure that United States assistance
is not provided to or through any individual, private entity, govern-
ment entity, or educational institution that the Secretary knows or
has reason to believe advocates, plans, sponsors, engages in, or has
engaged in, the BDS movement. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to strengthen policies and procedures to ensure organiza-
tions supported through funding are not participants in the BDS
movement, are not glorifying violence, and are not providing sup-
port for lawfare against the United States or Israel at the Inter-
national Criminal Court (ICC) or International Court of Justice
(ICJ).
The Committee notes allegations of assistance provided to indi-
viduals or entities engaging in political activities and directs the
Secretary of State to expand vetting policies and practices to in-
clude an assessment of political neutrality and a review of state-
ments by individuals or organizations that constitute engagement
in political advocacy, incitement, or support for terrorism that
would cause operational and reputational risks for the United
States Government.
The Committee supports efforts that foster reconciliation and en-
gagement and therefore recommends not less than the prior fiscal
year level under National Security Investment Programs for the
Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act (title VIII
of division K of Public Law 116–260).
Reports
BDS vetting.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall update the report required under this
heading in section 7041 of House Report 118–146 on steps taken
to expand vetting policies and procedures to ensure that organiza-
tions receiving United States assistance do not directly or indi-
rectly participate in or promote the BDS movement.
Countering Hizballah and Iran in Lebanon.—Not later than 90
days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall sub-
mit to the appropriate congressional committees a report describ-
ing: (1) the presence or deployment south of the Litani River of any
armed groups other than the LAF, including Hizballah and Pales-
tinian terrorist groups, and efforts by the Government of Lebanon,
including the LAF, to counter such presence; (2) any production,

United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is fulfilling its
mandate under United Nations Security Council Resolution
(UNSCR) 1701 and contributing to implementing the November 26,
2024 Cessation of Hostilities agreement; (4) the extent of the LAF’s
compliance with UNSCR 1701 and the Cessation of Hostilities
agreement in Lebanon, and the LAF’s cooperation on implementing
such agreement; (5) any capability gaps or other factors that hinder
the LAF’s ability to effectively comply with UNSCR 1701 and the
Cessation of Hostilities agreement and any plans for United States
assistance to Lebanon to be used to address these gaps; (6) the ex-
tent of Hizballah’s influence within Lebanon, including the legisla-
tive, judicial, and financial institutions of Lebanon and the LAF;
(7) the extent of Iranian influence in Lebanon; and (8) illegal
money laundering or smuggling of cash into Lebanon by Iran or
sanctioned persons. The report shall be submitted in an unclassi-
fied form but may contain a classified annex that is transmitted
separately from the unclassified report.
Prisoner payments.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State is directed to submit a report to the
appropriate congressional committees on the status of negotiating
an end to the Palestinian Authority’s practice of paying salaries to
terrorists and families of terrorists serving in prison and other
forms of such support.
Religious freedom.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State shall update the report required
under this heading in section 7041 of House Report 117–84 con-
cerning the treatment of Christian communities in Egypt.

Section 54:
Section 7042 (Africa)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding assistance for Africa.
Cabo Verde.—The Committee directs funding at not less than the
prior fiscal year level for Cabo Verde for strengthening bilateral en-
gagement and economic investments.
Cameroon.—The Committee remains concerned about human
rights violations committed against Cameroonian citizens, includ-
ing displaced persons in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon, and
urges the Secretary of State to encourage the Government of Cam-
eroon to support genuine political dialogue to resolve the
Anglophone crisis. The Secretary shall ensure that any security as-
sistance from the United States is not used in the perpetration of
human rights abuses.
Democratic Republic of the Congo.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to brief the Committees on Appropriations with-
in 90 days of enactment of this Act on efforts to protect minority
communities in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, address
the root causes of violence, including the unauthorized extraction
and trade of natural resources, and respond to recent atrocities
through the provision of humanitarian assistance and the imposi-
tion of targeted sanctions, as appropriate.

Ethiopia.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to brief
the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on efforts to ensure humanitarian access, address ongoing
human rights abuses, and support efforts to achieve a lasting peace
in Ethiopia, with particular attention to worsening food insecurity
and the protection of civilians.
Malawi.—The Committee continues to support higher education
investments in Malawi that expand access, promote economic
growth, and strengthen the agricultural workforce through skills
development and self-sustaining models at levels consistent with
prior years.
Nigeria.—The Committee directs that funds continue to be made
available to support religious freedom and atrocity response
projects, including through FBOs and nongovernmental organiza-
tions from the affected communities, that improve local commu-
nication, documentation, and distribution of humanitarian assist-
ance for communities impacted by violence in Nigeria, including in
the Middle Belt, Benue State, and other states and communities
impacted by violent jihadist extremism.
Power Africa.—The Committee supports levels of funding for
Power Africa that are consistent with prior years and that promote
an all-of-the-above energy development strategy for sub-Saharan
Africa that includes the use of oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric,
wind, solar, and geothermal power, and other sources of energy.
South Africa.—The Committee notes that the United States has
provided significant financial support to the people of South Africa
while the Government of South Africa has worked in direct opposi-
tion to United States and partner nation interests, including
through military and economic cooperation with the Russian Fed-
eration, the PRC, and Iran, pursuing baseless charges of genocide
against Israel, while not Hamas, at the International Court of Jus-
tice, and participating in the practice of human trafficking through
the use of Cuban doctors. Therefore, subsection (b) prohibits funds
to the Government of South Africa unless the Secretary of State
certifies and reports to the Committees on Appropriations that the
Government of South Africa has met the following conditions—
(1) ceased cooperation with United States adversaries;
(2) ceased participating in human trafficking, such as the ex-
ploitation of Cuban medical professionals; and
(3) ceased the implementation of policies that undermine in-
herent property rights of the citizens of South Africa.
Sudan.—Of the funds made available by this Act for assistance
to Sudan, the Secretary of State shall prioritize support for diplo-
matic efforts—including those led by civil society—that promote the
participation of Sudanese women and youth in conflict resolution,
as well as for activities that facilitate the delivery of humanitarian
assistance and the protection of civilians, with particular attention
to survivors of violence and displaced populations.
United States-Somaliland engagement.—The Committee directs
the Secretary of State to submit a report, not later than 120 days
after enactment of this Act, to the appropriate congressional com-
mittees on potential areas for improved United States engagement
with Somaliland, including in security, diplomacy, trade, and devel-
opment.

Report
Power Africa.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act, the Committee directs the Secretary of State, in coordination
with the CEO of the DFC, to submit a report to the appropriate
congressional committees that details planned support,
disaggregated by source of energy, for the Power Africa program in
fiscal year 2026. Such report shall also include detail on new pro-
gram outcomes expected as a result of such support, which are re-
quired, at minimum, to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan
Africa and bringing 30 gigawatts of new power generation in sub-
Saharan Africa to financial close by 2030.

Section 55:
Section 7043 (East Asia and the Pacific)
This section includes language modified from the prior year con-
taining limitations and prohibitions, directives on assistance, and
guidance for diplomatic and development activities and programs
in East Asia and the Pacific.
Burma.—The Committee recommendation includes $50,000,000
under title III to implement the BURMA Act of 2022 (subtitle E of
Public Law 117–263). Additionally, funds under International Hu-
manitarian Assistance are available to address the deepening hu-
manitarian crisis in Burma.
For the purposes of section 5575 of the Burma Act of 2022 and
assistance for Burma made available by this Act and prior acts
making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign oper-
ations, and related programs, ‘‘non-lethal assistance’’ shall include
equipment and associated training to support: (1) atrocities preven-
tion; (2) the protection of civilians from military attack; (3) the de-
livery of humanitarian assistance; (4) investigations into genocide
and human rights violations committed by the Burmese military;
(5) local governance and the provision of services in areas outside
the control of the Burmese military; and (6) medical trauma care,
supplies, and training.
Consistent with prior years, the Committee directs that funds
that are made available for assistance for Burma shall be made
available for programs and activities to support desertions from the
military junta and its allied entities, following consultation with
the appropriate congressional committees.
The Committee notes the dire conditions in Burma and continues
to condemn the military coup and associated regime atrocities and
does not provide any assistance to the Tatmadaw, State Adminis-
tration Council, or entities affiliated with the military junta. The
Committee recommendation includes funds to investigate and docu-
ment violations of human rights committed by the Burmese mili-
tary, including against ethnic groups in Burma.
The Committee recommends the Department of State explore the
feasibility of supporting the capacity of local partners to provide ex-
plosives risk education, victim assistance, and related programs to
mitigate against the peril of mines and other unexploded ordnance
in Burma.
Cambodia.—The Committee notes the need for a new United
States integrated country strategy for Cambodia that advances the
protection of American citizens and United States national security
interests in combatting cybercrime and other transnational crimi-
nal activities, supports greater Cambodian strategic autonomy, in-

cluding through strengthened military-to-military ties with the
United States, and seeks to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific
where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and terri-
torial integrity are upheld and defended.
Electronic waste.—The Committee is concerned about the un-
checked export of electronic waste, or e-waste, such as old cell
phones, computers, and servers to other nations. The flow to U.S.
e-waste to China and other foreign nations is on track to reach 80
million tons by 2030. Unfortunately, when e-waste is discarded
overseas, it is frequently done in ways that are environmentally de-
structive or unlawfully turned into counterfeit electronics. These
counterfeit electronics are often then resold to buyers in the United
States where the faulty materials can make their way into critical
U.S. military equipment. The Committee directs the Secretary to
coordinate with appropriate federal agencies on efforts to ensure
that the recycling and export of United States e-waste does not un-
dermine national security.
Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Countering PRC Influence Fund.—
The Committee recommendation includes $1,800,000,000 under ti-
tles III through VI for the Indo-Pacific Strategy, which is the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. It also includes $400,000,000 for the Coun-
tering PRC Influence Fund.
Funds for the Countering PRC Influence Fund are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:
COUNTERING PRC INFLUENCE FUND
[Budget authority in thousands of dollars]
Account Budget Authority
National Security Investment Programs....................................................................................................... $210,000
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement................................................................................ 70,000
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs............................................................. 35,000
Foreign Military Financing Program ............................................................................................................. 85,000
Pursuant to subsection (b)(2), the Countering PRC Influence
Fund should be used for activities that provide the highest stra-
tegic impact to counter PRC influence globally. The Secretary of
State should develop a strategic impact measurement system that
assesses PRC influence globally and measures the strategic impact
of United States involvement in countries by sector and activity.
Such system should be used to help prioritize and guide the alloca-
tion and obligation of funds from the Countering PRC Influence
Fund. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a briefing to
the appropriate congressional committees, not later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act, detailing the processes for admin-
istering the Countering PRC Influence Fund and how the strategic
impact measurement system informs such processes.
The Committee notes that our allies and partners in Southeast
Asia must strengthen their law enforcement capacity to combat
Chinese grey-zone aggression, including illegal, unregulated, and
unreported fishing, and CCP maritime militia and coast guard pa-
trols that violate their exclusive economic zones. The Committee
recommendation includes robust funding for the Countering PRC
Influence Fund to address these threats.

The Committee recommendation includes funding for AI to en-
hance current maritime situational awareness capabilities to sup-
port the operational needs of the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Mari-
time Domain Awareness.
The Committee notes that country members of the Association of
Southeast Asian States (ASEAN) are projected to become the fifth
largest economy in the world and recognizes the importance of
strengthening ties between those member states and the United
States, including to support secure supply chains and related re-
search collaboration. The Committee directs $1,000,000 be made
available for related training partnerships with an institution of
higher education.
The Committee recommendation includes funding to establish
partnerships between the Department of State and institutions of
higher education with research security programs to help safeguard
America’s primacy in science and technology from predation and
other threats from the PRC.
The Committee is deeply concerned by the surge of PRC influ-
ence across the Latin America and Caribbean region, which, com-
bined with unprecedented narcotics trafficking, organized crime,
and violence, is presenting an overwhelming challenge for partner
governments. The Committee supports efforts by the Secretary of
State to prioritize funds from the Countering PRC Influence Fund
to support strategically targeted programs region-wide, including
efforts to combat illegal fishing, increase transparency of public
procurement systems, address vulnerabilities at key ports, and to
promote the use of trusted technology. Not later than 45 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the Commit-
tees on Appropriations on the amount allocated to expand such ef-
forts.
The Committee directs $5,000,000 under National Security In-
vestment Programs be made available to support the work of the
Quad Investors Network to strengthen collaboration between the
public and private sectors in the United States and the Quad part-
ners of India, Japan, and Australia to promote and scale invest-
ments in critical emerging technologies in the Indo-Pacific.
The Committee notes that subsection (b)(3)(B) includes a restric-
tion on the use of funds provided by this Act and prior acts from
being made available for the use of technology developed by the
PRC. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to apply this re-
striction to any high-performance or other computer, video tech-
nology equipment, or printer made by an entity that is owned, con-
trolled, or influenced by the PRC or the CCP, including those con-
tracted from third parties.
Japan.—The Committee supports and encourages continued re-
gional partnership between the United States, Japan, and other re-
gional allies in pursuing policies that enhance stability in the Indo-
Pacific.
Mongolia.—The Committee supports the development of pro-
gramming and partnerships on weather-related forecasting and
early warning and response systems, including in Mongolia and
other areas that lack such forecasting tools.
North Korea.—Pursuant to subsection (c)(1), none of the funds
provided by this Act may be made available to the central govern-
ment of a country the Secretary of State determines engages in sig-

Pacific Islands.—The Committee recommendation includes not
less than $175,000,000 in titles III and IV for PICs, including
$60,000,000 for the South Pacific Tuna Treaty.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for small
grants programs to assist local communities across PICs.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for a Flexible
Microfinance Facility, launched by the DFC in partnership with the
Department of State, to expand access to finance for micro, small,
and medium-sized enterprises in PICs.
The Committee supports efforts to counter PRC propaganda in
PICs consistent with the limitations of section 7024 and directs the
Secretary of State to provide funding for such purpose.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for people-to-
people exchange programs between citizens of PICs and the United
States, with a focus on partnering with universities in Pacific loca-
tions with close and long-standing ties throughout PICs and with
expertise in Pacific Islands languages, cultures, and area studies.
The Committee directs that funds be made available for trade ca-
pacity building activities to improve the enabling environment for
trade and investment in PICs.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for a new, de-
mand-driven initiative to diversify trade opportunities in PICs and
help make the business environment and economic system more ef-
ficient, transparent, and resilient.
The Committee recommendation includes an increase over the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level for PICs and directs a portion be
made available for assistance for the Freely Associated States, in
addition to funds for such States included in the Compacts of Free
Association. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to col-
laborate with partners in the Freely Associated States on the po-
tential for increased efficiencies and reduced costs in health care.
The Committee supports funds above the prior year level to ad-
dress World War II-era unexploded ordinance in PICs, including
funds for Papua New Guinea and $2,500,000 for the Solomon Is-
lands.
The Committee supports the Department of State’s continued
support for the Advancing Port Enhancement and Customs Secu-
rity program in PICs. The Committee directs $3,000,000 to support
Pacific partners’ ability to strengthen port security and customs,
counter-trafficking, and anti-money laundering efforts.
The Committee continues to support the Young Pacific Leaders
Program, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Program, and the
Fulbright Program in the Indo-Pacific region and urges the Sec-
retary of State to prioritize such activities in the operating plan for
fiscal year 2026.
PRC.—Subsection (e) prohibits funds in this Act to: (1) the PRC
or CCP; (2) implement, administer, carry out, modify, revise, or en-
force any action that directly supports or facilitates forced labor or
other violations of human rights, crimes against humanity, or geno-
cide in the PRC; and (3) academic institutions partnering in STEM
programs with colleges or universities in China controlled by the
PRC or CCP.

Section 56:
Section 7031(a)(4) prohibits funds in this Act from being used by
foreign countries to repay loans to the Government of the PRC.
The Committee supports the role of international broadcasting
activities that provide essential news and information services in
East Asia and PICs, including the Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur, and
Cantonese language services. The Committee notes that such ac-
tivities were instrumental in exposing the CCP’s cover-up of
COVID–19 deaths as well as the human rights abuses in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
The Committee is concerned about the vulnerability of refugees
who have fled persecution in the PRC. Funds are available under
International Humanitarian Assistance to support Uyghur and
other Turkic refugees. The Committee supports efforts by the Sec-
retary of State to work with host governments to provide access to
basic services for such refugees and to prevent their refoulement to
the PRC where they could face torture and other gross violations
of human rights.
Philippines.—The Committee notes the ongoing threat to the
Philippines posed by the PRC’s campaign of intimidation and mari-
time occupation in the South China Sea and provides $100,000,000
under Foreign Military Financing Program and $80,300,000 under
National Security Investment Programs to help modernize the alli-
ance, strengthen deterrence, and continue to support a prosperous,
secure Philippines.
Public Law 106–554.—Of the funds appropriated by this Act, not
less than $11,500,000 shall be made available to carry out the pur-
poses of the Vietnam Education Foundation Act of 2000, of which
not less than $2,500,000 shall be from funds under Educational
Cultural Exchange Programs and not less than $9,000,000 shall be
from funds under National Security Investment Programs.
Taiwan.—The Committee recommendation includes $500,000,000
from funds made available under Foreign Military Financing Pro-
gram, including for Foreign Military Financing Program direct loan
and loan guarantee authority, and not less than the prior fiscal
year level under International Military Education and Training to
enhance Taiwan’s capacity to resist coercion and aggression and to
strengthen interoperability with the United States.
The Committee strongly supports efforts by AIT and the Depart-
ment of State to support Taiwan’s engagement with international
organizations, existing diplomatic partners, and like-minded coun-
tries. The Committee also supports efforts by the Taiwan authori-
ties and civil society to further strengthen institutions there and
build resilience in the face of intensifying PRC coercion.
The Committee notes that the Department of State’s guidance re-
garding relations with Taiwan are governed in part by the prin-
ciples outlined in the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (subtitle B of
Public Law 116–260). Not later than 60 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State is directed to brief the appropriate
congressional committees on how Department guidance on Taiwan
meets the goals and objectives outlined in such Act, including with
regard to the fact that Taiwan is governed by a representative de-
mocracy that is peacefully constituted through free and fair elec-
tions that reflect the will of the people of Taiwan.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to ensure that offi-
cials from Taiwan seeking discussions in the United States with

Federal or state government officials are admitted for entry in ac-
cordance with section 221 of Public Law 103–416.
Tibet.—The Committee continues to support implementation of
the Ngwang Choephel Fellows Program consistent with prior years.
The Committee directs that continued funding be made available
for Tibetan exchanges and fellowship programs, consistent with

Section 57:
section 346 of the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (Public
Law 116–260).
The Committee supports the continued allocation of funds to as-
sist Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal at levels commensurate
with prior years. The Committee remains concerned that Tibetans
living in Nepal are restricted from enjoying certain basic rights re-
sulting from agreements in recent years between the governments
of Nepal and the PRC, which has resulted in increased vulner-
ability for Tibetans both within and transiting through Nepal. The
Committee encourages the Secretary of State to press the Govern-
ment of Nepal to honor the agreement reached with the United Na-
tions High Commissioner for Refugees to respect the principle of
non-refoulement.
The Committee directs that funding be made available at not less
than the prior year level to promote human rights and democracy
in Tibetan communities.
Reports
Belt and Road Initiative impact assessment.—The Committee di-
rects the Department of State, in coordination with other relevant
Federal agencies, to report on the impact of PRC lending and other
financial practices on Belt and Road Initiative participant countries
and to recommend best practices for addressing the impact of such
activities through United States diplomatic and programmatic en-
gagements. The assessment should consider the impact of these
practices on corruption and social stability within a representative
sample of such countries, among other issues. The Committee fur-
ther directs that the lessons learned from such assessment be
shared with the European Union and other partners of the United
States to help develop a unified approach in addressing PRC efforts
to create economic dependencies and to coerce others through such
initiative and similar initiatives.
Burma.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit
a report to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 180
days after enactment of this Act, detailing the steps taken by the
United States to provide cross-border humanitarian and other as-
sistance to populations in need in Burma.
Commercial engagement with the Pacific Islands.—Not later than
180 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in co-
ordination with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall
submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on
ways to strengthen United States trade and investment with PICs.
For the purposes of this paragraph, the appropriate congressional
committees shall also include the Committee on Ways and Means
of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of
the Senate.
Engagement with FBOs.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant role of FBOs in PICs. Not later than 180 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a strategy for faith-

based engagement as part of assistance for PICs to the appropriate
congressional committees.
Hong Kong.—Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional
committees an update to the report described in section 301 of the
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5731).
Pacific Islands students.—Not later than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the
Committee on Appropriations on scholarships offered to Pacific Is-
lands students along with an assessment of the feasibility of estab-
lishing additional scholarship programs for Pacific Islanders to
study in the United States.
Transnational crime in the Pacific Islands.—The Committee di-
rects that not later than 120 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall update the report required under this
heading in House Report 117–401. Such report shall include an
analysis of the threat posed to PICs by money laundering and the
transshipment of illicit narcotics by criminal organizations based in
the PRC.

Section 58:
Section 7044 (South and Central Asia)
This section includes language modified from the prior year con-
taining limitations and directives for diplomatic and other activi-
ties and programs in South and Central Asia.
Afghanistan.—Subsection (a) prohibits funds appropriated by
this Act from being made available for assistance to the Taliban.
The Committee remains gravely concerned by the plight of Af-
ghans under Taliban rule, particularly women and girls. The Com-
mittee notes that the Taliban continues to ban women and girls
from education, health centers, cemeteries, sports, driving, and
traveling in public without a male escort or a ‘‘legitimate reason’’.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to take all appro-
priate actions to support and protect women and girls and ensure
such efforts are a top priority in United States diplomatic engage-
ment on Afghanistan.
Funds provided pursuant to this section shall be made available
following consultation with the Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee notes that education based upon American val-
ues is critical to countering radical ideologies and therefore directs
that funds be made available to support access to education for
women and girls in Afghanistan, including online education for
those who would otherwise be unable or severely limited in their
ability to attend school. Such investments are key to furthering a
more stable and free Afghanistan, which is directly in the United
States national security interest.
Bangladesh.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
continue to prioritize humanitarian assistance to help displaced
Rohingya refugees who have fled from Burma to Bangladesh. Such
assistance should include activities to improve cooperation with
host communities in Bangladesh.
India and Pakistan.—The Committee commends the Secretary of
State for the diplomatic engagement that facilitated the cessation
of hostilities between India and Pakistan following the April 22,
2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir.

The Committee urges the Secretary of State to intensify diplomatic
efforts aimed at de-escalation and the prevention of further conflict.
Pakistan.—The Secretary of State is directed to withhold from
obligation $33,000,000 in assistance for Pakistan until the Sec-
retary of State reports to the Committees on Appropriations that
Dr. Shakil Afridi has been released from prison and cleared of all
charges relating to the assistance provided to the United States in
locating Osama bin Laden. Funds provided by this Act under For-
eign Military Financing Program may only be made available to
support counterterrorism and counterinsurgency capabilities in
Pakistan.
Reports
Afghanistan.—Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate con-
gressional committees detailing plans, consistent with the restric-
tion contained in section 7044(a) of this Act, to protect and
strengthen the rights of Afghan women and girls, support higher
education programs, including online programs and other higher
education institutions in South Asia and the Middle East that are
hosting Afghan students, support and protect journalists and en-
hance access to uncensored news and information, consistent with
the limitations under section 7024.
Afghanistan SIV.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to submit a report, not later than 45 days after enactment of this
Act, to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of
the Afghan SIV program and the specific actions taken to provide
personnel, operational, and technical support to adjudicate and
process Afghan SIV cases.
Bangladesh.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to
the appropriate congressional committees on the extent to which
the government of Bangladesh supports human rights, including
freedoms of expression, association, and religion, due process, and
free and fair elections.
Pakistan.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to
the appropriate congressional committees on the status of Dr.
Shakil Afridi and the actions the United States has taken to secure
his release from prison and ensure that he has been cleared of all
charges related to the assistance provided in locating Osama bin
Laden.

Section 59:
Section 7045 (Latin America and the Caribbean)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding programs and funding for countries in Latin America and
the Caribbean.
Assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean
The Committee supports the leadership of the Secretary of State
with a coherent United States foreign policy toward the Western
Hemisphere that aligns with core American values and effectively
addresses challenges that threaten United States sovereignty and
national security. The Committee further supports the Secretary’s
efforts to deepen cooperation and reward democratic partners in

the region, including Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama,
Paraguay, and Peru, whose alignment with United States priorities
strengthens regional stability and prosperity. At the same time, the
Committee underscores the importance of countering malign actors,
including the authoritarian regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ven-
ezuela, and expresses concern over the deterioration of bilateral co-
operation with Colombia on shared national security objectives.
The Committee looks forward to the use of diplomacy, foreign as-
sistance, and targeted tools to bolster allies and hold adversarial
governments accountable.
Alliance for Development in Democracy.—The Alliance for Devel-
opment in Democracy (ADD) is a Dominican Republic-organized
partnership with Panama, Costa Rica, and Ecuador building more
secure supply chains integrated with the United States market,
partnering on nearshoring, fighting corruption, and countering nar-
cotics trafficking. The Committee strongly endorses continued sup-
port for initiatives that strengthen such partnership and supports
its vision for an alliance, comprised of United States allies, that
promotes democracy, free markets, and cooperation. Support for
such an alliance demonstrates the importance this Committee
places on supporting partners in the Western Hemisphere. The
Committee supports Department of State programs that facilitate
platforms of engagement with ADD countries.
Countering antisemitism in Latin America.—The Committee is
concerned by rising antisemitism targeting Jewish diaspora com-
munities in Latin American nations, including historic United
States partners and allies like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, particu-
larly instances of elected leaders fueling prejudice against Jewish
communities through social media and official government chan-
nels or otherwise neglecting their responsibility to protect Jewish
communities and other marginalized groups. The Committee con-
demns antisemitism in all forms and urges the Secretary of State
to encourage Latin American and Caribbean leaders to proactively
condemn and counter antisemitism in their nations.
Damage caused by communism in Latin America.—The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to support partnerships with
universities in order to establish platforms of researched informa-
tion about the practices and victims of communism and authori-
tarian control in Latin America, including political prisoners. Such
partnerships should leverage Latino student bodies to serve as re-
searchers and data collectors, including students who have emi-
grated from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.
Latin America broadcasting.—The Committee supports inter-
national broadcasting activities in Latin America. The Committee
directs the Secretary of State to put an emphasis on programming
in Mexico. The Committee expects a continued focus on countries,
such as Venezuela and Nicaragua, where government censorship of
news coverage, restrictions on the free flow of information, and in-
terference from countries, such as the Russian Federation and the
PRC, continues to increase.
Organization of American States.—The Secretary of State should
consider voluntary contributions to the Organization of American
States for human rights and democracy programs, consistent with
the Organization’s charter commitments to promote representative
democracy and protect human rights.

Strategic priorities.—Not later than 30 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State shall consult with the appropriate
congressional committees on a hemispheric plan to further the stra-
tegic priorities contained in subsection (a) and include the baseline
definitions for the referenced requirements.
Central America
Central America strategic partners.—The Committee supports the
efforts of the Secretary of State to employ more rigorous effort and
ingenuity in providing assistance to partners in Central America
who effectively cooperate on broad policy objectives, such as coun-
ternarcotics and migration, and share values aligned with the
United States.
Certification requirement.—Subsection (b)(2) describes conditions
the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
must meet for full funding allocated to such governments to be re-
leased. The Committee does not include explicit authority to repro-
gram funds if the conditions are not met.
The Committee notes that the required certifications provide an
opportunity for the Department of State to ensure that the central
governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are making
meaningful progress to address the conditions on assistance out-
lined in this Act. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
prioritize engagement on actions needed to fulfill the certification
requirement, including tax refunds owed to American businesses
operating in the region.
Combating corruption.—The Committee supports funds for anti-
corruption programs in Central America. Such funds shall only
support entities with sufficient authority, independence, and legal
mandate to investigate and prosecute corruption. Within the funds
made available pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the Committee sup-
ports assistance for offices of Attorneys General focused on corrup-
tion, money laundering, financial crimes, human rights crimes,
asset forfeitures, and criminal analysis if the Secretary of State de-
termines such offices and units have the authority, independence,
and will to hold corrupt and illicit actors accountable.
Combating human trafficking in Central America.—The Com-
mittee supports increased funds above the fiscal year 2025 level for
programs to combat human trafficking in Central America.
Costa Rica.—The Committee recognizes Costa Rica as a reliable
democratic partner facing increasing challenges from narcotics traf-
ficking, transnational criminal organizations, and malign influence
from the Russian Federation and the PRC. The Committee directs
that not less than prior year levels be made available under Inter-
national Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Foreign Mili-
tary Financing Program. The Committee intends this funding to
help counter narcotics trafficking and other threats to United
States national security and to foster greater military interoper-
ability with the United States.
The Committee encourages enhanced security cooperation, in-
cluding provision of non-lethal maritime domain awareness assets
and expanded cybersecurity cooperation for critical infrastructure
defense and ransomware training. The Committee recognizes Costa
Rica’s role in detecting fentanyl precursors and disrupting illicit fi-
nancial networks and recommends prioritization under the Central

America Regional Security Initiative. Additionally, the Committee
encourages DFC to explore financing tools for upper-middle-income
democratic partners like Costa Rica, with priority for projects that
improve migration management infrastructure, cybersecurity resil-
ience, and near-shoring of United States supply chains.
El Salvador.—The Committee notes the reduction of violence and
restoration of state control through operations against MS-13 and
other transnational gangs by the Government of El Salvador. The
Committee supports deeper United States-El Salvador cooperation
and directs the Secretary of State to promote the expansion of joint
operations, including enhanced INTERPOL coordination, use of fo-
rensic and biometric tools, financial intelligence support, and co-
ordinated operations against trafficking, extortion, and arms smug-
gling. The Committee supports continued cooperation with the Gov-
ernment of El Salvador to address irregular migration.
Independent journalists in Central America.—The Committee af-
firms the need for independent, investigative journalists in Central
America to disseminate information to effectively fight corruption
and promote freedom. The Committee recommends the Department
of State consider efforts to seek justice for threats, violence, and
other actions targeting independent journalists.
Over-collection of taxes.—The over-collection of Value Added Tax
(VAT) and Corporate Income Tax continues to disincentivize new
investment by American businesses in Guatemala. The Committee
encourages the Department of State to explore opportunities to en-
gage with the new administration to foster a business-friendly en-
vironment, including the possibility of legislation to remedy the
over-collection of taxes. Additionally, the Committee urges the De-
partment to support administrative efforts aimed at expediting res-
olution of outstanding claims, potentially by allowing for cross-cred-
iting against other tax obligations.
In Honduras, the Committee is concerned by reports that United
States businesses cannot pursue potential near-term investments
because of the unavailability of United States dollar currency ex-
change for inbound businesses and because tax refunds have re-
mained undelivered for several years. The Committee encourages
the Department of State to work with the central government of
Honduras to formalize and refine a mechanism that allows for the
cross-crediting of refunds against current and future tax obliga-
tions, as well as exemptions from VAT on new construction
projects. The Committee is also aware that many United States
citizens have longstanding property and financial claims against
Honduras. The Committee therefore directs the Secretary of State
to refer all United States citizens’ property and financial claims
against Honduras to the Department of Justice Foreign Claims
Settlement Commission for review and adjudication not later than
90 days after enactment of this Act.
Notification and spend plans.—The Committee recommendation
includes the special notification and spend plan requirements for
assistance for Central America and emphasizes the importance of
utilizing these tools to provide the Committees on Appropriations
with timely updates on United States assistance and its relation-
ship to: (1) corresponding regional and country-specific strategies;
(2) goals and objectives; (3) performance monitoring indicators and
benchmarks; (4) context indicators, including obstacles and oppor-

tunities for growth; (5) the results of assessments and evaluations;
and (6) the role of other key stakeholders, including donors and
counterpart governments. The spend plan shall outline steps re-
quired to obligate funding in a timely manner.
Panama.—The Committee recognizes the Republic of Panama’s
continued leadership in managing significant migration flows
through the Darie´n Gap and its broader role as a strategic regional
partner. The Committee supports opportunities for the United
States to assist Panama in addressing migration and advancing
shared regional priorities. Such support may include: (1) electronic
processing and recordkeeping of migrant populations; (2) special-
ized land and aerial vehicles for monitoring the Darie´n National
Park region; (3) cybersecurity and critical infrastructure resilience;
(4) strategic development finance to strengthen economic oppor-
tunity; and (5) enhanced counternarcotics operations and port secu-
rity.
Preventing violence against women and girls.—The Committee
recommendation includes funds for assistance in Central America
and the Caribbean to prevent violence against women and girls.
Reintegration assistance.—The Committee supports programs
that promote the safe and humane return and reintegration of chil-
dren to the Northern Triangle, including those victimized by vio-
lence and human trafficking.
United States investment in Pro´spera ZEDE.—The Committee is
concerned by repeated expropriation attempts and threats by the
Government of Honduras against United States investments in
Pro´spera ZEDE. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions on: (1) actions by the Honduran government constituting ex-
propriation, including analysis of the September 2024 Honduras
Supreme Court ruling; (2) threats and hostile acts by officials
against United States investors; (3) foreign government involve-
ment in anti-investor campaigns; (4) the impact on bilateral rela-
tions and United States assistance; and (5) necessary diplomatic
and policy measures to protect United States investors. The report
shall also outline steps to represent affected investors.
Reports, Central America
Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).—Not later
than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the Committee directs
the Secretary of State to provide to the Committees on Appropria-
tions a report on the uses of all funds provided for CARSI on a
country-by-country basis for each program, project, and activity for
fiscal years 2023 through 2025.
DFC investment in Central America.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the CEO of the DFC shall update the
report required under this heading in House Report 118–146 on
ways in which the DFC can further engage upper-middle-income
countries in Central America, notably Costa Rica and Panama.
Such report shall include areas of opportunities and remaining
challenges to supporting private sector investments in such coun-
tries.
Due diligence on tax refunds.—The report required under this
heading in House Report 118–146 directed the Secretary of State
to provide a summary of engagements with government officials in

Northern Triangle countries to address overdue tax refunds. The
Committee remains interested in understanding the steps taken by
the Department of State to work with local governments to pro-
mote a pro-investment environment, including by facilitating tax
refunds owed to American businesses. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary to provide an update to the report not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, including the number of
cases resolved and still outstanding. Such report should also cite
the tax refund amounts believed to be owed to American companies
by the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras and
the status of such refunds.
Honduras.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit an update
to the report required under this heading in House Report 118–146
regarding the successes and failures of the Government of Hon-
duras in democratic governance, rule of law, economic freedom, and
human rights. The report shall include assessments of the impact
Honduras’ relationships with Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, the Rus-
sian Federation, and the PRC have on United States national secu-
rity interests. The report shall also include a cost-benefit analysis
on United States assistance to Honduras in fiscal year 2025 to de-
termine whether such assistance has yielded material results, in-
cluding for American investors and business owners operating in
Honduras.
Colombia
The Committee notes with appreciation the deep and abiding re-
lationship between the United States and people of Colombia, in-
cluding the Colombian Armed Forces and the Colombian National
Police. However, the Committee remains deeply concerned about
the detrimental policies, erratic behavior, and malign relationships
of the Petro Administration, which are at odds with United States
security and economic interests.
The Committee is concerned by increased reports of drug abuse
in Colombia, including at the highest levels of government, and di-
rects the Secretary of State to consult with the Committees on Ap-
propriations not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on
opportunities to implement demand reduction programming in Co-
lombia.
The Committee notes the deteriorating security environment and
rising political volatility in Colombia, as demonstrated in the re-
cent assassination attempt of opposition senator and presidential
hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay on June 7, 2025. The Committee is
further alarmed by reports of growing destabilization across Colom-
bia as armed actors and criminal organizations regain lost territory
and violent conflict escalates in multiple regions.
The Committee is concerned by reports of due process violations
and judicial irregularities in the case against former President
A ´ lvaro Uribe Ve´lez, including allegations of unauthorized surveil-
lance, denial of defense rights, and conflicts of interest. Questions
of politicization raise serious concerns about the deterioration of ju-
dicial independence and the rule of law in Colombia. The chal-
lenges observed in Colombia reflect a troubling pattern of threats
to due process and judicial independence, serving as a reminder
that these core democratic values must be protected worldwide.

The Committee notes that the Petro Administration has failed to
effectively utilize United States assistance in advancing shared
goals and objectives. Therefore, funds for Colombia are reduced by
50 percent from the fiscal year 2025 level for non-military assist-
ance.
Funds for Colombia are allocated according to the following table
and subject to section 7019 of this Act:
COLOMBIA
[Budget authority in thousands of dollars]
Account Budget Authority
National Security Investment Programs..................................................................................... $67,250
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement.............................................................. 103,000
Foreign Military Financing Program ........................................................................................... 38,525
Cuba
The Committee recommendation includes $35,000,000 for pro-
grams to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba. The Com-
mittee commends and supports the Administration’s renewed focus
on advancing democracy in Cuba. The Committee directs that not
less than $7,000,000 of such funds be made available for the NED.
The Committee endorses a refocusing on the state of freedom in
Cuba by all donors and implementers and encourages the Depart-
ment of State to consider the unique capabilities of the core insti-
tutes of the NED in implementing programs in Cuba.
Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996.—The
Committee directs that funds provided by this Act for Cuba democ-
racy programs shall only be used for programs and activities pursu-
ant to section 109(a) of the LIBERTAD Act of 1996 and section
1705 of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and shall not be used
for business promotion, economic reform, entrepreneurship, or any
other assistance that is not democracy building. In addition, the
Committee applies the same limitations to public diplomacy funds.
With respect to grantee selection and implementation, the Com-
mittee directs that democracy promotion grants exceeding
$1,000,000 shall only be awarded to organizations with experience
promoting democracy in Cuba.
Innovations.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
identify opportunities to support grants for innovative methods to
reach audiences inside Cuba.
Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB).—The Committee directs
$40,000,000 under International Broadcasting Operations and Cap-
ital Improvements be made available for OCB. The Committee is
concerned about the detrimental effect underfunding has had on
OCB’s operation during the preceding Administration. OCB is a
critical source of independent, outside information for the Cuban
population and is necessary to counter the Cuban regime’s propa-
ganda and oppression. The Committee expects to receive updates
on an ongoing basis.
Political prisoners.—The Committee remains concerned with the
conditions faced by over one thousand Cuban political prisoners
who remain wrongfully and arbitrarily detained by the Cuban re-
gime, including prominent artists and activists jailed before, dur-
ing, and after the July 11, 2021 protests. The Committee directs

the Department of State to provide a classified briefing, not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, for members of the Com-
mittees on Appropriations regarding United States efforts to secure
the unconditional release of political prisoners held by the Cuban
regime, including all communications to the Cuban regime de-
manding the releases.
Reports, Cuba
Confiscated property.—The Committee notes that title III of the
LIBERTAD Act of 1996 creates substantial legal liability and risk
for any entity, Cuban or otherwise, that traffics in property that
was confiscated by the Cuban regime. Title IV of such Act provides
the Secretary of State with the authority and responsibility to deny
visas to individuals determined to have trafficked in confiscated
property to which a United States national has a claim. Not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations documenting
how the Department of State is implementing the law related to
title IV, including the number of processed determination letters of
claimants in the last fiscal year, methods being utilized by the De-
partment to identify individuals suspected to be subject to visa
bans, and any additional actions being undertaken to achieve jus-
tice for those whose property was stolen.
Malign alliances.—The Committee remains concerned by the on-
going alliance between the regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ven-
ezuela, which continue to facilitate repression and undermine re-
gional stability. Not later than 120 days after enactment of this
Act, the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a re-
port on the scope and nature of cooperation between Cuba, Nica-
ragua, and Venezuela, identifying key enablers of their partner-
ship, United States policy options to address it, and opportunities
for enhanced regional coordination with like-minded allied govern-
ments.
Military collusion.—The Committee is concerned with continued
reports of Cuban participation in military exercises and training in
Belarus. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on Cuba’s involvement and contribution to Rus-
sia’s war in Ukraine.
Cuban doctors
The Committee firmly stands against the use of Cuban medical
professionals against their will in foreign countries. The scheme
under which the Cuban regime is compensated for the services of
their doctors is a form of modern-day slavery, as doctors are paid
low wages and prevented from leaving their assignments while re-
cipient countries benefit from this coerced transaction. Subsection
(e) applies restrictions to assistance for countries and organizations
that benefit from trafficked Cuban doctors, and the Committee di-
rects, pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this Act, the Secretary of
State to use authorities within section 7031(c) to restrict visas of
entities engaging in such practice. The Committee is concerned by
the exploitation of Cuban medical professionals in countries such
as Mexico, Qatar, South Africa, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Spain, de-

spite the well-documented violations of both domestic and inter-
national labor standards.
Cuban medical missions and visa restrictions.—The Committee
commends the Secretary of State for expanding the Cuba-related
visa restriction policy targeting individuals involved in the exploit-
ative Cuban labor export program, including those engaged in the
trafficking of Cuban medical professionals. The Committee directs
relevant regional bureaus to contribute region-specific data to the
report required in subsection (e)(1), covering countries where
Cuban medical personnel are deployed. The Committee further ex-
pects these bureaus to actively identify foreign individuals, and
their immediate family members, who may be subject to visa re-
strictions under the expanded policy due to their involvement in
the Cuban labor export program.
Irresponsible migration
Subsection (f) establishes a prohibition on assistance in con-
travention of Executive Order 14165, relating to Securing Our Bor-
ders, and Executive Order 14218, relating to Ending Taxpayer Sub-
sidization of Open Borders, including to any organization that mo-
bilizes, organizes, or encourages irresponsible migration. This pro-
hibition extends to the publication of materials and online informa-
tion about migrant caravans. For the purposes of this subsection,
prohibited activities include: (1) the provision of cash cards that are
usable in countries other than where they are provided; (2) legal
counseling on the United States asylum process; (3) referrals to
legal representation in the United States; and (4) assistance to lo-
cate housing or sponsors in the United States.
Reports, Irresponsible migration
Not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on the organization and funding of mass-migra-
tion caravans in the Western Hemisphere from 2020 through 2024.
Migration cooperation.—Not later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations on the Department of State’s utilization
of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
data, including ICE’s listing of countries that are uncooperative
with the agency, and how the information is weighed in allocating
foreign assistance.
Haiti
The Committee expresses deep concern regarding the ongoing de-
cline of the security situation in Haiti. The Committee supports
continued United States engagement in advancing stability relating
to security, health, economic development, and governance in Haiti.
The Committee recommends that the Department of State continue
building the capacity of the Haitian National Police to address
widespread gang violence and to seek innovative approaches to
support anti-gang initiatives. The Committee recognizes the De-
partment’s efforts to facilitate the deployment of a multinational
security support mission and underscores the importance of main-
taining regular communication with Congress regarding the status
of this effort, including alternative plans should deployment

timelines change. The Committee also encourages the Department
to explore opportunities to support the participation and promotion
of women in conflict resolution in Haiti.
In order to stem the flow of irregular migration into the United
States, the Committee directs funds be made available consistent
with prior years for the assembly of prefabricated maternal and
neonatal care hospital units within 10 kilometers of the border
with the Dominican Republic. The Committee directs these funds
with the intention of treating pregnant Haitian women in need of
delivery services who migrate towards the Dominican Republic. If
security conditions prevent new construction, the Committee en-
courages the use of these funds to support and expand maternal
and neonatal care clinics. The Committee notes the challenging se-
curity environment in Haiti for such programs and directs the Sec-
retary of State to consult with the Committees on Appropriations
not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act on implementa-
tion.
The Committee notes extensive challenges for transportation in
Haiti, including to respond to medical crises. The Committee en-
courages the Department of State to consider public-private part-
nerships in support of transportation solutions for life-threatening
health services and emergencies, including air-lift services.
The Committee notes that no funds were requested for the
Armed Forces of Haiti, and therefore, none are provided in this
Act.
Reports, Haiti
Not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on the security situation in Haiti. The report
shall include efforts to combat gang violence, prevent sexual vio-
lence against women and girls, protect minors, address human
rights abuses and accountability by all parties, and facilitate hu-
manitarian access.
Locally led organizations.—The Committee encourages the Sec-
retary of State to incorporate more locally led organizations in their
approach to the multi-layered crisis in Haiti. Local organizations
run by the diaspora population in the United States are also eager
to contribute, including in humanitarian assistance. Not later than
45 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a
report to the appropriate congressional committees on localization
and capacity-building efforts to assist in Haiti’s crisis and plans for
the current fiscal year.
Mexico
Countering radio jamming at the United States-Mexico border.—
The Committee is concerned by reports of persistent radio fre-
quency interference affecting law enforcement communications in
the Riverside area of El Paso, Texas, believed to originate from
Mexico. The Committee directs the Department of State to engage
with the Government of Mexico to address the issue.
Fentanyl and opioids.—The Committee strongly supports in-
creased focus and aggressive action from the Department of State
to address the flow of illegal opioids into the United States, includ-
ing: (1) programs to assist the Government of Mexico in securing

its borders and reducing poppy cultivation and heroin and syn-
thetic drug production; (2) programs to thwart transnational crimi-
nal organizations involved in the trafficking of heroin and fentanyl;
(3) diplomatic efforts to strengthen precursor chemical control and
training on international treaty obligations related to opioids; (4)
measures to strengthen the security of the international postal sys-
tem to prevent illegal shipments of opioids from entering the
United States, particularly from the PRC; and (5) global demand
reduction programs. The Committee supports the Administration’s
efforts to designate major drug trafficking organizations as foreign
terrorist organizations and urges increased coordination across rel-
evant agencies to target their financial and logistical networks.
Judicial and security institutions.—The Secretary of State shall
prioritize assistance made available for Mexico for capacity build-
ing within Mexican judicial and security institutions to combat
crime, especially crime associated with fentanyl, other narcotics
trafficking, and transnational crime syndicates.
Support for migration management.—The Committee supports
efforts to help strengthen Mexico’s refugee agencies to improve in-
take facilities and asylum case management and processing.
Violence prevention.—The Committee recommendation includes
funds for assistance for Mexico that supports programs to prevent
violence against women and girls that are carried out in coopera-
tion with Mexican federal and local authorities.
Vulcan Materials seizure.—The Committee finds the Government
of Mexico’s forcible seizure and occupation of Vulcan Materials an
affront to the bilateral relationship and a signal to United States
companies that private property and investment in Mexico is not
secure. Former President Lo´pez Obrador’s strong-armed takeover of
Vulcan’s port in Quintana Roo, a site of strategic relevance to the
United States economy and infrastructure, disregarded the rule of
law and endangered the safety and livelihoods of Vulcan employ-
ees. The Committee urges President Sheinbaum to reconsider the
hostile takeover of Vulcan Materials’ port and property and restore
operations to its rightful owners. The Committee further urges the
Department of State to intensify diplomatic engagement at the
highest levels to ensure the protection of United States invest-
ments abroad and to seek a prompt and just resolution to this mat-
ter.
Water deliveries.—The Committee notes that section 7045(h)
withholds all assistance provided by this Act to Mexico, unless the
Secretary of State certifies that Mexico is implementing agreed-
upon remedies to address the deficit of water deliveries to the
United States under Article 4, Section B of the 1944 Water Treaty.
Such deficit has led to severe water shortages in the southern
United States, particularly Texas, and has had a devastating im-
pact on American citizens and businesses in the region. The Com-
mittee further notes that this limitation does not apply to funds
made available to counter the flow of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors,
and other synthetic drugs into the United States.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to prioritize the
deficit of water deliveries to the United States in bilateral talks
with Mexico, including through the establishment of consistent
channels of communication to monitor and manage water resources
along the Rio Grande Basin, and engage with Congress and other

impacted stakeholders, including American agriculture associations
located along the Rio Grande Basin, in discussions toward resolu-
tion of this crisis. The Committee notes the importance, in such bi-
lateral talks, that the Government of Mexico acknowledge the ex-
treme hardship experienced by the agrarian economy in the United
States, which relies on predictable and timely water deliveries from
the Rio Grande. The Committee encourages the Secretary to advo-
cate for the expedient release of 550,000 acre-feet of water, or
more, from the Rio Grande as it would provide much needed relief
and demonstrate commitment to resetting United States-Mexico bi-
lateral relations.
Reports, Mexico
Vulcan Materials seizure.—Not later than 30 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall report to the appro-
priate congressional committees on the Government of Mexico’s po-
sition on the Vulcan Materials seizure. Further, not later than 60
days after enactment of this Act, the Department of State shall
provide the appropriate congressional committees with a strategy
to protect United States commercial interests, including the use of
diplomatic incentives and disincentives, to prevent further inter-
ference with American companies in Mexico.
Water deliveries.—Not later than 30 days after enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate
congressional committees on the status of negotiations with Mexico
over the deficit of water deliveries. The Secretary shall update such
report every 30 days until a resolution has been achieved and fully
briefed to Congress.
Nicaragua
The Committee remains concerned about violations of human
rights and religious liberty in Nicaragua, including the severe per-
secution of the Catholic Church, Catholic charitable organizations,
and Catholic educational organizations and strongly supports con-
tinued funding for democracy programs for the people of Nica-
ragua.
The Caribbean
Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.—Subsection (k) directs that
not less than $92,500,000 be made available for the Caribbean
Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) and prioritized for countries, such
as the Dominican Republic, that are most directly impacted by the
crisis in Haiti and are within the transit zone of illicit drug ship-
ments toward the United States. The Committee further directs
that funds appropriated under CBSI be used to provide, sustain,
and maintain necessary equipment, such as radars, boats, vehicles,
and helicopters, to partner countries that need such resources to
better detect and interdict illicit drug trafficking and investigate
and dismantle transnational criminal organizations. The Secretary
of State should consider utilizing the authority of section 516 of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to transfer similar excess defense
articles to partner countries in the region with such requirements.
Dominican Republic.—The Committee recognizes that the Do-
minican Republic, a key United States ally in the Americas, plays
a central role in building more secure supply chains integrated

with the United States market and in fighting corruption and drug
trafficking. The Committee applauds the effectiveness of such coun-
ternarcotics efforts, including through CBSI, and the steps taken to
confront public corruption and increase transparency in govern-
ment. The Committee supports increased bilateral cooperation to
address crime and violence, improve public safety and security,
support at-risk youth programs, and prosecute corruption. The
Committee continues to support basic education programs in the
Dominican Republic.
Latin American and Caribbean open-source research initiative.—
The Committee supports the vision and goals of the Latin Amer-
ican and Caribbean open-source research initiative, including the
purpose of housing a secure, virtual technology platform that facili-
tates information sharing and enhances United States-Latin Amer-
ican research and analytics collaboration.
Loan guarantee authority.—The Committee supports the provi-
sion of loan guarantees to Costa Rica, Panama, and Small Island
Developing States in the Caribbean. The Committee further notes
that it will support funds being made available to support such
guarantees upon enactment of necessary authorizing legislation.
Preparedness for natural disasters.—The Committee directs not
less than the prior year level for programs to strengthen prepared-
ness for natural disasters in the Caribbean.
Reports, The Caribbean
CBSI.—Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the
Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations on the uses of all funds provided for
the CBSI on a country-by-country basis for each program, project,
and activity for fiscal years 2024 through 2025. Such information
shall be integrated into the ForeignAssistance.gov website, as ap-
propriate.
Dry port.—The Committee urges the Department of State to help
develop and support the concept of a dry port in the Dominican Re-
public near its border with Haiti to increase the capacity to safely
deliver vital supplies and respond to natural disasters, humani-
tarian crises, and health emergencies in the Dominican Republic or
Haiti. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations
a report on developing and supporting a dry port in the Dominican
Republic.
Venezuela
TdA.—The Committee is concerned by the proliferation of TdA,
a violent transnational criminal organization originating in Ven-
ezuela and now active across the Western Hemisphere. The Com-
mittee notes the recent designation of TdA as an FTO and urges
a coordinated response from the executive branch to disrupt the or-
ganization’s illicit activities. The Committee further recommends
that the Secretary of State strengthen diplomatic and law enforce-
ment partnerships with governments in the region to dismantle
TdA’s networks. Not later than 180 days after enactment of this
Act, the Secretary shall brief the Committees on Appropriations on
efforts undertaken to counter this threat.

Tracking assets belonging to the Venezuelan people.—The Com-
mittee notes that the United States remains committed to identi-
fying and tracking assets taken from the people of Venezuela
through theft, corruption, money laundering, and other illicit
means. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to continue
working to return these funds to the Venezuelan people, who have
been victimized by the Maduro regime.
Venezuela displacement.—The Committee continues to support
Venezuelans fleeing political repression in Venezuela and directs
the Department of State to prioritize programs to prevent violence,
abuse, and exploitation, with an emphasis on the protection of
women and children. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to urge other donors, including the European Union,
to make more substantial commitments to help neighboring coun-
tries deliver needed humanitarian services to migrants who have
fled Venezuela.
Other, Latin America and the Caribbean
Argentina.—The Committee recognizes Argentina as a demo-
cratic ally and a key partner in the Southern Cone. The Committee
supports efforts to strengthen bilateral engagement with the Gov-
ernment of Argentina across a range of shared national security in-
terests. The Committee encourages the Department of State to
deepen cooperation in areas including countering human trafficking
through programs under the Department’s INL framework and en-
ergy sector governance and market reforms that support regional
and global energy security. The Committee notes recent Foreign
Military Financing Program support in connection with Argentina’s
acquisition of F-16 aircraft and supports consideration of additional
assistance to support continued implementation of that agreement.
Ecuador.—The Committee notes that Ecuador remains a key
partner of the United States in the Andean region and, therefore,
supports continued assistance for Ecuador to: combat narcotics
trafficking, transnational crime, and terrorism; strengthen demo-
cratic institutions and the rule of law; promote economic develop-
ment, which requires reliable, utility-scale power generation; and
support migration management. The Committee urges coordination
within the interagency to ensure this assistance advances regional
security and aligns with United States strategic interests. The
Committee directs not less than the prior year levels under Inter-
national Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Foreign Mili-
tary Financing Program to support counternarcotics efforts and
other national security priorities of the United States and to foster
greater military interoperability with the United States.
Paraguay.—The Committee recognizes Paraguay as a reliable
democratic partner in the Southern Cone and supports continued
and increased assistance to advance shared security and govern-
ance objectives. This includes efforts to combat narcotics traf-
ficking, transnational crime, and corruption; strengthen the rule of
law and democratic institutions; and promote economic develop-
ment and energy sector modernization. The Committee supports
enhanced assistance through the International Narcotics Control
and Law Enforcement and Foreign Military Financing Program ac-
counts to counter illicit networks, improve border security, and fos-
ter greater interoperability with United States forces. The Com-

mittee encourages close interagency coordination to ensure such as-
sistance aligns with United States strategic interests and regional
stability.
Peru.—The Committee supports the allocation of funds appro-
priated under titles III and IV of this Act for assistance for Peru,
in order to strengthen democratic institutions, advance the rule of
law, combat corruption, manage natural resources, counter nar-
cotics trafficking, including through eradication of illicit coca crops,
and efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations that
threaten United States national security. The Committee also sup-
ports enhanced bilateral economic and security cooperation. This
includes increased assistance above prior-year levels under the
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Foreign
Military Financing Program accounts to counter narcotics and
other national security priorities of the United States and to foster
greater military interoperability with the United States.

Section 60:
Section 7046 (Europe and Eurasia)
This section includes language substantively the same as the
prior year regarding Europe and Eurasia.
Belarus.—The Committee directs that funds made available for
Belarus may only be made available for democracy programs, in-
cluding political party strengthening, and to combat human traf-
ficking. The Committee further directs that funds be made avail-
able at not less than the prior year level for such programs.
Broadcasting.—The Committee continues to support Belarusian
language services including to combat censorship practices by au-
thoritarian regimes.
Burden sharing.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to continually assess the extent to which allies in Europe are meet-
ing their NATO commitments on defense burden sharing and rec-
ommends that the Secretary calibrate the provision of United
States foreign assistance to help ensure that such benchmarks are
met. The Committee is concerned that Spain has not committed to
the pledge that other NATO member states have taken to raise de-
fense spending to 5 percent of GDP, with 3.5 percent dedicated to
core military capabilities, and urges the Government of Spain to
meet the allied commitment to NATO’s updated capability targets.
Croatia.—The Committee recognizes the important relationship
between the United States and the Republic of Croatia and encour-
ages the Secretary of State to continue efforts to strengthen the bi-
lateral relationship, including through emphasis on deepening mu-
tually beneficial economic ties.
Cyprus.—The Committee supports full implementation of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and its
contributions to create a conducive environment for settlement
talks. Should reunification occur, the Committee supports funding
for mechanisms to monitor and facilitate settlement of outstanding
issues in support of peace. Funds for the United States-assessed
cost of the UNFICYP are provided under Contributions for Inter-
national Peacekeeping Activities at the statutory cap of 25 percent.
Energy security for allies and partners.—The Committee recog-
nizes that energy security is essential for United States national
security and the security of our allies. The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to prioritize financing for diversified non-Rus-

sian sources of energy, including liquefied natural gas, to Europe
and other allies, to reduce dependence on energy imports from the
Russian Federation.
European policy on Cuba.—The Committee supports the shared
goal of the United States and Europe to coordinate with allies and
partners to isolate the Russian Federation and its sources of fi-
nancing and facilitation of its war in Ukraine. The Committee re-
mains deeply concerned by long-standing diplomatic, economic, and
security ties between Russia and Cuba. In furtherance of efforts to
cut off Russia’s sources of financing and facilitation of its continued
brutal attacks against Ukraine, the Committee urges European al-
lies and partners to review their diplomatic and economic relations
with the Cuban regime and recognize the same aspirations of free-
dom and democracy for the Cuban people. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to increase diplomatic efforts
to coordinate with countries in Europe to achieve such objectives
and ensure consistency of transatlantic priorities to defend freedom
and democracy both in Europe and the dictatorships in the West-
ern Hemisphere, particularly in Cuba.
Exchange programs.—The Committee continues to support funds
being made available for the Pawel Adamowicz Exchange Program
and the Congress-Bundestag Exchange Program.
Funding reports.—The committee directs the Secretary of State
to provide to Members of Congress, on request, such information as
may be available to the Department and appropriate to release re-
garding foreign assistance grants by non-United States donors to
nongovernmental organizations funded by the United States in the
European Union.
Greece.—The Committee welcomes increased cooperation between
the United States and Greece and encourages the Secretary of
State to deepen engagement between public and private institu-
tions in the United States and Greece. The Committee directs that
funds consistent with the prior year level are made available for
Greece under International Military Education and Training. In
addition, the Committee directs the Secretary to facilitate meetings
of the Interparliamentary Group established by the United States-
Greece Defense and Interparliamentary Partnership Act of 2021
(subtitle B of Public Law 117–81).
Income tax treaties.—The Committee encourages the Secretary of
State, in coordination with other relevant Federal agencies as ap-
propriate, to reexamine the potentially negative impacts that alter-
ing, suspending, or eliminating established income tax treaties has
on NATO allies.
Nordic exchanges.—The Committee directs funding at not less
than the prior year level be made available under National Secu-
rity Investment Programs to support exchanges of United States
and Nordic country professionals and experts to share talent and
knowledge in support of integrated deterrence, maritime security
and transportation, Arctic security, emerging and dual-use tech-
nologies, such as AI, 6G, and quantum computing, and other key
strategic areas of bilateral interest. The Secretary of State shall
consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to the design
and implementation of such program.

that with the growing challenge from the PRC the military facili-
ties on the island of Diego Garcia are central to Anglo-American
power projection and relative control of the Indian Ocean. Recog-
nizing the invaluable strategic importance and geographic rel-
evance of Diego Garcia to the United States, the Committee en-
courages the Secretary of State to engage with His Majesty’s Gov-
ernment of the United Kingdom to ensure our long-term access to
the facilities and that they remain integral to allied security.
Reports
Abducted children.—The Committee supports funds from Na-
tional Security Investment Programs being made available to sup-
port ongoing efforts for the collection, analysis, and preservation of
evidence related to the forcible abduction and transfer of children
to the Russian Federation. The Secretary of State is directed to up-
date the report required under this heading in House Report 118–
146, including amounts and status of funding programmed for the
documentation of Russia’s forcible abduction and deportation of
children from neighboring countries.
European policy on Cuba.—Not later than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit an update to the re-
port required under this heading in House Report 118–146 on ef-
forts to urge European countries to diminish diplomatic, trade, and
other financial ties with the Cuban dictatorship.
Greenland.—The Committee notes Greenland’s increased
geostrategic role in global security, including as a source of critical
minerals and rare earth elements. Not later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State is directed to report
to the Committees on Appropriations on United States efforts to
collaborate with Greenland to help facilitate investment by Amer-
ican firms in its mining sector.
Romania.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, on steps taken by the Government of
Romania and the Department of State to restore confiscated church
property to legal owners.
Slovakia.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than
90 days after enactment of this Act, on steps taken by the Depart-
ment to urge the Government of the Slovak Republic to cease ex-
propriating properties owned by Hungarians or Germans based on
WWII-era confiscation orders originally issued under Slovak Na-
tional Council Regulation No. 104/1945 and the Benesˇ Decrees.
Turkey.—The Committee is concerned about the longstanding
ties between Turkey and Hamas, which includes Turkey hosting
senior Hamas figures as well as providing political and other forms
of assistance to the terrorist group. Not later than 90 days after en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs the Department of State
to brief the appropriate congressional committees on the relation-
ship between Turkey and Hamas.

Section 61:
Section 7047 (Countering Russian Influence and Aggression)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding programs to counter Russian influence and aggression.

Section 62:
Section 7048 (United Nations and Other International Organiza-
tions)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
lating to conditions on funds for the United Nations and other
international organizations.
Accountability report.—In carrying out the requirement of sub-

Section 63:
section (a), the Secretary of State shall also consider and report on
efforts to combat antisemitism. The report shall include a section
on anti-Israel bias and antisemitism within the United Nations
system, including specific instances across United Nations entities,
such as those referenced in title I of House Report 116–444. It shall
assess whether such bias arises from member state actions or sys-
temic behavior within the United Nations, including that of staff,
consultants, and appointed experts. The report shall also evaluate
institutional practices that may compromise neutrality toward
Israel, including, but not limited to: public statements by United
Nations personnel, including on social media; the hiring or appoint-
ment of individuals with known prejudicial or hostile views toward
Israel; and procedural mechanisms that disproportionately target
or isolate Israel within United Nations bodies.
Further, the report shall include an assessment of the United
Nations Action Plan to Enhance Monitoring and Response to Anti-
semitism. The report shall include recommendations on steps the
United Nations should take to revise and strengthen its approach
to combating antisemitism, including enforcing a clear and action-
able definition of antisemitism and accountability mechanisms
within its institutions, including for staff.
International courts.—The Committee strongly condemns and un-
equivocally rejects one-sided, politicized, anti-Israel activity at the
ICC and the ICJ and prohibits funds provided in this Act and prior
acts for such courts. The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to prioritize diplomatic efforts to prevent any further efforts to
weaponize the ICC and ICJ against Israel. The Committee further
endorses the Secretary’s designation of four ICC judges under Ex-
ecutive Order 14203, relating to Imposing Sanctions on the Inter-
national Criminal Court, which imposed sanctions for their direct
involvement in unauthorized investigations and prosecutions of
United States and Israeli nationals.
International organizations.—The Committee recommendation
does not include funds for the United Nations Environment Pro-
gramme, United Nations Special Rapporteurs, or World Economic
Forum.
United Nations anti-Israel agenda.—The Committee urges the
Secretary of State to declare it is the policy of the United States
to veto one-sided, anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations Se-
curity Council.
United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).—The Com-
mittee notes the continued lack of progress at UNHRC towards
meaningful reforms to restore its credibility as a human rights
body. UNHRC continues to elevate, legitimize, and shield the worst
human rights offenders while simultaneously targeting Israel for

unjustified scrutiny. Therefore, the Committee recommendation
prohibits funds to UNHRC.
Subsection (d) prohibits funds in this Act and prior acts making
appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and
related programs for the United Nations International Commission
of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Je-
rusalem, and Israel.
The Committee endorses the designation of the United Nations
Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on the Situation of
Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories Occupied since 1967,
pursuant to Executive Order 14203, relating to Imposing Sanctions
on the International Criminal Court. The Committee notes the des-
ignation was triggered by attempts to abuse the mechanisms of the
ICC in a manner that undermines United States national security.
United Nations procurement reform.—Subsection (j) prohibits
funds in this Act and prior acts from being used to purchase goods
or services contracted from companies in the Russian Federation,
including any shell companies. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to promote fair and transparent procurement prac-
tices at the United Nations, including no longer evaluating procure-
ment bids under lowest-cost and technically compliant criteria,
which benefits Russian companies that are historically among the
cheapest providers.
UNRWA.—Subsection (e) prohibits voluntary contributions and
assessed funds for UNRWA. The Committee notes that UNRWA
has been compromised by staff who have promoted incitement to
violence, antisemitism, and the destruction of the State of Israel.
The Committee is concerned by UNRWA’s relationship with Hamas
and other terrorist organizations, including credible allegations
that several UNRWA staff participated in the October 7, 2023 mas-
sacre that killed over 1,200 people, including American citizens,
and was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
Further, the Committee is concerned by the use of UNRWA facili-
ties to shield Hamas infrastructure, such as the Hamas data center
under UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters.
The Committee notes allegations that significant numbers of
UNRWA staff celebrated the October 7, 2023, massacre on social
media and that many UNRWA staff, including school principals
and senior UNRWA management, are also members of terrorist or-
ganizations that violently oppress the Palestinian people, including
by using them as human shields.
The Committee further notes that the OIG has obtained evidence
implicating UNRWA staff and resources in the October 7, 2023, at-
tacks, which may have been implicated by a United Nations Office
of Internal Oversight Services report the United Nations, including
UNWRA, has refused to share unredacted. Any United Nations
personnel who provided material support to terrorist entities must
be held fully accountable, including through United States courts
and administrative proceedings without claim to functional immu-
nity.
Reports
PRC’s status as a developing nation.—The Committee notes that,
under various international agreements, the PRC enjoys developing
nation status, a distinction that affords preferential treatment in

international agreements relating to climate change and multi-
national trade. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit an update
to the report required under this heading in House Report 118–146
on the ways in which the PRC benefits from developing nation sta-
tus, how this status could undermine United States interests do-
mestically and abroad, and what actions the Secretary is taking to
advocate for the termination of the PRC’s developing nation status
in current and future international agreements.
Transparency and accountability.—Not later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act, and in accordance with subsection (b), the
Secretary of State shall report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions on whether international organizations, including the United
Nations, its specialized agencies, and regional and Inter-American
organizations, which receive assessed and voluntary contributions
from the United States, are meeting the required transparency and
accountability standards. For the purposes of this subsection, the
term ‘‘international organizations’’ shall mean international organi-
zations that were funded under Contributions to International Or-
ganizations and International Organizations and Programs in prior
acts.
United Nations procurement reform.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall report to
the appropriate congressional committees on progress made in re-
forming United Nations procurement to adopt a request for pro-
posals approach, which considers pricing, experience, technical ca-
pacity, and other factors.
UNRWA assistance and transition.—Not later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report
to the appropriate congressional committees detailing the total
amount of United States assistance provided to UNRWA from Jan-
uary 20, 2021, to January 20, 2025. The report shall also include
any known instances in which such assistance was diverted to, or
used by, terrorist organizations, including Hamas or Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad, or paid the salary of UNRWA staff who were members
of such organizations. In addition, the report shall include a transi-
tion plan for providing assistance in the Middle East without direct
or indirect funding to, or support from, UNRWA.

Section 64:
Section 7049 (America First Opportunity Fund)
The Committee recommendation includes $1,700,000,000 for the
America First Opportunity Fund from funds made available under
National Security Investment Programs, International Narcotics
Control and Law Enforcement, Peacekeeping Operations, and For-
eign Military Financing Program. The America First Opportunity
Fund is intended to allow the Secretary of State to respond rapidly
and flexibly to new and unforeseen opportunities and challenges
when they arise. The Committee expects that the Secretary will
use the America First Opportunity Fund to leverage foreign assist-
ance resources to make America safer, stronger, and more pros-
perous.
Funds for the America First Opportunity Fund are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

Section 65:
Section 7050 (Internet Freedom)
This section includes language modified from the prior year for
internet freedom.
Internet freedom initiatives play a critical role in countering ris-
ing tides of digital authoritarianism at a time of unprecedented ex-
pansion in global internet connectivity. The Committee encourages
the Department of State to strengthen programs that support
democratic norms within adversarial, anti-American countries that
obstruct internet access.
The Committee underscores the importance of opposing authori-
tarian censorship practices, including those that suppress political
dissent, manipulate online information, or restrict access to inde-
pendent content. Such authoritarian practices, whether carried out
by foreign adversaries or within democratic societies, undermine
the principles of free speech and the free flow of information, both
of which are essential for a healthy democracy. The Committee
supports efforts to ensure that internet freedom programs reflect a
consistent commitment to these American values.
The Committee notes the internet restrictions, content censor-
ship, and mobile network disruptions imposed by Cuba and Iran.
The Committee supports continued partnership between the De-
partment of State and other relevant Federal agencies on the use
of innovative technologies and creative actions to increase access.
Secure internet access and digital censorship circumvention tech-
nologies.—The Committee directs that $43,500,000 be made avail-
able for secure internet access and digital censorship circumvention
technologies to carry out section 1299P of the William M. (Mac)
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2021 (title XII of division A of Public Law 116–283).
Report
Internet freedom in Iran.—The Committee directs the Secretary
of State, not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, to sub-
mit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on the
progress of programs promoting internet access and internet free-
dom in Iran, as part of the comprehensive strategy required by sec-
tion 414 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act
of 2012 (Public Law 112–158). The report shall also include an up-
date on the implementation of the Iran internet freedom grant pro-
gram authorized in section 5124 of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).

nation.

able by this Act for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
and any foreign nongovernmental organization that promotes or
performs abortion, with certain exceptions.

Section 73:
Section 7058 (Global Health Activities)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding global health activities.
PEPFAR transition strategy.—The Committee recognizes
PEPFAR’s profound impact in the fight against HIV/AIDS, which
continues to make America safer from disease through the success-
ful improvement of health systems and promotion of a more robust
investment climate for American business through increased eco-
nomic growth in countries with PEPFAR programs. The Committee
notes that although nearly 60 percent of all HIV-related spending
globally in 2023 came from domestic sources, rather than external
donor support, United States funding for such efforts should not
continue in perpetuity, and that many countries are well positioned
to begin transitioning off such assistance. The Committee expects
that any transition strategy shall be guided foremost by the imper-
ative to safeguard the lives, health, and safety of beneficiaries, en-
suring that gains made in HIV/AIDS response are not reversed
during or after the transition process.
Pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary of State shall submit to
the appropriate congressional committees, not later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act, a comprehensive strategy to guide the
structured transition of PEPFAR-supported programs to country-
led ownership. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary shall consult with such committees on the compo-
nents of such strategy. The Committee directs that the strategy be

developed in consultation with implementing agencies, partner gov-
ernments at the national—and where possible, the subnational
level, faith-and community-based organizations, and the private
sector.
In developing such strategy, the Secretary shall consider:
(1) a phased approach for reducing reliance upon United
States bilateral funding in countries deemed ready for transi-
tion, informed by clearly defined, transparent economic and
programmatic criteria benchmarks;
(2) an annual country readiness assessment based on the de-
velopment of transition compacts that define clear roles and re-
sponsibilities, milestones, and projected annual funding reduc-
tions for PEPFAR-supported activities;
(3) a plan to coordinate United States Government global
health investments including grants and loans, United States
Development Finance Institutions’ participation, as well as en-
gagement with multilateral development banks and inter-
national partners to leverage co-financing mechanisms;
(4) a framework to sustain the role of faith-based and com-
munity-based service providers;
(5) a plan to engage the private sector as key actors within
the transition strategy; and
(6) guidance for the maintenance, integration, and national-
ization of data systems used for performance tracking, over-
sight, and accountability.

Section 74:
Section 7059 (Women’s Equality and Empowerment)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding programs that support women’s equality and empower-
ment.
The Committee has, on a bipartisan basis, provided support for
programs contained in this section for over a decade and continues
to support the equality and empowerment of women and girls
around the world. The Committee remains concerned by actions
taken in previous years utilizing funds from prior acts to advance
controversial agendas, which undermined bipartisan support for
women’s empowerment programs.
Consistent with the requirements included under Global Health
Programs and in section 7018 of this Act, any funds made available
to protect the rights of women and girls worldwide shall not be con-
strued to include a right to abortion. The Secretary of State is di-
rected to review guidance for Department of State personnel, as
well as for implementing partners, with respect to the application
of requirements under Global Health Programs and section 7018 of
this Act to ensure full compliance with such requirements in car-
rying out the purposes of this section. The Committee expects that
guidance and training associated with such requirements will en-
sure full awareness by implementing partners that funds made
available by this Act are prohibited from being used to lobby for
or against abortion.
The Committee acknowledges the important role that Village
Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA) play in advancing women’s
economic empowerment, financial inclusion, and financial security,
and urges the Secretary of State to support VSLAs in food security,
global health, and other development and humanitarian program-

ming. The Secretary should ensure United States-funded VSLA ini-
tiatives seek to address the root causes of women’s economic
disempowerment, financial insecurity, and financial dependence.
The Committee supports the Secretary of State’s efforts to ensure
that promoting women’s empowerment is a priority across the De-
partment of State. Not later than 45 days after enactment of this
Act, the Secretary shall consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on plans to implement this section and other policies related
to women and girls following the Department’s reorganization.
Reports
Adolescent girls.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to submit to the appropriate congressional committees, not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, a report on the actions
taken over the previous 12 months to: (1) reduce the incidence of
child, early, and forced marriage and female genital mutilation and
cutting; (2) address the needs of already married adolescent girls;
(3) promote equal access to education for girls; (4) ensure protection
of adolescent girls in humanitarian responses; (5) address the im-
pacts of food insecurity on adolescent girls; and (6) train relevant
staff on the specific challenges and needs of adolescent girls.
Transparency and accountability.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to submit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on all
funding made available in fiscal year 2025 for the Gender Equity
and Equality Action Fund, which shall include program descrip-
tions, geographic scope, funding levels, accounts, and prime and
sub-partners. The sub-partner information shall indicate the prime
partner for each activity.
Violence in humanitarian crises.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the alarming rates of violence against women and
girls in humanitarian crises and directs continued funding to pre-
vent such violence. The Committee directs the Secretary of State,
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, to update the
report required under this heading in House Report 118–146 on the
steps taken to address violence against women and girls in human-
itarian emergencies.

Section 75:
Section 7060 (Sector Allocations)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding assistance for programs related to basic education, higher
education, conservation, food security and agriculture development,
combating human trafficking, and water and sanitation.
Basic education
The Committee directs not less than $737,600,000 for basic edu-
cation programs in this Act. Pursuant to division A of Public Law
115–56, as reauthorized by section 7812 of Public Law 118–159,
the United States Government promotes quality basic education in
partner countries by seeking to expand access to basic education
for all children and measurably improve the quality of basic edu-
cation and learning outcomes. The Committee supports continued
investments in the Global Partnership for Education and Education
Cannot Wait (ECW) at not less than the prior year level and recog-
nizes that these organizations leverage additional funding from

other donors and complement bilateral efforts to address inter-
national basic education needs, including ensuring children have
access to education in crisis settings. The Committee expects that
funds provided to ECW should be derived from funding accounts in
a manner consistent with prior years.
Higher education
Subsection (a)(2) directs that $50,000,000 shall be used to sup-
port institutions of higher education in countries experiencing eco-
nomic crisis. In implementing such directive, the term ‘‘countries
impacted by economic crises’’ shall include countries, such as Leb-
anon, whose economies are adversely affected by: political insta-
bility; conflict, including in neighboring countries; or catastrophic
manmade disasters. The Secretary of State shall consult with the
Committees on Appropriations prior to the initial obligation of
funds on the proposed use of such funds.
Conservation
The Committee recommendation includes $292,600,000 for con-
servation programs, $100,000,000 for the United States Foundation
for International Conservation, and $95,000,000 to combat
transnational the threat of wildlife poaching and trafficking.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.—The Com-
mittee directs the Bureau of Oceans and International Environ-
mental and Scientific Affairs to ensure the timely submission of the
Maritime-SAFE Interagency Working Group’s report on efforts to
combat IUU fishing. The report should specifically address sub-
working group activities in the Western Pacific region, including
Guam, that contribute to the protection of marine ecosystems and
sustainable fisheries.
Agriculture
The Committee directs not less than $768,000,000 for food secu-
rity and agriculture development as authorized by the Global Food
Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–195). The Committee sup-
ports Feed the Future’s comprehensive approach to combating glob-
al food insecurity and promoting market-led economic growth, and
notes the direct benefit on food security in the United States, such
as protecting American crops and herds from damaging diseases
that would have severe negative economic impacts on the United
States.
Agricultural research.—The Committee directs not less than
$175,000,000 be made available for international agricultural re-
search, of which $72,000,000 is for the Feed the Future Innovation
Labs. The Committee directs that the request level for agricultural
research and development initiatives be designated in the CBJ for
fiscal year 2027.
American technology.—The Committee supports efforts to ensure
there are modern storage facilities for grains, produce, and perish-
ables along with efficient distribution systems available in recipient
countries to prevent spoilage or waste and strongly encourages
these recipient countries to utilize American food security tech-
nologies and management systems that enhance post-harvest food
safety and security.

Programs to combat trafficking in persons
The Committee directs not less than $111,000,000 for activities
to combat trafficking in persons internationally, including for the
Program to End Modern Slavery.
Funds made available pursuant to subsection (d)(1) to combat
human trafficking should be obligated and programmed consistent
with country-specific recommendations included in the annual TIP
report as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000
(Public Law 106–386) and shall be coordinated with the Office to
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. For the purposes of
subsection (d), the term ‘‘Tier 3 country’’ means a country on the
list of countries required under section 110(b)(1)(C) of the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107(b)(1)(C)).
Child protection compacts.—The Committee directs $12,500,000
be made available under International Narcotics Control and Law
Enforcement for child protection compacts. Funds should be
prioritized for countries with the greatest need.
Combating child exploitation.—The Committee supports efforts of
international law enforcement partners, such as the International
Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), to address child exploi-
tation, including technology-facilitated exploitation, and strengthen
investigations and directs funds be made available for such efforts.
Combating human trafficking in Latin America and the Carib-
bean.—The Committee directs $3,500,000 be made available under
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement for partner-
ships between nongovernmental organizations and the Organiza-
tion of American States to combat human trafficking in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
Combating ritualized murder and organ trafficking.—The Com-
mittee directs $3,500,000 be made available under International
Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement for the purpose of com-
bating ritualized murder of children and organ trafficking in Afri-
ca. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations on the number of incidents, investigations, and prosecu-
tions of organ trafficking and ritualized murder in Africa and cor-
responding data on Department of State-funded programs training
authorities to interdict on such matters in Africa.
Global consortium.—The Committee notes the significant dis-
parity between the estimated number of human trafficking victims
globally and the number of human trafficking prosecutions. The
Committee also recognizes the importance of ensuring that human
trafficking prosecutions are conducted with a victim-centric ap-
proach. The Committee supports efforts to increase funds for pros-
ecuting human trafficking cases, including support for global net-
works and consortia of higher education that exchange best prac-
tices. Funds allocated for such purposes shall be designated in the

recommendation does not include funds for the Montreal Protocol
Multilateral Fund, the Adaptation Fund, or the United Nations

quired in subsection (c) is not possible, the Comptroller General
shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations explain-
ing the reasons why climate change programs lack a measurable
impact on global temperatures, including an analysis of any under-
lying assumptions or methodologies that rely on implausible or in-
accurate scenarios and models rendering such programs
unquantifiable or directed toward outcomes that may not be
achievable or substantiated by empirical evidence.

Section 77:
Section 7062 (Budget Documents)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
quiring operating and spend plans for certain funds appropriated
by this Act.

Section 78:
Section 7063 (Reorganization)

as carried in the prior year, concerning consultation, notification,

sistent with section 7034(h)(6) of this Act.

The Committee directs the Department of State OIG to leverage
the expertise of personnel from the OIG funded under Title II in
prior acts with respect to material support to terrorists, as the of-
fice integrates into the Department of State. The Committee notes
such expertise is required to ensure sufficient oversight in high-
risk environments, such as Gaza, including to detect the presence
of designated terrorists within implementing organizations. The
Committee expects that any individual employed by a United
States-funded entity who is determined to be a member of a des-
ignated terrorist organization—or who knowingly employed such
individuals—shall be referred expeditiously for appropriate admin-
istrative suspension and debarment proceedings, in accordance
with applicable regulations.

Section 81:
Section 7066 (United Nations Relief Works Agency Oversight and
Justice for Victims)
The Committee is gravely concerned by credible reports that
UNRWA employed individuals linked to Hamas, has a long history
of supporting terrorist groups, and employed staff who murdered
American citizens on October 7, 2023. The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to initiate urgent reforms to multilateral over-
sight and any relevant certification for its multilateral partners,
with full accountability to American victims and their families. The
Committee rejects the United Nations Secretary General’s claim of
immunity for terrorism, atrocities, or corruption and supports the
directives in subsections (a) through (c), regarding evidence preser-
vation, Department of Justice referrals, and withholding funds
until accountability is ensured. The Department of State shall reg-
ularly update the appropriate congressional committees of efforts to
carry out justice on behalf of the American victims and their sur-
viving families.
The Committee directs that, for the purposes of this section, the
term ‘‘individuals or entities implicated in such events by such
findings’’ shall include any United Nations official, contractor, or
subcontractor who has materially supported, including through em-
ployment, members of a United States-designated terrorist organi-
zation, or who has mismanaged United States contributions in a
manner that enabled such individuals to carry out any act in sup-
port of such terrorist organization, commit mass atrocities, or cause
harm to United States citizens.

Section 82:
Section 7067 (Additional Limitations on Operations and Assistance)
This section includes new limitations on the use of funds appro-
priated or otherwise made available by this Act for certain oper-
ations expenses and assistance programs and activities.

Section 83:
Section 7068 (Rescissions)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
scinding unobligated balances from prior year appropriations.

CHANGES IN THE APPLICATION OF EXISTING LAW
Pursuant to clause 3(f)(1)(A) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the following statements are submitted
describing the effect of provisions in the accompanying bill that di-
rectly or indirectly change the application of existing law.
Language is included in various parts of the bill to continue on-
going activities in fiscal year 2026 that require annual authoriza-
tion or additional legislation, which to date has not been enacted.
The bill includes provisions that place limitations on the use of
funds in the bill or change existing limitations and that might
under some circumstances be construed as changing the application
of existing law. The bill includes a number of provisions that have
been virtually unchanged for many years, which are technically
considered legislation. The bill provides that several of the appro-
priations shall remain available for obligation beyond the current
fiscal year. In all cases, it is deemed desirable to carry such lan-
guage in order to provide for orderly administration of such pro-
grams and effective use of funds. In various places in the bill, the
Committee recommendation continues the prior year practice of
designating amounts within appropriation accounts in order to
fund specific programs and has adjusted some designations.
The bill contains general provisions and other language that
have been carried in the bill in past years that include limitations
and conditions on funding provided in this Act.
Additional changes in the fiscal year 2026 bill, which may be con-
strued as changing existing law, are as follows:

ADDITIONAL VIEWS
The first six months of the Trump Administration have inflicted
unprecedented damage on the United States’ diplomacy, develop-
ment, and humanitarian infrastructure. The Fiscal Year 2026 Na-
tional Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appro-
priations bill fails to repair that damage—and instead marks a
dangerous and short-sighted retreat from America’s longstanding
leadership in global engagement, development, and humanitarian
response.
Rather than meeting this moment with resolve, strategy, and in-
vestment, the bill before us would continue to dismantle the very
tools that have long safeguarded U.S. interests, promoted global
stability, and embodied our nation’s values abroad.
Across the world, American diplomats, development officers, pub-
lic health experts, and humanitarian responders—many formerly
at the United States Agency for International Development—serve
on the frontlines of crisis and opportunity. These men and women
represent our country in some of the most volatile regions on
Earth: delivering vaccines in the Congo, educating girls in Ethi-
opia, and supporting Syrian children in Jordan. They are patriots
who deserve not just our gratitude—but the resources they need to
continue their life-saving work.
This bill offers neither. Instead, it embraces isolation and under-
investment, proceeding to hollow out the very institutions that
have made America a global leader. These cuts don’t just harm
communities in far-off places—they have direct consequences for
our own constituents: undermining economic growth, health secu-
rity, and national defense.
The bill slashes the international affairs budget by a staggering
22%, eliminating $13 billion from programs that fight poverty, pre-
vent conflict, and build economic resilience. It decimates develop-
ment assistance and slashes humanitarian programs by 42%. It
cuts support for essential multilateral institutions like UNICEF,
the World Bank, and the World Health Organization weakening
our ability to shape the global agenda and painting the United
States as an unreliable partner.
As the United States retreats, China and Russia rush to fill the
void—armed with cash, weapons, and propaganda. They are forg-
ing strategic alliances, gaining access to critical minerals, expand-
ing military influence, and reshaping international norms in ways
that threaten U.S. interests and democratic values. China is build-
ing ports, railways, and digital networks with strings attached,
while Russia exploits instability to strengthen its authoritarian
reach. As we defund public diplomacy tools like Voice of America,
China floods the airwaves with state-sponsored messaging designed
to undermine democracy and promote its authoritarian model. The
vacuum the United States leaves behind becomes a breeding
(161)

ground for extremism, corruption, and instability—undermining
global security and diminishing American influence for generations
to come.
The bill escalates attacks on women’s reproductive freedom.
Today, 218 million women around the world still lack access to the
tools to determine whether and when to grow their families. Hun-
dreds of thousands die each year in childbirth. Yet this bill would
make it even harder for women to access care deeply underfunding
contraceptive care—denying women basic reproductive health serv-
ices that are critical for their lives and futures. And, it eliminates
funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), one of
the only partners reaching mothers and babies in the hardest-to-
reach places.
Across ports and warehouses around the world, millions of dol-
lars’ worth of U.S.-funded food and contraceptives are waiting to be
incinerated—the result of incompetence, mismanagement, and ex-
treme ideology. More than just a waste of tax payer dollars, it is
a moral failure.
Despite these cuts being framed as fiscal discipline, the entire
international affairs budget regularly accounts for less than 1% of
federal spending. Yet it delivers enormous returns—opening mar-
kets for U.S. goods, stabilizing fragile regions, protecting us from
global pandemics, and reducing the need to send U.S. troops into
harm’s way. To ignore these facts is not just shortsighted—it is fis-
cally irresponsible and strategically reckless. True leadership un-
derstands that soft power is not a luxury. It is a necessity.
Several amendments were offered to address the shortcomings of
this year’s bill, but unfortunately, were defeated in largely partisan
votes. An amendment to strike the harmful riders affecting wom-
en’s health offered by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz
was rejected along party lines. Amendments to increase staffing by
Ranking Member Lois Frankel; restore funding for the Inter-Amer-
ican Foundation by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz;
prevent programs in the bill from financially benefiting the Presi-
dent or his family members by Congressman Mark Pocan; prevent
destruction of commodities paid for by the American taxpayer by
Congresswoman Grace Meng; move funding from the Emergency
Refugee and Migration Assistance account to the International Hu-
manitarian Assistance account by Representative Bonnie Watson
Coleman; encourage support for the East Jerusalem Hospital Net-
work by Representative Madeleine Dean; and inclusion of trans-
parency requirements before the implementation of staffing Reduc-
tions-in-Force (RIFs) by Representative Veronica Escobar were all
similarly defeated in party-line votes. Two amendments related to
diplomatic negotiations on deportations, including in El Salvador,
offered by Representative Norma Torres were also defeated.
Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro offered amendments directing a
report on the impact of changes to U.S. foreign aid policy on the
relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic
of China, especially in countries where the United States develop-
ment presence has been diminished and requiring notifications of
terminated programs to include domestic economic impacts. Both
were defeated.

However, the Committee accepted an amendment offered by
Ranking Member Lois Frankel to ensure that at least 15% of the
economic development funds in the bill benefit countries on the
continent of Africa. Investing in Africa reflects its vital role in our
shared future—a continent with a dynamic youth population and
vast economic potential, if we remain its partner of choice. An
amendment by Representative Adriano Espaillat on electronic
waste was also accepted.
The United States cannot just bomb or bully its way to peace and
prosperity. Along with military power, our strength has always
come with diplomacy, development, and compassion. This bill does
not chart a path forward. It is a blueprint for retreat.
We must do better. We must work together—across the aisle—
to craft legislation that reflects our values, honors our commit-
ments, and protects both American lives and global stability.
Finally, this bill was considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since taking office in January 2025, the
executive branch has engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and uncon-
stitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular, the Office of
Management and Budget has been at the center of a government-
wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s laws in its ac-
tions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the agency’s legally-
binding budget decisions (known as apportionments) in contraven-
tion of an unambiguous and constitutionally sound assertion of the
Congress’s authority to impose transparency requirements upon
the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all Democrats on the Committee, the
debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just as former
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States William
Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney General
with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any funding in the bill, so too does the Committee de-
cide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear in-
tent to be both a floor and a ceiling.

These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.

OVERVIEW
The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2026 for activities
under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on National Security,
Department of State, and Related Programs includes
$46,218,000,000 in new discretionary budget authority for pro-
grams and activities within the Subcommittee’s purview, which is
22 percent below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.
The fiscal year 2026 National Security, Department of State, and
Related Programs Appropriations Act (‘‘this Act’’) demonstrates
clear support for an America First foreign policy, first and fore-
most, by dramatically reducing spending. With government debt
forecasted to grow from 100 percent to 200 percent of Gross Domes-
tic Product (GDP) within decades, the Committee is committed to
making the significant cuts required to help get our fiscal house in
order, consistent with the power of the purse authority as laid out
in Article I of the United States Constitution.
Within these cuts, the bill prioritizes funding effective and ac-
countable programs that support and protect the American people
and our national security interests abroad and ensure our country’s
allies are supported and enemies confronted. An America First for-
eign policy requires careful consideration of how American tax dol-

lars are spent abroad. The bill strengthens requirements for the
Secretary of State to consider, prior to providing funds, the voting
practices of other countries at the United Nations, as well as co-
operation on issues important to the United States, such as migra-
tion cooperation, opposing foreign adversaries, and burden sharing.
Further, this Act supports full implementation of key Executive
Orders that reflect a clear commitment to national sovereignty, se-
cure borders, limited government, and traditional American values.
These Executive Orders collectively address critical policy areas
and institutional reforms, including: Executive Order 14149, relat-
ing to Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censor-
ship; Executive Order 14151, relating to Ending Radical and
Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing; Executive
Order 14155, relating to Withdrawing the United States From the
World Health Organization; Executive Order 14162, relating to
Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements;
Executive Order 14165, relating to Securing Our Borders; Execu-
tive Order 14170, relating to Reforming the Federal Hiring Process
and Restoring Merit to Government Service; Executive Order
14173, relating to Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring
Merit-Based Opportunity; Executive Order 14187, relating to Pro-
tecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation; Execu-
tive Order 14203, relating to Imposing Sanctions on the Inter-
national Criminal Court; Executive Order 14218, relating to End-
ing Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders; and Executive Order
14312, relating to Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions.
NATIONAL SECURITY
The Committee looks forward to the beginning of a new era in
American foreign policy—one of strength and unapologetic leader-
ship. As in previous years, the Committee recommendation sup-
ports allies and partners of the United States while countering ad-
versaries and those countries and non-state actors that support
them. However, it is critical that our European and other partners
continue to show resolve in the face of rising security challenges,
including by taking material steps to strengthen their national de-
fense.
The Committee recommendation includes steadfast support for
Israel by providing $3,300,000,000 from funds made available
under Foreign Military Financing Program, consistent with the
United States-Israel Memorandum of Understanding.
While Israel’s recent military success against Iran and its prox-
ies, alongside American strategic kinetic action against key nuclear
sites, has left Iran and its proxies weakened and vulnerable, the
Committee remains deeply concerned about Tehran’s ballistic mis-
sile capability and nuclear program. The Committee recommenda-
tion continues to prohibit funding to implement or enforce any
agreement with Iran regarding its nuclear program, including re-
newal of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, unless such
agreement complies with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act
of 2015. In addition, the Committee prohibits the use of funds to
revoke the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Furthermore, the Committee
encourages increased vigilance and support to our partners facing
threats from the Iranian regime and its proxies in the region.

The Committee continues its longstanding focus on the multi-
dimensional challenge posed to United States national security in-
terests by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). This challenge is complicated and made
more acute by growing collaboration between the PRC and a range
of other hostile actors, including the Russian Federation, Iran,
Cuba, and North Korea. In addition, Communist China’s aggressive
military operations to project power over Taiwan—actions which
the United States commander in the Indo-Pacific describes as a ‘‘re-
hearsal’’ for forced unification—as well as its dangerous and coer-
cive behavior in the East and South China seas underscores the
need for modernized alliances with greater partner burden sharing
to ensure continued successful deterrence.
The Committee therefore supports efforts to counter such threats
by directing not less than $1,800,000,000 to advance United States
national security interests in the Indo-Pacific and to counter the
malign influence of the PRC, including by providing up to
$400,000,000 for the Countering PRC Influence Fund, and by pro-
viding funding above the request for the Indo-Pacific Strategy and
Pacific Islands countries (PICs).
The Committee notes the ongoing need to strengthen deterrence
across the Taiwan Strait and recommends $500,000,000 from funds
made available under Foreign Military Financing Program for Tai-
wan, as well as up to $2,000,000,000 in loans and loan guarantees
for such purpose, as authorized by section 5502(g) of the Taiwan
Enhanced Resilience Act (Public Law 117–263).
As Secretary of State Rubio has noted, ‘‘the United States is put-
ting our region, the Americas, first.’’ The Committee recommenda-
tion strongly supports such efforts, including strengthening ties
with friends and partners in our own hemisphere, including in the
Caribbean, to invest in, and promote, free markets, transparency,
stability, and regional cooperation. It prioritizes funding to combat
the flow of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs into the United
States and prohibits funds for other organizations that support the
movement of migrant caravans to the United States. In addition,
the Committee supports efforts by Federal agencies funded in this
Act to de-risk critical supply chains by diversifying away from reli-
ance on the PRC and nearshoring them to the Americas to support
enhanced economic growth and stability, opening new markets for
United States businesses.
The Committee remains committed to supporting freedom for the
people of Cuba and provides $35,000,000 for democracy programs
and $40,000,000 for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. The Com-
mittee recommendation continues strong support for democracy
programs for the people of Venezuela and Nicaragua and calls on
European partners seeking support for Ukraine to stand for free-
dom and democracy in the Western Hemisphere as well, especially
in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.
PROTECTING LIFE AND SUPPORTING AMERICAN VALUES
The Committee recommendation maintains support for global
health programs by including all longstanding pro-life protections,
including the prohibition on funds to pay for abortions. The Com-
mittee expands and strengthens additional requirements, including
by applying the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy,

which prohibits funds for any foreign nongovernmental organiza-
tions that promotes or performs abortion, with certain exceptions.
The Committee includes additional requirements to enhance
transparency on how funds are used and which organizations are
implementing programs. The Committee remains significantly con-
cerned over the Helms Amendment violation under the Biden Ad-
ministration and includes new requirements for oversight to ensure
this despicable violation never occurs again.
In addition, the Committee prioritizes funding for religious free-
dom programs abroad and religious freedom protections for faith-
based organizations (FBOs) delivering foreign assistance.
The Committee strengthens the prohibition on censorship to in-
clude all funds provided by this Act and prior acts making appro-
priations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and re-
lated programs. The Committee continues to strongly support the
protection of free speech and free press around the globe, especially
with respect to American citizens and businesses.
UNITED STATES ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND
AMERICAN CITIZEN SERVICES
The Committee recommendation supports a strong American
economy by strengthening a provision to enhance United States
diplomatic engagement on commercial diplomacy in support of
United States businesses abroad and in the resolution of foreign
commercial disputes involving American citizens and businesses.
The Committee also directs the Secretary of State to prioritize
consular services for American citizens, chiefly by ensuring reason-
able and predictable processing times for passports. Therefore, the
Committee provides $517,000,000 under Consular and Border Se-
curity Programs to continue reducing wait times and increasing
customer service.
The Committee recommendation underscores the importance of
prioritizing investments for the International Boundary and Water
Commission, the International Fisheries Commissions, and the
International Joint Commission, as these commissions directly im-
pact Americans and the United States economy. Further, the Com-
mittee highlights the urgency of resolving the water delivery deficit
from the Rio Grande, which is owed by Mexico to the United States
as required by the 1944 Water Treaty. It is imperative to the
agrarian economy along the Rio Grande Basin, including South
Texas, that such water deliveries are timely and dependable, and
the Committee recommendation reflects the critical nature of
promptly resolving this issue to safeguard the livelihoods and eco-
nomic stability of the region. The Committee applauds the Admin-
istration for prioritizing this issue in negotiations with Mexico and
welcomes collaboration on continued efforts to secure water deliv-
eries for Americans.
OVERSIGHT, TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Committee continues to prioritize proper management of
American tax dollars across all Federal agencies funded in the bill,
and this is particularly important for the Department of State and
other agencies charged with advancing the interests of the United
States around the world. Waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs
funded in this Act will not be tolerated. In this regard, the Com-

mittee looks forward to working with the Department of State on
their strategic realignment, including: (1) the streamlining of cer-
tain functions and the Department’s expanded role in management
of foreign assistance; and (2) an increased focus on foreign assist-
ance effectiveness and transparency, pursuant to section 7011 of
this Act.
The bill includes unprecedented oversight and accountability re-
lated to the United Nations and other international organizations,
including by withholding funds until any such organization funded
by this Act is in compliance with requirements on oversight access
agreements established by the Department of State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024. The Com-
mittee also requires the Inspectors General to update best practices
for conducting oversight, including in countries and regions at
higher risk for waste, fraud, and abuse, and for programs involving
multilateral organizations.
In global health assistance, the Committee encourages greater
emphasis on leveraging American technology and innovation along-
side closer cooperation with the private sector to instill outcome
and performance-based programming to boost effectiveness and ac-
countability. The Committee continues to support funding for the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and takes
the first step toward ensuring the long-term success and viability
of this important investment by directing a strategy to guide a suc-
cessful transition over time from United States support.
The Committee reduces reprogramming authorities to ensure
that funds are devoted to the highest priorities and carried out ex-
peditiously according to congressional intent. The Committee notes
that reprogramming notifications must be submitted subject to the
regular notification procedures of the Committees on Appropria-
tions.
For the purposes of this Act and this Report, ‘‘regular notification
procedures’’ means notification must be provided at least 15 days
in advance of the obligation of funds.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND
RELATED PROGRAMS
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The Committee recommendation for Administration of Foreign
Affairs provides funds for the broad range of activities necessary to

The Committee recommendation includes $8,966,278,000 for Dip-
lomatic Programs, including $3,758,836,000 for Worldwide Security
Protection (WSP).
Worldwide Security Protection
The Committee recommendation includes $3,758,836,000 for
WSP, of which $723,187,000 is for Human Resources and
$3,035,649,000 is for Security Programs.
The WSP program provides funding for the protection of life,
property, and information of the Department of State and supports
a worldwide guard force protecting over 270 overseas diplomatic
posts, including missions, residences, and other facilities, and 150
domestic sites. Funds also support enhanced high-threat protection,
security technology, cyber and information security, secure diplo-
matic courier operations, and protective services for the Secretary
of State, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, and
foreign dignitaries visiting the United States.
Armored vehicles.—Funds provided for WSP are available for the
procurement of the materials and equipment to provide protection
for United States Government personnel serving in high-threat en-
vironments, including the replacement and modernization of ar-
mored vehicles that have reached the end of their useful life. The
Committee encourages the Secretary of State to support armored
vehicle fleet modernization, including consideration of the Heavy-
Duty Sport Utility Vehicle, and directs the Secretary to include in
the operating plan required by section 7062(a) of this Act informa-
tion on the armored vehicle procurement plan for fiscal year 2026.
Enhanced video analytics.—Within the funds provided, the Com-
mittee encourages the Secretary of State to consider implementa-
tion of a pilot program testing the use of enhanced video analytics.
The Department of State should include in the operating plan re-
quired by section 7062(a) plans for embassy security moderniza-
tion, including any plans for the use of enhanced video analytics.

Safety of locally employed staff.—The Committee recognizes that
locally employed staff provide essential contributions at United
States diplomatic and consular posts around the world. In emer-
gency situations, the Secretary of State should use funds made
available to the Department of State to provide support to ensure
the safety and security of locally employed staff and their imme-
diate family members.
Visa and passport fraud investigation.—The Committee supports
the work carried out by the Visa and Passport Analysis Branch
within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to protect the national
security of the United States through the continuous identification
of emergent threats to United States travel documents by improv-
ing the Investigative Management System (IMS) data enhance-
ment, analytics, and governance, in addition to other capabilities.
Further, the Committee recommendation includes additional fund-
ing above the prior year level to continue IMS upgrades and en-
hancements.
Other Matters
Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region.—The Committee sup-
ports the work of the Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region to
advance United States policy in the Arctic, including ongoing en-
gagements with counterparts in Arctic and non-Arctic nations.
Once confirmed, the Secretary of State shall include in the oper-
ating plan required by section 7062(a) of this Act planned staffing
and funding levels in support of the work of the Ambassador-at-
Large.
Artificial intelligence (AI) utilization.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall consult
with the Committees on Appropriations on plans to increase train-
ing on, and utilization of, AI tools within the Department of State
for increased efficiency as well as options to facilitate collaboration
between state and local government and key foreign sub-national
level governments on AI research projects and policies.
Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy.—The Committee recog-
nizes the growing importance of cybersecurity capacity building
and the need for personnel experienced in cybersecurity issues. The
Committee directs that funding be made available for the Bureau
of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and for strengthening efforts to
advance security in cyberspace.
Bureau of Medical Services.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment of State to allocate resources for the Bureau of Medical
Services to support an integrated telemedicine platform to increase
the capacity of the Bureau to deliver timely healthcare, create cost
savings, increase efficiency, and improve the quality and accuracy
of medical care. Adding an expanded capability that includes the
integration of biomedical devices and remotely guided specialty
care should further the Department’s goal of promoting and safe-
guarding the health and well-being of Chief of Mission personnel
and their families and improve the continuity of care for the diplo-
matic community.
Combating antisemitism.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant work of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semi-
tism and directs not less than $2,500,000 be made available for the
Office, as authorized by the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of

2004 (Public Law 108–332). The Committee remains concerned by
the lack of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions within the Office
of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism and its
impact on the stability and continuity of operations of the Office.
Further, the Committee encourages the Department of State to en-
sure that FTEs hired with this funding are adequately assigned
across offices, including the Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor
and Combat Anti-Semitism which plays a critical role in ensuring
the safety and security of Jewish communities around the world.
Countering PRC’s strategic advances in AI.—The Committee re-
mains concerned by the PRC’s strategic objective to overtake the
United States as the global leader in AI by 2030. Accordingly, the
Committee directs the Secretary of State, in coordination with rel-
evant national security and science agencies, to expand diplomatic
engagement with allies to counter PRC technology theft, promote
democratic principles in AI governance, and secure critical emerg-
ing technologies. The Committee further encourages interagency ef-
forts to strengthen intellectual property protection and build trust-
ed supply chains.
Department of State training programs and partnerships.—The
Committee supports ongoing partnerships to improve the United
States Foreign Service (Foreign Service) by preparing both grad-
uate and undergraduate students for positions in the Foreign Serv-
ice, including support for the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs
Fellowship and Charles B. Rangel International Affairs programs.
The Committee also supports continuation of Department pro-
grams authorized by section 9201 of the Department of State Au-
thorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117–263), the Foreign Affairs
Information Technology Fellowship, and the William D. Clarke, Sr.
Diplomatic Security Fellowship.
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.—The Com-
mittee directs support for the continued implementation of the
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Public Law
114–328).
Holocaust issues.—The Committee recommendation includes up
to $1,500,000 to continue the important work of the Office of Holo-
caust Issues to bring a measure of justice and assistance to Holo-
caust victims and their families and to ensure that the Holocaust
is remembered appropriately and accurately. The Committee ac-
knowledges the work of the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues and
urges the authorizing committees of jurisdiction to expeditiously
take action to expressly authorize such position.
Innovative procurement policies.—The Committee is concerned
that existing procurement policies and procedures may be inter-
fering with delivering mission critical support to government agen-
cies and the constituents they serve. As technology develops at a
rapid pace, traditional methods of procurement can hamper the
ability to respond to changing needs. The Committee encourages
the Department of State to make use of smaller, targeted procure-
ments that utilize alternative contracting approaches to increase
competition and innovation and reduce risk of contract non-per-
formance, including the application of generative AI to further that
goal. Further, the Committee encourages the Department to focus
on holding contractors accountable to measurable results and,
where appropriate, utilize pilot projects and open competition to

identify contractors that can most readily meet the needs of the De-
partment.
International religious freedom.—The Committee continues to
support the work of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Re-
ligious Freedom, as authorized by the International Religious Free-
dom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–292).
Language training.—The Committee supports efforts by the De-
partment of State to recruit and train Foreign Service Officers and
Civil Service employees with the knowledge and language skills
needed to advance United States policies toward countering malign
activities of the PRC.
Monitoring and combating trafficking in persons.—The Com-
mittee directs $25,000,000 for the Office to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking in Persons, as authorized by the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act of 2000, as amended, including to support the co-
ordination of the President’s Interagency Task Force and Senior
Policy Operating Group, deployment of rapid response teams, pro-
duction of the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, implementation
of child protection compacts, diplomatic engagement and technical
assistance, and management and oversight of assistance provided
by this Act to combat trafficking in persons.
The Committee continues to support the Office’s mission and role
to: coordinate, through the Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and
Combat Trafficking in Persons, anti-trafficking activities across the
United States Government; produce the annual TIP report; and ad-
minister grants to promote United States national security by pre-
venting trafficking, prosecuting traffickers, and protecting victims
in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000,
as amended. The annual TIP report is a vital tool in combating
human trafficking. The Committee directs the Department of State
to explore whether producing printed copies of the report would
further enhance its effectiveness.
The Committee also directs the Secretary of State to ensure the
Office has the staffing necessary to carry out the responsibilities
described under this heading. Finally, the Secretary is directed to
publicly post resources for victims of human trafficking, including
hotlines and websites, in all United States embassies and con-
sulates in areas where visa applications are processed.
Office of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues.—The Com-
mittee directs funding for the continued operation of the Office of
the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to carry out the respon-
sibilities detailed in section 21(d) of the Foreign Relations Author-
ization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107–228).
Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for the Abraham Ac-
cords.—The Committee directs not less than $1,500,000 for the Of-
fice of the Special Presidential Envoy for the Abraham Accords, as
authorized by section 6407 of the Department of State Authoriza-
tion Act of 2023 (division F of Public Law 118–31).
Sanctions coordination and counter threat financing.—The Com-
mittee directs that funding be continued for staff dedicated to sanc-
tions implementation, coordination, and counter threat financing
and that particular focus be given to the Western Hemisphere. The
Committee directs that the operating plan required by section
7062(a) of this Act include the projected budget and staffing level

for the Office of Global Sanctions and Threat Finance and the Of-
fice of Policy and Implementation.
Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.—The Committee
continues to support the work of the Special Presidential Envoy for
Hostage Affairs, as authorized by the Robert Levinson Hostage Re-
covery and Hostage Taking Accountability Act (division FF, title
III, subtitle A of Public Law 116–260), which leads and coordinates
United States diplomatic engagements on overseas hostage-related
matters.
Study of international child abduction.—The Committee directs
that $1,000,000 be made available to carry out the study author-
ized by Section 202 of the Sean and David Goldman International
Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C.
9122).
Technology.—The Committee recognizes the need for education of
United States diplomats in technology diplomacy and urges the De-
partment of State to establish a training program to enable the ad-
vancement of freedom through trusted technology. The Secretary of
State should consider partnering with academic and other entities
with expertise in providing research and training to policymakers,
diplomats, and other key stakeholders on technologies critical to
United States foreign policy and national security interests.
Youth.—The Committee recognizes that youth represent almost a
quarter of the global population living in areas affected by conflict
and that prioritizing programming involving youth advances
United States national security interests, creates new markets, un-
dermines terrorist recruitment efforts, and promotes more durable
peace and stability. The Committee encourages the Secretary of
State to consider designating an experienced official within the Of-
fice of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs who will advise re-
gional bureaus on the incorporation of youth into United States
diplomatic and development initiatives and coordinate youth policy
within the Department of State.
Reports
Arctic.—The Committee commends efforts by the Secretary of

that protracted review timelines and insufficient interagency co-
ordination have hampered efforts to improve and expand critical
infrastructure at United States land ports of entry. The Committee
directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with relevant inter-
agency partners, to review the process for evaluating and approv-
ing Presidential permits. Not later than 180 days after enactment

The Committee recommendation makes available $517,000,000
in budget authority for Consular and Border Security Programs
from passport application and execution fees. The additional budget
authority is provided to increase operational capacity to reduce
wait times; address increased demand for passport, visa, and
United States citizen services; and accelerate the passport mod-
ernization system and other modernization efforts already under-
way.
Revenues from the Department of State’s retained consular fees
and surcharges are deposited into the Consular and Border Secu-
rity Programs account. Each consular fee or surcharge is used to
fund authorized consular activities, such as passport and visa proc-
essing and adjudication, fraud prevention and detection, and serv-
ices for American citizens overseas.

tions are processed timely and efficiently to prevent unnecessary
delays affecting the public, including through the online passport
renewal program. The Committee directs the Department of State
to continue proactively seeking technological and procedural alter-
natives to streamline the processes where possible to enhance con-
sular services domestically and overseas. The Committee urges the
Secretary to put together a strategy outlining definitive steps to
improve coordination between passport agencies, ensure the timely
processing of passports, and avoid duplicates. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary to make every effort to use commercially avail-
able off-the-shelf technology and best practices to expedite the
passport issuance process, including identity authentication, while
protecting the integrity of the passport process, the privacy of pass-
port applicants, and the efficiency of processing passport issuance
requests. The Committee further requests that the Secretary en-
sure that Congressional offices receive timely updates to con-
stituent requests.
The Committee recommends that the Department of State pre-
pare to increase the capacity to process a wide range of tourist-re-
lated visas in advance of numerous high-profile sporting events
over the next several years.
The Committee notes that sections 7304, 7507, and 7508 of Pub-
lic Law 118–159 require significant reforms to the passport
issuance system. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
take all necessary steps to comply with the timelines described in
these sections, particularly timely submission of the interim action
plan described in section 7508(b)(3).
The Committee is aware of states, territories, and communities
that lack local access to passport agencies and passport acceptance
facilities. The Committee directs the Department of State to regu-
larly examine and identify high-demand, high-travel areas that
lack local, convenient access to passport agencies or acceptance fa-
cilities, which are essential for supporting residents’ travel and for
boosting the tourism economy. The Department should then assess
the most effective methods for supporting the establishment of
passport agencies or acceptance facilities to better support these
communities and travel hubs with timely, accessible passport serv-
ices.
The Committee directs the Department of State to improve agen-
cy customer experience, particularly regarding passport and visa
services. The Committee further urges the Department to ensure
that standards to measure and improve customer experience are in
place and are incorporated into the performance plans required
under 31 U.S.C. 1115.
The Committee recognizes the critical role temporary work visa
programs play in supporting key sectors of the United States econ-
omy. The Committee is concerned about ongoing delays in the proc-
essing of work visas and encourages the Department of State to
prioritize the timely adjudication of visa categories essential to fill-
ing urgent workforce gaps. The Committee directs the Department
to take all necessary steps to ensure the expeditious processing of
H–2A and H–2B visas. In addition, the Committee urges the De-
partment to improve processing of nonimmigrant visa categories
that allow employers in the United States to temporarily employ
high-skilled talent in critical sectors. The Committee further urges

address the years of backlog of families of Special Immigrant Visa
(SIV) holders.

sonnel in the Adoption Division of the Office of Children’s Issues,
including the number of staff with professional experience working
in the field of adoption before employment by the Department of
State.
Visa wait times.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
the timely processing of visas to the United States economy. The
Committee acknowledges that the Bureau of Consular Affairs has
made attempts to decrease wait times by employing critical tech-
nology, shifting resources between consulates, and improving trans-
parency, and believes significant additional efforts should be under-
taken to make the United States competitive in the market for pro-
spective travelers, including for appropriately vetted international
student applicants. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act, and on a quarterly basis thereafter until September 30, 2027,
the Secretary of State is directed to report to the appropriate con-
gressional committees on: (1) visa wait times; (2) the steps taken

times for visa processing.

The Committee recommendation includes $310,200,000 for Con-
tributions to International Organizations.
Funds made available under this heading are allocated according
to the following table and are subject to the requirements of sec-
tions 7015 and 7062 of this Act:
CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The Committee recommendation does not include funding for as-
sessed contributions for certain United Nations agencies and other
international organizations, including the United Nations regular
budget. The Committee also prohibits funds to the World Health
Organization (WHO), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA), and other organizations under section 7048 of this Act.
The Committee remains concerned with the continued lack of
progress toward meaningful reforms at the United Nations. Such
reforms, at a minimum, should include increased fiscal trans-
parency; meaningful consequences for sexual misconduct by United
Nations officials and peacekeepers; protections for whistleblowers;
efforts to combat antisemitism and anti-Israel bias; and holding
member states accountable for undermining international security.
Reforms must also address due process and accountability within
the United States justice system for the mass atrocities carried out
by staff of UNRWA and supported by UNRWA leadership over the
past decade, including through the provision of material support
and partnership with designated terrorist organizations that con-
tributed to the October 7, 2023 attacks. The Committee strongly
condemns the United Nations General Assembly for undermining
peace and security between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples by
passing the ‘‘Status of Palestine in the United Nations’’ resolution
that provided the ‘‘State of Palestine’’ almost all the rights and
privileges of Member States. The Committee has concluded that
further assessed contributions to the United Nations are not justi-
fied and increased scrutiny and oversight must predicate any con-
sideration of a voluntary contribution to the United Nations or any
United Nations agency. The Committee provides additional direc-
tion on the United Nations in section 7048 of this report.
International Energy Agency.—The Committee finds that the
International Energy Agency, housed within the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has strayed from
its core mission of ensuring global energy security. The Committee
finds that the Agency has abandoned objectivity in the critical en-
ergy-supply information it produces and, instead, has pursued po-
liticized information to support climate policy advocacy. This well-
documented shift by the Agency undermines decision-making by
policymakers and threatens energy security and the economic in-

terests of the United States. Accordingly, the Committee provides
no funding in this Act for the International Energy Agency.
OECD.—The Committee recommendation does not include fund-
ing for assessed contributions to the OECD. The Committee does
not support the work of the OECD that promotes higher tax rates,
corporate tax floors, and digital tax schemes that target American
taxpayers.
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).—The Committee
recommendation does not include funding for PAHO. The Com-
mittee remains deeply concerned about PAHO’s prior involvement
in the trafficking of Cuban doctors and medical personnel under
the former Mais Me´dicos program in Brazil and expects PAHO to
fully account for its role in such program prior to receiving Amer-
ican tax dollars. This includes cooperating with ongoing litigation
in United States courts under the Trafficking Victims Protection
Act of 2000, as amended, and providing compensation in any re-
sulting judgments. PAHO must publish all relevant financial
records and contracts, including an assessment of whether such
contracts complied with local and international labor standards.
Additionally, PAHO must release internal analyses of its oper-
ational, administrative, and financial role in the Mais Me´dicos pro-
gram. These requirements also apply to any other programs involv-
ing Cuban medical professionals in which PAHO played a facili-
tating role. The Committee notes that claims of functional immu-
nity should not preclude accountability for any actions by PAHO of-
ficials that directly or indirectly facilitated human trafficking.
Reproductive health and family planning.—The Committee re-
mains deeply concerned by United Nations entities that consider
abortion as a foundational component of comprehensive health
care, sexual and reproductive rights, and reproductive health and
family planning resources by their own organizational definitions.
In the context of constrained resources, the Committee must be as-
sured, prior to supporting funds, that multilateral organizations
comply with statutory prohibitions and requirements related to
abortion included in this Act and prior acts.
WHO.—Section 7048(l)(1) prohibits funds appropriated by this
Act from being made available to the WHO. The WHO’s credibility
has been severely undermined by its failure to hold the PRC ac-
countable for obstructing transparency during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, including suppressing early warnings from Taiwan and de-
laying international investigations. The Committee endorses Exec-
utive Order 14155, relating to Withdrawing the United States
From the World Health Organization, signed on January 20, 2025,
which directs the withdrawal of the United States from the WHO
due to the organization’s persistent mismanagement of global
health crises, its lack of accountability, and its susceptibility to in-
appropriate political influence by certain member states. The Com-
mittee remains deeply concerned by the WHO’s reluctance to con-
demn the PRC’s actions, its shift away from core communicable dis-
ease functions, and adoption of deeply biased, anti-Israel resolu-
tions that perpetuate harmful and historically antisemitic nar-
ratives.

Reports
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).—The Com-
mittee recognizes the importance of United States leadership in
ICAO in advancing global aviation safety and security. The Com-
mittee provides funding for the United States assessed contribution
under this heading and recommends that the Secretary of State
convene an interagency effort to ensure United States engagement
aligns with national security and domestic transportation prior-
ities. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act on priorities for ICAO engagement dur-
ing fiscal year 2026 and how United States funding will support
such priorities.
United Nations credits.—Not later than May 1, 2026, and 30
days after the end of fiscal year 2026, the Secretary of State shall
report to the Committees on Appropriations on any credits attrib-
utable to the United States, including from the United Nations Tax
Equalization Fund. The Secretary shall also provide updated fiscal
year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 United States assessments to the
United Nations Regular Budget and other international organiza-
tions, including any available credits and updated foreign currency
exchange rates, and indicate whether credits have been applied to
any assessed contributions or payment of arrearages.
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES

Change from enacted level ............................................................. ¥671,825,000
Change from request ...................................................................... +562,319,000
The Committee recommendation includes $562,319,000 for Con-
tributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The Com-
mittee recommends reduced funding for Contributions for Inter-
national Peacekeeping Activities to give the Secretary of State dis-
cretion to support missions, using funds subject to the 25 percent
statutory cap on peacekeeping assessments, that are effective and
aligned with United States national security interests, while with-
holding funding from missions that are ineffective or associated
with repeated cases of sexual abuse. The Committee urges stronger
oversight of peacekeeping performance, mandate relevance, and ac-
countability for troop-contributing countries whose personnel com-
mit abuses, including withholding reimbursements in order to sup-
port victims and encouraging enforcement of consequences.
Oversight.—The Committee supports independent oversight of
the United Nations to identify waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as
sexual abuse in peacekeeping operations, and the Committee sup-
ports reforms to ensure that such practices are eliminated. The
Committee expects the Department of State to increase oversight
of United Nations peacekeeping missions which must include more
effective mechanisms to ensure perpetrators are tracked and troop
contributing countries are held accountable, and victims receive
justice and support. The Committee provides additional direction
on United Nations peacekeeping in section 7048 of this report.

priations on the scope, timeline, and cost of such programs and
projects.
Amistad Dam repairs and modernization.—The Committee recog-
nizes the strategic importance of Amistad Dam—the largest inter-
national storage dam and reservoir on the Rio Grande—in sup-
porting flood control, water conservation, and hydroelectric power
generation. The Committee applauds efforts by the IBWC to repair
critical infrastructure at the Amistad Dam, including addressing
sinkholes and mitigating seepage. The Committee urges the IBWC
to prioritize and expeditiously complete these repairs to ensure

Release of effluent.—The Committee remains concerned about the
adverse impact on communities in the United States from the re-
lease of effluent from Mexico, including from the Tijuana River.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State and the United
States Commissioner of the IBWC to continue engaging with the
Government of Mexico to take appropriate steps to facilitate long-
term solutions. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,

Water deliveries.—The Committee directs the Department of
State, in coordination with the IBWC, to implement the 1944
Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico in a manner
that assures reliable, annual water flow from Mexico to the United
States. It is critical for the agrarian economy that South Texas
farmers receive reliable, annual water flow from the Rio Grande in
accordance with the Treaty. The Committee notes that section
7045(h) of this Act includes limitations with respect to water deliv-
eries to the United States from Mexico.

Lakes. The amount includes not less than $1,000,000 to address
grass carp in the Great Lakes and $10,500,000 to continue support
for the Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog basins and the
Lake Memphremagog fishery.
The Committee supports the steps being taken by GLFC to up-
date the Commission’s infrastructure plan, including the precise
assessment of annual Canadian infrastructure costs. It is critical to
the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem that the United States
and Canada continue to maintain and improve their respective in-
frastructure, which provides significant benefits to each country’s
economy. The Committee expects that Federal agencies adhere to
section 11 of the Great Lakes Fishery Act of 1956, including work-
ing with any and all duly appointed Commission staff. The Com-
mittee further directs that the GLFC take all appropriate steps to
ensure that the Convention mandate of the GLFC is executed fully
and in an efficient and timely manner. This includes a directive to
ensure sea lamprey control remains a priority Great Lakes pro-
gram as previously designated by the Committee.
Pacific Salmon Commission.—The Committee directs $6,500,000

provided directly to the NED and shall not be subject to prior ap-
proval by the Department of State. Administrative or management
surcharges and minimal expenses, if any, should be charged to the
Department of State operating expenses. The NED should not be
precluded from competitively bidding on other grant solicitations.
Information sharing.—Information sharing between the Depart-
ment of State and the NED shall occur as in prior years, but the
independence of the NED shall be maintained per section 502(a) of

TITLE III—BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT
GLOBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS
Fiscal year 2025 enacted level........................................................... $10,030,450,000
Fiscal year 2026 request .................................................................... 3,797,000,000
Committee recommendation .............................................................. 9,518,712,000
Change from enacted level ............................................................. ¥511,738,000
Change from request ...................................................................... +5,721,712,000
The Committee recommendation includes $9,518,712,000 for
Global Health Programs.
Investments in global health programming are a fundamental
pillar of America’s national security agenda. It makes America
safer by supporting early detection and protection from dangerous
outbreaks of infectious diseases and by improving health infra-
structure to bolster prevention, preparedness, and response to
chronic and emergent health needs. It makes America stronger and
more prosperous by strengthening global economic stability, as well
as social cohesion, and unleashes American ingenuity in creating
medicines, treatment, technology, manufacturing, health education,
and more. Effective global health programs save and improve lives,
stabilize and secure international trade and global supply chains,
and accelerate prosperity at home and around the world.
Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.—The Committee in-
cludes language in section 7057(b) of this Act prohibiting funds for
any foreign nongovernmental organization that promotes or per-
forms abortion, with certain exceptions.
In addition, the Committee recommendation includes conditions
under this heading that do the following: (1) require that none of
the funds appropriated by this Act, or any unobligated balances,
may be made available to any organization or program, which as
determined by the President, supports or participates in the man-
agement of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary steriliza-
tion; (2) state that funds cannot be used to pay for the performance
of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce
any person to practice abortion; (3) specify that population funds
shall be available only to voluntary family planning projects that
offer, either directly or through referral, information about access
to a broad range of family planning methods and services; (4) re-
quire that in awarding grants for natural family planning under
section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, no applicant
shall be discriminated against because of such applicant’s religious
or conscientious commitment to offer only natural family planning;
and (5) require the provision of accurate information related to
condoms.
The Committee remains significantly concerned over the viola-
tion of the Helms Amendment under the previous Administration.
Therefore, the Secretary of State is directed to review guidance for
the Department of State, as well as for implementing partners,
with respect to the application of requirements under Global
Health Programs, section 7018, and section 7057 of this Act, to en-
sure full compliance with such requirements. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary to conduct stringent oversight to ensure full ad-
herence to requirements in law. The Committee expects that guid-

ance and training associated with such requirements will ensure
full awareness and compliance by implementing partners. The
Committee directs the Secretary to consult with the appropriate
congressional committees, not later than 30 days after enactment
of this Act, on additional staff, training, guidance, and regulations
to address compliance.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

Childhood cancer.—Funds appropriated under title III of this Act
may be made available for public-private partnerships, including in
coordination with relevant multilateral organizations and research
entities, to address childhood cancer. The Secretary of State is di-
rected to consult with the appropriate congressional committees not
later than 60 days after enactment of this Act on uses of funds for
such partnerships.
Diagnostics.—The Committee recognizes that accurate and swift
diagnostics are crucial for the early detection and containment of
infectious diseases of pandemic potential and a key part of the
global health security program. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to make funds available from its global health secu-
rity programming for the development of diagnostics for pathogens
of pandemic potential consistent with the limitations of section
7058(d).
Frontline health workers.—The Committee recognizes the key
role of frontline health workers in effective global health programs
and encourages support for frontline workers, particularly at the
community level, as part of existing efforts to combat infectious dis-
eases, prevent maternal and child deaths, and improve global
health outcomes.
Global health security.—The Committee supports continued ef-
forts to promote global health security, address emerging health
threats overseas, and prevent future pandemics, including support
to strengthen laboratory and surveillance capabilities.
The Committee remains concerned by the continuing commercial
trade in and markets for live wildlife for the purpose of human con-
sumption and the risk posed to global health. The Committee notes
the risks of zoonotic spillover posed by greater human contact with

wildlife and supports efforts to address threats posed by certain
wildlife markets and prioritize surveillance and spillover preven-
tion in global health security programs.
The Committee supports funding for the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations, at levels consistent with prior fiscal
years, to address emerging infectious diseases, deadly viruses, and
other pathogenic threats pursuant to section 6501 of Public Law
117–81. Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on the amount to be made available.
HIV/AIDS.—The Committee recommendation includes a new re-
quirement in section 7058(e) directing the Secretary of State to
submit a strategy on PEPFAR transition to gradually and respon-
sibly reduce United States funding for HIV/AIDS abroad through
the use of country transition plans, while prioritizing the safety
and health of beneficiaries.
The Committee commends the efforts of the Department of State
to support public-private partnerships expanding cervical cancer
screening and treatment for women living with HIV. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to brief the Committees on
Appropriations not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act
on a proposal to transition from visual inspection with acetic acid
(VIA) to molecular testing for high-risk human papillomavirus
(HPV) as the primary screening method.
The Committee supports the scale-up of long-acting injectable
antiretrovirals to reduce HIV transmission, expedite country tran-
sition from donor support, and lower costs. The Committee encour-
ages the Department of State to prioritize these technologies in
high-burden countries.
The Committee recommendation includes $1,500,000,000 for the
eighth replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber-
culosis and Malaria (Global Fund). The Committee commends the
efforts of the Global Fund to transition countries to fully funding
and implementing health programs independent of Global Fund
support. Oversight of the Global Fund remains a top priority, as
well as continued support for an independent Office of the Inspec-
tor General.
The Committee recommends continued support for microbicide
development and directs the Department of State to coordinate
with other Federal research agencies and donors to expedite
microbicide development and implementation.
Innovative technologies.—The Committee supports investments
in research, development, and introduction of innovative tech-
nologies related to child survival, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuber-
culosis (TB).
Neglected surgical conditions.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to support efforts to strengthen surgical health ca-
pacity to address such health issues as cleft lip and cleft palate,
club foot, cataracts, hernias, obstetric fistulas, untreated traumatic
injuries, and access to safe cesarean sections in underserved areas
in developing countries, including in regions without water or elec-
tricity. Strengthening surgical health systems includes the training
of local surgical teams, anesthesia teams, and assisting ministries
of health to develop and implement national surgical, obstetric,
trauma, and anesthesia plans. Not later than 90 days after enact-

ment of this Act, the Secretary shall brief the Committees on Ap-
propriations on the planned uses of funds for these purposes in fis-
cal year 2026.
Neglected tropical diseases.—The Committee supports continued
funding to treat neglected tropical diseases and the coordination of
neglected tropical disease programs with complementary develop-
ment and global health programs, including water, sanitation, and
hygiene.
Noncommunicable disease interventions.—The Committee sup-
ports efforts to decentralize and enhance the care for severe non-
communicable diseases, including among children and young adults
in sub-Saharan Africa, at first-level referral health facilities, in-
cluding through partnerships to improve diagnosis, treatment, and
training.
Nutrition.—The Committee supports effective nutrition interven-
tions and expects not less than 50 percent of nutrition funding be
devoted to the most cost-effective and evidence-based nutrition
interventions, including American-made Ready-to-Use Therapeutic
Foods (RUTF), breastfeeding support, prenatal vitamins, and vita-
min A supplementation.
RUTF.—The Committee notes the increase in cases of child wast-
ing globally and the shortage of therapeutic food treatments.
Therefore, the Committee also directs not less than $300,000,000
under title III of this Act be made available for American-made
RUTF. The Committee directs that RUTF already procured for
emergency responses be distributed quickly, prioritizing areas of
greatest need and taking expiration dates into account to avoid
waste.
Reproductive health and voluntary family planning.—Section
7058 of this Act includes a limitation of not more than
$461,000,000 for reproductive health and voluntary family plan-
ning programs funded by this Act.
Vulnerable children.—The Committee encourages the Depart-
ment of State to continue to align existing programs for vulnerable
children with the goals and objectives of the United States Govern-
ment Strategy on Advancing Protection and Care for Children in
Adversity and ensure that orphans and vulnerable children remain
a priority within PEPFAR country programs.
Reports
Disadvantaged geographies.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to submit a report to the appropriate congressional
committees not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on
how much of the assistance provided under bilateral Global Health
Programs during fiscal year 2024 was used to provide health serv-
ices to sub-national populations with an under-five mortality rate

State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations
listing all prime and sub-partners that received funds for global
health activities in fiscal year 2025. The report shall be

ner, the amount of funding received, the activity description and
purpose, and the country or region for such activity. The sub-part-
ner information shall indicate the prime partner for each activity.
Preventing childhood deaths.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to include in annual maternal and child health re-
porting the amount spent each year on highest-impact, evidence-
based child health interventions in bilateral global health pro-
grams, disaggregated by intervention and outcomes achieved as a
result of United States assistance. The report shall include an ac-
counting of interventions provided, including treatment, for (1)
childhood pneumonia, (2) malaria, (3) diarrheal dehydration, (4) se-
vere acute malnutrition, (5) immunizations, (6) azithromycin provi-
sion, and (7) neonatal sepsis. The report shall also include an esti-
mation of funds expended to support the outcomes for each inter-

The Committee recommendation includes $6,890,170,000 for Na-
tional Security Investment Programs. The National Security In-
vestment Programs account consolidates bilateral economic assist-
ance accounts funded under prior acts making appropriations for
the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs
into a single account. Funds are appropriated to the National Secu-
rity Investment Programs account for necessary expenses to carry
out the provisions of: sections 103, 105, 106, 214, and sections 251
through 255, and chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961, chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
the FREEDOM Support Act (Public Law 102–511), and the Support
for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (Public Law
101–179).
In determining the allocation of funds made available under this
heading, the Secretary of State shall consider a recipient partner
country’s cooperation on United States priorities such as migration
issues, opposing foreign adversaries, burden sharing, and United
Nations votes.
Funds appropriated under this heading shall be allocated strate-
gically for programs that support United States national security
interests. In addition to specific geographic priorities, funds appro-
priated under this heading will fund key national security initia-
tives including programs related to economic resilience (section
7030), democracy (section 7032), international religious freedom
(section 7033), countering the flow of fentanyl and other synthetic
drugs (section 7036), women’s equality and empowerment (section
7059), education, conservation, food security and agricultural devel-
opment, combating trafficking in persons, and water and sanitation
(section 7060).
The Committee views recent changes with respect to the provi-
sion of United States foreign assistance as an opportunity to em-
brace innovative solutions for implementing programs that are in
the national security interest of the United States. The Committee
encourages the Secretary of State to consider implementing mile-
stone-based funding for innovative, cost-effective, and scalable ap-
proaches to development challenges in the United States national
interest, focusing on emerging technologies and evidence-based so-
lutions with a clear path to long-term financial sustainability.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

recovery programs, with a focus on sectors vital to the national se-
curity of the United States, such as mining and critical minerals.
These investments, which should align with the June 2025 agree-
ment, support United States national security objectives and ad-
vance United States strategic interests by securing access to essen-
tial resources and promoting regional stability through responsible
development.

Cooperative development programs.—The Committee recognizes
the important role that United States cooperatives and credit
unions play in overseas programs to lift low-income people out of
poverty through their own efforts and resources by mobilizing eq-
uity and savings for durable community-based economic growth.
Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on
use of funds under this heading for cooperative development pro-
grams.
Countering the flow of fentanyl.—The Committee notes the ur-
gency of stopping fentanyl and other drugs from entering the
United States and supports the aggressive action by the Depart-
ment of State to respond to these deadly threats. Funds appro-
priated under this heading shall be used for programs to counter
the flow of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and other synthetic drugs
into the United States. Such programs shall be coordinated with
the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL)
Affairs in order to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. Additional
funds for this purpose are made available under International Nar-
cotics Control and Law Enforcement.
Cybersecurity capacity building.—The Committee directs that
funds under this heading be used to strengthen cybersecurity capa-
bilities in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Peru to counter
cyber threats, particularly from the PRC, in order to support demo-
cratic partners aligned with United States interests, including
those that recognize Taiwan, and help safeguard critical infrastruc-
ture.
Deepening strategic alliances in the Western Hemisphere.—Funds
under this heading should be used to support economic cooperation
with key democratic allies in the Western Hemisphere, including
Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru whose shared
commitment to free markets and open trade furthers regional sta-
bility and United States prosperity. Such funds should support pro-
grams that modernize energy systems, enhance infrastructure, and
support transparent governance to foster strong economies aligned
with United States strategic objectives.
Indo-Pacific.—The Committee directs that funds under this
heading be prioritized for countries and programs in the Indo-Pa-
cific to counter the malign influence of the PRC.

stability, including through investments in water infrastructure, is
important to United States national security.
Microenterprise and microfinance.—The Committee supports mi-
croenterprise and microfinance programs to promote economic de-
velopment and urges the Secretary of State to look for ways to fur-
ther advance economic growth, including identifying financial and

available under this heading, not less than $5,000,000 shall be
made available to support evidence-based programs that assess the
implementation of peace agreements and peace accords using im-
partial methodologies and diverse information sources. The Com-
mittee notes that impartial standards and methodologies for meas-
uring the progress of peace in post-conflict settings by gathering in-
formation from public, private, and nongovernmental entities pro-
vide a valuable tool for the Department in assessing and moni-
toring peace accords and processes.
Philippines.—The Committee recommendation includes support
for the longstanding alliance between the United States and the
Republic of the Philippines, including continued development co-
operation on shared strategic priorities. The Committee directs
funds be made available to support projects related to: energy secu-
rity and critical infrastructure; strengthening information and com-
munication technology and logistics through enhanced digital
connectivity; bolstering efforts to prevent illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing; capacity building to support improved national
disaster risk management; and assistance in training and develop-
ment in critical industries, such as infrastructure, semiconductors
and electronics, nuclear energy, and advanced technologies.
Section 7030.—The Committee directs $155,000,000 for strategic
infrastructure, critical mineral supply chains, and cyber and tech-
nology investments to enhance United States national security
around the world and to be allocated and administered consistent
with the requirements in section 7030.
Taiwan.—Funds under this heading include the GCTF, which
continues to be a key mechanism for strengthening Taiwan’s rela-
tionships in the Indo-Pacific, and, increasingly, around the world.
Launched in 2015 by AIT and Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
GCTF builds support for Taiwan by demonstrating its capacity and
willingness to contribute to the global community. Since its incep-
tion, the program has engaged nearly 8,000 participants from 127
countries through GCTF workshops that showcase Taiwan’s exper-
tise, ability, and willingness to help address global problems across
a wide spectrum of topics.
Trade capacity building.—The Committee continues to support
capacity building activities in countries with free trade agreements
with the United States to ensure that American workers and busi-
nesses can compete on a level playing field. The Committee further
supports trade capacity building programs that advance United
States interests and values in the Western Hemisphere and Africa,
including to advance the goals of the African Continental Free
Trade Area by increasing intra-continental trade. The Committee
includes further direction under Reports under this heading.
United Nations Children’s Fund.—The Committee notes funds
may be made available for the United Nations Children’s Fund
under this heading instead of under International Organizations
and Programs pursuant to section 301 of the Foreign Assistance
Act.

Venezuela democracy programs.—The Committee directs that
funds under this heading shall be used to support democracy pro-
grams in Venezuela to restore democratic institutions, promote
civil society, and counter authoritarian repression. Such programs
bolster United States national security by advancing regional sta-
bility and supporting the Venezuelan people’s pursuit of democratic
governance.
Reports
FBOs.—The Committee notes the important role that FBOs play
in communities around the world, including in the provision of hu-
manitarian, development, and global health assistance. The Com-
mittee urges the Department of State to ensure that as the Depart-
ment assumes a greater role in the provision of foreign assistance,
the Department has tools and resources to collaborate with reli-
gious communities and FBOs. Not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate con-
gressional committees a report on how efforts to engage and part-
ner with FBOs are incorporated into the Department’s localization
approach. The Committee expects that the Department’s efforts to
enable involvement of local organizations extend to those whose or-
ganizational missions are tied to faith, religious freedoms, charity,
and religious-based humanitarian support, given the extensive
presence and experience of FBOs in the developing world.
Additionally, the Committee expects the Department of State to
ensure compliance with existing Federal laws protecting the rights
of FBOs, including rights related to employment practices, from
discrimination in competing for and administering projects funded
with United States foreign assistance.
Improving the effectiveness of foreign assistance.—The Committee
supports continued efforts to improve the effectiveness of United
States foreign assistance to ensure maximum return on investment
for every United States tax dollar spent overseas. Not later than
120 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations describing
the Department of State’s plans to implement pilot programs, par-
ticularly with respect to global health and food security, that would
provide performance-based payments for measurable, independ-
ently-verified development outcomes that are in line with United
States national security interests. Such report shall recommend a
proposal for the funding level for such pilot programs.
Locally led development.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of localization of humanitarian and development assistance
to increase self-reliance. Not later than 120 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the ap-
propriate congressional committees assessing the Department of
State’s progress in advancing locally led development and humani-
tarian response and outlining the Department’s plans to continue
advancing such locally led response, including the coordinated im-
plementation of relevant agency strategies and policies. The report
shall include information on: how the Department of State is ena-
bling more local leadership of State-funded programs through utili-
zation of internal systems, management, and process reforms; how
the Department is coordinating implementation of relevant agency
strategies and policies; and humanitarian and development funding

this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appro-
priate congressional committees on the actions taken over the pre-
vious 12 months to implement programs benefiting children and
youth, including infants and other children under school age, and
on steps being taken to improve the tracking and disaggregation of
funding benefiting children and youth, including for programs pri-
marily and secondarily related to the protection, education, sup-
port, and safety of children and youth.
Trade capacity building.—Not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a spend plan
to the Committees on Appropriations for trade capacity building ac-
tivities for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.

mocracy Fund.
Funding provided under this heading demonstrates the high pri-
ority the Committee places on democracy and human rights around
the world, at a moment when definitions of these terms are fre-
quently manipulated, and the concepts themselves are frequently
tested by autocrats, dictators, and malign powers. The Committee
believes strongly that defending democracy and human rights is
fundamental to United States national security.
Programs funded by Democracy Fund should prioritize free elec-
tions, rights of free speech and dissent, access to information, free-
dom to organize, assemble, compete politically, and worship along
with protection against attacks on these freedoms, and adherence
to the rule of law.
Religious freedom.—The Committee directs that $30,000,000
from funds under this heading be made available for international
religious freedom programs pursuant to section 7033 of this Act.
An additional $20,000,000 is included under National Security In-
vestment Programs for such purposes.

at a time when cyber incidents are on the rise, is a critical compo-
nent of the safety and security of volunteers. The Committee di-
rects the Director of the Peace Corps to prioritize investments to
improve information security, including the response to information
security events and consistent implementation of policies and pro-
cedures.

bases have a unique capability to confirm identities and have prov-
en to be an effective tool in deterring and preventing human traf-
ficking. The Committee expects the Department of State to work in
partnership to further develop the capacity of the governments of
Central America and Mexico to utilize DNA forensic science and
databases to combat trafficking in persons. The Secretary of State
shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the use of
funds.
Fentanyl and opioids.—The Committee recognizes the prolifera-
tion of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids as one of the most ur-
gent national security and public health challenges facing the
United States. The Committee strongly supports increased Depart-
ment of State focus and aggressive action to address the flow of il-
legal opioids into the United States, including: (1) programs to as-
sist the Government of Mexico in securing its borders and reducing
poppy cultivation and heroin and synthetic drug production; (2)
programs to thwart transnational criminal organizations involved
in the trafficking of heroin and fentanyl; (3) diplomatic efforts to
strengthen precursor chemical control and training on inter-
national treaty obligations related to opioids; (4) measures to
strengthen the security of the international postal system to pre-
vent illegal shipments of opioids from entering the United States,
particularly from the PRC; and (5) global demand reduction pro-
grams.
The Committee supports recent actions by the Department to
designate dangerous cartels and transnational criminal organiza-
tions as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Des-
ignated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). The Committee encourages the
Secretary of State, in coordination with heads of other relevant
Federal agencies, to fully implement these designations and related
restrictive sanctions against FTOs and SDGTs, including cartels
and other transnational criminal organizations like Mara
Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Tren de Aragua (TdA), that generate
hundreds of millions of dollars annually from illegally trafficking
fentanyl and other opioids into the United States.
Fentanyl precursors.—The Committee supports continued efforts
and programs that support precursor disposal, forensic laboratory
analysis, port security, and training and equipment, including ca-
nine support.
Fentanyl screening.—The Committee is aware of ongoing efforts
with foreign governments to deploy passive, non-intrusive screen-
ing technologies to detect small quantities of person-borne opioids,
fentanyl, and other narcotics, including residue on United States
currency, related to drug trafficking. The Committee supports this
ongoing effort and expects the Department of State to expand these
efforts with international partners to other United States-bound
airports and pedestrian ports of entry.
Indo-Pacific.—The Committee directs that funds be made avail-
able at not less than the prior year level for partners in the Indo-
Pacific, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
PRC-linked scam centers.—The Committee is concerned by the
growth of PRC-linked scam centers across Southeast Asia and
notes that Americans are estimated to have lost $5,000,000,000 to
such scam centers in 2024 alone, an increase of 42 percent above
the previous year. The Committee directs that funds under this

heading be used to counter the threats posed by PRC-linked scam
centers in Southeast Asia, which fuel corruption, violence, human
trafficking, and massive economic fraud against the American pub-
lic.
Southern Cone.—The Committee supports continued program-
ming with key Southern Cone partners, including Argentina and
Paraguay, to build regional capacity to counter organized crime,
drug trafficking, and financial crime and disrupt transnational
criminal organizations.
Reports
Assessing PRC cooperation in countering fentanyl.—Not later
than 120 days after enactment of this Act, and every 90 days there-
after until September 30, 2026, the Secretary of State, in consulta-
tion with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall submit
a report to the appropriate congressional committees detailing and
assessing the cooperation of the PRC in countering the flow of
fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and other synthetic drugs, and de-
scribing actions taken by the United States in coordination with
other countries to engage the PRC on taking concrete and measur-
able steps to stop the flow of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and
other synthetic drugs from the PRC to other countries.

enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in consultation with
the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall submit a report
to the appropriate congressional committees detailing: (1) programs
and operations that contribute to disrupting fentanyl proliferation
into the United States; (2) Mexico’s level of cooperation and culpa-
bility in the proliferation of fentanyl across United States borders;
and (3) efforts to address fentanyl variants and opioid counterfeits.

to explore CWD programs in parts of the Horn of Africa where
there is risk to civilians posed by degrading ammunition and en-
courages support for weapons security management programs to
address this humanitarian threat.
Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Initiative.—The Com-
mittee directs that $13,000,000 be made available to support the
Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation’s Artificial
Intelligence Safety and Security Initiative to counter chemical, bio-
logical, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons of mass destruc-
tion risks associated with AI model development. The Committee
supports the Department of State’s efforts to detect, plan, and re-
spond to AI-enabled CBRN threats, and to coordinate with allies
and partners to manage such threats. The Committee encourages
the Department to recruit and retain personnel with the relevant
expertise to address these emerging issues.
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.—The Committee directs $2,000,000
for humanitarian demining and unexploded ordnance clearance ac-
tivities in areas affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, subject

national security interest of the United States.
Western Hemisphere.—The Committee supports the use of funds

strengthening the professionalism and democratic values of secu-
rity partners in the Indo-Pacific.

Assistance provided under this heading helps facilitate strong
military-to-military cooperation; enables greater interoperability of
friends and allies with United States military forces; and increases
participation in coalition operations. By increasing demand for
United States systems, Foreign Military Financing Program fund-
ing also contributes to a strong industrial base, reduces the cost of
Department of Defense acquisitions, and supports American work-
ers. The program provides grant and loan assistance to partner
countries in coordination with the Department of Defense.
Funds for certain programs under this heading are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

East Asia and the Pacific.—The Committee remains concerned
about the military modernization of the PRC and their claims in
territorial disputes, including in the East and South China seas.
The Committee encourages the Secretary of State to continue to en-
gage with partners and allies in the region on the political, eco-
nomic, and military implications of the strategic rise of the PRC,
including through military assistance and sales programs. Funds
appropriated under this heading should emphasize building the se-
curity capabilities of United States partners in Southeast Asia and
the Pacific, including in PICs.
Oversight and accountability.—The Committee notes that the
Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires that certain standard
terms and conditions be incorporated into all Foreign Military
Sales cases. These relate in part to the obligations of the pur-
chasing country under International Humanitarian Law and
Human Rights Law, requirements for end-use monitoring, and re-
strictions on retransfer without prior United States consent. The
AECA also contains requirements for prompt notice to Congress of
violations. The AECA and Foreign Assistance Act contain numer-
ous additional requirements relating to oversight and account-
ability for arms transfers and provisions for notice to Congress.

panies or social network platforms.
The Committee supports assistance for free press, including mod-
els of support that address media sustainability in nascent democ-
racies. Programs that support the free flow of objective information
are fundamental pillars for strengthening democratic governance.
The Committee recommends funding for programs and activities
globally that strengthen free and open media; protect freedom of
expression; and support accurate and ethical independent report-
ing. Additionally, the Committee supports programs that counter
manipulation of information by adversaries. Such programming
should focus exclusively on countering manipulation of information
by adversaries abroad and not general misinformation or
malinformation, especially targeting American citizens and compa-
nies.
Public-private partnerships.—The Committee supports the estab-
lishment of public-private partnerships to support democracy pro-
grams. No later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on op-
portunities to implement public-private partnerships to support de-
mocracy programs in fiscal year 2026.

Section 7033 (International Religious Freedom)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding international religious freedom.
Subsection (a) directs that funds under Diplomatic Programs be
made available for the Office of International Religious Freedom,
and funds for the Office of International Religious Freedom shall
be made available for the continued development and implementa-
tion of an international religious freedom curriculum in accordance
with section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.
Subsection (b) provides that not less than $50,000,000 be made
available for religious freedom programs. Within that amount, the
Committee directs that not less than $20,000,000 shall be from Na-
tional Security Investment Programs and not less than $30,000,000
shall be from Democracy Fund. Such funds shall be the responsi-
bility of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Free-
dom, in consultation with other relevant United States Government
officials, and made available subject to prior consultation with the
Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee directs that funds made available for religious
freedom shall be made available in authoritarian countries like
Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, where faith-based communities
are drivers for democratic change.
Subsection (b)(2), directs that humanitarian assistance shall be
made available for vulnerable and persecuted religious minorities,
including victims of genocide designated by the Secretary of State
and other groups that have suffered crimes against humanity and
ethnic cleansing. The Committee urges the Secretary to: accelerate
the implementation of an immediate, coordinated, and sustained
response to provide humanitarian assistance; work to enhance pro-
tection of conflict victims, including those facing a dire humani-
tarian crisis and severe persecution because of their faith or eth-
nicity; help reestablish livelihoods for displaced and persecuted per-
sons in their communities of origin; and improve access to nearby
secure locations for obtaining humanitarian services.
Countries of particular concern.—If the United States Commis-
sion on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) recommends
the designation of a country as a Country of Particular Concern
(CPC) in its annual report, and such country is not designated as
a CPC by the Department of State, the Secretary of State shall pro-
vide the rationale for such decision to the appropriate congressional
committees within 30 days of such decision. The Committee notes
that Nigeria fits such criteria in 2023, 2024, and 2025.
Spend plan.—In submitting the spend plan required pursuant to
section 7062(b), the Secretary of State shall consider the rec-
ommendations of USCIRF in the allocations of funds made avail-
able pursuant to this section.
Report
The Committee remains concerned that vulnerable and per-
secuted religious minorities, including victims of genocide des-
ignated by the Secretary of State and other groups that have suf-
fered crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing are not receiv-
ing necessary assistance, despite congressional direction. Therefore,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to provide a report on
the status of the implementation of section 7033(b)(3) of the Con-

solidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (division K of Public Law 115–
141). Specifically, the Committee requests information regarding
the status of small and medium-sized projects to benefit such vic-
tims, such as restoring residential services, including water, elec-
tricity, sewage, health, and education.
Section 7034 (Special Provisions)
This section includes language modified from the prior year in-
volving certain special authorities and limitations that apply to
funds made available by this Act.
Section 7035 (Law Enforcement and Security)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
lated to assistance, authorities, limitations, technical amendments,
and reports regarding law enforcement and security matters.
The Committee notes the longstanding need to update authori-
ties relating to the use of registration fees by the Directorate of De-
fense Trade Controls. The Committee encourages the authorizing
committees of jurisdiction to update relevant statute to permit use
of such fees for all management, licensing, compliance, and policy
activities in the defense trade controls function, including the facili-
tation of defense trade policy development and implementation, re-
view of commodity jurisdiction determinations, public outreach to
industry and foreign parties, and analysis of scientific and techno-
logical developments as they relate to the exercise of defense trade
control authorities, and contract personnel to assist in all such ac-
tivities.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to ensure that the
Department of State continuously provides all foreign policy assess-
ments to other Federal agencies within 90 days of the initial re-
quest to facilitate the importation of military firearms of special in-
terest and value to collectors and meeting the curio or relic defini-
tion in 27 C.F.R. 178.11.
The Committee supports efforts to increase capitalization of the
Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF) but notes that the type
of collections that can be paid into SDAF are limited by Article 51
of the AECA. The Committee directs the Secretary of State, in con-
sultation with the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, to work with stakeholders to explore legislative and policy
proposals to increase capitalization of the Fund, including by uti-
lizing existing authority under the AECA for the incremental
recoupment of nonrecurring costs on new Foreign Military Sales
cases.
Reports
Combat casualty care.—Not later than 90 days after enactment
of this Act, and following consultation with the Committees on Ap-
propriations, the Secretary of State shall update the report re-
quired under this section in House Report 118–146.
Security assistance coordination.—The Committee notes that re-
cent reports by the Government Accountability Office and the De-
partment of State OIG have highlighted persistent challenges in
the planning process for coordination on security cooperation pro-
grams funded by the Department of Defense for which the Sec-
retary of State has statutory concurrence authority, as well as in

the administration of Department of State-funded security assist-
ance. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, shall
brief the Committees on Appropriations on steps taken to address
these concerns, including project planning related to partner capac-
ity and sustainment as well as, with respect to Department of
State security assistance programs, staffing levels and efforts to
improve program oversight, planning, and management of such
funds.
Section 7036 (Countering the Flow of Fentanyl and Other Synthetic
Drugs)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
lated to assistance for countering the flow of fentanyl towards the
United States border.
Section 7037 (Palestinian Statehood)
This section includes language carried in the prior year estab-
lishing limitations on the use of funds in support of a Palestinian
state.
Section 7038 (Prohibition on Assistance to the Palestinian Broad-
casting Corporation)
This section includes language carried in the prior year restrict-
ing assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation.
Section 7039 (Oversight Requirements for the West Bank and Gaza)
This section includes language, which is substantively the same
as carried in the prior year, placing conditions on assistance for the
West Bank and Gaza.
Section 7040 (Limitation on Assistance for the Palestinian Author-
ity)
This section includes language carried in the prior year placing
limitations on any assistance for the Palestinian Authority and re-
garding Hamas.
Section 7041 (Middle East and North Africa)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding policies and countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Abraham Accords.—The Committee notes the increased under-
standing, cooperation, and interfaith dialogue brought about by
peace and normalization agreements between Israel and Arab
states, including the Abraham Accords, and encourages continued
progress to expand these agreements, the Negev Forum, and other
multilateral efforts. Following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 terrorist at-
tack on Israel, the urgent need for regional unity as well as eco-
nomic and security cooperation has become more apparent than
ever. The Committee further notes the need for dedicated resources
to implement the Israel Relations Normalization Act (division Z of
Public Law 117–103) to deepen ties between Israel and Arab and
Muslim-majority countries. The Committee directs the Secretary of
State to ensure resources are available to leverage, strengthen, and
expand existing peace and normalization agreements and establish
new ones. The Secretary shall consult with the appropriate con-

gressional committees on the availability of flexible resources and
intended uses of such funds.
Arab League boycott of Israel.—It is the sense of the Committee
that: (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary boy-
cott of American firms that have commercial ties with Israel, re-
main an impediment to trade and investment in the Middle East
and should be terminated immediately, as should the Central Of-
fice for the Boycott of Israel; (2) several Arab states and Israel
have made important progress toward peace through treaties and
normalization agreements, including the Abraham Accords, which
open a path toward a more stable and prosperous Middle East; (3)
all Arab League states should join Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan in establishing and nor-
malizing relations with Israel, in addition to promoting peace nego-
tiations, economic cooperation, and security cooperation between
Israelis and Palestinians; (4) the President and the Secretary of
State should continue to vigorously oppose the Arab League boycott
of Israel; and (5) the President should support broadening and
deepening participation in the Abraham Accords, and other nor-
malization agreements, and report annually to the appropriate con-
gressional committees on the United States strategy, including
steps being taken by the United States to encourage additional
Arab League and other Muslim-majority states to normalize rela-
tions with Israel, and the prospect of advancing peace between
Israelis and Palestinians.
Bahrain.—The Committee notes the important role that the
Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement (C–
SIPA) with Bahrain plays in facilitating cooperation between the
United States and Bahrain on areas of shared interest. The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to prioritize diplomatic efforts
to increase membership in C–SIPA to benefit United States inter-
ests in the Middle East and the United States partnership with
Bahrain.
Boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) annual report.—The
Committee remains concerned about international efforts to stig-
matize and isolate Israel through the BDS movement. The Com-
mittee directs, as part of the report required under the heading
‘‘Arab League boycott of Israel’’, that the President add information
about the BDS campaign, which shall cover companies, inter-
national organizations, countries, and other organizations, includ-
ing state investment vehicles, that are involved in promoting the
movement and specific steps the Department of State has taken or
expects to take to discourage or end politically-motivated efforts to
boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel and Israeli entities. Such re-
porting requirement shall not be considered met by the require-
ments of section 909 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforce-
ment Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–125).
Combating antisemitism and promoting tolerance.—Since Hamas’
October 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, Jewish communities
around the world have been subject to significant increases in anti-
semitism and violent attacks. Countering antisemitism in all its
forms is in the national security interests of the United States. The
Committee supports educational and cultural exchange initiatives
that strengthen United States-Israel partnerships through institu-
tions dedicated to promoting tolerance, combating antisemitism,

and fostering cross-cultural understanding. Within the funds pro-
vided under the heading Educational and Cultural Exchange Pro-
grams, the Committee encourages support for programming that
engages students and community leaders in immersive, techno-
logically driven experiences focused on navigating conflict, under-
standing diverse perspectives, and building social cohesion. The
Committee recommends that the Department prioritize partner-
ships with institutions that demonstrate a commitment to edu-
cation, mutual respect, and citizen engagement between the United
States and Israel.
Compliance with the Taylor Force Act.—The Committee under-
scores the importance of full compliance with the restrictions of the
Taylor Force Act (title X of division S of Public Law 115–141) and
continued efforts to fully implement the law, including increasing
diplomatic efforts to end the Palestinian Authority’s practice of
paying salaries to terrorists in Israeli prisons and paying for acts
of terrorism. As described in section 7040 of this Act, and in com-
pliance with the Taylor Force Act, no funding made available by
this Act shall be provided to the Palestinian Authority.
Efforts to release hostages.—The Committee remains deeply con-
cerned that hostages continue to be held in Gaza by Hamas fol-
lowing the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack. The Committee com-
mends ongoing efforts to secure the safe release of those held cap-
tive and the return of the remains of those who were murdered.
The Committee affirms that securing the freedom of the remaining
hostages is a critical United States national security priority and
urges regional partners and allies to intensify their efforts toward
achieving this objective.
Egypt.—The Committee notes that the United States and Egypt
share a mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, eco-
nomic opportunity, and regional security. Since the Camp David
Accords, United States assistance to Egypt has played an impor-
tant role in the country’s economic and military development. The
Committee recognizes the enduring Egypt-Israel peace agreement
as well as Egypt’s ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and counter
Iran’s malign influence in the region. Supporting a stable, demo-
cratic, and prosperous Egypt continues to be a core objective of
United States foreign policy.
Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations re-
garding different options, including a memorandum of under-
standing, to augment long-term planning in the mutually beneficial
United States-Egypt partnership, particularly with respect to secu-
rity assistance.
The Committee directs not less than $1,425,000,000 for assist-
ance for Egypt. Pursuant to subsection (a)(2), an additional
$75,000,000 under Foreign Military Financing Program is included
to make up for prior year Foreign Military Financing Program
funds that expired or were reprogrammed rather than being made
available for the intended purpose. In addition to amounts provided
in subsection (a), the Committee directs that $2,000,000 be made
available from Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Re-
lated Programs and $2,000,000 be made available from Inter-
national Military Education and Training.

The Committee directs that $40,000,000 of the funds appro-
priated under National Security Investment Programs and made
available for assistance for Egypt be allocated for higher education
programs in Egypt, including $17,500,000 for scholarships for
Egyptian students with high financial need to attend not-for-profit
institutions of higher education in Egypt that are currently accred-
ited by a regional accrediting agency recognized by the United
States Department of Education or meet standards equivalent to
those required for United States institutional accreditation by a re-
gional accrediting agency recognized by such Department. Not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State
shall brief the Committees on Appropriations on implementation of
funds made available for scholarships in Egypt.
Iran.—Subsection (b)(1) carries language, which is substantively
the same as carried in the prior year, directing that funds appro-
priated under Diplomatic Programs, National Security Investment
Programs, and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Re-
lated Programs be made available to support: (1) the United States
policy to prevent Iran from achieving the capability to produce or
otherwise obtain a nuclear weapon; (2) an expeditious response to
any violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions or to
efforts that advance Iran’s nuclear program; (3) the implementa-
tion, enforcement, and renewal of sanctions against Iran for its
support of nuclear weapons development, terrorism, human rights
abuses, and ballistic missile and weapons proliferation; and (4) de-
mocracy programs for Iran. The Committee directs that $2,000,000
above the prior year level be made available for the implementa-
tion, enforcement, and renewal of sanctions against Iran.
Pursuant to subsection (b)(3), none of the funds appropriated by
this Act may be: (1) used to implement or enforce a nuclear agree-
ment with Iran in contravention of the Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act of 2015; (2) made available to any foreign entity that
is subject to United Nations or United States sanctions with re-
spect to the Government of Iran; and (3) used to revoke the des-
ignation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign
Terrorist Organization.
The Committee is gravely concerned by Iran’s escalatory nuclear
activities, before and after the June 2025 conflict. The Committee
notes that the International Atomic Energy Agency has found that
Iran is not in compliance with its obligations under the Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty and has consistently failed to provide information
about undeclared nuclear material and activities. The Committee
directs the Secretary of State to work with partners and allies to
address the threat of Iran’s nuclear program and any related fur-
ther proliferation risks, including through the snapback of UN
sanctions on Iran. The Committee continues to emphasize that pre-
venting Iran from achieving the capability to produce or otherwise
obtain a nuclear weapon is vital to United States national security
interests.
The Committee notes the significant loss of life and damage
caused by Iran’s ballistic missile and drone programs and support
for terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East. Any sanctions re-
lief provided to Iran could further Iran’s ability to fund these dan-
gerous lines of effort. The Committee urges the Secretary of State
to ensure that any agreement with Iran includes strict limitations

on missiles, drones, and support for terrorist proxies to prevent
Iran from being a threat to the United States, Israel, and our part-
ners and allies in the Middle East.
The Committee remains concerned by Iran’s ongoing efforts to
expand its regional influence and undermine United States and al-
lied interests through Iran’s support for a network of terrorist
groups including Hizballah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran-backed
militias in Iraq and Syria. Iran’s sustained backing of these
groups—through arms transfers, training, and financial support—
continues to threaten United States interests, regional stability,
and international security. The Committee directs the Secretary of
State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, to prioritize efforts to disrupt Iranian
malign influence, enhance the capabilities of partner forces, and
strengthen deterrence through coordinated diplomatic, security,
and intelligence initiatives.
The Committee continues to support the Iranian people’s desire
for democracy and fundamental freedoms, including the right to
elect the country’s leadership through free and fair elections. The
proven ability of Iranian women to bravely lead the demands for
rights and change is recognized and commended by this Committee
and met with a commitment to continue support from the Amer-
ican people.
Iraq.—The Committee continues to support assistance for Iraq in
support of United States national security interests, particularly
with respect to countering Iran’s malign activities and ensuring the
enduring defeat of ISIS. Funds should be made available for: bilat-
eral economic assistance and international security assistance, in-
cluding in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI); stabilization assist-
ance; humanitarian assistance, including in the KRI; programs to
protect and assist religious and ethnic minority populations; and
programs to increase United States private sector investment.
Funds appropriated by this Act under title III and made available
for bilateral economic assistance for Iraq may not be made avail-
able to an organization or entity which the Secretary of State has
credible information is controlled by the Badr Organization.
The Committee continues to support programming that assists in
the creation of conditions for minorities in Iraq and Syria who were
victims of genocide to safely return to, and remain in, their ances-
tral homeland.
The Committee directs the Department of State to ensure that
assistance, including security assistance, intended for the KRI can
be accessed and used in the KRI as planned.
Within the amount provided under National Security Investment
Programs, the Committee directs $15,000,000 be made available to
support American-style higher education institutions in Iraq, in-
cluding in the KRI, on an open and competitive basis. Such funds
should include support for non-degree and certificate granting pro-
grams at such institutions that equip graduates of universities, in-
stitutes, and secondary schools with the knowledge and skills re-
quired to obtain gainful employment in the private sector. The Sec-
retary of State shall include funds to be allocated for this purpose
in the spend plan submitted pursuant to section 7062(b) of this Act.
Israel.—Subsection (c) directs not less than $3,300,000,000 in
grants for military assistance under the Foreign Military Financing

Program to Israel, which is the same as the budget request. Of the
funds provided, not less than $250,300,000 shall be available for
the procurement in Israel of defense articles and defense services
to the extent that the Government of Israel requests that funds be
used for such purposes, consistent with the 2016 United States-
Israel Memorandum of Understanding and the budget request. The
Committee expects the Secretary of State to prioritize additional
funds appropriated by this Act for Israel, as necessary, to address
urgent security requirements.
The Committee reaffirms its support of the 2016 United States-
Israel Memorandum of Understanding, which demonstrates the
United States’ unshakable commitment to the security of Israel
and to ensuring that Israel’s qualitative military edge and defense
capabilities are maintained. The Committee strongly believes in
the right and ability of Israel to defend itself against the wide
range of threats it faces and believes that a close United States-
Israel security partnership benefits the interests of both countries.
The Committee further believes that by contributing to a safe and
secure Israel, United States assistance positively contributes to any
progress towards peace achieved through direct negotiations be-
tween Israel and the Palestinians.
The Committee assesses that Hamas, even in a degraded state,
continues to pose a significant threat to the security and interests
of the United States, Israel, and regional partners. The Committee
reaffirms unwavering support for Israel’s right to self-defense and
endorses continued United States-Israel security and diplomatic co-
ordination to prevent the resurgence of violent extremism. The
Committee further supports efforts to fully dismantle Hamas’ mili-
tary and political infrastructure and urges the Department of State
to prioritize long-term strategies that promote regional stability
and prevent future conflict.
The Committee notes that Congress previously provided emer-
gency supplemental funds for Israel, including humanitarian as-
sistance. The Committee directs funds to be made available to ad-
dress humanitarian needs in Israel, such as safe medical transport,
in light of continued attacks on the civilian population, including
ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks from
Iran and the Houthis in Yemen.
The Committee supports historical, archaeological, and cultural
initiatives, including in Jerusalem, that strengthen and deepen the
United States-Israel special relationship. The Committee notes that
the City of David in Biblical Jerusalem has been recognized by the
United States Commission for the Preservation of America’s Herit-
age Abroad. Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on
plans to fund and implement such initiatives. The Committee di-
rects not less than $5,000,000 be directed to such initiatives.
Jordan.—The Committee notes the importance of the United
States relationship with the Kingdom of Jordan and the strong
leadership role that Jordan continues to play in advancing peace
and stability in the region. The Secretary of State shall continue
to support economic reforms, including through budget support, to
help ensure Jordan’s long-term stability and help mitigate the im-
pact of hosting large numbers of refugees.

Subsection (d)(1) directs not less than $1,650,000,000 for assist-
ance for Jordan. Of the total amount provided, the Committee di-
rects that not less than $2,500,000 be made available from Inter-
national Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, $10,400,000 be
made available from Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining
and Related Programs, and $3,800,000 be made available from
International Military Education and Training.
Subsection (d)(2) provides an additional $450,000,000 from funds
appropriated by this Act for assistance for Jordan to address ur-
gent needs resulting from the malign activities of Iran and its prox-
ies.
Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall consult with the appropriate congressional commit-
tees on humanitarian assistance for Jordan.
The Committee recognizes that Jordan continues to face eco-
nomic and security challenges in the Middle East, including limited
natural resources, regional conflict, and persistent humanitarian
pressures, which impact United States interests in the region. The
Committee directs the Secretary of State to engage with Jordan on
efforts to advance regional security and stability and to encourage
private-sector investment that strengthens critical sectors such as
water, energy, and infrastructure. The Committee also encourages
such discussions to include continued protection and preservation
of sites of religious significance including the Baptismal Site of
Jesus Christ and the surrounding region.
Lebanon.—Subsection (e) is modified from the prior year by de-
leting language making non-security assistance for Lebanon avail-
able notwithstanding any other provision of law. The bill continues
the requirement that certain conditions be met prior to the obliga-
tion of Foreign Military Financing Program funds for Lebanon. The
Committee intends that assistance provided to the Lebanese Armed
Forces (LAF) not be used against Israel and such assistance will
not affect Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region. The Com-
mittee notes that paragraph (1) of this subsection prohibits funds
for the Lebanese Internal Security Forces or the LAF if either orga-
nization is controlled by a foreign terrorist organization, and the
Committee directs the Secretary of State to regularly consult with
the Committees on Appropriations regarding the rigorous imple-
mentation of this provision, the activities of the LAF, and assist-
ance provided by the United States. The Committee includes fur-
ther language under Reports under this heading.
The Committee directs that support be continued at not less than
the prior year under National Security Investment Programs for
the Lebanon scholarship program and the undergraduate and grad-
uate scholarship program for refugees in Lebanon. The Secretary
of State is directed to consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on an ongoing basis regarding how the programs will be ad-
ministered by not-for-profit educational institutions in Lebanon
that meet the standards required for American accreditation and
other matters related to implementation.
The Committee notes the important and enduring partnerships
with institutions of higher education in Lebanon and directs the
Secretary of State to consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on funding for such institutions, including funding made
available pursuant to section 7060(a)(2).

Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI).—The Committee di-
rects funding for MEPI to support programs consistent with prior
fiscal years. The Committee further directs that, in an effort to
streamline programming and reduce redundancy, funds previously
provided for similar activities for Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon be
made available through MEPI. Not later than 60 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the Committees
on Appropriations on the allocation of funds provided under this
heading and funds made available pursuant to section 7060(a)(2) of
this Act.
Morocco.—The Committee continues to support assistance for
Morocco in support of United States national security interests and
directs not less than $20,000,000 under National Security Invest-
ment Programs and $20,000,000 under Foreign Military Financing
Program.
Muslim Brotherhood.—The Committee is deeply concerned by the
destabilizing role that the Muslim Brotherhood plays in the Middle
East and actions by Muslim Brotherhood entities in various coun-
tries that threaten United States interests in the region. Not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall sub-
mit a report to the appropriate congressional committees describing
the policies, including visa restrictions, the Department of State is
implementing to address the threats posed by the Muslim Brother-
hood. For the purposes of this paragraph, the appropriate congres-
sional committees shall also include the Committees on the Judici-
ary.
Syria.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to take all
practicable steps to ensure that mechanisms are in place for moni-
toring, oversight, and control of any assistance provided inside
Syria and notes that section 7015(j), which requires prompt notifi-
cation of any assistance diverted or destroyed, applies to funds
made available for such assistance for Syria. Pursuant to section
7015(f), funds may not be obligated or expended for assistance for
Syria except as provided through the regular notification proce-
dures of the Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee notes significant changes with respect to Syria
following the fall of the Assad regime and ongoing actions to lift
United States sanctions and other restrictions on Syria pursuant to
Executive Order 14312, relating to Providing for the Revocation of
Syria Sanctions. This Act contains a new requirement that any
new program or activity in Syria initiated in fiscal year 2026 shall
be subject to prior consultation with the appropriate congressional
committees.
Remnants of the Assad regime and associated forces remain in
Syria and continue to have financial interests within parts of Syria.
Any United States assistance made available for Syria should be
programmed in a way that does not benefit such entities.
The Committee supports efforts to de-escalate tensions across
Syria. The Committee opposes any actions that would inhibit ef-
forts to address the security threat and humanitarian challenges
posed by conditions at the al-Hol displacement camp and associated
ISIS-detention sites administered by the Syrian Democratic Forces.
The Committee recognizes the longtime efforts of local Syrian
and diaspora organizations, as well as relief organizations, to im-
plement lifesaving interventions in Syria, including support for

emergency medical and rescue response and chemical weapons in-
vestigations. The Committee urges the Secretary of State, within
the requirements of this Act, to work to ensure continued delivery
of humanitarian aid into and within Syria.
West Bank and Gaza.—Subsection (g) includes language modified
from the prior year regarding conditions related to the West Bank
and Gaza.
Monitoring, notification, and vetting.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to promptly inform the appropriate congressional
committees of any alleged incident involving any United States as-
sistance used in such a way that adversely affects or jeopardizes
such assistance. This includes any incidents where United States
assistance has directly or indirectly been provided to an individual
or organization with ties to terrorism or incitement of violence.
The BDS movement has engaged in the spread of anti-Israel sen-
timent and antisemitism. The Secretary of State shall expand vet-
ting policies and practices to ensure that United States assistance
is not provided to or through any individual, private entity, govern-
ment entity, or educational institution that the Secretary knows or
has reason to believe advocates, plans, sponsors, engages in, or has
engaged in, the BDS movement. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to strengthen policies and procedures to ensure organiza-
tions supported through funding are not participants in the BDS
movement, are not glorifying violence, and are not providing sup-
port for lawfare against the United States or Israel at the Inter-
national Criminal Court (ICC) or International Court of Justice
(ICJ).
The Committee notes allegations of assistance provided to indi-
viduals or entities engaging in political activities and directs the
Secretary of State to expand vetting policies and practices to in-
clude an assessment of political neutrality and a review of state-
ments by individuals or organizations that constitute engagement
in political advocacy, incitement, or support for terrorism that
would cause operational and reputational risks for the United
States Government.
The Committee supports efforts that foster reconciliation and en-
gagement and therefore recommends not less than the prior fiscal
year level under National Security Investment Programs for the
Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act (title VIII
of division K of Public Law 116–260).
Reports
BDS vetting.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall update the report required under this
heading in section 7041 of House Report 118–146 on steps taken
to expand vetting policies and procedures to ensure that organiza-
tions receiving United States assistance do not directly or indi-
rectly participate in or promote the BDS movement.
Countering Hizballah and Iran in Lebanon.—Not later than 90
days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall sub-
mit to the appropriate congressional committees a report describ-
ing: (1) the presence or deployment south of the Litani River of any
armed groups other than the LAF, including Hizballah and Pales-
tinian terrorist groups, and efforts by the Government of Lebanon,
including the LAF, to counter such presence; (2) any production,

Hizballah, Palestinian terrorist groups, or other designated ter-
rorist entities, and efforts by the Government of Lebanon, including
the LAF, to counter such activities; (3) the extent to which the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is fulfilling its
mandate under United Nations Security Council Resolution
(UNSCR) 1701 and contributing to implementing the November 26,
2024 Cessation of Hostilities agreement; (4) the extent of the LAF’s
compliance with UNSCR 1701 and the Cessation of Hostilities
agreement in Lebanon, and the LAF’s cooperation on implementing
such agreement; (5) any capability gaps or other factors that hinder
the LAF’s ability to effectively comply with UNSCR 1701 and the
Cessation of Hostilities agreement and any plans for United States
assistance to Lebanon to be used to address these gaps; (6) the ex-
tent of Hizballah’s influence within Lebanon, including the legisla-
tive, judicial, and financial institutions of Lebanon and the LAF;
(7) the extent of Iranian influence in Lebanon; and (8) illegal
money laundering or smuggling of cash into Lebanon by Iran or
sanctioned persons. The report shall be submitted in an unclassi-
fied form but may contain a classified annex that is transmitted
separately from the unclassified report.
Prisoner payments.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State is directed to submit a report to the
appropriate congressional committees on the status of negotiating
an end to the Palestinian Authority’s practice of paying salaries to
terrorists and families of terrorists serving in prison and other
forms of such support.
Religious freedom.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State shall update the report required
under this heading in section 7041 of House Report 117–84 con-
cerning the treatment of Christian communities in Egypt.
Section 7042 (Africa)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding assistance for Africa.
Cabo Verde.—The Committee directs funding at not less than the
prior fiscal year level for Cabo Verde for strengthening bilateral en-
gagement and economic investments.
Cameroon.—The Committee remains concerned about human
rights violations committed against Cameroonian citizens, includ-
ing displaced persons in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon, and
urges the Secretary of State to encourage the Government of Cam-
eroon to support genuine political dialogue to resolve the
Anglophone crisis. The Secretary shall ensure that any security as-
sistance from the United States is not used in the perpetration of
human rights abuses.
Democratic Republic of the Congo.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to brief the Committees on Appropriations with-
in 90 days of enactment of this Act on efforts to protect minority
communities in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, address
the root causes of violence, including the unauthorized extraction
and trade of natural resources, and respond to recent atrocities
through the provision of humanitarian assistance and the imposi-
tion of targeted sanctions, as appropriate.

Ethiopia.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to brief
the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of
this Act on efforts to ensure humanitarian access, address ongoing
human rights abuses, and support efforts to achieve a lasting peace
in Ethiopia, with particular attention to worsening food insecurity
and the protection of civilians.
Malawi.—The Committee continues to support higher education
investments in Malawi that expand access, promote economic
growth, and strengthen the agricultural workforce through skills
development and self-sustaining models at levels consistent with
prior years.
Nigeria.—The Committee directs that funds continue to be made
available to support religious freedom and atrocity response
projects, including through FBOs and nongovernmental organiza-
tions from the affected communities, that improve local commu-
nication, documentation, and distribution of humanitarian assist-
ance for communities impacted by violence in Nigeria, including in
the Middle Belt, Benue State, and other states and communities
impacted by violent jihadist extremism.
Power Africa.—The Committee supports levels of funding for
Power Africa that are consistent with prior years and that promote
an all-of-the-above energy development strategy for sub-Saharan
Africa that includes the use of oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric,
wind, solar, and geothermal power, and other sources of energy.
South Africa.—The Committee notes that the United States has
provided significant financial support to the people of South Africa
while the Government of South Africa has worked in direct opposi-
tion to United States and partner nation interests, including
through military and economic cooperation with the Russian Fed-
eration, the PRC, and Iran, pursuing baseless charges of genocide
against Israel, while not Hamas, at the International Court of Jus-
tice, and participating in the practice of human trafficking through
the use of Cuban doctors. Therefore, subsection (b) prohibits funds
to the Government of South Africa unless the Secretary of State
certifies and reports to the Committees on Appropriations that the
Government of South Africa has met the following conditions—
(1) ceased cooperation with United States adversaries;
(2) ceased participating in human trafficking, such as the ex-
ploitation of Cuban medical professionals; and
(3) ceased the implementation of policies that undermine in-
herent property rights of the citizens of South Africa.
Sudan.—Of the funds made available by this Act for assistance
to Sudan, the Secretary of State shall prioritize support for diplo-
matic efforts—including those led by civil society—that promote the
participation of Sudanese women and youth in conflict resolution,
as well as for activities that facilitate the delivery of humanitarian
assistance and the protection of civilians, with particular attention
to survivors of violence and displaced populations.
United States-Somaliland engagement.—The Committee directs
the Secretary of State to submit a report, not later than 120 days
after enactment of this Act, to the appropriate congressional com-
mittees on potential areas for improved United States engagement
with Somaliland, including in security, diplomacy, trade, and devel-
opment.

Report
Power Africa.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this
Act, the Committee directs the Secretary of State, in coordination
with the CEO of the DFC, to submit a report to the appropriate
congressional committees that details planned support,
disaggregated by source of energy, for the Power Africa program in
fiscal year 2026. Such report shall also include detail on new pro-
gram outcomes expected as a result of such support, which are re-
quired, at minimum, to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan
Africa and bringing 30 gigawatts of new power generation in sub-
Saharan Africa to financial close by 2030.
Section 7043 (East Asia and the Pacific)
This section includes language modified from the prior year con-
taining limitations and prohibitions, directives on assistance, and
guidance for diplomatic and development activities and programs
in East Asia and the Pacific.
Burma.—The Committee recommendation includes $50,000,000
under title III to implement the BURMA Act of 2022 (subtitle E of
Public Law 117–263). Additionally, funds under International Hu-
manitarian Assistance are available to address the deepening hu-
manitarian crisis in Burma.
For the purposes of section 5575 of the Burma Act of 2022 and
assistance for Burma made available by this Act and prior acts
making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign oper-
ations, and related programs, ‘‘non-lethal assistance’’ shall include
equipment and associated training to support: (1) atrocities preven-
tion; (2) the protection of civilians from military attack; (3) the de-
livery of humanitarian assistance; (4) investigations into genocide
and human rights violations committed by the Burmese military;
(5) local governance and the provision of services in areas outside
the control of the Burmese military; and (6) medical trauma care,
supplies, and training.
Consistent with prior years, the Committee directs that funds
that are made available for assistance for Burma shall be made
available for programs and activities to support desertions from the
military junta and its allied entities, following consultation with
the appropriate congressional committees.
The Committee notes the dire conditions in Burma and continues
to condemn the military coup and associated regime atrocities and
does not provide any assistance to the Tatmadaw, State Adminis-
tration Council, or entities affiliated with the military junta. The
Committee recommendation includes funds to investigate and docu-
ment violations of human rights committed by the Burmese mili-
tary, including against ethnic groups in Burma.
The Committee recommends the Department of State explore the
feasibility of supporting the capacity of local partners to provide ex-
plosives risk education, victim assistance, and related programs to
mitigate against the peril of mines and other unexploded ordnance
in Burma.
Cambodia.—The Committee notes the need for a new United
States integrated country strategy for Cambodia that advances the
protection of American citizens and United States national security
interests in combatting cybercrime and other transnational crimi-
nal activities, supports greater Cambodian strategic autonomy, in-

cluding through strengthened military-to-military ties with the
United States, and seeks to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific
where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and terri-
torial integrity are upheld and defended.
Electronic waste.—The Committee is concerned about the un-
checked export of electronic waste, or e-waste, such as old cell
phones, computers, and servers to other nations. The flow to U.S.
e-waste to China and other foreign nations is on track to reach 80
million tons by 2030. Unfortunately, when e-waste is discarded
overseas, it is frequently done in ways that are environmentally de-
structive or unlawfully turned into counterfeit electronics. These
counterfeit electronics are often then resold to buyers in the United
States where the faulty materials can make their way into critical
U.S. military equipment. The Committee directs the Secretary to
coordinate with appropriate federal agencies on efforts to ensure
that the recycling and export of United States e-waste does not un-
dermine national security.
Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Countering PRC Influence Fund.—
The Committee recommendation includes $1,800,000,000 under ti-
tles III through VI for the Indo-Pacific Strategy, which is the fiscal
year 2025 enacted level. It also includes $400,000,000 for the Coun-
tering PRC Influence Fund.
Funds for the Countering PRC Influence Fund are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:
COUNTERING PRC INFLUENCE FUND
[Budget authority in thousands of dollars]
Account Budget Authority
National Security Investment Programs....................................................................................................... $210,000
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement................................................................................ 70,000
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs............................................................. 35,000
Foreign Military Financing Program ............................................................................................................. 85,000
Pursuant to subsection (b)(2), the Countering PRC Influence
Fund should be used for activities that provide the highest stra-
tegic impact to counter PRC influence globally. The Secretary of
State should develop a strategic impact measurement system that
assesses PRC influence globally and measures the strategic impact
of United States involvement in countries by sector and activity.
Such system should be used to help prioritize and guide the alloca-
tion and obligation of funds from the Countering PRC Influence
Fund. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a briefing to
the appropriate congressional committees, not later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act, detailing the processes for admin-
istering the Countering PRC Influence Fund and how the strategic
impact measurement system informs such processes.
The Committee notes that our allies and partners in Southeast
Asia must strengthen their law enforcement capacity to combat
Chinese grey-zone aggression, including illegal, unregulated, and
unreported fishing, and CCP maritime militia and coast guard pa-
trols that violate their exclusive economic zones. The Committee
recommendation includes robust funding for the Countering PRC
Influence Fund to address these threats.

The Committee recommendation includes funding for AI to en-
hance current maritime situational awareness capabilities to sup-
port the operational needs of the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Mari-
time Domain Awareness.
The Committee notes that country members of the Association of
Southeast Asian States (ASEAN) are projected to become the fifth
largest economy in the world and recognizes the importance of
strengthening ties between those member states and the United
States, including to support secure supply chains and related re-
search collaboration. The Committee directs $1,000,000 be made
available for related training partnerships with an institution of
higher education.
The Committee recommendation includes funding to establish
partnerships between the Department of State and institutions of
higher education with research security programs to help safeguard
America’s primacy in science and technology from predation and
other threats from the PRC.
The Committee is deeply concerned by the surge of PRC influ-
ence across the Latin America and Caribbean region, which, com-
bined with unprecedented narcotics trafficking, organized crime,
and violence, is presenting an overwhelming challenge for partner
governments. The Committee supports efforts by the Secretary of
State to prioritize funds from the Countering PRC Influence Fund
to support strategically targeted programs region-wide, including
efforts to combat illegal fishing, increase transparency of public
procurement systems, address vulnerabilities at key ports, and to
promote the use of trusted technology. Not later than 45 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the Commit-
tees on Appropriations on the amount allocated to expand such ef-
forts.
The Committee directs $5,000,000 under National Security In-
vestment Programs be made available to support the work of the
Quad Investors Network to strengthen collaboration between the
public and private sectors in the United States and the Quad part-
ners of India, Japan, and Australia to promote and scale invest-
ments in critical emerging technologies in the Indo-Pacific.
The Committee notes that subsection (b)(3)(B) includes a restric-
tion on the use of funds provided by this Act and prior acts from
being made available for the use of technology developed by the
PRC. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to apply this re-
striction to any high-performance or other computer, video tech-
nology equipment, or printer made by an entity that is owned, con-
trolled, or influenced by the PRC or the CCP, including those con-
tracted from third parties.
Japan.—The Committee supports and encourages continued re-
gional partnership between the United States, Japan, and other re-
gional allies in pursuing policies that enhance stability in the Indo-
Pacific.
Mongolia.—The Committee supports the development of pro-
gramming and partnerships on weather-related forecasting and
early warning and response systems, including in Mongolia and
other areas that lack such forecasting tools.
North Korea.—Pursuant to subsection (c)(1), none of the funds
provided by this Act may be made available to the central govern-
ment of a country the Secretary of State determines engages in sig-

nificant transactions contributing to the malicious cyber-intrusion
capabilities of the Government of North Korea.
Pacific Islands.—The Committee recommendation includes not
less than $175,000,000 in titles III and IV for PICs, including
$60,000,000 for the South Pacific Tuna Treaty.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for small
grants programs to assist local communities across PICs.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for a Flexible
Microfinance Facility, launched by the DFC in partnership with the
Department of State, to expand access to finance for micro, small,
and medium-sized enterprises in PICs.
The Committee supports efforts to counter PRC propaganda in
PICs consistent with the limitations of section 7024 and directs the
Secretary of State to provide funding for such purpose.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for people-to-
people exchange programs between citizens of PICs and the United
States, with a focus on partnering with universities in Pacific loca-
tions with close and long-standing ties throughout PICs and with
expertise in Pacific Islands languages, cultures, and area studies.
The Committee directs that funds be made available for trade ca-
pacity building activities to improve the enabling environment for
trade and investment in PICs.
The Committee recommendation includes funding for a new, de-
mand-driven initiative to diversify trade opportunities in PICs and
help make the business environment and economic system more ef-
ficient, transparent, and resilient.
The Committee recommendation includes an increase over the
fiscal year 2025 enacted level for PICs and directs a portion be
made available for assistance for the Freely Associated States, in
addition to funds for such States included in the Compacts of Free
Association. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to col-
laborate with partners in the Freely Associated States on the po-
tential for increased efficiencies and reduced costs in health care.
The Committee supports funds above the prior year level to ad-
dress World War II-era unexploded ordinance in PICs, including
funds for Papua New Guinea and $2,500,000 for the Solomon Is-
lands.
The Committee supports the Department of State’s continued
support for the Advancing Port Enhancement and Customs Secu-
rity program in PICs. The Committee directs $3,000,000 to support
Pacific partners’ ability to strengthen port security and customs,
counter-trafficking, and anti-money laundering efforts.
The Committee continues to support the Young Pacific Leaders
Program, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Program, and the
Fulbright Program in the Indo-Pacific region and urges the Sec-
retary of State to prioritize such activities in the operating plan for
fiscal year 2026.
PRC.—Subsection (e) prohibits funds in this Act to: (1) the PRC
or CCP; (2) implement, administer, carry out, modify, revise, or en-
force any action that directly supports or facilitates forced labor or
other violations of human rights, crimes against humanity, or geno-
cide in the PRC; and (3) academic institutions partnering in STEM
programs with colleges or universities in China controlled by the
PRC or CCP.

Section 7031(a)(4) prohibits funds in this Act from being used by
foreign countries to repay loans to the Government of the PRC.
The Committee supports the role of international broadcasting
activities that provide essential news and information services in
East Asia and PICs, including the Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur, and
Cantonese language services. The Committee notes that such ac-
tivities were instrumental in exposing the CCP’s cover-up of
COVID–19 deaths as well as the human rights abuses in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
The Committee is concerned about the vulnerability of refugees
who have fled persecution in the PRC. Funds are available under
International Humanitarian Assistance to support Uyghur and
other Turkic refugees. The Committee supports efforts by the Sec-
retary of State to work with host governments to provide access to
basic services for such refugees and to prevent their refoulement to
the PRC where they could face torture and other gross violations
of human rights.
Philippines.—The Committee notes the ongoing threat to the
Philippines posed by the PRC’s campaign of intimidation and mari-
time occupation in the South China Sea and provides $100,000,000
under Foreign Military Financing Program and $80,300,000 under
National Security Investment Programs to help modernize the alli-
ance, strengthen deterrence, and continue to support a prosperous,
secure Philippines.
Public Law 106–554.—Of the funds appropriated by this Act, not
less than $11,500,000 shall be made available to carry out the pur-
poses of the Vietnam Education Foundation Act of 2000, of which
not less than $2,500,000 shall be from funds under Educational
Cultural Exchange Programs and not less than $9,000,000 shall be
from funds under National Security Investment Programs.
Taiwan.—The Committee recommendation includes $500,000,000
from funds made available under Foreign Military Financing Pro-
gram, including for Foreign Military Financing Program direct loan
and loan guarantee authority, and not less than the prior fiscal
year level under International Military Education and Training to
enhance Taiwan’s capacity to resist coercion and aggression and to
strengthen interoperability with the United States.
The Committee strongly supports efforts by AIT and the Depart-
ment of State to support Taiwan’s engagement with international
organizations, existing diplomatic partners, and like-minded coun-
tries. The Committee also supports efforts by the Taiwan authori-
ties and civil society to further strengthen institutions there and
build resilience in the face of intensifying PRC coercion.
The Committee notes that the Department of State’s guidance re-
garding relations with Taiwan are governed in part by the prin-
ciples outlined in the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (subtitle B of
Public Law 116–260). Not later than 60 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State is directed to brief the appropriate
congressional committees on how Department guidance on Taiwan
meets the goals and objectives outlined in such Act, including with
regard to the fact that Taiwan is governed by a representative de-
mocracy that is peacefully constituted through free and fair elec-
tions that reflect the will of the people of Taiwan.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to ensure that offi-
cials from Taiwan seeking discussions in the United States with

Federal or state government officials are admitted for entry in ac-
cordance with section 221 of Public Law 103–416.
Tibet.—The Committee continues to support implementation of
the Ngwang Choephel Fellows Program consistent with prior years.
The Committee directs that continued funding be made available
for Tibetan exchanges and fellowship programs, consistent with
section 346 of the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (Public
Law 116–260).
The Committee supports the continued allocation of funds to as-
sist Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal at levels commensurate
with prior years. The Committee remains concerned that Tibetans
living in Nepal are restricted from enjoying certain basic rights re-
sulting from agreements in recent years between the governments
of Nepal and the PRC, which has resulted in increased vulner-
ability for Tibetans both within and transiting through Nepal. The
Committee encourages the Secretary of State to press the Govern-
ment of Nepal to honor the agreement reached with the United Na-
tions High Commissioner for Refugees to respect the principle of
non-refoulement.
The Committee directs that funding be made available at not less
than the prior year level to promote human rights and democracy
in Tibetan communities.
Reports
Belt and Road Initiative impact assessment.—The Committee di-
rects the Department of State, in coordination with other relevant
Federal agencies, to report on the impact of PRC lending and other
financial practices on Belt and Road Initiative participant countries
and to recommend best practices for addressing the impact of such
activities through United States diplomatic and programmatic en-
gagements. The assessment should consider the impact of these
practices on corruption and social stability within a representative
sample of such countries, among other issues. The Committee fur-
ther directs that the lessons learned from such assessment be
shared with the European Union and other partners of the United
States to help develop a unified approach in addressing PRC efforts
to create economic dependencies and to coerce others through such
initiative and similar initiatives.

based engagement as part of assistance for PICs to the appropriate
congressional committees.
Hong Kong.—Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act,

committees an update to the report described in section 301 of the
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5731).

rects that not later than 120 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall update the report required under this

the PRC.
Section 7044 (South and Central Asia)
This section includes language modified from the prior year con-
taining limitations and directives for diplomatic and other activi-
ties and programs in South and Central Asia.
Afghanistan.—Subsection (a) prohibits funds appropriated by
this Act from being made available for assistance to the Taliban.
The Committee remains gravely concerned by the plight of Af-
ghans under Taliban rule, particularly women and girls. The Com-
mittee notes that the Taliban continues to ban women and girls
from education, health centers, cemeteries, sports, driving, and
traveling in public without a male escort or a ‘‘legitimate reason’’.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to take all appro-
priate actions to support and protect women and girls and ensure
such efforts are a top priority in United States diplomatic engage-
ment on Afghanistan.
Funds provided pursuant to this section shall be made available
following consultation with the Committees on Appropriations.
The Committee notes that education based upon American val-
ues is critical to countering radical ideologies and therefore directs
that funds be made available to support access to education for
women and girls in Afghanistan, including online education for
those who would otherwise be unable or severely limited in their
ability to attend school. Such investments are key to furthering a
more stable and free Afghanistan, which is directly in the United
States national security interest.
Bangladesh.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
continue to prioritize humanitarian assistance to help displaced
Rohingya refugees who have fled from Burma to Bangladesh. Such
assistance should include activities to improve cooperation with
host communities in Bangladesh.
India and Pakistan.—The Committee commends the Secretary of
State for the diplomatic engagement that facilitated the cessation
of hostilities between India and Pakistan following the April 22,
2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir.

The Committee urges the Secretary of State to intensify diplomatic
efforts aimed at de-escalation and the prevention of further conflict.
Pakistan.—The Secretary of State is directed to withhold from
obligation $33,000,000 in assistance for Pakistan until the Sec-
retary of State reports to the Committees on Appropriations that
Dr. Shakil Afridi has been released from prison and cleared of all
charges relating to the assistance provided to the United States in
locating Osama bin Laden. Funds provided by this Act under For-
eign Military Financing Program may only be made available to
support counterterrorism and counterinsurgency capabilities in
Pakistan.
Reports
Afghanistan.—Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate con-
gressional committees detailing plans, consistent with the restric-
tion contained in section 7044(a) of this Act, to protect and
strengthen the rights of Afghan women and girls, support higher
education programs, including online programs and other higher
education institutions in South Asia and the Middle East that are
hosting Afghan students, support and protect journalists and en-
hance access to uncensored news and information, consistent with
the limitations under section 7024.
Afghanistan SIV.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to submit a report, not later than 45 days after enactment of this
Act, to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of
the Afghan SIV program and the specific actions taken to provide
personnel, operational, and technical support to adjudicate and
process Afghan SIV cases.
Bangladesh.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to
the appropriate congressional committees on the extent to which
the government of Bangladesh supports human rights, including
freedoms of expression, association, and religion, due process, and
free and fair elections.
Pakistan.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to
the appropriate congressional committees on the status of Dr.
Shakil Afridi and the actions the United States has taken to secure
his release from prison and ensure that he has been cleared of all
charges related to the assistance provided in locating Osama bin
Laden.
Section 7045 (Latin America and the Caribbean)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding programs and funding for countries in Latin America and
the Caribbean.
Assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean
The Committee supports the leadership of the Secretary of State
with a coherent United States foreign policy toward the Western
Hemisphere that aligns with core American values and effectively
addresses challenges that threaten United States sovereignty and
national security. The Committee further supports the Secretary’s
efforts to deepen cooperation and reward democratic partners in

the region, including Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama,
Paraguay, and Peru, whose alignment with United States priorities
strengthens regional stability and prosperity. At the same time, the
Committee underscores the importance of countering malign actors,
including the authoritarian regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ven-
ezuela, and expresses concern over the deterioration of bilateral co-
operation with Colombia on shared national security objectives.
The Committee looks forward to the use of diplomacy, foreign as-
sistance, and targeted tools to bolster allies and hold adversarial
governments accountable.
Alliance for Development in Democracy.—The Alliance for Devel-
opment in Democracy (ADD) is a Dominican Republic-organized
partnership with Panama, Costa Rica, and Ecuador building more
secure supply chains integrated with the United States market,
partnering on nearshoring, fighting corruption, and countering nar-
cotics trafficking. The Committee strongly endorses continued sup-
port for initiatives that strengthen such partnership and supports
its vision for an alliance, comprised of United States allies, that
promotes democracy, free markets, and cooperation. Support for
such an alliance demonstrates the importance this Committee
places on supporting partners in the Western Hemisphere. The
Committee supports Department of State programs that facilitate
platforms of engagement with ADD countries.
Countering antisemitism in Latin America.—The Committee is
concerned by rising antisemitism targeting Jewish diaspora com-
munities in Latin American nations, including historic United
States partners and allies like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, particu-
larly instances of elected leaders fueling prejudice against Jewish
communities through social media and official government chan-
nels or otherwise neglecting their responsibility to protect Jewish
communities and other marginalized groups. The Committee con-
demns antisemitism in all forms and urges the Secretary of State
to encourage Latin American and Caribbean leaders to proactively
condemn and counter antisemitism in their nations.
Damage caused by communism in Latin America.—The Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to support partnerships with
universities in order to establish platforms of researched informa-
tion about the practices and victims of communism and authori-
tarian control in Latin America, including political prisoners. Such
partnerships should leverage Latino student bodies to serve as re-
searchers and data collectors, including students who have emi-
grated from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.
Latin America broadcasting.—The Committee supports inter-
national broadcasting activities in Latin America. The Committee
directs the Secretary of State to put an emphasis on programming
in Mexico. The Committee expects a continued focus on countries,
such as Venezuela and Nicaragua, where government censorship of
news coverage, restrictions on the free flow of information, and in-
terference from countries, such as the Russian Federation and the
PRC, continues to increase.
Organization of American States.—The Secretary of State should
consider voluntary contributions to the Organization of American
States for human rights and democracy programs, consistent with
the Organization’s charter commitments to promote representative
democracy and protect human rights.

91
Strategic priorities.—Not later than 30 days after enactment of
this Act, the Secretary of State shall consult with the appropriate
congressional committees on a hemispheric plan to further the stra-
tegic priorities contained in subsection (a) and include the baseline
definitions for the referenced requirements.
Central America
Central America strategic partners.—The Committee supports the
efforts of the Secretary of State to employ more rigorous effort and
ingenuity in providing assistance to partners in Central America
who effectively cooperate on broad policy objectives, such as coun-
ternarcotics and migration, and share values aligned with the
United States.
Certification requirement.—Subsection (b)(2) describes conditions
the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
must meet for full funding allocated to such governments to be re-
leased. The Committee does not include explicit authority to repro-
gram funds if the conditions are not met.
The Committee notes that the required certifications provide an
opportunity for the Department of State to ensure that the central
governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are making
meaningful progress to address the conditions on assistance out-
lined in this Act. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
prioritize engagement on actions needed to fulfill the certification
requirement, including tax refunds owed to American businesses
operating in the region.
Combating corruption.—The Committee supports funds for anti-
corruption programs in Central America. Such funds shall only
support entities with sufficient authority, independence, and legal
mandate to investigate and prosecute corruption. Within the funds
made available pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the Committee sup-
ports assistance for offices of Attorneys General focused on corrup-
tion, money laundering, financial crimes, human rights crimes,
asset forfeitures, and criminal analysis if the Secretary of State de-
termines such offices and units have the authority, independence,
and will to hold corrupt and illicit actors accountable.
Combating human trafficking in Central America.—The Com-
mittee supports increased funds above the fiscal year 2025 level for
programs to combat human trafficking in Central America.
Costa Rica.—The Committee recognizes Costa Rica as a reliable
democratic partner facing increasing challenges from narcotics traf-
ficking, transnational criminal organizations, and malign influence
from the Russian Federation and the PRC. The Committee directs
that not less than prior year levels be made available under Inter-
national Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Foreign Mili-
tary Financing Program. The Committee intends this funding to
help counter narcotics trafficking and other threats to United
States national security and to foster greater military interoper-
ability with the United States.
The Committee encourages enhanced security cooperation, in-
cluding provision of non-lethal maritime domain awareness assets
and expanded cybersecurity cooperation for critical infrastructure
defense and ransomware training. The Committee recognizes Costa
Rica’s role in detecting fentanyl precursors and disrupting illicit fi-
nancial networks and recommends prioritization under the Central

America Regional Security Initiative. Additionally, the Committee
encourages DFC to explore financing tools for upper-middle-income
democratic partners like Costa Rica, with priority for projects that
improve migration management infrastructure, cybersecurity resil-
ience, and near-shoring of United States supply chains.
El Salvador.—The Committee notes the reduction of violence and
restoration of state control through operations against MS-13 and
other transnational gangs by the Government of El Salvador. The
Committee supports deeper United States-El Salvador cooperation
and directs the Secretary of State to promote the expansion of joint
operations, including enhanced INTERPOL coordination, use of fo-
rensic and biometric tools, financial intelligence support, and co-
ordinated operations against trafficking, extortion, and arms smug-
gling. The Committee supports continued cooperation with the Gov-
ernment of El Salvador to address irregular migration.
Independent journalists in Central America.—The Committee af-
firms the need for independent, investigative journalists in Central
America to disseminate information to effectively fight corruption
and promote freedom. The Committee recommends the Department
of State consider efforts to seek justice for threats, violence, and
other actions targeting independent journalists.
Over-collection of taxes.—The over-collection of Value Added Tax
(VAT) and Corporate Income Tax continues to disincentivize new
investment by American businesses in Guatemala. The Committee
encourages the Department of State to explore opportunities to en-
gage with the new administration to foster a business-friendly en-
vironment, including the possibility of legislation to remedy the
over-collection of taxes. Additionally, the Committee urges the De-
partment to support administrative efforts aimed at expediting res-
olution of outstanding claims, potentially by allowing for cross-cred-
iting against other tax obligations.
In Honduras, the Committee is concerned by reports that United
States businesses cannot pursue potential near-term investments
because of the unavailability of United States dollar currency ex-
change for inbound businesses and because tax refunds have re-
mained undelivered for several years. The Committee encourages
the Department of State to work with the central government of
Honduras to formalize and refine a mechanism that allows for the
cross-crediting of refunds against current and future tax obliga-
tions, as well as exemptions from VAT on new construction
projects. The Committee is also aware that many United States
citizens have longstanding property and financial claims against
Honduras. The Committee therefore directs the Secretary of State
to refer all United States citizens’ property and financial claims
against Honduras to the Department of Justice Foreign Claims
Settlement Commission for review and adjudication not later than
90 days after enactment of this Act.
Notification and spend plans.—The Committee recommendation
includes the special notification and spend plan requirements for
assistance for Central America and emphasizes the importance of
utilizing these tools to provide the Committees on Appropriations
with timely updates on United States assistance and its relation-
ship to: (1) corresponding regional and country-specific strategies;
(2) goals and objectives; (3) performance monitoring indicators and
benchmarks; (4) context indicators, including obstacles and oppor-

tunities for growth; (5) the results of assessments and evaluations;
and (6) the role of other key stakeholders, including donors and
counterpart governments. The spend plan shall outline steps re-
quired to obligate funding in a timely manner.
Panama.—The Committee recognizes the Republic of Panama’s
continued leadership in managing significant migration flows
through the Darie´n Gap and its broader role as a strategic regional
partner. The Committee supports opportunities for the United
States to assist Panama in addressing migration and advancing
shared regional priorities. Such support may include: (1) electronic
processing and recordkeeping of migrant populations; (2) special-
ized land and aerial vehicles for monitoring the Darie´n National
Park region; (3) cybersecurity and critical infrastructure resilience;
(4) strategic development finance to strengthen economic oppor-
tunity; and (5) enhanced counternarcotics operations and port secu-
rity.
Preventing violence against women and girls.—The Committee
recommendation includes funds for assistance in Central America
and the Caribbean to prevent violence against women and girls.
Reintegration assistance.—The Committee supports programs
that promote the safe and humane return and reintegration of chil-
dren to the Northern Triangle, including those victimized by vio-
lence and human trafficking.
United States investment in Pro´spera ZEDE.—The Committee is
concerned by repeated expropriation attempts and threats by the
Government of Honduras against United States investments in
Pro´spera ZEDE. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of State shall report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions on: (1) actions by the Honduran government constituting ex-
propriation, including analysis of the September 2024 Honduras
Supreme Court ruling; (2) threats and hostile acts by officials
against United States investors; (3) foreign government involve-
ment in anti-investor campaigns; (4) the impact on bilateral rela-
tions and United States assistance; and (5) necessary diplomatic
and policy measures to protect United States investors. The report
shall also outline steps to represent affected investors.
Reports, Central America
Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).—Not later
than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the Committee directs
the Secretary of State to provide to the Committees on Appropria-
tions a report on the uses of all funds provided for CARSI on a
country-by-country basis for each program, project, and activity for
fiscal years 2023 through 2025.
DFC investment in Central America.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the CEO of the DFC shall update the
report required under this heading in House Report 118–146 on
ways in which the DFC can further engage upper-middle-income
countries in Central America, notably Costa Rica and Panama.
Such report shall include areas of opportunities and remaining
challenges to supporting private sector investments in such coun-
tries.
Due diligence on tax refunds.—The report required under this
heading in House Report 118–146 directed the Secretary of State
to provide a summary of engagements with government officials in

Northern Triangle countries to address overdue tax refunds. The
Committee remains interested in understanding the steps taken by
the Department of State to work with local governments to pro-
mote a pro-investment environment, including by facilitating tax
refunds owed to American businesses. Therefore, the Committee di-
rects the Secretary to provide an update to the report not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, including the number of
cases resolved and still outstanding. Such report should also cite
the tax refund amounts believed to be owed to American companies
by the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras and
the status of such refunds.
Honduras.—Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit an update
to the report required under this heading in House Report 118–146
regarding the successes and failures of the Government of Hon-
duras in democratic governance, rule of law, economic freedom, and
human rights. The report shall include assessments of the impact
Honduras’ relationships with Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, the Rus-
sian Federation, and the PRC have on United States national secu-
rity interests. The report shall also include a cost-benefit analysis
on United States assistance to Honduras in fiscal year 2025 to de-
termine whether such assistance has yielded material results, in-
cluding for American investors and business owners operating in
Honduras.
Colombia
The Committee notes with appreciation the deep and abiding re-
lationship between the United States and people of Colombia, in-
cluding the Colombian Armed Forces and the Colombian National
Police. However, the Committee remains deeply concerned about
the detrimental policies, erratic behavior, and malign relationships
of the Petro Administration, which are at odds with United States
security and economic interests.
The Committee is concerned by increased reports of drug abuse
in Colombia, including at the highest levels of government, and di-
rects the Secretary of State to consult with the Committees on Ap-
propriations not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on
opportunities to implement demand reduction programming in Co-
lombia.
The Committee notes the deteriorating security environment and
rising political volatility in Colombia, as demonstrated in the re-
cent assassination attempt of opposition senator and presidential
hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay on June 7, 2025. The Committee is
further alarmed by reports of growing destabilization across Colom-
bia as armed actors and criminal organizations regain lost territory
and violent conflict escalates in multiple regions.
The Committee is concerned by reports of due process violations
and judicial irregularities in the case against former President
A ´ lvaro Uribe Ve´lez, including allegations of unauthorized surveil-
lance, denial of defense rights, and conflicts of interest. Questions
of politicization raise serious concerns about the deterioration of ju-
dicial independence and the rule of law in Colombia. The chal-
lenges observed in Colombia reflect a troubling pattern of threats
to due process and judicial independence, serving as a reminder
that these core democratic values must be protected worldwide.

The Committee notes that the Petro Administration has failed to
effectively utilize United States assistance in advancing shared
goals and objectives. Therefore, funds for Colombia are reduced by
50 percent from the fiscal year 2025 level for non-military assist-
ance.
Funds for Colombia are allocated according to the following table
and subject to section 7019 of this Act:
COLOMBIA
[Budget authority in thousands of dollars]
Account Budget Authority
National Security Investment Programs..................................................................................... $67,250
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement.............................................................. 103,000
Foreign Military Financing Program ........................................................................................... 38,525
Cuba
The Committee recommendation includes $35,000,000 for pro-
grams to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba. The Com-
mittee commends and supports the Administration’s renewed focus
on advancing democracy in Cuba. The Committee directs that not
less than $7,000,000 of such funds be made available for the NED.
The Committee endorses a refocusing on the state of freedom in
Cuba by all donors and implementers and encourages the Depart-
ment of State to consider the unique capabilities of the core insti-
tutes of the NED in implementing programs in Cuba.
Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996.—The
Committee directs that funds provided by this Act for Cuba democ-
racy programs shall only be used for programs and activities pursu-
ant to section 109(a) of the LIBERTAD Act of 1996 and section
1705 of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and shall not be used
for business promotion, economic reform, entrepreneurship, or any
other assistance that is not democracy building. In addition, the
Committee applies the same limitations to public diplomacy funds.
With respect to grantee selection and implementation, the Com-
mittee directs that democracy promotion grants exceeding
$1,000,000 shall only be awarded to organizations with experience
promoting democracy in Cuba.
Innovations.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
identify opportunities to support grants for innovative methods to
reach audiences inside Cuba.
Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB).—The Committee directs
$40,000,000 under International Broadcasting Operations and Cap-
ital Improvements be made available for OCB. The Committee is
concerned about the detrimental effect underfunding has had on
OCB’s operation during the preceding Administration. OCB is a
critical source of independent, outside information for the Cuban
population and is necessary to counter the Cuban regime’s propa-
ganda and oppression. The Committee expects to receive updates
on an ongoing basis.
Political prisoners.—The Committee remains concerned with the
conditions faced by over one thousand Cuban political prisoners
who remain wrongfully and arbitrarily detained by the Cuban re-
gime, including prominent artists and activists jailed before, dur-
ing, and after the July 11, 2021 protests. The Committee directs

the Department of State to provide a classified briefing, not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, for members of the Com-
mittees on Appropriations regarding United States efforts to secure
the unconditional release of political prisoners held by the Cuban
regime, including all communications to the Cuban regime de-
manding the releases.
Reports, Cuba
Confiscated property.—The Committee notes that title III of the
LIBERTAD Act of 1996 creates substantial legal liability and risk
for any entity, Cuban or otherwise, that traffics in property that
was confiscated by the Cuban regime. Title IV of such Act provides
the Secretary of State with the authority and responsibility to deny
visas to individuals determined to have trafficked in confiscated
property to which a United States national has a claim. Not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations documenting
how the Department of State is implementing the law related to
title IV, including the number of processed determination letters of
claimants in the last fiscal year, methods being utilized by the De-
partment to identify individuals suspected to be subject to visa
bans, and any additional actions being undertaken to achieve jus-
tice for those whose property was stolen.
Malign alliances.—The Committee remains concerned by the on-
going alliance between the regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ven-
ezuela, which continue to facilitate repression and undermine re-
gional stability. Not later than 120 days after enactment of this
Act, the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a re-
port on the scope and nature of cooperation between Cuba, Nica-
ragua, and Venezuela, identifying key enablers of their partner-
ship, United States policy options to address it, and opportunities
for enhanced regional coordination with like-minded allied govern-
ments.
Military collusion.—The Committee is concerned with continued
reports of Cuban participation in military exercises and training in
Belarus. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on Cuba’s involvement and contribution to Rus-
sia’s war in Ukraine.
Cuban doctors
The Committee firmly stands against the use of Cuban medical
professionals against their will in foreign countries. The scheme
under which the Cuban regime is compensated for the services of
their doctors is a form of modern-day slavery, as doctors are paid
low wages and prevented from leaving their assignments while re-
cipient countries benefit from this coerced transaction. Subsection
(e) applies restrictions to assistance for countries and organizations
that benefit from trafficked Cuban doctors, and the Committee di-
rects, pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this Act, the Secretary of
State to use authorities within section 7031(c) to restrict visas of
entities engaging in such practice. The Committee is concerned by
the exploitation of Cuban medical professionals in countries such
as Mexico, Qatar, South Africa, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Spain, de-

spite the well-documented violations of both domestic and inter-
national labor standards.
Cuban medical missions and visa restrictions.—The Committee
commends the Secretary of State for expanding the Cuba-related
visa restriction policy targeting individuals involved in the exploit-
ative Cuban labor export program, including those engaged in the
trafficking of Cuban medical professionals. The Committee directs
relevant regional bureaus to contribute region-specific data to the
report required in subsection (e)(1), covering countries where
Cuban medical personnel are deployed. The Committee further ex-
pects these bureaus to actively identify foreign individuals, and
their immediate family members, who may be subject to visa re-
strictions under the expanded policy due to their involvement in
the Cuban labor export program.
Irresponsible migration
Subsection (f) establishes a prohibition on assistance in con-
travention of Executive Order 14165, relating to Securing Our Bor-
ders, and Executive Order 14218, relating to Ending Taxpayer Sub-
sidization of Open Borders, including to any organization that mo-
bilizes, organizes, or encourages irresponsible migration. This pro-
hibition extends to the publication of materials and online informa-
tion about migrant caravans. For the purposes of this subsection,
prohibited activities include: (1) the provision of cash cards that are
usable in countries other than where they are provided; (2) legal
counseling on the United States asylum process; (3) referrals to
legal representation in the United States; and (4) assistance to lo-
cate housing or sponsors in the United States.
Reports, Irresponsible migration
Not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on the organization and funding of mass-migra-
tion caravans in the Western Hemisphere from 2020 through 2024.
Migration cooperation.—Not later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations on the Department of State’s utilization
of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
data, including ICE’s listing of countries that are uncooperative
with the agency, and how the information is weighed in allocating
foreign assistance.
Haiti
The Committee expresses deep concern regarding the ongoing de-
cline of the security situation in Haiti. The Committee supports
continued United States engagement in advancing stability relating
to security, health, economic development, and governance in Haiti.
The Committee recommends that the Department of State continue
building the capacity of the Haitian National Police to address
widespread gang violence and to seek innovative approaches to
support anti-gang initiatives. The Committee recognizes the De-
partment’s efforts to facilitate the deployment of a multinational
security support mission and underscores the importance of main-
taining regular communication with Congress regarding the status
of this effort, including alternative plans should deployment

timelines change. The Committee also encourages the Department
to explore opportunities to support the participation and promotion
of women in conflict resolution in Haiti.
In order to stem the flow of irregular migration into the United
States, the Committee directs funds be made available consistent
with prior years for the assembly of prefabricated maternal and
neonatal care hospital units within 10 kilometers of the border
with the Dominican Republic. The Committee directs these funds
with the intention of treating pregnant Haitian women in need of
delivery services who migrate towards the Dominican Republic. If
security conditions prevent new construction, the Committee en-
courages the use of these funds to support and expand maternal
and neonatal care clinics. The Committee notes the challenging se-
curity environment in Haiti for such programs and directs the Sec-
retary of State to consult with the Committees on Appropriations
not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act on implementa-
tion.
The Committee notes extensive challenges for transportation in
Haiti, including to respond to medical crises. The Committee en-
courages the Department of State to consider public-private part-
nerships in support of transportation solutions for life-threatening
health services and emergencies, including air-lift services.
The Committee notes that no funds were requested for the
Armed Forces of Haiti, and therefore, none are provided in this
Act.
Reports, Haiti
Not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congres-
sional committees on the security situation in Haiti. The report
shall include efforts to combat gang violence, prevent sexual vio-
lence against women and girls, protect minors, address human
rights abuses and accountability by all parties, and facilitate hu-
manitarian access.
Locally led organizations.—The Committee encourages the Sec-
retary of State to incorporate more locally led organizations in their
approach to the multi-layered crisis in Haiti. Local organizations
run by the diaspora population in the United States are also eager
to contribute, including in humanitarian assistance. Not later than
45 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a
report to the appropriate congressional committees on localization
and capacity-building efforts to assist in Haiti’s crisis and plans for
the current fiscal year.
Mexico
Countering radio jamming at the United States-Mexico border.—
The Committee is concerned by reports of persistent radio fre-
quency interference affecting law enforcement communications in
the Riverside area of El Paso, Texas, believed to originate from
Mexico. The Committee directs the Department of State to engage
with the Government of Mexico to address the issue.
Fentanyl and opioids.—The Committee strongly supports in-
creased focus and aggressive action from the Department of State
to address the flow of illegal opioids into the United States, includ-
ing: (1) programs to assist the Government of Mexico in securing

its borders and reducing poppy cultivation and heroin and syn-
thetic drug production; (2) programs to thwart transnational crimi-
nal organizations involved in the trafficking of heroin and fentanyl;
(3) diplomatic efforts to strengthen precursor chemical control and
training on international treaty obligations related to opioids; (4)
measures to strengthen the security of the international postal sys-
tem to prevent illegal shipments of opioids from entering the
United States, particularly from the PRC; and (5) global demand
reduction programs. The Committee supports the Administration’s
efforts to designate major drug trafficking organizations as foreign
terrorist organizations and urges increased coordination across rel-
evant agencies to target their financial and logistical networks.
Judicial and security institutions.—The Secretary of State shall
prioritize assistance made available for Mexico for capacity build-
ing within Mexican judicial and security institutions to combat
crime, especially crime associated with fentanyl, other narcotics
trafficking, and transnational crime syndicates.
Support for migration management.—The Committee supports
efforts to help strengthen Mexico’s refugee agencies to improve in-
take facilities and asylum case management and processing.
Violence prevention.—The Committee recommendation includes
funds for assistance for Mexico that supports programs to prevent
violence against women and girls that are carried out in coopera-
tion with Mexican federal and local authorities.
Vulcan Materials seizure.—The Committee finds the Government
of Mexico’s forcible seizure and occupation of Vulcan Materials an
affront to the bilateral relationship and a signal to United States
companies that private property and investment in Mexico is not
secure. Former President Lo´pez Obrador’s strong-armed takeover of
Vulcan’s port in Quintana Roo, a site of strategic relevance to the
United States economy and infrastructure, disregarded the rule of
law and endangered the safety and livelihoods of Vulcan employ-
ees. The Committee urges President Sheinbaum to reconsider the
hostile takeover of Vulcan Materials’ port and property and restore
operations to its rightful owners. The Committee further urges the
Department of State to intensify diplomatic engagement at the
highest levels to ensure the protection of United States invest-
ments abroad and to seek a prompt and just resolution to this mat-
ter.
Water deliveries.—The Committee notes that section 7045(h)
withholds all assistance provided by this Act to Mexico, unless the
Secretary of State certifies that Mexico is implementing agreed-
upon remedies to address the deficit of water deliveries to the
United States under Article 4, Section B of the 1944 Water Treaty.
Such deficit has led to severe water shortages in the southern
United States, particularly Texas, and has had a devastating im-
pact on American citizens and businesses in the region. The Com-
mittee further notes that this limitation does not apply to funds
made available to counter the flow of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors,
and other synthetic drugs into the United States.
The Committee directs the Secretary of State to prioritize the
deficit of water deliveries to the United States in bilateral talks
with Mexico, including through the establishment of consistent
channels of communication to monitor and manage water resources
along the Rio Grande Basin, and engage with Congress and other

impacted stakeholders, including American agriculture associations
located along the Rio Grande Basin, in discussions toward resolu-
tion of this crisis. The Committee notes the importance, in such bi-
lateral talks, that the Government of Mexico acknowledge the ex-
treme hardship experienced by the agrarian economy in the United
States, which relies on predictable and timely water deliveries from
the Rio Grande. The Committee encourages the Secretary to advo-
cate for the expedient release of 550,000 acre-feet of water, or
more, from the Rio Grande as it would provide much needed relief
and demonstrate commitment to resetting United States-Mexico bi-
lateral relations.
Reports, Mexico
Vulcan Materials seizure.—Not later than 30 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall report to the appro-
priate congressional committees on the Government of Mexico’s po-
sition on the Vulcan Materials seizure. Further, not later than 60
days after enactment of this Act, the Department of State shall
provide the appropriate congressional committees with a strategy
to protect United States commercial interests, including the use of
diplomatic incentives and disincentives, to prevent further inter-
ference with American companies in Mexico.
Water deliveries.—Not later than 30 days after enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate
congressional committees on the status of negotiations with Mexico
over the deficit of water deliveries. The Secretary shall update such
report every 30 days until a resolution has been achieved and fully
briefed to Congress.
Nicaragua
The Committee remains concerned about violations of human
rights and religious liberty in Nicaragua, including the severe per-
secution of the Catholic Church, Catholic charitable organizations,
and Catholic educational organizations and strongly supports con-
tinued funding for democracy programs for the people of Nica-
ragua.
The Caribbean
Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.—Subsection (k) directs that
not less than $92,500,000 be made available for the Caribbean
Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) and prioritized for countries, such
as the Dominican Republic, that are most directly impacted by the
crisis in Haiti and are within the transit zone of illicit drug ship-
ments toward the United States. The Committee further directs
that funds appropriated under CBSI be used to provide, sustain,
and maintain necessary equipment, such as radars, boats, vehicles,
and helicopters, to partner countries that need such resources to
better detect and interdict illicit drug trafficking and investigate
and dismantle transnational criminal organizations. The Secretary
of State should consider utilizing the authority of section 516 of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to transfer similar excess defense
articles to partner countries in the region with such requirements.
Dominican Republic.—The Committee recognizes that the Do-
minican Republic, a key United States ally in the Americas, plays
a central role in building more secure supply chains integrated

with the United States market and in fighting corruption and drug
trafficking. The Committee applauds the effectiveness of such coun-
ternarcotics efforts, including through CBSI, and the steps taken to
confront public corruption and increase transparency in govern-
ment. The Committee supports increased bilateral cooperation to
address crime and violence, improve public safety and security,
support at-risk youth programs, and prosecute corruption. The
Committee continues to support basic education programs in the
Dominican Republic.
Latin American and Caribbean open-source research initiative.—
The Committee supports the vision and goals of the Latin Amer-
ican and Caribbean open-source research initiative, including the
purpose of housing a secure, virtual technology platform that facili-
tates information sharing and enhances United States-Latin Amer-
ican research and analytics collaboration.
Loan guarantee authority.—The Committee supports the provi-
sion of loan guarantees to Costa Rica, Panama, and Small Island
Developing States in the Caribbean. The Committee further notes
that it will support funds being made available to support such
guarantees upon enactment of necessary authorizing legislation.
Preparedness for natural disasters.—The Committee directs not
less than the prior year level for programs to strengthen prepared-
ness for natural disasters in the Caribbean.
Reports, The Caribbean
CBSI.—Not later than 45 days after enactment of this Act, the
Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations on the uses of all funds provided for
the CBSI on a country-by-country basis for each program, project,
and activity for fiscal years 2024 through 2025. Such information
shall be integrated into the ForeignAssistance.gov website, as ap-
propriate.
Dry port.—The Committee urges the Department of State to help
develop and support the concept of a dry port in the Dominican Re-
public near its border with Haiti to increase the capacity to safely
deliver vital supplies and respond to natural disasters, humani-
tarian crises, and health emergencies in the Dominican Republic or
Haiti. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations
a report on developing and supporting a dry port in the Dominican
Republic.
Venezuela
TdA.—The Committee is concerned by the proliferation of TdA,
a violent transnational criminal organization originating in Ven-
ezuela and now active across the Western Hemisphere. The Com-
mittee notes the recent designation of TdA as an FTO and urges
a coordinated response from the executive branch to disrupt the or-
ganization’s illicit activities. The Committee further recommends
that the Secretary of State strengthen diplomatic and law enforce-
ment partnerships with governments in the region to dismantle
TdA’s networks. Not later than 180 days after enactment of this
Act, the Secretary shall brief the Committees on Appropriations on
efforts undertaken to counter this threat.

Tracking assets belonging to the Venezuelan people.—The Com-
mittee notes that the United States remains committed to identi-
fying and tracking assets taken from the people of Venezuela
through theft, corruption, money laundering, and other illicit
means. The Committee directs the Secretary of State to continue
working to return these funds to the Venezuelan people, who have
been victimized by the Maduro regime.
Venezuela displacement.—The Committee continues to support
Venezuelans fleeing political repression in Venezuela and directs
the Department of State to prioritize programs to prevent violence,
abuse, and exploitation, with an emphasis on the protection of
women and children. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to urge other donors, including the European Union,
to make more substantial commitments to help neighboring coun-
tries deliver needed humanitarian services to migrants who have
fled Venezuela.
Other, Latin America and the Caribbean
Argentina.—The Committee recognizes Argentina as a demo-
cratic ally and a key partner in the Southern Cone. The Committee
supports efforts to strengthen bilateral engagement with the Gov-
ernment of Argentina across a range of shared national security in-
terests. The Committee encourages the Department of State to
deepen cooperation in areas including countering human trafficking
through programs under the Department’s INL framework and en-
ergy sector governance and market reforms that support regional
and global energy security. The Committee notes recent Foreign
Military Financing Program support in connection with Argentina’s
acquisition of F-16 aircraft and supports consideration of additional
assistance to support continued implementation of that agreement.
Ecuador.—The Committee notes that Ecuador remains a key
partner of the United States in the Andean region and, therefore,
supports continued assistance for Ecuador to: combat narcotics
trafficking, transnational crime, and terrorism; strengthen demo-
cratic institutions and the rule of law; promote economic develop-
ment, which requires reliable, utility-scale power generation; and
support migration management. The Committee urges coordination
within the interagency to ensure this assistance advances regional
security and aligns with United States strategic interests. The
Committee directs not less than the prior year levels under Inter-
national Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Foreign Mili-
tary Financing Program to support counternarcotics efforts and
other national security priorities of the United States and to foster
greater military interoperability with the United States.
Paraguay.—The Committee recognizes Paraguay as a reliable
democratic partner in the Southern Cone and supports continued
and increased assistance to advance shared security and govern-
ance objectives. This includes efforts to combat narcotics traf-
ficking, transnational crime, and corruption; strengthen the rule of
law and democratic institutions; and promote economic develop-
ment and energy sector modernization. The Committee supports
enhanced assistance through the International Narcotics Control
and Law Enforcement and Foreign Military Financing Program ac-
counts to counter illicit networks, improve border security, and fos-
ter greater interoperability with United States forces. The Com-

mittee encourages close interagency coordination to ensure such as-
sistance aligns with United States strategic interests and regional
stability.
Peru.—The Committee supports the allocation of funds appro-
priated under titles III and IV of this Act for assistance for Peru,
in order to strengthen democratic institutions, advance the rule of
law, combat corruption, manage natural resources, counter nar-
cotics trafficking, including through eradication of illicit coca crops,
and efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations that
threaten United States national security. The Committee also sup-
ports enhanced bilateral economic and security cooperation. This
includes increased assistance above prior-year levels under the
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Foreign
Military Financing Program accounts to counter narcotics and
other national security priorities of the United States and to foster
greater military interoperability with the United States.
Section 7046 (Europe and Eurasia)
This section includes language substantively the same as the
prior year regarding Europe and Eurasia.
Belarus.—The Committee directs that funds made available for
Belarus may only be made available for democracy programs, in-
cluding political party strengthening, and to combat human traf-
ficking. The Committee further directs that funds be made avail-
able at not less than the prior year level for such programs.
Broadcasting.—The Committee continues to support Belarusian
language services including to combat censorship practices by au-
thoritarian regimes.
Burden sharing.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to continually assess the extent to which allies in Europe are meet-
ing their NATO commitments on defense burden sharing and rec-
ommends that the Secretary calibrate the provision of United
States foreign assistance to help ensure that such benchmarks are
met. The Committee is concerned that Spain has not committed to
the pledge that other NATO member states have taken to raise de-
fense spending to 5 percent of GDP, with 3.5 percent dedicated to
core military capabilities, and urges the Government of Spain to
meet the allied commitment to NATO’s updated capability targets.
Croatia.—The Committee recognizes the important relationship
between the United States and the Republic of Croatia and encour-
ages the Secretary of State to continue efforts to strengthen the bi-
lateral relationship, including through emphasis on deepening mu-
tually beneficial economic ties.
Cyprus.—The Committee supports full implementation of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and its
contributions to create a conducive environment for settlement
talks. Should reunification occur, the Committee supports funding
for mechanisms to monitor and facilitate settlement of outstanding
issues in support of peace. Funds for the United States-assessed
cost of the UNFICYP are provided under Contributions for Inter-
national Peacekeeping Activities at the statutory cap of 25 percent.
Energy security for allies and partners.—The Committee recog-
nizes that energy security is essential for United States national
security and the security of our allies. The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to prioritize financing for diversified non-Rus-

sian sources of energy, including liquefied natural gas, to Europe
and other allies, to reduce dependence on energy imports from the
Russian Federation.
European policy on Cuba.—The Committee supports the shared
goal of the United States and Europe to coordinate with allies and
partners to isolate the Russian Federation and its sources of fi-
nancing and facilitation of its war in Ukraine. The Committee re-
mains deeply concerned by long-standing diplomatic, economic, and
security ties between Russia and Cuba. In furtherance of efforts to
cut off Russia’s sources of financing and facilitation of its continued
brutal attacks against Ukraine, the Committee urges European al-
lies and partners to review their diplomatic and economic relations
with the Cuban regime and recognize the same aspirations of free-
dom and democracy for the Cuban people. Therefore, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary of State to increase diplomatic efforts
to coordinate with countries in Europe to achieve such objectives
and ensure consistency of transatlantic priorities to defend freedom
and democracy both in Europe and the dictatorships in the West-
ern Hemisphere, particularly in Cuba.
Exchange programs.—The Committee continues to support funds
being made available for the Pawel Adamowicz Exchange Program
and the Congress-Bundestag Exchange Program.
Funding reports.—The committee directs the Secretary of State
to provide to Members of Congress, on request, such information as
may be available to the Department and appropriate to release re-
garding foreign assistance grants by non-United States donors to
nongovernmental organizations funded by the United States in the
European Union.
Greece.—The Committee welcomes increased cooperation between
the United States and Greece and encourages the Secretary of
State to deepen engagement between public and private institu-
tions in the United States and Greece. The Committee directs that
funds consistent with the prior year level are made available for
Greece under International Military Education and Training. In
addition, the Committee directs the Secretary to facilitate meetings
of the Interparliamentary Group established by the United States-
Greece Defense and Interparliamentary Partnership Act of 2021
(subtitle B of Public Law 117–81).
Income tax treaties.—The Committee encourages the Secretary of
State, in coordination with other relevant Federal agencies as ap-
propriate, to reexamine the potentially negative impacts that alter-
ing, suspending, or eliminating established income tax treaties has
on NATO allies.
Nordic exchanges.—The Committee directs funding at not less
than the prior year level be made available under National Secu-
rity Investment Programs to support exchanges of United States
and Nordic country professionals and experts to share talent and
knowledge in support of integrated deterrence, maritime security
and transportation, Arctic security, emerging and dual-use tech-
nologies, such as AI, 6G, and quantum computing, and other key
strategic areas of bilateral interest. The Secretary of State shall
consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to the design
and implementation of such program.

Reconciliation.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to
continue efforts to support the advancement of peace and reconcili-
ation in Ireland.
United Kingdom and Chagos Archipelago.—The Committee notes
that with the growing challenge from the PRC the military facili-
ties on the island of Diego Garcia are central to Anglo-American
power projection and relative control of the Indian Ocean. Recog-
nizing the invaluable strategic importance and geographic rel-
evance of Diego Garcia to the United States, the Committee en-
courages the Secretary of State to engage with His Majesty’s Gov-
ernment of the United Kingdom to ensure our long-term access to
the facilities and that they remain integral to allied security.
Reports
Abducted children.—The Committee supports funds from Na-
tional Security Investment Programs being made available to sup-
port ongoing efforts for the collection, analysis, and preservation of
evidence related to the forcible abduction and transfer of children
to the Russian Federation. The Secretary of State is directed to up-
date the report required under this heading in House Report 118–
146, including amounts and status of funding programmed for the
documentation of Russia’s forcible abduction and deportation of
children from neighboring countries.
European policy on Cuba.—Not later than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit an update to the re-
port required under this heading in House Report 118–146 on ef-
forts to urge European countries to diminish diplomatic, trade, and
other financial ties with the Cuban dictatorship.
Greenland.—The Committee notes Greenland’s increased
geostrategic role in global security, including as a source of critical
minerals and rare earth elements. Not later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State is directed to report
to the Committees on Appropriations on United States efforts to
collaborate with Greenland to help facilitate investment by Amer-
ican firms in its mining sector.
Romania.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, on steps taken by the Government of
Romania and the Department of State to restore confiscated church
property to legal owners.
Slovakia.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than
90 days after enactment of this Act, on steps taken by the Depart-
ment to urge the Government of the Slovak Republic to cease ex-
propriating properties owned by Hungarians or Germans based on
WWII-era confiscation orders originally issued under Slovak Na-
tional Council Regulation No. 104/1945 and the Benesˇ Decrees.
Turkey.—The Committee is concerned about the longstanding
ties between Turkey and Hamas, which includes Turkey hosting
senior Hamas figures as well as providing political and other forms
of assistance to the terrorist group. Not later than 90 days after en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs the Department of State
to brief the appropriate congressional committees on the relation-
ship between Turkey and Hamas.

Section 7047 (Countering Russian Influence and Aggression)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding programs to counter Russian influence and aggression.
Section 7048 (United Nations and Other International Organiza-
tions)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
lating to conditions on funds for the United Nations and other
international organizations.
Accountability report.—In carrying out the requirement of sub-
section (a), the Secretary of State shall also consider and report on
efforts to combat antisemitism. The report shall include a section
on anti-Israel bias and antisemitism within the United Nations
system, including specific instances across United Nations entities,
such as those referenced in title I of House Report 116–444. It shall
assess whether such bias arises from member state actions or sys-
temic behavior within the United Nations, including that of staff,
consultants, and appointed experts. The report shall also evaluate
institutional practices that may compromise neutrality toward
Israel, including, but not limited to: public statements by United
Nations personnel, including on social media; the hiring or appoint-
ment of individuals with known prejudicial or hostile views toward
Israel; and procedural mechanisms that disproportionately target
or isolate Israel within United Nations bodies.
Further, the report shall include an assessment of the United
Nations Action Plan to Enhance Monitoring and Response to Anti-
semitism. The report shall include recommendations on steps the
United Nations should take to revise and strengthen its approach
to combating antisemitism, including enforcing a clear and action-
able definition of antisemitism and accountability mechanisms
within its institutions, including for staff.
International courts.—The Committee strongly condemns and un-
equivocally rejects one-sided, politicized, anti-Israel activity at the
ICC and the ICJ and prohibits funds provided in this Act and prior
acts for such courts. The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to prioritize diplomatic efforts to prevent any further efforts to
weaponize the ICC and ICJ against Israel. The Committee further
endorses the Secretary’s designation of four ICC judges under Ex-
ecutive Order 14203, relating to Imposing Sanctions on the Inter-
national Criminal Court, which imposed sanctions for their direct
involvement in unauthorized investigations and prosecutions of
United States and Israeli nationals.
International organizations.—The Committee recommendation
does not include funds for the United Nations Environment Pro-
gramme, United Nations Special Rapporteurs, or World Economic
Forum.
United Nations anti-Israel agenda.—The Committee urges the
Secretary of State to declare it is the policy of the United States
to veto one-sided, anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations Se-
curity Council.
United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).—The Com-
mittee notes the continued lack of progress at UNHRC towards
meaningful reforms to restore its credibility as a human rights
body. UNHRC continues to elevate, legitimize, and shield the worst
human rights offenders while simultaneously targeting Israel for

unjustified scrutiny. Therefore, the Committee recommendation
prohibits funds to UNHRC.
Subsection (d) prohibits funds in this Act and prior acts making
appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and
related programs for the United Nations International Commission
of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Je-
rusalem, and Israel.
The Committee endorses the designation of the United Nations
Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on the Situation of
Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories Occupied since 1967,
pursuant to Executive Order 14203, relating to Imposing Sanctions
on the International Criminal Court. The Committee notes the des-
ignation was triggered by attempts to abuse the mechanisms of the
ICC in a manner that undermines United States national security.
United Nations procurement reform.—Subsection (j) prohibits
funds in this Act and prior acts from being used to purchase goods
or services contracted from companies in the Russian Federation,
including any shell companies. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary of State to promote fair and transparent procurement prac-
tices at the United Nations, including no longer evaluating procure-
ment bids under lowest-cost and technically compliant criteria,
which benefits Russian companies that are historically among the
cheapest providers.
UNRWA.—Subsection (e) prohibits voluntary contributions and
assessed funds for UNRWA. The Committee notes that UNRWA
has been compromised by staff who have promoted incitement to
violence, antisemitism, and the destruction of the State of Israel.
The Committee is concerned by UNRWA’s relationship with Hamas
and other terrorist organizations, including credible allegations
that several UNRWA staff participated in the October 7, 2023 mas-
sacre that killed over 1,200 people, including American citizens,
and was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
Further, the Committee is concerned by the use of UNRWA facili-
ties to shield Hamas infrastructure, such as the Hamas data center
under UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters.
The Committee notes allegations that significant numbers of
UNRWA staff celebrated the October 7, 2023, massacre on social
media and that many UNRWA staff, including school principals
and senior UNRWA management, are also members of terrorist or-
ganizations that violently oppress the Palestinian people, including
by using them as human shields.
The Committee further notes that the OIG has obtained evidence
implicating UNRWA staff and resources in the October 7, 2023, at-
tacks, which may have been implicated by a United Nations Office
of Internal Oversight Services report the United Nations, including
UNWRA, has refused to share unredacted. Any United Nations
personnel who provided material support to terrorist entities must
be held fully accountable, including through United States courts
and administrative proceedings without claim to functional immu-
nity.

international agreements relating to climate change and multi-
national trade. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit an update
to the report required under this heading in House Report 118–146
on the ways in which the PRC benefits from developing nation sta-
tus, how this status could undermine United States interests do-
mestically and abroad, and what actions the Secretary is taking to
advocate for the termination of the PRC’s developing nation status
in current and future international agreements.
Transparency and accountability.—Not later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act, and in accordance with subsection (b), the
Secretary of State shall report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions on whether international organizations, including the United
Nations, its specialized agencies, and regional and Inter-American
organizations, which receive assessed and voluntary contributions
from the United States, are meeting the required transparency and
accountability standards. For the purposes of this subsection, the
term ‘‘international organizations’’ shall mean international organi-
zations that were funded under Contributions to International Or-
ganizations and International Organizations and Programs in prior
acts.
United Nations procurement reform.—Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall report to
the appropriate congressional committees on progress made in re-
forming United Nations procurement to adopt a request for pro-
posals approach, which considers pricing, experience, technical ca-
pacity, and other factors.
UNRWA assistance and transition.—Not later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report
to the appropriate congressional committees detailing the total
amount of United States assistance provided to UNRWA from Jan-
uary 20, 2021, to January 20, 2025. The report shall also include
any known instances in which such assistance was diverted to, or
used by, terrorist organizations, including Hamas or Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad, or paid the salary of UNRWA staff who were members
of such organizations. In addition, the report shall include a transi-
tion plan for providing assistance in the Middle East without direct
or indirect funding to, or support from, UNRWA.
Section 7049 (America First Opportunity Fund)
The Committee recommendation includes $1,700,000,000 for the
America First Opportunity Fund from funds made available under
National Security Investment Programs, International Narcotics
Control and Law Enforcement, Peacekeeping Operations, and For-
eign Military Financing Program. The America First Opportunity
Fund is intended to allow the Secretary of State to respond rapidly
and flexibly to new and unforeseen opportunities and challenges
when they arise. The Committee expects that the Secretary will
use the America First Opportunity Fund to leverage foreign assist-
ance resources to make America safer, stronger, and more pros-
perous.
Funds for the America First Opportunity Fund are allocated ac-
cording to the following table and subject to section 7019 of this
Act:

Section 7050 (Internet Freedom)
This section includes language modified from the prior year for
internet freedom.
Internet freedom initiatives play a critical role in countering ris-
ing tides of digital authoritarianism at a time of unprecedented ex-
pansion in global internet connectivity. The Committee encourages
the Department of State to strengthen programs that support
democratic norms within adversarial, anti-American countries that
obstruct internet access.
The Committee underscores the importance of opposing authori-
tarian censorship practices, including those that suppress political
dissent, manipulate online information, or restrict access to inde-
pendent content. Such authoritarian practices, whether carried out
by foreign adversaries or within democratic societies, undermine
the principles of free speech and the free flow of information, both
of which are essential for a healthy democracy. The Committee
supports efforts to ensure that internet freedom programs reflect a
consistent commitment to these American values.
The Committee notes the internet restrictions, content censor-
ship, and mobile network disruptions imposed by Cuba and Iran.
The Committee supports continued partnership between the De-
partment of State and other relevant Federal agencies on the use
of innovative technologies and creative actions to increase access.
Secure internet access and digital censorship circumvention tech-
nologies.—The Committee directs that $43,500,000 be made avail-
able for secure internet access and digital censorship circumvention
technologies to carry out section 1299P of the William M. (Mac)
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2021 (title XII of division A of Public Law 116–283).
Report
Internet freedom in Iran.—The Committee directs the Secretary
of State, not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, to sub-
mit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on the
progress of programs promoting internet access and internet free-
dom in Iran, as part of the comprehensive strategy required by sec-
tion 414 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act
of 2012 (Public Law 112–158). The report shall also include an up-
date on the implementation of the Iran internet freedom grant pro-
gram authorized in section 5124 of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
Section 7051 (Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading

as carried in the prior year, relating to aircraft transfer and coordi-
nation.
Section 7053 (Parking Fines and Real Property Taxes Owed by For-
eign Governments)
This section includes language carried in the prior year relating
to unpaid parking fines and real property taxes owed by foreign
governments.
Section 7054 (International Monetary Fund)
This section includes language carried in the prior year estab-
lishing restrictions related to the International Monetary Fund.

hibiting funds for a country that does not cooperate in the extra-
dition of certain individuals to the United States.

This section includes language carried in the prior year estab-
lishing restrictions on enterprise funds.
Section 7057 (Limitations Related to Global Health Assistance)
This section includes new language prohibiting funds made avail-
able by this Act for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
and any foreign nongovernmental organization that promotes or
performs abortion, with certain exceptions.
Section 7058 (Global Health Activities)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding global health activities.
PEPFAR transition strategy.—The Committee recognizes
PEPFAR’s profound impact in the fight against HIV/AIDS, which
continues to make America safer from disease through the success-
ful improvement of health systems and promotion of a more robust
investment climate for American business through increased eco-
nomic growth in countries with PEPFAR programs. The Committee
notes that although nearly 60 percent of all HIV-related spending
globally in 2023 came from domestic sources, rather than external
donor support, United States funding for such efforts should not
continue in perpetuity, and that many countries are well positioned
to begin transitioning off such assistance. The Committee expects
that any transition strategy shall be guided foremost by the imper-
ative to safeguard the lives, health, and safety of beneficiaries, en-
suring that gains made in HIV/AIDS response are not reversed
during or after the transition process.
Pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary of State shall submit to
the appropriate congressional committees, not later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act, a comprehensive strategy to guide the
structured transition of PEPFAR-supported programs to country-
led ownership. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,
the Secretary shall consult with such committees on the compo-
nents of such strategy. The Committee directs that the strategy be

developed in consultation with implementing agencies, partner gov-
ernments at the national—and where possible, the subnational
level, faith-and community-based organizations, and the private
sector.
In developing such strategy, the Secretary shall consider:
(1) a phased approach for reducing reliance upon United
States bilateral funding in countries deemed ready for transi-
tion, informed by clearly defined, transparent economic and
programmatic criteria benchmarks;
(2) an annual country readiness assessment based on the de-
velopment of transition compacts that define clear roles and re-
sponsibilities, milestones, and projected annual funding reduc-
tions for PEPFAR-supported activities;
(3) a plan to coordinate United States Government global
health investments including grants and loans, United States
Development Finance Institutions’ participation, as well as en-
gagement with multilateral development banks and inter-
national partners to leverage co-financing mechanisms;
(4) a framework to sustain the role of faith-based and com-
munity-based service providers;
(5) a plan to engage the private sector as key actors within
the transition strategy; and
(6) guidance for the maintenance, integration, and national-
ization of data systems used for performance tracking, over-
sight, and accountability.
Section 7059 (Women’s Equality and Empowerment)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding programs that support women’s equality and empower-
ment.
The Committee has, on a bipartisan basis, provided support for
programs contained in this section for over a decade and continues
to support the equality and empowerment of women and girls
around the world. The Committee remains concerned by actions
taken in previous years utilizing funds from prior acts to advance
controversial agendas, which undermined bipartisan support for
women’s empowerment programs.
Consistent with the requirements included under Global Health
Programs and in section 7018 of this Act, any funds made available
to protect the rights of women and girls worldwide shall not be con-
strued to include a right to abortion. The Secretary of State is di-
rected to review guidance for Department of State personnel, as
well as for implementing partners, with respect to the application
of requirements under Global Health Programs and section 7018 of
this Act to ensure full compliance with such requirements in car-
rying out the purposes of this section. The Committee expects that
guidance and training associated with such requirements will en-
sure full awareness by implementing partners that funds made
available by this Act are prohibited from being used to lobby for
or against abortion.
The Committee acknowledges the important role that Village
Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA) play in advancing women’s
economic empowerment, financial inclusion, and financial security,
and urges the Secretary of State to support VSLAs in food security,
global health, and other development and humanitarian program-

112
ming. The Secretary should ensure United States-funded VSLA ini-
tiatives seek to address the root causes of women’s economic
disempowerment, financial insecurity, and financial dependence.
The Committee supports the Secretary of State’s efforts to ensure
that promoting women’s empowerment is a priority across the De-
partment of State. Not later than 45 days after enactment of this
Act, the Secretary shall consult with the Committees on Appropria-
tions on plans to implement this section and other policies related
to women and girls following the Department’s reorganization.
Reports
Adolescent girls.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State
to submit to the appropriate congressional committees, not later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act, a report on the actions
taken over the previous 12 months to: (1) reduce the incidence of
child, early, and forced marriage and female genital mutilation and
cutting; (2) address the needs of already married adolescent girls;
(3) promote equal access to education for girls; (4) ensure protection
of adolescent girls in humanitarian responses; (5) address the im-
pacts of food insecurity on adolescent girls; and (6) train relevant
staff on the specific challenges and needs of adolescent girls.
Transparency and accountability.—The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to submit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on all
funding made available in fiscal year 2025 for the Gender Equity
and Equality Action Fund, which shall include program descrip-
tions, geographic scope, funding levels, accounts, and prime and
sub-partners. The sub-partner information shall indicate the prime
partner for each activity.
Violence in humanitarian crises.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the alarming rates of violence against women and
girls in humanitarian crises and directs continued funding to pre-
vent such violence. The Committee directs the Secretary of State,
not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, to update the
report required under this heading in House Report 118–146 on the
steps taken to address violence against women and girls in human-
itarian emergencies.
Section 7060 (Sector Allocations)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
garding assistance for programs related to basic education, higher
education, conservation, food security and agriculture development,
combating human trafficking, and water and sanitation.
Basic education
The Committee directs not less than $737,600,000 for basic edu-
cation programs in this Act. Pursuant to division A of Public Law
115–56, as reauthorized by section 7812 of Public Law 118–159,
the United States Government promotes quality basic education in
partner countries by seeking to expand access to basic education
for all children and measurably improve the quality of basic edu-
cation and learning outcomes. The Committee supports continued
investments in the Global Partnership for Education and Education
Cannot Wait (ECW) at not less than the prior year level and recog-
nizes that these organizations leverage additional funding from

other donors and complement bilateral efforts to address inter-
national basic education needs, including ensuring children have
access to education in crisis settings. The Committee expects that
funds provided to ECW should be derived from funding accounts in
a manner consistent with prior years.
Higher education
Subsection (a)(2) directs that $50,000,000 shall be used to sup-
port institutions of higher education in countries experiencing eco-
nomic crisis. In implementing such directive, the term ‘‘countries
impacted by economic crises’’ shall include countries, such as Leb-
anon, whose economies are adversely affected by: political insta-
bility; conflict, including in neighboring countries; or catastrophic
manmade disasters. The Secretary of State shall consult with the
Committees on Appropriations prior to the initial obligation of
funds on the proposed use of such funds.
Conservation
The Committee recommendation includes $292,600,000 for con-
servation programs, $100,000,000 for the United States Foundation
for International Conservation, and $95,000,000 to combat
transnational the threat of wildlife poaching and trafficking.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.—The Com-
mittee directs the Bureau of Oceans and International Environ-
mental and Scientific Affairs to ensure the timely submission of the
Maritime-SAFE Interagency Working Group’s report on efforts to
combat IUU fishing. The report should specifically address sub-
working group activities in the Western Pacific region, including
Guam, that contribute to the protection of marine ecosystems and
sustainable fisheries.
Agriculture
The Committee directs not less than $768,000,000 for food secu-
rity and agriculture development as authorized by the Global Food
Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–195). The Committee sup-
ports Feed the Future’s comprehensive approach to combating glob-
al food insecurity and promoting market-led economic growth, and
notes the direct benefit on food security in the United States, such
as protecting American crops and herds from damaging diseases
that would have severe negative economic impacts on the United
States.
Agricultural research.—The Committee directs not less than
$175,000,000 be made available for international agricultural re-
search, of which $72,000,000 is for the Feed the Future Innovation
Labs. The Committee directs that the request level for agricultural
research and development initiatives be designated in the CBJ for
fiscal year 2027.
American technology.—The Committee supports efforts to ensure
there are modern storage facilities for grains, produce, and perish-
ables along with efficient distribution systems available in recipient
countries to prevent spoilage or waste and strongly encourages
these recipient countries to utilize American food security tech-
nologies and management systems that enhance post-harvest food
safety and security.

Programs to combat trafficking in persons
The Committee directs not less than $111,000,000 for activities
to combat trafficking in persons internationally, including for the
Program to End Modern Slavery.
Funds made available pursuant to subsection (d)(1) to combat
human trafficking should be obligated and programmed consistent
with country-specific recommendations included in the annual TIP
report as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000
(Public Law 106–386) and shall be coordinated with the Office to
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. For the purposes of
subsection (d), the term ‘‘Tier 3 country’’ means a country on the
list of countries required under section 110(b)(1)(C) of the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107(b)(1)(C)).
Child protection compacts.—The Committee directs $12,500,000
be made available under International Narcotics Control and Law
Enforcement for child protection compacts. Funds should be
prioritized for countries with the greatest need.
Combating child exploitation.—The Committee supports efforts of
international law enforcement partners, such as the International
Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), to address child exploi-
tation, including technology-facilitated exploitation, and strengthen
investigations and directs funds be made available for such efforts.
Combating human trafficking in Latin America and the Carib-
bean.—The Committee directs $3,500,000 be made available under
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement for partner-
ships between nongovernmental organizations and the Organiza-
tion of American States to combat human trafficking in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
Combating ritualized murder and organ trafficking.—The Com-
mittee directs $3,500,000 be made available under International
Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement for the purpose of com-
bating ritualized murder of children and organ trafficking in Afri-
ca. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations on the number of incidents, investigations, and prosecu-
tions of organ trafficking and ritualized murder in Africa and cor-
responding data on Department of State-funded programs training
authorities to interdict on such matters in Africa.
Global consortium.—The Committee notes the significant dis-
parity between the estimated number of human trafficking victims
globally and the number of human trafficking prosecutions. The
Committee also recognizes the importance of ensuring that human
trafficking prosecutions are conducted with a victim-centric ap-
proach. The Committee supports efforts to increase funds for pros-
ecuting human trafficking cases, including support for global net-
works and consortia of higher education that exchange best prac-
tices. Funds allocated for such purposes shall be designated in the
spend plan required pursuant to section 7062(b).
Restriction on conferences.—Subsection (d)(2) restricts funds from
being made available for conferences in countries classified as Tier
3 of the Department of State TIP report. The Committee sees facili-
tation of such conferences to such countries as contrary to traf-
ficking in persons policy unless the purposes are specifically de-
signed to address human trafficking or are in the national security
interest of the United States.

Training.—The Committee directs the Secretary of State to en-
sure that all employees of the Department of State are provided
Counter Trafficking in Persons Code of Conduct training in fiscal
year 2026 as the Department assumes responsibility for imple-
menting United States foreign assistance. Not later than 30 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the
Committees on Appropriations on implementation of this directive.
The Committee directs $1,000,000 be made available to support
training updates for all United States Government personnel over-
seas to be vigilant in helping identify possible victims of trafficking
and aware of the reporting protocols.
Pursuant to the requirement in section 7060(d)(3) on training re-
lated to reporting protocols, and the directive in section 7060(d)(5)
on oversight, such trainings and oversight shall ensure that data
on suspected cases are disaggregated by sex, age, geographic loca-
tion and connectivity to personnel under Chief of Mission authority
or United States-funded grants, contracts and agreements, and are
recorded to reasonable levels of detail to assist law enforcement,
while being cognizant of the rights and privacy of all individuals
involved in suspected cases.
Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
The Committee directs not less than $451,000,000 in this Act for
WASH projects pursuant to Public Law 109–121, as amended by
Public Law 113–289. The Committee recognizes the unique role of
access to WASH projects in saving human life, driving self-reliance,
enabling economic growth, and supporting health security through
infection prevention and control. The Committee includes further
language under Reports under this heading.
Reports
Basic education annual report.—The annual report to Congress
on the United States strategy to promote basic education, sub-
mitted pursuant to the Reinforcing Education Accountability in De-
velopment Act (division A of Public Law 115–56), should include
funding data disaggregated by country, education level, and popu-
lations affected by crisis and conflict.

retary of State to report on foreign assistance investments in early
childhood development, disaggregated by country, program area,
and conflict-affected settings, not less than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act. The Secretary of State shall consult with the

areas: water, sanitation, including disbursements categorized by
urban and rural sanitation, and hygiene. Not later than 90 days
after enactment of this Act, the Secretary is further directed to pro-
vide a report and briefing to the appropriate congressional commit-
tees on the current implementation of the United States Global
Water Strategy within agency structures and plans for how WASH

programming will be sustained and scaled in fiscal year 2026 in ac-
cordance with existing statute.
Section 7061 (Environment Limitations)
This section includes new language concerning limitations for en-
vironment programs.
Multilateral programs.—In addition to the funding prohibitions
included in this section for the Green Climate Fund, the Clean
Technology Fund, and the Loss and Damage Fund, the Committee
recommendation does not include funds for the Montreal Protocol
Multilateral Fund, the Adaptation Fund, or the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Study.—If the Comptroller General determines the study re-
quired in subsection (c) is not possible, the Comptroller General
shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations explain-
ing the reasons why climate change programs lack a measurable
impact on global temperatures, including an analysis of any under-
lying assumptions or methodologies that rely on implausible or in-
accurate scenarios and models rendering such programs
unquantifiable or directed toward outcomes that may not be
achievable or substantiated by empirical evidence.
Section 7062 (Budget Documents)
This section includes language modified from the prior year re-
quiring operating and spend plans for certain funds appropriated
by this Act.
Section 7063 (Reorganization)
This section includes language, which is substantively the same
as carried in the prior year, concerning consultation, notification,
and reporting requirements involving any agency reorganization.
Consultations required by this section shall be carried out con-
sistent with section 7034(h)(6) of this Act.
Report
Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary
of State shall submit an analysis and justification to the appro-
priate congressional committees for the reduction of Department of
State personnel during fiscal year 2025, including an explanation
of how such reductions support the Department’s mission and ad-
vance United States national security interests.
Section 7064 (Department of State Matters)

garding management of the Department of State. The section also
includes new language placing limitations on funding for certain

The Committee directs the Department of State OIG to leverage
the expertise of personnel from the OIG funded under Title II in
prior acts with respect to material support to terrorists, as the of-
fice integrates into the Department of State. The Committee notes
such expertise is required to ensure sufficient oversight in high-
risk environments, such as Gaza, including to detect the presence
of designated terrorists within implementing organizations. The
Committee expects that any individual employed by a United
States-funded entity who is determined to be a member of a des-
ignated terrorist organization—or who knowingly employed such
individuals—shall be referred expeditiously for appropriate admin-
istrative suspension and debarment proceedings, in accordance
with applicable regulations.
Section 7066 (United Nations Relief Works Agency Oversight and
Justice for Victims)
The Committee is gravely concerned by credible reports that
UNRWA employed individuals linked to Hamas, has a long history
of supporting terrorist groups, and employed staff who murdered
American citizens on October 7, 2023. The Committee directs the
Secretary of State to initiate urgent reforms to multilateral over-
sight and any relevant certification for its multilateral partners,
with full accountability to American victims and their families. The
Committee rejects the United Nations Secretary General’s claim of
immunity for terrorism, atrocities, or corruption and supports the
directives in subsections (a) through (c), regarding evidence preser-
vation, Department of Justice referrals, and withholding funds
until accountability is ensured. The Department of State shall reg-
ularly update the appropriate congressional committees of efforts to

CHANGES IN THE APPLICATION OF EXISTING LAW
Pursuant to clause 3(f)(1)(A) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the following statements are submitted
describing the effect of provisions in the accompanying bill that di-
rectly or indirectly change the application of existing law.
Language is included in various parts of the bill to continue on-
going activities in fiscal year 2026 that require annual authoriza-
tion or additional legislation, which to date has not been enacted.
The bill includes provisions that place limitations on the use of
funds in the bill or change existing limitations and that might
under some circumstances be construed as changing the application
of existing law. The bill includes a number of provisions that have
been virtually unchanged for many years, which are technically
considered legislation. The bill provides that several of the appro-
priations shall remain available for obligation beyond the current
fiscal year. In all cases, it is deemed desirable to carry such lan-
guage in order to provide for orderly administration of such pro-
grams and effective use of funds. In various places in the bill, the
Committee recommendation continues the prior year practice of
designating amounts within appropriation accounts in order to
fund specific programs and has adjusted some designations.
The bill contains general provisions and other language that
have been carried in the bill in past years that include limitations
and conditions on funding provided in this Act.
Additional changes in the fiscal year 2026 bill, which may be con-
strued as changing existing law, are as follows:

ADDITIONAL VIEWS
The first six months of the Trump Administration have inflicted
unprecedented damage on the United States’ diplomacy, develop-
ment, and humanitarian infrastructure. The Fiscal Year 2026 Na-
tional Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appro-
priations bill fails to repair that damage—and instead marks a
dangerous and short-sighted retreat from America’s longstanding
leadership in global engagement, development, and humanitarian
response.
Rather than meeting this moment with resolve, strategy, and in-
vestment, the bill before us would continue to dismantle the very
tools that have long safeguarded U.S. interests, promoted global
stability, and embodied our nation’s values abroad.
Across the world, American diplomats, development officers, pub-
lic health experts, and humanitarian responders—many formerly
at the United States Agency for International Development—serve
on the frontlines of crisis and opportunity. These men and women
represent our country in some of the most volatile regions on
Earth: delivering vaccines in the Congo, educating girls in Ethi-
opia, and supporting Syrian children in Jordan. They are patriots
who deserve not just our gratitude—but the resources they need to
continue their life-saving work.
This bill offers neither. Instead, it embraces isolation and under-
investment, proceeding to hollow out the very institutions that
have made America a global leader. These cuts don’t just harm
communities in far-off places—they have direct consequences for
our own constituents: undermining economic growth, health secu-
rity, and national defense.
The bill slashes the international affairs budget by a staggering
22%, eliminating $13 billion from programs that fight poverty, pre-
vent conflict, and build economic resilience. It decimates develop-
ment assistance and slashes humanitarian programs by 42%. It
cuts support for essential multilateral institutions like UNICEF,
the World Bank, and the World Health Organization weakening
our ability to shape the global agenda and painting the United
States as an unreliable partner.
As the United States retreats, China and Russia rush to fill the
void—armed with cash, weapons, and propaganda. They are forg-
ing strategic alliances, gaining access to critical minerals, expand-
ing military influence, and reshaping international norms in ways
that threaten U.S. interests and democratic values. China is build-
ing ports, railways, and digital networks with strings attached,
while Russia exploits instability to strengthen its authoritarian
reach. As we defund public diplomacy tools like Voice of America,
China floods the airwaves with state-sponsored messaging designed
to undermine democracy and promote its authoritarian model. The
vacuum the United States leaves behind becomes a breeding

ground for extremism, corruption, and instability—undermining
global security and diminishing American influence for generations
to come.
The bill escalates attacks on women’s reproductive freedom.
Today, 218 million women around the world still lack access to the
tools to determine whether and when to grow their families. Hun-
dreds of thousands die each year in childbirth. Yet this bill would
make it even harder for women to access care deeply underfunding
contraceptive care—denying women basic reproductive health serv-
ices that are critical for their lives and futures. And, it eliminates
funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), one of
the only partners reaching mothers and babies in the hardest-to-
reach places.
Across ports and warehouses around the world, millions of dol-
lars’ worth of U.S.-funded food and contraceptives are waiting to be
incinerated—the result of incompetence, mismanagement, and ex-
treme ideology. More than just a waste of tax payer dollars, it is
a moral failure.
Despite these cuts being framed as fiscal discipline, the entire
international affairs budget regularly accounts for less than 1% of
federal spending. Yet it delivers enormous returns—opening mar-
kets for U.S. goods, stabilizing fragile regions, protecting us from
global pandemics, and reducing the need to send U.S. troops into
harm’s way. To ignore these facts is not just shortsighted—it is fis-
cally irresponsible and strategically reckless. True leadership un-
derstands that soft power is not a luxury. It is a necessity.
Several amendments were offered to address the shortcomings of
this year’s bill, but unfortunately, were defeated in largely partisan
votes. An amendment to strike the harmful riders affecting wom-
en’s health offered by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz
was rejected along party lines. Amendments to increase staffing by
Ranking Member Lois Frankel; restore funding for the Inter-Amer-
ican Foundation by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz;
prevent programs in the bill from financially benefiting the Presi-
dent or his family members by Congressman Mark Pocan; prevent
destruction of commodities paid for by the American taxpayer by
Congresswoman Grace Meng; move funding from the Emergency
Refugee and Migration Assistance account to the International Hu-
manitarian Assistance account by Representative Bonnie Watson
Coleman; encourage support for the East Jerusalem Hospital Net-
work by Representative Madeleine Dean; and inclusion of trans-
parency requirements before the implementation of staffing Reduc-
tions-in-Force (RIFs) by Representative Veronica Escobar were all
similarly defeated in party-line votes. Two amendments related to
diplomatic negotiations on deportations, including in El Salvador,
offered by Representative Norma Torres were also defeated.
Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro offered amendments directing a
report on the impact of changes to U.S. foreign aid policy on the
relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic
of China, especially in countries where the United States develop-
ment presence has been diminished and requiring notifications of
terminated programs to include domestic economic impacts. Both
were defeated.

However, the Committee accepted an amendment offered by
Ranking Member Lois Frankel to ensure that at least 15% of the
economic development funds in the bill benefit countries on the
continent of Africa. Investing in Africa reflects its vital role in our
shared future—a continent with a dynamic youth population and
vast economic potential, if we remain its partner of choice. An
amendment by Representative Adriano Espaillat on electronic
waste was also accepted.
The United States cannot just bomb or bully its way to peace and
prosperity. Along with military power, our strength has always
come with diplomacy, development, and compassion. This bill does
not chart a path forward. It is a blueprint for retreat.
We must do better. We must work together—across the aisle—
to craft legislation that reflects our values, honors our commit-
ments, and protects both American lives and global stability.
Finally, this bill was considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since taking office in January 2025, the
executive branch has engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and uncon-
stitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular, the Office of
Management and Budget has been at the center of a government-
wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s laws in its ac-
tions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the agency’s legally-
binding budget decisions (known as apportionments) in contraven-
tion of an unambiguous and constitutionally sound assertion of the
Congress’s authority to impose transparency requirements upon
the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all Democrats on the Committee, the
debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just as former
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States William
Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney General
with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any funding in the bill, so too does the Committee de-
cide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear in-
tent to be both a floor and a ceiling.

These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
