The funding levels provided in this appropriations bill continue
to demonstrate how seriously this Committee takes its responsi-
bility to fund the highest priority programs and activities while
helping to address the nation’s debt, deficit, and economic chal-
lenges. The Committee does not include funding to begin new pro-
grams and, except where specifically noted, does not provide addi-
tional funding for pay increases. Further, the Committee does not
provide funding for climate hubs or climate corps activities. The
bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food,
drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranch-
ers, and rural communities first.
The Committee notes that the President’s budget request in-
cludes a number of important proposals to reform and reorganize
the Federal government. The Committee applauds these efforts to
improve efficiency while reducing waste, fraud, and abuse. Such re-
forms are long overdue. The Committee notes that the authorizing
committees of jurisdiction have not yet had the opportunity to con-
sider these reorganizational proposals. Accordingly, the Commit-
tee’s bill and report reflect the current organizational structure of
the agencies funded herein. The Committee looks forward to work-
ing with the authorizing committees of jurisdiction as they act on
the President’s proposed organizational reforms.
Due to the timing of the fiscal year 2026 President’s budget re-
lease, the Comparative Statement of New Budget Authority does
not compare the bill to the President’s request.
In this report, ‘‘the Committees’’ refers to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Similar to prior years, the Committee does not include direct
funding for activities that are currently funded through other re-
sources, such as the Working Capital Fund, or that have histori-
cally been funded through other means.
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Report.—The Committee
directs the Secretary to provide a report on November 15, 2025,
and May 15, 2026, on planned uses of funding under the authori-
ties of Section 4 and Section 11 of the CCC Charter Act.
CCC Obligations and Commitments.—The Secretary is directed
to notify the Committees in writing 15 days prior to any announce-
ment on the use or cancelation of funds from the CCC or the obli-
gation, commitment, transfer, or cancelation of any emergency
funds from the CCC.
Communication from USDA.—A collaborative working relation-
ship between the Committee and USDA is necessary to ensure effi-
cient and effective implementation of Congress’ funding decisions.
USDA is directed to continue notifying the Committee of major
changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its
operations before providing non-governmental stakeholders such
information, before making the changes public, and before imple-
menting them.
Credit Subsidy Rates.—The Committee notes that the release of
the OMB Budget coincided with the Committee’s work to draft this
Act. In preparation for the appropriations process for fiscal year
2027, the Committee directs USDA to transmit to the Committee
the estimated credit subsidy rates for fiscal year 2027 for each pro-
gram for which amounts are provided in the Act for gross obliga-
tions for the principal amount of direct or guaranteed loans no
later than March 1, 2026.
Critical Inputs.—The Committee directs the Secretary to provide
a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the depend-
ency on the People’s Republic of China for critical agricultural in-
puts such as agricultural equipment, machinery, fertilizer, animal
feed ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, and amino acids,
crop protection chemicals, and veterinary drugs and vaccines, and
recommend legislative or regulatory actions to reduce barriers to
onshore production and mitigate potential supply chain disruptions
that could be exploited by the People’s Republic of China.
Customer Service.—The Committee continues to support USDA’s
efforts to improve customer service. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to develop standards to improve customer service, incor-
porate the standards into the performance plans required under 31
U.S.C. 1115, and submit a report on these efforts within 60 days
of enactment of this Act.
Explanatory Notes.—The Committee appreciates the Depart-
ment’s work to restore the Explanatory Notes to the same format
as they had been presented prior to fiscal year 2021 and directs
that this format be maintained for fiscal year 2027 and beyond.
Fruit Fly Quarantine Areas.—The Committee is aware of quar-
antines in California as a result of detections of Oriental fruit fly
and Queensland fruit fly. The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
Plant Protection and Quarantine in safeguarding crops and forests
against the entry, establishment, and spread of pests. However,
with very few treatment options available for crops located within

the California quarantine areas, farmers have faced devastating
losses. The Committee urges APHIS to take the necessary steps to
resolve the infestation so that the quarantine may be lifted. Fur-
ther, USDA is directed through all agencies, including within Farm
Production and Conservation (FPAC), to evaluate available finan-
cial assistance for producers impacted by the quarantines and pro-
vide a report of its findings to the Committee within 120 days of
enactment of this Act. Within the report, USDA is encouraged to
provide recommendations on program changes that would make
them more accessible and beneficial to producers negatively im-
pacted by quarantines.
Intermediate Crops.—The Committee is aware of a burgeoning
industry of nonfood crops, such as camelina, that can be grown on
existing farmland between primary crops to produce feedstock for
renewable biofuels and chemicals. The Committee encourages
USDA to consider opportunities to utilize existing programs and re-
sources to support intermediate crop production in the United
States. Further, the Committee encourages USDA to establish a
standard definition for the term ‘‘intermediate crop’’ as an oilseed
crop of renewable biomass, such as camelina, carinata, and domes-
ticated pennycress, or any other crop as determined by the Sec-
retary, that otherwise meets the definition of a cover crop and is
planted and harvested on land that would otherwise be idle in a
rotation pattern between main crops or in a fallow rotation and is
primarily intended to provide feedstocks for the production of re-
newable biofuels and chemicals.
Interstate Commerce of Agricultural Products.—The Committee
directs the Secretary to provide a report on the impact of State
statutes and regulations on food prices and industry consolidation
within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. Such report shall pro-
vide recommendations of actions that can be taken to alleviate the
impacts of these policies while also respecting States’ rights.
Liability Protections for Food Donation.—The Committee directs
USDA to update the guidance documents related to liability protec-
tions provided through the Bill Emerson Act and the Food Dona-
tion Improvement Act to clarify how food companies can donate ex-
cess food.
Loan and Grant Programs.—The Committee directs that if an es-
timate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles II and III
of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commit-
ments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal
year, or in any event when 75 percent of the authority to make
commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify
the Committees through OBPA. The Committee directs the Depart-
ment, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Commit-
tees on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan
and grant programs provided in this bill.
National Finance Center.—The National Finance Center (NFC) is
the largest designated Federal Government Payroll Shared Service
Provider, and it provides integrated payroll and personnel services
for over 640,000 Federal employees. To ensure that thousands of
Federal employees’ pay and human resources services are not in-
terrupted or adversely impacted by major organizational changes,
the Committee continues requirements under current law relating
to NFC payroll and shared services operations, missions, personnel,

and functions. The Committee also directs USDA to provide quar-
terly reports on full-time equivalent (FTE) levels for each of the
current NFC divisions, operations, and functions, as well as each
of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and Office of the
Chief Information Officer (OCIO) divisions, operations, and func-
tions currently co-located with the NFC. The reports also are to in-
clude a detailed breakdown of the FTEs for each and any of these
same divisions, functions, or operations for the NFC and the co-lo-
cated OCFO and OCIO functions compared to those during fiscal
year 2017 and 2018.
The Committee is aware of the National Academy of Public Ad-
ministration (Academy) recommendations regarding the stabiliza-
tion and modernization of the NFC. The Academy notes that tim-
ing and budget pressures place a significant burden on NFC, and
absent a dedicated appropriation, problems can persist. The Com-
mittee supports the efforts of NFC to modernize its IT infrastruc-
ture, resulting in higher recruitment of skilled workers and long-
term cost savings. The Committee urges the Secretary to use dedi-
cated credit card rebates transferred to the Working Capital Fund,
as approved by section 725, to bolster information technology and
other support systems at the NFC. Additionally, the Committee en-
courages the Secretary to provide resources for agency costs associ-
ated with transitioning to NFC services.
Native Plants.—The Committee continues to support the use of
locally adapted native plant materials in the undertaking of land
management activity on Federal lands under the jurisdiction of
USDA.
New Initiatives.—The Committee directs USDA, no later than
120 days after enactment of this Act, to submit an execution plan
for each new initiative funded in this Act. This strategy should in-
clude, but is not limited to, the steps necessary to make funding
available, the timeline thereof, targeted beneficiaries, and expected
results. The Committee requests quarterly reports on these initia-
tives until the initiative has been fully implemented.
Notification Requirements.—The Committee reminds the Depart-
ment that the Committee uses the definitions for transfer, re-
programming, and program, project, and activity as defined by the
Government Accountability Office (GAO). As noted in the fiscal
year 2024 Joint Explanatory Statement, a program, project, or ac-
tivity (PPA) is an element within a budget account. PPAs are iden-
tified by reference to include the most specific level of budget items
identified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug
Administration, and Related Agencies Act, 2024, accompanying
Committee reports, explanatory statements, and budget justifica-
tions. The Committee notes that the most specific level of budget
items in USDA budget justifications is not limited to tables titled
‘‘Project Statement’’.
Persistent Poverty Areas.—The Committee supports targeted in-
vestments in impoverished areas. The Committee directs USDA to
develop and implement measures to increase the share of invest-
ments in persistent poverty counties, distressed communities, and
other impoverished areas. The Committee directs USDA to submit
a report to the Committee that includes the total amount of Fed-
eral investments targeted toward such areas; a list of the programs
under which the amount of Federal investments to such areas were

increased in fiscal year 2025; the percent change in the amount of
funds that were targeted to such areas from fiscal year 2024; and
to the extent practicable, an assessment of the economic impact of
departmental programs in these areas.
Program, Project, or Activity.—For the purposes of sections 716
and 721 of this Act, ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ means the most
detailed subdivision of an appropriation and should reflect the
more detailed of (a) amounts identified in any tables in this report;
(b) amounts, including increases or decreases, specified in any
parts of this Act or this report; (c) activities or directives specified
in this Act or this report; or (d) tables included in budget justifica-
tion materials.
Quarterly Reports.—The Committee directs the Secretary to sub-
mit a unified quarterly report detailing staffing levels and obli-
gated balances across the Department. Staffing data should provide
detail by agency, including current levels and end-of-year goals,
and the source of appropriations, notated by the authority citation,
supporting each staffing level. Obligation data should include year-
to-date obligations and current balances at the mission area, agen-
cy, and program level, broken down by source of appropriation and
the number of FTEs supported by each PPA.
Seafood and Aquaculture Report.—The Committee recognizes
that American demand for seafood has increased significantly and
supports increasing the production of domestic aquaculture. The
Committee requests a report no later than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act that evaluates USDA’s role, and includes rec-
ommendations, for supporting the U.S. aquaculture and the seafood
industry. The report should include USDA expenditures, over the
last three fiscal years, on seafood and aquaculture purchases; sea-
food and aquaculture promotion and outreach; the number and
amount of grants made to the seafood and aquaculture industries;
and the number and amount of grants made to facilitate seafood
and aquaculture research.
Simplifying the Application Process.—The Committee recognizes
that the complexity and variability of Notices of Funding Opportu-
nities can create significant barriers for small, rural, and Tribal
communities with limited administrative capacity. To improve ac-
cess to USDA grant programs, the Committee urges the Depart-
ment to streamline and standardize application procedures across
discretionary programs. The Committee encourages USDA to de-
velop a common application framework or shared application com-
ponents, where feasible, to reduce administrative burden and to
brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within
180 days of enactment of this Act on these efforts.
Spending Plans.—The bill continues a provision in Title VII that
requires USDA to submit spending plans to the Committee within
30 days of enactment of this Act. Previous versions of these plans
have not included adequate details that would be useful for Com-
mittee oversight. The Committee requests that USDA spending
plans include for each program, project, or activity: (1) a compari-
son between the budget justification funding levels, the most recent
Congressional directives or approved funding levels, and the fund-
ing levels proposed by the department or agency; and (2) a clear,
concise, and informative description/justification.

The Committee reminds USDA of notification requirements, also
included in Title VII, for all applicable changes.
Status of House and Senate Report Language.—The Department
is directed to include in its fiscal year 2027 Congressional Justifica-
tion, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a col-
umn for due dates if applicable. OBPA is directed to provide up-
dates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from
the Committees.
Study on Infant Formula Consolidation.—The Committee directs
USDA in partnership with the FTC to study and report to Con-
gress making recommendations on how to reduce market con-
centration and consolidation in infant formula, including rec-
ommendations for whether and how Congress could alter the single
supply contract model under WIC to address these issues.
U.S. Fiber Processing.—The Committee encourages USDA to
identify programs, such as Value-Added Producer Grants and the
Business and Industry Loan Program, that can support the produc-
tion and processing of plant-based fiber crops, such as cotton,
hemp, and flax, and animal-based fibers such as wool, alpaca, and
leather. The Committee requests a briefing within 180 days of en-
actment of this Act on Agency efforts to bolster support for plant
and animal-based fiber production and processing in the U.S.
USDA Farm Delivery Systems Modernization.—The Committee
directs the Secretary within 60 days of enactment of this Act to
provide an IT modernization plan that accelerates the continued
implementation and expansion of the Farmers.gov system using
the Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset (EDAPT) to en-
able USDA customers to: (1) view their information, complete
transactions, quickly review the status, and update tabular cus-
tomer information; (2) submit applications for FPAC programs and
receive program payments for all USDA farm programs; (3) to com-
plete their own applications, including electronic signatures and
submissions, for all farm programs that require direct application;
(4) enable electronic income reporting between USDA and the In-
ternal Revenue Service; and (5) access and manage acreage report-
ing, farm records mapping, and farm records information within
Farmers.gov. The Committee further directs the FPAC Business
Center to provide a roadmap for systems to make customer infor-
mation available within Farmers.gov and EDAPT including, but
not limited to, the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Cov-
erage programs, the Dairy Margin Coverage program, and the
Farm Service Agency Emergency Relief Program.
USDA Office of Homeland Security.—The Committee expects the
Office of Homeland Security to fulfill its co-Sector Risk Manage-
ment Agency (SRMA) responsibilities. As demonstrated by
ransomware attacks, cybersecurity threats to the food and agri-
culture sector have far-reaching and highly disruptive effects.
SRMA is responsible for coordinating efforts across the food and
agriculture sector to address and mitigate these threats.

Of the amounts provided for policy research, $3,000,000 is pro-
vided for the Department to focus on entities that have developed
models, databases, and staff necessary to conduct in-depth analysis
of the impacts of agriculture or rural development policy proposals
on rural communities, farmers, agribusiness, taxpayers, and con-
sumers, including an analysis of irrigation water supplies coming
from Mexico to the U.S., per the 1944 Water Treaty, specifically Ar-
ticle 4, Section B, subparagraph (c).
Of the amounts provided for policy research, $1,500,000 shall be
for the Department to focus efforts on entities that have informa-
tion, analysis, research, and staff necessary to provide objective,
scientific information to support and enhance efficient, accurate im-
plementation of Federal drought preparedness and drought re-
sponse programs, including interagency thresholds used to deter-

1862, 1890, and 1994 Land-Grant Institutions.—The Committee
directs USDA to make every effort to strengthen partnerships and
expand cooperation between 1862, 1890, and 1994 land-grant insti-
tutions, wherever regionally appropriate, to help close gaps in ex-
tension and leverage joint collaborative efforts.
1890 Capacity Building.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the 1890s in providing technical assistance and outreach

Artificial Intelligence in Precision Agriculture.—The Committee
urges collaboration between USDA and the National Science Foun-
dation to pursue advances in precision agriculture and food system
security using artificial intelligence.
Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) Labor Shortages.—
The Committee recognizes the labor challenges facing the agricul-
tural industry in recent years, especially in the greenhouse and
CEA industry. The Committee requests a report within 180 days
of enactment of this Act on best practices for attracting and retain-
ing greenhouse and CEA labor, as well as processes and systems
to increase labor efficiency in this agricultural sector.
Foreign Research Funding.—The Committee is concerned about
funding for research in foreign countries of concern. The Committee
directs USDA to submit a report within 120 days of enactment of
this Act that details all direct or indirect funding or other USDA
support for research conducted in collaboration with foreign govern-
ments or entities of concern as defined in 42 U.S.C. 19221(a), in-
cluding the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic People’s Re-
public of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic
of Iran, over the last 5 years. This report should include the cost
of each project, a list of collaborating institutions, an explanation
of the research, and the level of oversight USDA provides over the
foreign research.
High-Value Biological Compounds.—The Committee supports re-
search on high-value biological compounds, including from non-
meat animal products, for human and animal benefit.
Potato Research.—The Committee encourages the Secretary to
support pest management programs in potato growing states to
minimize the application of pesticides and maximize the yield and
quality of harvested potatoes. Such programs help scientists track
potential pest outbreaks, provide growers and industry profes-
sionals with current information on specific and timely treatments,
identify serious diseases, such as late blight, in their early stages,
and allow for preventive measures to be put into place quickly to
avoid crop losses.

tion through integrated collaborative research and technology
transfer. The Committee provides funding to support research into
laying hen and turkey disease prevention, antimicrobial resistance,
nutrition, gut health, and alternative housing systems under ex-
treme weather conditions. The Committee encourages NIFA to im-
plement a pilot process to administer this funding through a Na-
tional Program Leader, who will work with industry stakeholders
to identify a land-grant university to serve as the principal investi-
gator and identify and administer multiple subawards.
Minor Crop Pest Management.—The Committee recognizes the
critical work of the IR–4 Project in securing registrations for new
plant protection products for specialty crops and new reduced-risk
pesticides to support food security research infrastructure and con-
sumer demand for high-quality food.
Multifaceted Tools for Controlling Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)
and Huanglongbing.—The Committee encourages NIFA to continue
research into the use of potent antimicrobials through the use of
environmentally-friendly integrated nano-delivery systems for the
purpose of controlling both HABs and Huanglongbing.

the importance of nationally coordinated, regionally managed
canola research and extension programs. The Committee encour-
ages NIFA to continue to seek input from stakeholders regarding
canola research and to address research needs in areas with the
greatest potential to expand canola production, as well as those
where canola production is established and needs to be maintained.
Vector Control.—The Committee encourages USDA to support re-
search, including the work done through the Biotechnology Risk
Assessment Research Grants program, to develop innovative vector
control technologies to combat Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosqui-
toes. The Committee urges USDA to utilize pest management pro-
grams and partner organizations to conduct research to develop
and test effective repellents, create new molecular pesticide tech-
nologies that prevent mosquitoes from reproducing, and explore
natural product remedies to deter pests.

Agriculture Quarantine Inspections (AQI).—The Committee rec-
ognizes that prevention of infestations of pests and diseases is
much more cost-effective than subsequent control or eradication.
This is an important Federal responsibility, and the Committee
provides $35,500,000 for the AQI function, including pre-departure
and interline inspections.
Animal Care Website.—The Committee encourages APHIS to con-
tinue to provide means for the public to search for compliance and
enforcement data, as well as specific information regarding inspec-
tion report findings. The Committee further encourages APHIS to
continue to identify additional improvements to the search capabili-
ties on the Public Search Tool.
Animal Welfare Act (AWA).— The Committee supports a collabo-
rative approach between APHIS and licensees involving education,
training, outreach, and timely inspections to improve the care of
animals.
The Committee directs APHIS to submit a report within 240
days of enactment of this Act on the requirements and enforcement
of standards under the AWA, the agency’s efforts to educate and
advise licensees, and the capacity of the agency to enforce the
AWA. The report should also include recommendations to improve
the requirements and standards under the AWA, education efforts
of the agency with respect to such requirements and standards,
and the associated costs of any recommended improvements.
Additionally, USDA is expected to continue to collaborate on
AWA enforcement with the Department of Justice as appropriate.
APHIS Inspections of ARS Facilities.—The funding provided for
the Animal Welfare program includes funding to support the agree-
ment between APHIS and ARS, under which APHIS conducts com-
pliance inspections of ARS facilities to ensure compliance with the
regulations and standards of the AWA. The Committee directs
APHIS to conduct inspections of all such ARS facilities and to post
the resulting inspection reports online in their entirety without

redactions except signatures. The Committee continues to direct
APHIS to transmit to the Committees all inspection reports involv-
ing ARS facilities, including pre-compliance inspections.
Arundo Management and Control.—The Committee is concerned
with the damage the invasive plant Arundo donax inflicts on
groundwater levels in drought-prone western States. The Com-
mittee encourages APHIS to work with Federal, State, and local
water managers in affected areas to establish a management and
control regime to prevent further water shortages in drought-
stricken areas.
Asian Longhorned Tick (ALT).—The Committee is concerned
about the ongoing spread of ALT, which represents a growing
threat to domestic livestock populations. In addition to monitoring
the spread of ALT, APHIS should utilize the resources necessary
to enhance collaboration with ARS, NIFA, State partners, and in-
dustry stakeholders to improve preparedness, surveillance, and re-
sponse capabilities. Recognizing that public education and outreach
will play an important role in reducing the spread of ALT, the
Committee expects APHIS to enhance outreach and education ef-
forts to that end. The Committee directs APHIS to submit a report
within 60 days of enactment of this Act outlining the resources
which would be required to establish an ALT control program with-
in APHIS.
Avian Health.—The Committee provides no less than the fiscal
year 2025 levels for the Avian Health Program, which provides sur-
veillance, prevention, and control of avian diseases to protect the
U.S. poultry industry.
Aviation Personnel Safety.—To help ensure the safety of APHIS
aviation personnel, the Committee encourages APHIS to invest in
leading Health and Usage Monitoring System technologies for the
agency’s aircraft fleet.
Blackbird Predation.—APHIS is responsible for providing Fed-
eral leadership in managing problems caused by wildlife. The Com-
mittee is aware of the economic importance of controlling blackbird
depredation, which affects sunflowers and other crops. The Com-
mittee encourages APHIS to take action to reduce blackbird depre-
dation in the Northern Great Plains.
Border Inspectors.—The Committee recognizes the critical role
APHIS border inspectors play in protecting U.S. agriculture and
natural resources from invasive pests and diseases, while ensuring
safe and secure movement of agricultural goods. The Committee
also acknowledges that APHIS border inspectors are funded par-
tially through user fees. The Committee encourages USDA to ex-
empt border inspectors from any federal hiring freeze.
Canine Detection and Surveillance.—The Committee recognizes
the important role APHIS’ canines program plays in invasive spe-
cies and disease detection and provides $3,022,000 to support these
efforts. The Committee requests that APHIS keep it apprised of
program activities, including how the agency uses the funding pro-
vided.
Cattle Health.—The Committee provides $111,500,000 for Cattle
Health to continue to fund initiatives related to eradication of fever
ticks for livestock and wildlife hosts, including but not limited to
research, data management, infrastructure, and treatment. The
Committee is concerned that the cattle fever tick quarantine area

is expanding despite efforts to constrain spread. To prevent move-
ment of livestock and game animals outside of the quarantined
area or high-risk premises, the Committee encourages APHIS to
use available funds for a cost-share program for the construction
and repair of livestock or game fencing on private lands. The Com-
mittee directs USDA, in conjunction with State animal health com-
missions, to develop a strategy to exclude wildlife from areas at
highest risk of tick spread and identify areas that qualify for funds
within these areas.
The Committee also notes that large, dense stands of non-native
Carrizo cane occupy the banks and floodplains of the Rio Grande
River, providing favorable habitat for cattle fever ticks and threat-
ening water supplies for agriculture due to its high
evapotranspiration capacity. The Committee understands that
APHIS has been working with ARS on biological controls and the
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for mechanical controls.
The Committee encourages APHIS to continue to coordinate with
ARS, CBP, Department of the Interior, the International Boundary
and Water Commission, the Texas State Soil and Water Conserva-
tion Board, and other stakeholders on control efforts. The Depart-
ment is requested to keep the Committee apprised of progress
made in this regard.
Cervid Health.—The Committee recognizes the importance of a
live test for cervids potentially affected with chronic wasting dis-
ease (CWD) and for research dedicated to the development of such
tests and on pathways of transmission. The Committee provides
$17,500,000 for APHIS for CWD, of which $12,500,000 shall be for
APHIS to further develop and implement CWD surveillance, test-
ing, management, and response activities. APHIS shall provide
$5,000,000 for indemnity payments, cervid health activities, and
associated costs to remove infected and exposed animals as expedi-
tiously as possible. The Committee directs APHIS to continue
working with States, Native American Tribes, university collabo-
rators, and dedicated CWD research facilities to provide research
support to the overall effort to detect, combat, and control CWD.
In addition, the Committee maintains the 2025 funding level for
Wildlife Services Methods Development for CWD work at the Na-
tional Wildlife Research Center.
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) Reportable Disease.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the ongoing efforts to combat CWD. Recent re-
ports suggest there is a substantial species barrier preventing
transmission of CWD from cervids to humans. The Committee re-
quests a report from APHIS within 90 days of enactment on the
impacts of removing CWD from the USDA National List of Report-
able Animal Diseases.
Citrus Health Response Program (CHRP).—CHRP is a national
effort to protect the U.S. citrus industry from invasive pests and
diseases. These funds are designed to partner with State depart-
ments of agriculture and industry groups to address the challenges
of citrus pests and diseases. In addition to the funds provided in
this account, the Committee encourages APHIS to utilize the funds
available in the Plant Pest and Disease Management and Disaster
Prevention Programs to the greatest extent possible to sustain the
economic viability of the citrus industry.

Cotton Pests.—The Committee provides $15,500,000 for the joint
Cotton Pests Program and encourages APHIS and the cotton indus-
try to make every effort to ensure the boll weevil does not reinfest
areas of the U.S. where it has been successfully eradicated.
Depopulation.—APHIS uses defined methods for depopulation as
described in the 2019 American Veterinary Medical Association
(AVMA) Guidelines for Depopulation of Animals, based on the spe-
cies and to meet specific depopulation timelines and on-site condi-
tions. The AVMA definition stresses the importance of considering
animal welfare when determining the best approach to depopula-
tion. Given the nationwide outbreak of HPAI and growing concerns
over African swine fever, the Committee directs USDA to ensure
that the National Veterinary Stockpile has adequate supplies and
equipment to assist producers in utilizing more rapid, humane, and
effective depopulation methods when necessary, as outlined in
AVMA guidelines.
Eastern Spruce Budworm.—The Committee is aware that the
Eastern Spruce Budworm has a long history of causing severe defo-
liation and tree mortality in forests throughout the northeast. The
current outbreak has caused over 20 million acres of defoliation
and continues to spread. The Committee encourages APHIS to
partner with the U.S. Forest Service for the monitoring and man-
agement of the pest.
Education and Outreach on Avian Influenza.—The Committee re-
mains concerned by the spread of HPAI. The Committee encour-
ages APHIS to continue to provide increased training, public out-
reach, and educational materials to areas threatened by HPAI.
Electronic Identification (EID).—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the APHIS Animal Disease Traceability (ADT)
framework to protect livestock producers and the domestic food
supply. The Committee does not support the costs of requiring EID
tags for interstate movement of cattle and bison falling onto pro-
ducers, livestock markets, veterinarians, or others in the livestock
industry. The Committee maintains fiscal year 2025 levels of
$15,000,000 for the purchase of EID tags and related infrastruc-
ture, such as EID readers, software, and other technological up-
grades needed for the industry to comply with the final rule, ‘‘Use
of Electronic Identification Eartags as Official Identification in Cat-
tle and Bison’’ (89 FR 39540). Within these funds, APHIS is en-
couraged to purchase no fewer than 11 million EID tags.
Emergency Outbreaks.—The Committee continues to include spe-
cific language relating to the availability of funds to address emer-
gencies related to the arrest and eradication of contagious or infec-
tious diseases or pests of animals, poultry, or plants. The Com-
mittee expects the Secretary to continue to use the authority pro-
vided in this Act to transfer funds from the CCC for the arrest and
eradication of animal and plant pests and diseases that threaten
American agriculture. By providing funds in this account, the Com-
mittee is enhancing, not replacing, the use of CCC funding for
emergency outbreaks.
Emergency Preparedness and Response.—The Committee con-
tinues to provide funding for the Animal Care Program to coordi-
nate with FEMA on the National Response Plan and to support
State and local governments’ efforts to plan for protection of people
with animals and incorporate lessons learned from previous disas-

ters. The Committee maintains fiscal year 2025 levels to support
hazard preparedness and response for zoos and aquariums, and im-
plementation of emergency contingency plans for all facilities regu-
lated under the AWA.
European Green Crab.—The Committee encourages APHIS to as-
sist shellfish growers who have been impacted by the spread of Eu-
ropean Green Crab.
Feral Swine.—The Committee provides an increase of $500,000
for feral swine eradication efforts and encourages APHIS Wildlife
Services to use all approved measures as a force multiplier and to
prioritize States with the highest population of feral swine.
Fruit Fly Exclusion and Detection.—The Committee provides an
increase of $750,000 for exotic fruit fly detection, response, and pre-
vention. The Committee requests a report, in consultation with the
Department of Defense (DoD), on plans for repairs, improvements,
maintenance, and construction of the Sterile Insect Release Facility
at Joint Forces Training Base, Los Alamitos, California.
Glassy Winged Sharpshooter.—The Committee maintains fiscal
year 2025 levels and urges USDA to consider all appropriate fund-
ing resources to rapidly respond to areas where increasing numbers
of the pest glassy winged sharpshooter are occurring in California.
Glossy Buckthorn.—The Committee is concerned about the
spread of glossy buckthorn, an invasive shrub species that thrives
in forests and wetlands. Glossy buckthorn is easily spread by birds
and animals and can establish itself in any environment that has
sufficient moisture. Its spread presents a direct threat to the bio-
diversity of forests and wetlands across the country, including the
Allegheny National Forest. The Committee requests a report on
possible mitigation strategies to limit the impacts of glossy
buckthorn.
Hawaii Inspections.—The Committee directs APHIS to provide a
report within one year of enactment of this Act outlining rec-
ommendations to enhance existing protocols to better protect Ha-
waii from invasive species. The report should include an evaluation
of the feasibility of USDA working with the State to improve bio-
security to prevent the establishment of invasive species and to
mitigate damage from existing invasive species. APHIS is encour-
aged to evaluate the risk of persons, baggage, cargo, and other
items entering Hawaii to introduce invasive species of concern.
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).—The Committee is
supportive of USDA and industry efforts to develop an HPAI Initia-
tive to assist the poultry industry in managing the ongoing HPAI
outbreak and its subsequent market impacts through collaborative
research among institutions with HPAI expertise. The Committee
encourages USDA to continue vaccine related research; coordinate
with industry and researchers on alternate vaccine administration
techniques to minimize bird handling and maximize animal wel-
fare; work to develop surveillance methods of differentiating in-
fected from vaccinated birds; develop new advanced biosecurity
practices, wild bird mitigation, and research; and work with the
U.S. Trade Representative to accelerate negotiations with trading
partners to permit poultry and egg trade to continue under pre-ne-
gotiated terms if vaccination for HPAI must be used to prevent or
mitigate future outbreaks.

The Committee is also concerned by the emerging and ongoing
outbreak of HPAI in dairy herds across the U.S. that has resulted
in a sharp drop in feed intake and milk production by infected
cows. Continued spread of HPAI will impact dairy producers, milk
production, and utilization of foodgrains nationwide, and may lead
to increased milk prices for consumers. The Committee recognizes
and is sensitive to the effects a voluntary vaccine may have on
international trade relationships; however, the Committee is also
aware that USDA has used vaccines against low pathogenic avian
influenza, and deployment of an HPAI vaccine may address con-
cerns from the scientific community about transmission, future
variants, and mortality rates. The Committee is aware of private
companies’ investment in vaccine development for H5N1 in dairy
herds. The Committee directs USDA to report on the status of vac-
cine research, development, and approvals and to engage with
other relevant agencies to evaluate the potential for use of vaccines
for dairy cattle. USDA should also describe strategies to mitigate
the concerns of international trading partners and align with appli-
cable international standards and agreements for potential vaccine
use. Further, the Committee understands that there is concern
among some dairy producers about data collection efforts to confirm
infections in the absence of indemnity assistance assurances. Data
collection and testing efforts must take into consideration the im-
portance of a producer’s future ability to market milk and meat.
The Committee will continue monitoring the situation and encour-
ages USDA to consider providing indemnity assistance to producers
where appropriate.
Horse Protection Act Inspections.—The Committee has consist-
ently recognized the need for APHIS and the Tennessee Walking
Horse industry to communicate and work together to eliminate the
soring of horses. The Committee is concerned that the final rule,
Horse Protection Amendments, published May 8, 2024 (89 FR
39194), ignores the strong concerns of and comments submitted by
industry experts, is based on out-of-date and unreliable data, and
exceeds the agency’s legal authority under the Horse Protection
Act. Further, the cost-benefit analysis accompanying the rule relies
on data that is over a decade old and severely underestimates the
impact the rule will have on the 20,000 jobs supported by the Ten-
nessee Walking Horse industry. The Committee reiterates that an
objective, science-based inspection system would provide assurance
for both accuracy and fairness. Therefore, the Committee directs
APHIS to withdraw the final rule and work with the industry to
eliminate soring using objective, science-based protocols.
Huanglongbing Emergency Response.—The Committee encour-
ages APHIS to allocate sufficient resources to continue the activi-
ties necessary to effectively prevent or manage HLB. The disease,
for which there is no cure, has caused a significant decline in Flor-
ida’s citrus production since 2007. All citrus producing counties in
Texas are under quarantine, and in California there have been
over 3,000 confirmed cases of HLB in backyard citrus trees. HLB
threatens the sustainability of the entire domestic citrus industry.
If HLB continues to spread, it will cost thousands of additional jobs
and millions in lost revenue. The agency is encouraged to support
the priorities and strategies identified by the HLB–MAC group.

The agency should appropriately allocate resources based on crit-
ical need and the maximum benefit to the citrus industry.
Imported Dogs.—The Committee is aware that USDA issued a
report that showed that over one million dogs are imported into the
U.S. each year. Of that number, however, less than one percent are
subject to thorough health screenings to show that they are
healthy, vaccinated, and free of disease prior to entering the coun-
try. The limited health requirements and inspections have resulted
in the importation of animals that arrive in poor health or die dur-
ing travel, as well as the importation of animals carrying various
diseases from rabies to canine influenza to leptospirosis, among
others. As the connection between human and animal health be-
comes clearer, it is imperative that imported animals, including
dogs, are healthy, vaccinated, and of an appropriate age to travel.
Therefore, the Committee maintains the fiscal year 2025 levels for
APHIS to strengthen its oversight of imported dogs, including
stronger interagency coordination to better protect animal and pub-
lic health.
In- and Out-Bound Market Access Report.—The Committee re-
quests that APHIS continue submitting the report on U.S. out-
bound and foreign in-bound agricultural market access. The report
should provide data for the last three years, including the date ac-
cess was granted and the in-bound and out-bound volumes shipped
by country and commodity.
M–44 Sodium Cyanide Devices.—The Committee supports the
purchase, deployment, and training of third parties on the use of
M–44 sodium cyanide ejector devices (M–44s). These devices are an
important tool for the control of predators preying on livestock,
poultry, or Federally designated threatened and endangered spe-
cies. The Committee directs APHIS to fully incorporate M–44s in
the agency’s wildlife damage management strategy as appropriate.
Mexican Wolves.—The Committee is concerned about the APHIS
evidence standards from August 2023 for determining livestock
depredations by Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico. The
updated standards make it significantly more difficult for livestock
producers to be fairly reimbursed for livestock killed by the experi-
mental population of Mexican wolves that were released into these
areas by the Federal government. The Committee notes that evi-
dence of subcutaneous hemorrhaging is often difficult to determine,
especially in instances in which the wolves have almost entirely
consumed the animal’s carcass. The Committee urges APHIS to re-
place the August 2023 evidence standards with standards that take
into consideration but do not predominantly rely on evidence of
subcutaneous hemorrhaging.
Mormon Crickets.—The Committee provides an increase of
$1,000,000 for the suppression and control of Mormon crickets and
grasshoppers on private and public lands, including in States that
require treatments later in the season. The Committee directs
APHIS to make available additional emergency use applications,
according to product use label standards, to States under cir-
cumstances of critical infestation, which is identified as more than
two crickets per square yard after initial treatment or more than
eight grasshoppers per square yard after initial treatment, or as
determined by State survey data in consultation with APHIS.

National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN).—The
laboratories within the NAHLN network are on the frontline for
detection of newly identified and reemerging animal diseases and
provide a critical contribution to animal and human health. There-
fore, the Committee continues to provide funding for NAHLN
through both APHIS and NIFA at no less than $18,500,000. This
amount is in addition to mandatory funding provided through the
2018 Farm Bill for Animal Disease Prevention and Management.
The Committee encourages the Department to provide robust fund-
ing from the 2018 Farm Bill for NAHLN.
National Clean Plant Network (NCPN).—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the NCPN, which was created to protect
U.S. crops, including berries, grapes, nuts, fruit trees, roses, sweet
potatoes, and citrus, from the spread of economically devastating
plant pests and diseases.
National Detector Dog Training Center.—The Committee sup-
ports the work of the National Detector Dog Training Center in
protecting the domestic agriculture sector from invasive pests and
diseases. The Committee directs USDA to provide a report within
one year of enactment of this Act on the cost and feasibility of es-
tablishing an additional canine detection training facility on the
West Coast.
National Honeybee Disease Survey Report.—The Committee con-
tinues funding for the National Honeybee Survey. Since 2009, a na-
tional survey of honeybee pests and diseases has been funded an-
nually by APHIS along with other Federal and non-Federal part-
ners to document which bee diseases, parasites, or pests of honey-
bees are present and/or likely absent in the U.S. This information
will help place current and future epidemiological studies in con-
text and thus may indirectly help investigations of emerging condi-
tions.
New World Screwworm (NWS).—The Committee is concerned by
the rapidly spreading NWS infestation in Mexico and Central
America, which threatens to infect the domestic livestock industry.
The Committee recognizes that NWS poses a serious threat to
human health, as well as the health of every mammalian livestock
species. The Committee further recognizes that past efforts to
eradicate this parasite in the U.S. were costly, and if an infestation
were to occur within the U.S. borders today, the burden on tax-
payers and private industry to eradicate it would be significant.
The Committee notes that this Act reaffirms USDA’s authority to
transfer emergency funds under the Animal Health Protection Act
(AHPA) for the arrest and eradication of contagious or infectious
disease or pests. The Committee directs APHIS to prioritize the es-
tablishment of a sterile fly facility in the U.S. to provide the means
necessary to prevent and control NWS, including by considering
the authorities of the AHPA if necessary.
New World Screwworm Preparedness.—The Committee recog-
nizes that proactive measures, including continued research and
development on control methods, are critical to responding to and
preventing a NWS outbreak. The Committee further notes that the
Foreign Animal Disease Preparedness & Response Plan for the
New World Screwworm from APHIS was last updated in 2018 and
acknowledges the necessity to update these documents in light of
the current NWS infestation in Mexico and Central America. With-

in 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee directs APHIS,
alongside the FDA as necessary, and with relevant stakeholders, to
update the current state of U.S. preparedness and response capa-
bilities and identify critical research and development needs to en-
hance NWS prevention, control and eradication such as new diag-
nostic tools, improved sterile insect techniques, and potential drug
treatments, to combat the NWS. APHIS shall make all issued guid-
ance documents in relation to NWS outbreak prevention and eradi-
cation publicly available.
Nitrogen Depopulation Methods.—The Committee encourages
USDA to invest in research and development of whole house gas-
sing with nitrogen and high expansion nitrogen gas-filled foam as
methods of large-scale poultry depopulation, particularly during
animal disease emergency response events. Further, the Committee
requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the
current utilization of nitrogen-based depopulation methods within
the animal agriculture industry and barriers to widespread use of
these methods during animal disease emergency response events.
Pale Cyst Nematode Eradication.—The Committee includes fund-
ing to maintain resources for the pale cyst nematode eradication
program at the fiscal year 2025 level to continue successful efforts
to eradicate this pest. If left untreated, this pest could spread, af-
fecting other crops.
Paraguay Beef.—The Committee is concerned about the final rule
titled ‘‘Importation of Fresh Beef From Paraguay’’ (88 Fed. Reg.
77883). The rule is based on a risk assessment that relies on poten-
tially outdated data from in-country site visits that occurred in
2008 and 2014. Conclusions drawn from a science-based risk as-
sessment are only as reliable as the data included in the assess-
ment. Therefore, it is critical for APHIS to use current data to con-
firm Paraguay’s animal health and inspection systems can provide
an equivalent level of safety compared to the U.S. prior to allowing
fresh beef imports from Paraguay. The Committee directs APHIS,
as expeditiously as possible, to conduct an additional in-country
site visit in Paraguay and provide the Committee an updated risk
analysis that incorporates data from the visits.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).—The Committee remains
concerned about the impact of HPAI as it continues to spread, with
persistent impacts on the agricultural sector and ongoing risks of
mutations that could result in airborne-transmissible strains. The
Committee urges USDA to prioritize reusable elastomeric res-
pirators in the National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) to support ef-
forts to curtail disease outbreaks and protect poultry and dairy
workers in the event the outbreak worsens. These respirators pro-
vide enhanced protection compared to disposable masks. Access to
reusable respirators during a crisis prevents shortages, and they
are more cost-effective to stockpile due to their reusability and
their longer shelf lives. USDA is encouraged to supplement their
stocks of crisis PPE in the NVS with U.S. manufactured reusable
respirators. Furthermore, the Committee emphasizes the critical
need to protect agricultural workers, especially veterinarians, who
are at increased risk of exposure to HPAI, as recent studies have
shown evidence of asymptomatic infections among veterinary pro-
fessionals.

Scrapie Eradication Program.—The Committee maintains fund-
ing at the 2025 level for the National Scrapie Eradication Program.
Southern Pine Bark Beetle.—The worsening outbreak of the
Southern Pine Bark Beetle has substantially impacted pine ecology
and timber production across the U.S. The Committee encourages
APHIS to partner with the U.S. Forest Service to support efforts
to combat this pest.
Spotted Lanternfly.—The Committee remains concerned about
the recent Spotted Lanternfly outbreak and provides an increase of
$500,000 to support efforts to combat this pest. The Committee re-
quests that APHIS keeps it apprised of the program’s strategy and
progress.
Sulfuryl Fluoride.—The Committee encourages APHIS to con-
sider adding sulfuryl fluoride treatments for logs, wood products,
and solid wood packing material to its Treatment Manual to facili-
tate the export of U.S. forestry products and other goods and to
provide additional options for the protection of tree nut and stored
grain commodities.
Swine Health Improvement Program.—The Committee notes that
USDA announced in 2020 the establishment of a joint Federal,
State, and industry project to develop a certification program for
high-consequence swine diseases. Given the outbreak of African
Swine Fever in the Hispaniola region, the Committee recognizes
the importance of reassuring foreign trading partners of the status
of the American swine herd’s health and the measures the Amer-
ican swine industry has taken to prevent an introduction of African
swine fever and classical swine fever. The Committee provides an
increase of $1,000,000 to continue advancing the work of the Swine
Health Improvement Program.
Trespass Horses.—The Committee directs APHIS to coordinate
the establishment of a working group to address trespass horses on
Federal, State, and private lands in southwest Louisiana. The
working group should be compromised of all relevant Federal,
State, and local entities to collaborate and identify the best reloca-
tion and mitigation practices concerning trespass horses. The Com-
mittee directs the working group to provide a report within 180
days of enactment of this Act detailing plans to address trespass
horses for public safety and the welfare of the trespass horses.
West Nile Virus.—The Committee is concerned about the threats
to human and animal health posed by West Nile virus and other
infectious diseases and recognizes that a critical strategy for ad-
dressing these threats is necessary to prevent the infection and
transmission by known vectors, including farm-raised alligators.
Within funding provided, the Committee maintains fiscal year 2025
levels for APHIS to enter into cooperative agreements with the af-
fected States to further investigate West Nile virus and other infec-
tious diseases affecting farm-raised alligators and to develop treat-
ments and methods to prevent infection and transmission.
Wildlife Services.—The Committee is concerned with livestock
predation in areas with the highest populations of sheep and goats
and maintains fiscal year 2025 levels for improved predator man-
agement methods and tools in cooperation with partner agencies
serving these areas.
Wildlife Services Alternatives.—The Committee encourages
APHIS to consider minimizing or eliminating activities associated

with pest or predator control when non-governmental alternatives
that can provide similar levels of services are available.
Wildlife Services Cost Share.—The Committee is concerned about
the increasing inequitable Federal amount of cost share in coopera-
tive service agreements between APHIS–Wildlife Services and/or
political subdivisions of States responsible for Wildlife Service pro-
grams that protect agriculture, property, human life, and natural
resources. The Committee expects Wildlife Services to strive for an
equitable 50/50 cost share to the extent that funding is available
to do so.
Wildlife Services Education and Training.—The Committee is
aware of the wide range of hazardous procedures and materials uti-
lized by APHIS personnel in the conduct of daily duties. To ensure
a safe working environment, the Committee provides no less than
2025 levels to maintain a National Training Academy focused on
those areas of greatest concern such as pyrotechnics, firearms, haz-
ardous materials, immobilization and euthanasia drugs, pesticides,
animal care and handling, land vehicles, watercraft, and zoonotic
diseases.
Wood Imports.—The Committee recognizes the majority of U.S.
manufactured finished wood products require a combination of do-
mestically grown species with international species, the latter of
which cannot be grown in the U.S. APHIS, Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice, and Customs and Border Protection are jointly responsible for
overseeing processes with respect to the Lacey Act. The Committee
supports further coordination across the agencies with respect to
wood product imports and directs APHIS to provide a report within
180 days of enactment of this Act detailing USDA’s current role in
the wood importation declaration process and how it interacts with
other agencies to help expedite shipments that are delayed.
Zoological Disaster Response.—The Committee provides not less
than fiscal year 2025 levels of $450,000 within Emergency Pre-
paredness and Response for APHIS to support industry-led non-
profits that are comprised of a national network of zoological facili-
ties and assist zoos, aquariums, sanctuaries, and other exotic ani-
mal businesses respond to disasters. The disaster response efforts
may include but are not limited to: preparedness consultations, risk
assessments, evacuation and transportation of animals, veterinary
care, facility repairs, incident command and communications sup-
port, and other response and recovery efforts. The Committee notes
that these funds are in addition to, not a replacement of existing
agreements made with nonprofit organizations in previous fiscal
years for zoological disaster initiatives.

AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SERVICE
MARKETING SERVICES
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For Marketing Services of the Agricultural Marketing Service
(AMS), the Committee provides an appropriation of $190,250,000.
Cotton Classing.—The Committee encourages AMS to continue
working with producers to secure stability and dependability of the
cotton classification program to timely and accurately process nu-
merous samples of cotton bales with less reliance on seasonal staff
and less disruption of market opportunities.
Dried Fruit Standards.—The Committee recognizes the need for
updated dried fruit standards to meet the needs of current proc-
essors. The Committee encourages AMS to keep the Committee ap-
prised of efforts to update specifications for dried sweet cherries
and dried apples.
Dried Sweet Cherries.—The Committee encourages AMS to con-
sider purchases of dried sweet cherries, which will help reduce food
waste and provide a healthy snacking option to program partici-
pants.
Dry Edible Beans.—The Committee recognizes the nutritional
qualities of dry edible beans and encourages AMS to enhance the
amount and frequency of dry edible bean purchases.
Olive Oil Authenticity Testing Program.—The Committee directs
AMS to administer a testing program that will result in robust
data sets of authenticity parameters for domestically produced olive
oil to better understand the relation of various environments, soils,
varietals, growing regions, and the concerns around the purity pa-
rameters in standards and compliance of U.S. oils. The testing pro-
gram should include physio-chemical and organoleptic analysis of
domestically produced olive oil.
Packers & Stockyards.—The Committee is concerned by previous
efforts to expand the scope of its regulations to implement the
Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. The Committee holds that the
Department has previously misinterpreted Congressional intent
and mistaken its jurisdiction throughout the recent regulatory se-
ries. As such, the Secretary is prohibited from promulgating, imple-
menting, or enforcing any regulations under Sections 202(a) or
202(b) of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 which were first
published in the Federal Register after June 1, 2022. Further, the
Committee rebuts the agency’s assertions regarding harm to com-
petition and affirms it is the intent of Congress, in accordance with
the rulings of eight Federal circuit courts, that complainants must
demonstrate harm or likelihood of harm to competition in order to
establish a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.
Simplified Applications.—The Committee is aware that AMS im-
plemented a simplified, turnkey grant application in fiscal year
2023 for Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Grants, with
applications restricted to specific project types. The Committee en-
courages the agency to expand the turnkey application to include
other common activities, such as vendor and customer outreach ac-
tivities, farmers market manager staff time, regional food chain co-
ordination, and special purpose equipment.

Vegetable Promotion.—The Committee recognizes that specialty
crop vegetable growers and value-added processors are under sig-
nificant pressure from the effects of inflation and increasing im-
ports. The Committee encourages AMS to collaborate with local
partners to expand marketing opportunities for domestic specialty
crop vegetable growers by increasing promotion activities imme-
diately prior to and during harvest, including for asparagus har-
vested April to May, carrots harvested August to October, and cu-
cumbers harvested August to September. The Committee directs
AMS to report to the Committee on the status of these efforts with-
in 90 days of enactment of this Act.
Wild-Caught Catfish Purchases.—The Committee appreciates
AMS establishing a wild-caught catfish specification and con-
tinuing to work with wild-caught catfish processors to become ap-
proved providers. The Committee expects AMS to make purchases
of wild-caught catfish, including from approved processors in the
Chesapeake Bay area, in equal quantity to farm-raised catfish.
Wild Game Processing Technical Assistance.—The Committee
recognizes the important role of wild game processing in rural food
supply chains, especially in the business models of many small and
very small processors. The Committee encourages AMS to expand
the scope of the existing Meat and Poultry Processing Capacity—
Technical Assistance Program to include assistance for processors
interested in opening or expanding facilities that conduct custom-
exempt wild game processing.

Food Donations.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
food loss and waste reduction and encourages FSIS, in coordination
with the Food Loss and Waste Reduction Liaison, to consider up-
dates to food donation guidelines to clarify safety protocols for food
donations.
Good Commercial Practices.—The Committee recognizes that the
handling of birds at slaughter according to Good Commercial Prac-
tices improves quality and reduces the occurrence of adulterated
poultry products in the marketplace.
Humane Methods of Slaughter.—FSIS shall ensure that all in-
spection personnel conducting humane handling verification proce-
dures receive robust initial training and periodic refresher training
on the FSIS humane handling and slaughter regulations and direc-
tives. This includes handling of non-ambulatory disabled animals,
as well as proper use of the Humane Activities Tracking System to
ensure humane handling of animals as they arrive and are
offloaded and handled in ante-mortem holding pens, suspect pens,
chutes, stunning areas, and on the slaughter line. The Committee
directs the agency to continue preparation and online publication
of the Humane Handling Quarterly Reports, to include: (1) the
number of humane handling verification procedures performed, (2)
the number of administrative enforcement actions taken, (3) the
time spent on Humane Handling Activities Tracking System activi-
ties, and (4) comparisons of these measurements by plant size and
FSIS district.
Invasive Species.—The Committee encourages the FSIS to work
with other agencies and stakeholders to better market food offered
for sale that is the product of a wild caught, invasive species, such
as northern snakehead or blue catfish.
Salmonella.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
science-based regulations and urges USDA to ensure that any new
salmonella performance standard in poultry products be based on
sound scientific principles and risk assessment.
State Inspections.—The Committee is aware of concerns that in-
sufficient funding provided by FSIS to state meat and poultry in-
spection programs from within existing appropriations may result
in states withdrawing from this important program, leading to
FSIS having to provide full inspection to those state inspected proc-
essing facilities at 100 percent cost. The Committee continues to
encourage FSIS to aim for a reimbursement rate of 50 percent.

TITLE II
FARM PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FARM PRODUCTION AND
CONSERVATION
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Office of the Under Secretary for Farm Production and
Conservation (FPAC), the Committee provides an appropriation of
$1,527,000.
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA).—USDA
is responsible for monitoring foreign purchases of agricultural land
under AFIDA and for assessing penalties on entities that have
failed to make disclosures as required. The Committee is concerned
that USDA failed to assess penalties for a failure to disclose foreign
investments in American agricultural land. The Committee directs
the Secretary to report to the Committee within 90 days of enact-
ment of this Act on USDA’s efforts to ensure that foreign invest-
ments are being accurately disclosed, including an analysis of any
barriers USDA faces in conducting oversight of these purchases
and planned steps for overcoming these challenges.
Cover Crop Incentives.—The Committee recognizes that cover
crops show promise of potentially reducing indemnities for crop in-
surance in certain circumstances. The Committee encourages
USDA to conduct a study regarding crop insurance premium bene-
fits for cover crops using available cover crop data from RMA and
FSA, information collected as part of the Pandemic Cover Crop Pro-
grams, and data from state-level programs. The Committee re-
quests that USDA provide the study no later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act.
Crawfish Disaster Assistance.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of ensuring that disaster assistance programs are ac-
cessible for all sectors of the agriculture industry, including aqua-
culture. The Committee is aware of current policies at the Small
Business Administration (SBA) that exclude assistance for certain
crawfish producers who also engage in rice farming. The Com-
mittee encourages the Secretary to collaborate with the Adminis-
trator of the SBA, if requested, to evaluate and update SBA policies
related to disaster assistance programs to ensure that dual-crop
farmers who have experienced losses in their aquaculture oper-
ations are not excluded from disaster relief.
Migration Corridors.—The Committee recognizes that working
farms and ranches can provide important migratory habitat for big
game species and commends NRCS and FSA on their innovative
application of Grassland Conservation Reserve Program and Envi-
ronmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) in tandem.
Leveraging the unique payments, cost-share, and technical assist-
ance that these programs provide against one another—as is being
done through the USDA Migratory Big Game Initiative in Wyo-
ming—provides expanded support and management flexibility for
producers stewarding wildlife habitat while keeping lands in pro-
duction. NRCS and FSA are encouraged to cooperate in expanding
this innovative model to other states.

Property Damage.—The Committee encourages the Secretary to
follow up on the report, as required in House Report 118–124, on
how USDA may reimburse landowners along the U.S. southern
border for property damages related to trespassing and expedi-
tiously implement a process for property damage reimbursements.
Service Center.—The Committee urges USDA to consider reestab-
lishing a USDA Service Center in Weld County, Colorado to ensure
resources are accessible for farmers and ranchers.
FARM PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION BUSINESS CENTER
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, the
Committee provides an appropriation of $210,000,000. This amount
includes an increase of $1,000,000 for design of a new data system
to comply with AFIDA, as specified by Sec. 773 of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2023.

Farmers.gov.—The Committee directs USDA to continue to drive
implementation and expansion of the Farmers.gov application, a
single portal built around the needs of farmers, to enable USDA
employees and USDA customers and producers to view their infor-
mation, complete transactions, quickly review the status of and
submit applications for FPAC programs, and receive program pay-
ments for all USDA farm programs including, but not limited to,
loans, conservation, disaster, dairy, or other programs. All farm
programs which require direct application from the farmer, ranch-
er, or producer should be considered for expansion of the Farm-
ers.gov application and functions.
Mexican Wolves Depredations.—The Committee supports compen-
sating livestock producers for animals killed by the experimental
population of Mexican wolves released by the Federal government
in Arizona and New Mexico. The Committee directs USDA to revise

compensation to producers for both confirmed and probable wolf at-
tacks on livestock.
PFAS.—The Committee is aware that PFAS contamination can
cause significant financial distress for farmers and encourages FSA
to provide the maximum flexibility possible to impacted borrowers
as appropriate.
Staffing.—The Committee is concerned about FSA’s ability to at-
tract and retain field staff to do FSA’s critical work in rural com-
munities. The Committee is also concerned that local FSA offices
are often tasked with implementing new programs with little no-
tice. The Committee directs the Secretary to report on a plan to ad-
dress retention and communication between FSA offices and the
national office. Additionally, the Committee encourages FSA to fac-
tor in administration of disaster assistance programming when
contemplating additional staffing resources needed to successfully
carry out its mission.
STATE MEDIATION GRANTS
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For State Mediation Grants, the Committee provides an appro-
priation of $6,500,000.
GRASSROOTS SOURCE WATER PROTECTION PROGRAM
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program, the Com-
mittee provides an appropriation of $8,000,000.
DAIRY INDEMNITY PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Dairy Indemnity Program (DIPP), the Committee pro-
vides an appropriation of such sums as may be necessary (esti-
mated to be $500,000).
PFAS chemicals.—The Committee is aware that some dairy
farms are unable to sell their milk because of contamination from
a family of synthetic chemicals, collectively known as ‘‘PFAS’’
chemicals. The Committee notes that USDA updated the DIPP to
provide additional options to dairy producers impacted by PFAS
contamination and looks forward to continuing to work with USDA,
other State and Federal partners, and producers to mitigate the
impacts of PFAS.

SALARIES AND EXPENSES
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Risk Management Agency (RMA), the Committee pro-
vides an appropriation of $60,000,000.
Administrative and Operating (A&O) Expenses.—The Committee
notes that the explanatory statement accompanying the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2023 encourages RMA to provide an an-
nual inflation adjustment to A&O expenses and to provide equi-
table relief for specialty crop policies, recognizing RMA’s authority
to do so without a renegotiation of the Standard Reinsurance
Agreement (SRA) in a manner similar to a previous inflation ad-
justment. The Committee notes that inflation adjustments are not
mentioned in the SRA. Instead, an RMA Manager’s Bulletin from
June 30, 2010 (MGR–10–007) provided for the adjustments. For

each year, RMA published an Informational Memorandum an-
nouncing the adjustment for that year (see, for example, ‘‘Federal
Crop Insurance: Delivery Subsidies in Brief’’, CRS, August 20,
2018). Given the adjustments then were initiated outside the SRA,
the Committee urges RMA to initiate the adjustments going for-
ward in the same manner. In doing so, RMA may provide adjust-
ments without renegotiation of the SRA and without violating 7
U.S.C. 1508(k)(8).
Alfalfa.—The Committee recognizes alfalfa to be an important
domestic forage crop valued for nitrogen fixation, soil conservation,
crop rotation, and as a natural habitat. From 2002 through 2024,
alfalfa acreage has declined 30 percent. The Committee encourages
RMA to explore the creation of a revenue and/or quality alfalfa crop
insurance policy to ensure producers have a safety net that they
need to produce this important crop.
Cover Crops.—The Committee remains interested in USDA’s ef-
forts to streamline opportunities for farmers to insure primary and
secondary crops with revenue streams resulting from biofuel use,
with particular reference to carinata, pennycress, camelina, and
other oilseeds. The Committee expects USDA to provide a briefing
within 120 days of enactment of this Act on the Department’s
progress on this effort.
Quality Losses.—The Committee urges RMA to evaluate and con-
sider additional products that will permit producers to better pro-
tect themselves from losses directly and indirectly attributed to
quality losses.
NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE
CONSERVATION OPERATIONS
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conserva-
tion Operations, the Committee provides an appropriation of
$850,000,000.
The Committee provides $14,000,000 for the Snow Survey and
Water Forecasting Program; $10,000,000 for the Plant Materials
Centers; $86,000,000 for the Soil Surveys Program; and
$701,375,000 for Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), which
includes $1,000,000 for Phragmite control.
Agricultural Open Burning Alternatives.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of EQIP, which provides Federal funding and
technical assistance to farmers throughout the Nation. The Com-
mittee urges USDA to prioritize EQIP awards to projects that en-
able the purchase of equipment to process agricultural woody waste
generated from orchard and vineyard removals as an alternative to
open burning.
Alfalfa Utilization.—The Committee encourages NRCS to
incentivize the use and integration of alfalfa in NRCS programs to
capitalize on the unique conservation benefits it brings to the agri-
cultural landscape.
Chesapeake Bay States’ Partnership Initiative.—The Committee
recognizes the important role of voluntary conservation practices in
protecting and restoring waterways, especially when deployed at
scale. To enhance the resiliency of farmland and reduce nutrient

and sediment pollution in line with the most recent Chesapeake
Bay Watershed Agreement, USDA created the Chesapeake Bay
States’ Partnership Initiative. The Committee supports this Initia-
tive and directs USDA to leverage additional conservation re-
sources for agricultural producers in the Chesapeake Bay water-
shed to support the implementation of the Chesapeake Bay juris-
dictions’ watershed implementation plans. The Committee also
urges USDA to target additional CTA funds in the most effective
basin areas of the watershed and to prioritize conservation prac-
tices that build on-farm.
Code 590.—The Committee recognizes the importance of updat-
ing the Conservation Practice Standard for Nutrient Management
(Code 590), which is essential for advancing sustainable agriculture
by improving nutrient management efficiency and reducing envi-
ronmental impacts across diverse farming systems. Scenario #27
under Practice Standard 441 effectively outlines the requirements
for applying manure through dripline systems and has led to the
creation of the ‘‘SDI, Manure’’ cost-share programs in California,
Oregon, and Washington under EQIP. However, Scenario #27 does
not directly apply to other regional agricultural systems, and the
Irrigation History Requirement, which mandates that farmers dem-
onstrate an irrigation history for 2 out of the past 5 years to qual-
ify for EQIP funding for irrigation systems, is a significant barrier
to entry and inadvertently incentivizes dryland farmers to tempo-
rarily adopt inefficient irrigation practices to become eligible for
modernization funds. The Committee directs USDA to expand the
applicability of SDI systems for manure and nutrient management
beyond existing geographic and operational confines and to qualify
SDI systems under Code 590.
Conservation Innovation Grants.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of NRCS’s Conservation Innovation Grant program
(CIG) and its positive impact on rural communities to enhance the
development of new tools, approaches, and technologies for resource
conservation on private lands. The Committee encourages NRCS to
expand CIG grant opportunities to strengthen rural agriculture
communities and improve agricultural operations.
Conservation Programs Timeline.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of NRCS’s conservation programs and their positive im-
pact on water and soil quality. The Committee also recognizes that
these programs must consist of realistic timelines and outcomes as
identified by the farmers using them. The Committee encourages
NRCS to review all conservation programs to ensure their funding
timelines related to conservation planning and program delivery
meet legislatively mandated timelines to support farmers in devel-
oping their practices and fulfilling the mission of the programs.
The Committee directs NRCS to report back on its findings and ef-
forts to improve program funding timelines within 180 days of en-
actment of this Act.
Conservation Technical Assistance.—The Secretary, shall,
through the Chief of NRCS, prioritize the development of CTA
agreements with qualified partners who can help deliver conserva-
tion funding to durable on-farm projects that maximize water
quantity and water quality benefits in a cost-effective manner,
while also helping to address regional resource concerns. Such
partners shall support NRCS by using advanced technology to iden-

tify priority projects and streamline processes, secure leveraged
funding, and more cost-effectively and rapidly complete technical
assistance steps so that more EQIP, CSP, and RCPP financial as-
sistance funds are delivered to producers. NRCS shall provide a re-
port within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the results of these
CTA agreements.
Critical Conservation Areas (CCAs).—The Committee supports
CCAs and the collaborative regional approach to address common
natural resource goals while maintaining or improving agricultural
productivity. The Committee encourages NRCS to provide addi-
tional CTA funds to CCAs to address conservation planning back-
logs.
Drought-Prone Western States.—The Committee supports pro-
grams and policies which support production and crop yield in
strong agriculture communities impacted by drought issues, espe-
cially those in Western States which are particularly prone to
drought and wildfires. The Committee encourages NRCS, in con-
junction with State agricultural agencies and local water conserva-
tion districts, to promote and provide assistance to farmers in
drought-prone areas in Western States, including opportunities for
water infrastructure updates and access to innovative water-saving
technologies.
Firebreaks and Fuel Breaks.—The Committee recognizes that
firebreaks and fuel breaks are efficient conservation measures that
can be implemented by landowners to reduce the risk or intensity
of wildfires and help firefighters by creating defensible areas. The
Committee continues to encourage NRCS to promote and provide
assistance to design and construct firebreaks and fuel breaks in
areas and communities under heightened risk of woodland fires,
consistent with the directive in P.L. 117–328.
Invasive Pest Mitigation.—The Committee encourages NRCS to
include financial and technical support for orchard removal
through EQIP in cases where invasive pests threaten the sustain-
ability of production. The Committee also encourages NRCS to col-
laborate with State agricultural agencies, research institutions, and
industry stakeholders to develop best practices for orchard removal
as a pest management strategy and to ensure replanting practices
that enhance long-term orchard health and productivity.
Microbial Soil Amendments.—The Committee recognizes that re-
search and data show that biodiverse microbial soil amendments
have a positive impact on soil health. The Committee encourages
USDA to support the expanded use of these biologic soil health so-
lutions across a broad range of programs, including EQIP, to ad-
dress soil health benefits related to yield increase, advanced root
development, input efficiency, improved water efficacy, catastrophic
soil damage restoration, and catalysts to other soil health practices
such as reduced tillage.
Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI).—
The Committee affirms the importance of the MRBI as a coopera-
tive program working with farmers, landowners, and producers in
watersheds which drain into the Gulf of America and supports its
continued funding. The MRBI is a key component of the Gulf of
America Hypoxia Action Plan, utilizing Farm Bill conservation pro-
grams that allow land to remain in production as nutrient runoff

is reduced, improving water quality in the Mississippi and Ohio
River Basins as well as downstream in the Gulf.
NRCS Snow Survey and Water Forecasting Modernization.—The
Committee is concerned that NRCS’ Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL)
network has not been modernized to take advantage of sensor tech-
nology innovation, such as airborne radar and lidar and modern
data analysis tools, limiting its utility to water managers and fore-
casters. The Committee directs NRCS to partner with a public re-
search university that has an existing partnership with NRCS to
modernize the SNOTEL network by combining ground observations
with airborne snow surveys, satellite measurements, and modeling
to produce spatial maps of snow properties.
PFAS Soil Testing.—The Committee understands that soil test-
ing for PFAS can be prohibitively expensive and encourages NRCS
to utilize existing conservation practice standards for soil testing to
assist producers in managing these costs.
Phragmites.—The Committee is concerned about the damage
caused by phragmites in the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee pro-
vides $1,000,000 for phragmite control and directs NRCS to work
with relevant State agencies to provide funding and technical as-
sistance to control phragmites in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
Resource Conservation and Development Councils (RC&Ds).—The
Committee recognizes that RC&Ds have been valuable partners in
conservation and encourages NRCS to continue working with local
councils, as appropriate, to ensure conservation programs meet
local resource needs.
Sage Grouse Initiative.—The Committee strongly supports
NRCS’s ongoing sage grouse conservation efforts. Through this ini-
tiative, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to help
landowners conserve sage grouse habitat on their land. The initia-
tive is an integral part of efforts by Federal agencies, western
States, and private landowners to help preclude the listing of the
sage grouse as an endangered species.
Sentinel Landscapes.—The Committee affirms the importance of
the Sentinel Landscapes Partnership in strengthening military
readiness and supporting the long-term viability of agriculture and
working lands near defense installations. By coordinating across
DoD, USDA, and the Department of the Interior, the partnership
helps prevent encroachment and other incompatible development
that can limit military training and testing activities while ena-
bling private landowners to maintain productive farming, ranching,
and forestry operations.
Soil Carbon Research and Monitoring.—The Committee directs
NRCS, in collaboration with experts, to conduct a systematic re-
view of existing USDA and Federal soil carbon monitoring meth-
odologies in order to develop a standardized soil carbon monitoring
methodology that is reflective of current best practices and ensures
the scientific rigor necessary to accurately measure and monitor
soil carbon stocks and fluctuations over time and across regions,
soil types, and various production systems. The Committee encour-
ages USDA to utilize the standardized methodology developed from
this review to ensure that the Soil Carbon Monitoring Network is
grounded in shared data measurements and standards to enable
large-scale data analysis and insights. Improved measurements

and best practices should be incorporated into NRCS technical as-
sistance to producers to the maximum extent practicable.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee supports further
investments regarding the positive impacts and benefits of virtual
fencing compared to traditional fencing on grazing lands. The Com-
mittee directs NRCS to compile available data and submit a report
within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the positive impacts of
precision agriculture grazing technologies, including virtual fenc-
ing, to improve soil health, grazing outcomes, and profitability.
Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program (VPA–
HIP).—The Committee recognizes the important role of VPA–HIP
in creating and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat and addressing
a major barrier to hunting and fishing participation: lack of access
to quality places to hunt and fish, including lakes, streams, wet-
lands, grasslands, forests, and agricultural land. This locally led,
voluntary framework to incentivize willing private landowners to
allow access for recreation stimulates rural economies by increas-
ing hunting and fishing participation and enhances outdoor rec-
reational opportunities nationwide. The Committee encourages
NRCS to expedite the distribution of any funds allocated to this
program and to support program continuity by issuing five-year
grant awards.
Water Quality Data.—The Committee supports the Department’s
creation of the National Water Quality Initiative and regional wa-
tershed initiatives for the Mississippi River and Chesapeake Bay.
To promote transparency and understanding of the water quality
benefits of voluntary conservation practices, the Committee urges
USDA to utilize data collection to publish an annual report on the
nutrient and sediment reductions achieved through conservation
programs in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, similar to the Depart-
ment’s annual progress report on the MRBI.
White Oak Initiative.—White oak forests are critical for wildlife,
biodiversity, and forest products, and without swift action by pri-
vate landowners and land management agencies, there will be a
significant decline of white oak forests in the future. The Com-
mittee commends NRCS for its work to encourage white oak con-
servation and promote white oak reforestation practices and en-
courages NRCS to expand and coordinate these efforts across its
programs with the U.S. Forest Service.
WATERSHED AND FLOOD PREVENTION OPERATIONS
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO),
the Committee provides an appropriation of $35,000,000.
The Committee notes that WFPO received $500,000,000 in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117–58) and has sig-
nificant unobligated balances available.
Watershed Backlogs.—The Committee remains concerned about
delays with some WFPO projects and the impact such delays have
on local communities. The Committee urges NRCS to balance the
needs of addressing the project backlog, remediation of existing
structures, and new projects by prioritizing those projects which
mitigate the greatest flood risks to public safety, consistent with
the directive in P.L. 117–328.

Watershed Infrastructure.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of water infrastructure to agricultural economies, Tribal
water rights, municipal water supplies, and environmental sustain-
ability. The Committee encourages NRCS to provide dedicated
funding for water infrastructure systems such as drop structures to
ensure water availability for rural agricultural communities and
Tribal nations.
WATERSHED REHABILITATION PROGRAM
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, the Committee pro-
vides an appropriation of $7,000,000.
The Committee notes that the Watershed Rehabilitation Program
received $118,000,000 in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (P.L. 117–58) and has significant unobligated balances avail-
able.
High-Hazard Dams.—The Committee recognizes the large back-
log of community infrastructure projects eligible for financial and
technical assistance through the Watershed Rehabilitation Pro-
gram to address safety concerns, public health, and environmental
impacts of aging dams. The Committee urges NRCS to prioritize
the rehabilitation of dams that pose the greatest risk to public safe-
ty.

TITLE III
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Office of the Under Secretary for Rural Development
(RD), the Committee provides an appropriation of $1,620,000.
Coastal Infrastructure.—The Committee recognizes that severe
weather, coastal erosion, and tsunami risk pose significant threats
to coastal Tribes’ essential infrastructure. The Committee encour-
ages RD to work across all mission areas and offices to optimize
opportunities that provide technical and financial assistance to dis-
tressed rural and Tribal communities to support infrastructure re-
silience activities and protect rural economies from environmental
and natural disaster risk and vulnerabilities.
Construction Management.—The Committee intends to provide
local governments and local utilities with the necessary tools to
maximize federal investments and encourages USDA to allow local
governments and units of local governments to utilize Construction
Management services in addition to traditional design-build serv-
ices within all USDA-funded construction and infrastructure
projects. Construction Management services provide a level of ex-
pertise and experience that many rural communities and govern-
mental units lack and can ensure a more efficient and cost-effective
project execution during the construction process.
Persistent Poverty Areas.—The Committee supports targeted in-
vestments in impoverished areas. The Committee urges USDA to
implement measures to increase the share of investments in per-
sistent poverty counties, distressed communities, and any other im-
poverished areas. The Committee directs USDA to define perform-
ance measures, increase capacity to collect and analyze data, evalu-
ate data sets, and develop a report to the Committee on how in-
vestments in persistently poor communities have improved eco-
nomic outcomes.
Rural Business Investment Program.—The Committee recognizes
the implementation of the Rural Business Investment Program
(RBIP) and the RBIP Operational Assistance Grants for leveraged
Rural Business Investment Companies did not meet the desired
outcomes. The Committee requests the Department report to the
Committee within 270 days of enactment of this Act an analysis
identifying why the programs did not succeed and the potential for
other avenues of similarly leveraged funds for rural businesses.
Streamlining Applications.—The Committee recognizes GAO Re-
port 21–579, which found that HUD, EDA, and USDA have similar
requirements for stakeholder engagement, strategic planning, and
application requirements for State and local organizations applying
for economic development programs. Per the report, while HUD
and EDA have a written agreement to align requirements and
issue joint guidance to streamline the application process, USDA
does not have such a report. The Committee urges USDA to work
with EDA and HUD to evaluate economic development programs
and, where feasible, enter into such an interagency agreement. The

Committee looks forward to reviewing the report requested in
House Report 118–124.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).—The Committee notes that
SAF has the potential to decarbonize the aviation industry by uti-
lizing several feedstocks such as ethanol, soy, tallow, wood bio-
mass, agricultural residue, and cover crops. The cultivation of these
feedstocks could provide a significant economic opportunity in rural
communities across the nation. While there is significant demand
by global air carriers, the Committee believes more volume is need-
ed to produce 3 billion gallons by 2030. The USDA 9003 Program
has significant potential to scale up the volume of SAF by pro-
viding loans and financial support to burgeoning enterprises in
rural America. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a
report that includes 9003 program loan metrics and alternative ac-
tions that could accelerate and scale SAF Research and Develop-
ment and biorefinery construction.
Uninhabited Properties.—The Committee recognizes the demand
for affordable rural housing and is concerned about Federal fund-
ing supporting uninhabited properties. The Committee directs the
agency to provide a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act
outlining how many RD housing properties are uninhabited and in
foreclosure or real estate owned (REO), the number of foreclosure
sales that have taken place within the previous three fiscal years,
and the amount spent on taxes, mortgage, and insurance for
uninhabited properties in foreclosure or REO.

Farm Labor Housing.—The Committee urges the Secretary to
better utilize available data on demand for the Farm Labor Hous-
ing program such as systematically reviewing local areas, further
analyzing occupancy data on a statewide, regional, or national
level, and collecting application information so that available fund-
ing is directed to areas of greatest need. The Committee also en-
courages the USDA, in collaboration with other relevant Federal
agencies, including the Department of Labor, to analyze data re-
lated to the different agricultural industries on the different hous-
ing types appropriate to accommodate the housing needs of perma-
nent or seasonal farmworkers.
Rural Housing Preservation.—The Committee appreciates RD ef-
forts to ensure Section 515 and Section 514 properties with matur-
ing mortgages or owners pre-paying their mortgage remain afford-
able. The Committee encourages RD to take additional steps to
streamline the approach to housing preservation and affordability,
including working closely with nonprofits and local housing author-
ity buyers committed to preservation and affordability. The Com-
mittee recognizes the urgent need to preserve rural affordable
housing units. To assist the facilitation of transfers, the Committee
encourages USDA to prioritize no more than fifty percent of Section
515 and Section 514 funds for use by public bodies or nonprofit or-
ganizations or their affiliates (any limited partnership in which the
general partner is a nonprofit entity with a principal purpose of
providing affordable housing) to acquire and rehabilitate properties
financed under sections 514 and 515 to retain long-term use by eli-
gible households.

RURAL BUSINESS—COOPERATIVE SERVICE
RURAL BUSINESS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Rural Business Program Account, the Committee pro-
vides an appropriation of $57,200,000. The following programs are
included in the bill for the Rural Business Program account:
$4,000,000 for Federally Recognized Native American Tribes, of
which $250,000 is for transportation technical assistance.
The Committee provides resources to operate programs under the
Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS). RBS programs com-
plement lending activities of the private sector by promoting eco-
nomic prosperity in rural communities through improved access to
capital and economic development on a regional scale.
Arts in Rural Communities.—The Committee recognizes the val-
uable role of the arts in the economic and community development
of rural communities across the country. In providing grants and
assistance under this title, RD shall continue to support individ-
uals, nonprofits, and small businesses in the arts through these
traditional economic development tools, including business incuba-
tors, and economic development planning and technical assistance.
Categorical Exclusions.—The Committee acknowledges that the
Fiscal Responsibility Act provided certain flexibilities designed to
speed up the loan delivery process. The Committee urges USDA to
review its current approach and consider that certain projects or
loans are not subject to Section 106 review. Adopting these flexi-
bilities, as other Federal agencies have, may assist in eliminating
delays, undue burdens and costs on applicants.
Infant Formula.—The Committee remains concerned about in-
fant formula shortages and supply chain fragility for sole source
nutrition for babies. The Committee encourages USDA to ensure
that small infant formula manufacturers in rural areas are aware
of their eligibility for the Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Pro-
gram and the Food Supply Chain Expansion Loan Program. This
inclusion will help prevent future infant formula shortages by sup-
porting the diversification of U.S.-based infant formula manufac-
turers and helping bolster domestic production capabilities.
Catfish Processing Grants.—The Committee directs USDA to ex-
pedite the implementation of the grants to processors of invasive,
wild-caught catfish as established in Section 755 of P.L. 118–42, as
well as Section 753 of this Act. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to prioritize facilities in the Chesapeake Bay area to help
mitigate the ecological damage being done by invasive blue catfish.
State Technology Councils.—The Committee is concerned about
the lack of private sector-driven rural economic development in
many regions. The Committee appreciates the value of State tech-
nology councils in promoting business development in rural areas,
including diversifying into the bio-sciences and technology industry.

and microloans to rural owner-operated small businesses and aspir-
ing entrepreneurs.
RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Rural Energy for America Program, the Committee pro-
vides a loan authorization level of $50,000,000 to make loans as au-
thorized by section 9007 of the Farm Security and Rural Invest-
ment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8107) to farmers, ranchers, and rural
small businesses to assist with purchasing renewable energy sys-
tems and making energy efficiency improvements.
REAP Applications.—The Committee understands REAP appli-
cants are supporting renewable energy projects in buildings that
previously did not require insulation because prior operations gen-
erated sufficient heat, such as former mills. REAP applications cur-
rently require applicants to compare heating bills to demonstrate
energy improvements have decreased bills. The Committee encour-
ages the agency to examine any changes to consider or support
these projects.

Distance Learning and Telemedicine:
Grants ..................................................................................................................................... 30,157
Total, Loan Subsidy and Grants .................................................................................... $135,907
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Pro-
gram, the Committee provides an appropriation of $135,907,000.
The Committee commends USDA for providing in its most recent
NOFO that funding should not be used in areas that are already
largely served and should be focused in areas where at least 90%
of households lack access. The Committee encourages USDA to con-
tinue to use the FCC’s National Broadband Map as part of the
process of identifying unserved and underserved areas. It is critical
that USDA avoid efforts that could duplicate existing or planned
broadband networks, including avoiding granting funding in areas
where another provider already has received funding from another
Federal, State or local program to build, has otherwise committed
to a government entity to build, or has invested private risk capital
to build in an area, even if construction has not yet commenced.
To avoid waste, funding should be given only to applicants that
can and will follow through with their commitments, by prioritizing
applicants that have demonstrated the technical and financial ex-
perience required to construct and operate broadband networks.
To incentivize participation, applications should be as stream-
lined as possible, including allowing all providers to offer proof of
financial capability through bond ratings instead of submitting fi-
nancial documentation, and to offer collateral for loans as well as
security for performance under grants using alternate forms of se-
curity instead of providing irrevocable letters of credit and a first
lien on assets. Applications should only require the data strictly
necessary to evaluate the application, and post-award burdens
should be minimized.
Audit Requirements.—The Committee urges USDA to consider
ReConnect awardees that are a publicly traded company and sub-
ject to the audit standards of the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board, accepting the financial statements audited in accord-
ance with those standards in lieu of the requirements in 7 CFR
1773.
Broadband and Tribal Colleges and Universities.—The Com-
mittee encourages the Secretary to explore opportunities to expand
broadband for 1994 Institutions (as defined in Sec. 532 of the Eq-
uity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301
note) under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et
seq.)). Stronger efforts are needed to support expansion and main-
tenance of broadband connectivity, including, but not limited to,
equipment costs, maintenance of broadband systems, broadband in-

frastructure expansion, and ongoing broadband operations ex-
penses directly related to 1994 Institutions broadband systems.
Evolving Broadband Technologies.—The Committee recognizes
the evolving landscape in broadband deployment technology, in-
cluding minimally disruptive, surface-level installation technologies
that may be effective in getting service to hard-to-reach areas. The
Committee urges USDA to engage with relevant stakeholders and
consider all broadband installation technologies in program imple-
mentation.
Indian Country Broadband.—The Committee urges USDA to re-
sponsibly and efficiently take action to address broadband defi-
ciencies through increased access and investments for broadband
on rural Tribal lands.
ReConnect.—The Committee provides an additional $90,000,000
for the ReConnect program to increase access to broadband
connectivity in unserved and underserved rural communities, tar-
geting areas of the country with the largest broadband coverage
gaps, including those with mountainous terrain.
ReConnect Coordination.—The Committee recognizes certain bur-
dens facing small telecommunication providers in rural America
that seek financial assistance through the ReConnect program.
Rural broadband providers are community institutions that are
leading the way to close the digital divide. Government assistance
programs should not further complicate these small companies
with costly applications and confusing regulatory compliance re-
quirements. The Committee urges continued partnerships with
other Federal agencies to review various Federal broadband pro-
gram requirements in efforts to better understand program nu-
ances and promote harmonization of Federal broadband application
processes.
ReConnect Scoring Criteria.—The ReConnect program shall es-
tablish a scoring criterion that prioritizes serving the hardest to
reach, unserved, and underserved rural communities and shall not
provide a scoring disadvantage based specifically upon the form of
organization or commercial status of a broadband service provider.
ReConnect Service Areas.—RUS Telecommunications Program
funds should not be awarded in any areas, study areas or census
blocks where a recipient of FCC High-Cost USF support is already
subject to a buildout obligation of 25/3 Mbps or greater for fixed
terrestrial broadband, except that RUS Telecommunication Pro-
gram funds may be awarded in such areas to help finance construc-
tion of the network. This shall not apply in cases where the FCC
has not provided for final approval of an award of such funds.
Speed Standards.—The Committee supports FCC’s recent action
to increase its benchmark for high-speed broadband service from
25/3 megabits per second (Mbps) to 100/20 Mbps. This update rec-
ognizes that consumer bandwidth needs are growing and sets a
standard that reflects household usage today. The Committee urges
USDA to consider areas lacking access to internet service of 100/
20 Mbps in fiscal year 2026, to provide consistency across federal
programs and ensure that all rural consumers are receiving access
to high-speed internet services.

TITLE IV
DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOOD, NUTRITION, AND
CONSUMER SERVICES
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and
Consumer Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of
$1,127,000.
The Committee is aware of USDA’s work to improve customer
service through language access and to ensure applications are
available in multiple languages and requests an update on such ac-
tivities.
Local Food Purchases.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of strengthening local and regional food systems to enhance
food security, support producers, and stimulate rural economies.
The Committee directs USDA to work in coordination with State
agencies, Territories, Tribes, and Child Nutrition Program institu-
tions, and emergency food providers, including food banks and pan-
tries, to facilitate the use of federal nutrition and food assistance
funds—including funds under Child Nutrition Programs—for the
direct purchase of food from local and regional producers. The Com-
mittee also directs FNS and AMS to work with DoD when engaged
with a program to review current practices to identify opportunities
that increase local food purchases through the Fresh Fruit and
Vegetable Program, USDA Foods, and DOD Fresh. The Committee
encourages USDA to provide technical assistance and streamline
administrative requirements to ensure that institutions and pro-
viders can easily identify and procure from local producers. The
Committee further directs USDA to report within 180 days of en-
actment of this Act on barriers to local procurement and rec-
ommendations to enhance access to locally grown foods across all
nutrition assistance programs, including The Emergency Food As-
sistance Program (TEFAP), the Food Distribution Program on In-
dian Reservations (FDPIR), and the Commodity Supplemental
Food Program (CSFP).
Public Release of Information.—The Committee directs FNS to
continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program,
including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance,
and questions and answers, available to the public within one week
of their release to WIC State administrators.
FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides an appro-
priation of $35,784,402,000.
Farm to School.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
training the next generation of farmers and agricultural profes-
sionals and encourages FNS to prioritize hands-on opportunities

under the Farm to School Program to promote agricultural edu-
cation and career pathways for younger generations. The Com-
mittee encourages FNS to provide a report on the outcomes of
Farm to School grants over the past five years.
Local School Wellness Policies.—Any difficulty in having access
to healthy food amongst youth can cause significant issues, includ-
ing poor physical health and eating disorders. The Committee re-
quests a report within 120 days of the enactment of this Act on
FNS’ progress to work with and inform State Education Agencies
that obesity and eating disorder information can be included in
local school wellness policies.
Non-Congregate Meals.—The Committee supports providing daily
school meals to students whether they attend school in-person or
virtually. The Committee is concerned that access to such meals is
not available to all income-eligible students and encourages FNS to
explore innovative solutions to reach all income-eligible students,
specifically those that utilize virtual learning options.
Pulse Crops.—The Committee encourages FNS to evaluate the
acceptability and availability of pulse crops in the National School
Lunch Program.
Seafood in the National School Lunch Program.—USDA is di-
rected to submit to the Committee, within 120 days of enactment
of this Act, the plan to address factors limiting seafood consump-
tion in schools developed in response to the GAO report ‘‘National
School Lunch Program: USDA Could Enhance Assistance to States
and Schools in Providing Seafood to Students’’ [GAO–23–105179].
Summer Food Service Program.—The Committee supports FNS
allowing State agencies to use non-congregate meal programs
where necessary and encourages USDA to provide technical assist-
ance funding for States to implement meal delivery options for chil-
dren in rural areas. The funding should be prioritized for States in-
terested in partnering with a nonprofit entity that has experience
in implementing meal delivery options in rural areas and to uphold
program integrity as required.
Team Nutrition.—The Committee supports the nutritional health
of school children and recognizes the need for additional support
for schools to meet certain nutrition standards for school meals,
particularly for sodium and whole grains. The Committee encour-
ages FNS to help schools meet these targets and directs FNS to re-
port on the use of funds to assist schools.

SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS,
AND CHILDREN (WIC)
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, In-
fants, and Children (WIC), the Committee provides an appropria-
tion of $7,697,000,000.
The Committee recognizes that birth rates remain at an all-time
low according to the CDC and that the Secretary has a WIC contin-
gency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand and
sufficient carryover balances. The Committee will continue to mon-
itor WIC participation, carryover funds, and food costs, and take
additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in
fiscal year 2026 remains sufficient to serve all eligible participants.
Breastfeeding Services.—The Committee remains interested in
how to improve breastfeeding rates through consistent, collabo-
rative, and high-quality breastfeeding services and supplies. Re-
ports that some WIC agencies only make breast pumps and related
supplies available to WIC participants who meet certain criteria
are concerning and seem to be in opposition to the goals of encour-
aging breastfeeding. FNS is directed to provide a report within 120
days of enactment of this Act detailing any conditions considered
or requirements imposed by WIC agencies when determining
whether a WIC participant who intends to fully breastfeed her in-
fant may access breastfeeding supplies and services. The report
should also identify any waivers active or granted in the last five
years allowing any state agency to spend less than required by
WIC program regulations on breastfeeding promotion and support
activities.
Milk Allowance in the WIC Food Package.—The Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans (DGA) have identified dairy products as nutri-
ent-dense while also noting that a high percentage of the U.S. pop-
ulation, including WIC’s at-risk population, are not consuming the
recommended level of dairy. The Committee remains concerned
about the reduction of the maximum monthly allowance with re-
spect to milk in the final rule, and bill language is included to con-
tinue the previous recommended levels of dairy in the WIC pro-
gram.
Yogurt Fortification.—The Committee recognizes that the final
rule entitled ‘‘WIC: Revisions in the WIC Food Packages’’ is requir-
ing vitamin D fortification of yogurt to address shortfalls. The Com-
mittee understands that a majority of yogurts in the marketplace
do not contain vitamin D fortification and that manufacturers re-
quire additional time to reformulate and relabel products to meet
such requirements. No later than 180 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall extend the compliance date in
the final rule requiring vitamin D fortification of yogurts for an ad-
ditional 36 months.

Zika Outreach and Education.—The Committee encourages
USDA to continue its education and outreach efforts through the
WIC program to provide pregnant women with the information

SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the
Committee provides $118,141,341,000. The total amount includes
$3,000,000,000 for a contingency reserve to be used only in the
event and in the amount necessary.
This amount fully funds SNAP benefits, Nutrition Assistance for
Puerto Rico (NAP), American Samoa, Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands, FDPIR, the cost share for State administra-
tive expenses, the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention
Grant Program, Employment and Training, and TEFAP Commod-
ities. The Committee is aware that Congress is considering changes
to SNAP and will include any program changes that become law.
The Committee is aware that the Basic Allowance for Housing
that members of the military receive is not excluded as income
when calculating eligibility for SNAP and awaits the report on the
effect of this policy.
Data Transparency.—The Committee applauds FNS for requiring
states to share SNAP benefit records with the Federal government.
These actions are in response to Executive Order 14243, which re-
quires the Secretary to ‘‘take all necessary steps, to the maximum
extent consistent with the law, to ensure the federal government
has unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state pro-
grams that receive federal funding, including, as appropriate, data
generated by those programs but maintained in third-party data-
bases.’’ SNAP is federally funded but administered by State agen-
cies through partnerships with FNS and payment processors. Prior
to these actions, FNS has not had access to how program dollars
are being spent. The Committee notes that FNS has paused the
data transfer pending implementation of ‘‘requisite procedural safe-
guards.’’ The Committee directs FNS safeguard the use of person-
ally identifiable information (PII).
FDPIR Warehouse Report.—The Committee was very dis-
appointed when USDA failed to ensure Tribal communities had
food to provide to their most vulnerable citizens last year. The deci-
sion to have one warehouse supply the entire FDPIR program, as
well as the CSFP program, must be carefully examined to prevent
this situation from occurring again. The Committee directs USDA
to provide a briefing within 60 days of enactment of this Act detail-
ing how USDA has addressed the missteps to ensure vulnerable
populations do not go without necessary food again.
Nutrition Standards.—The Secretary is directed to establish a
working group of nutrition experts to determine a national stand-
ard for nutritious foods and beverages that should be purchased
with SNAP benefits. These nutrition standards can guide States
and USDA in implementing SNAP waivers and policies. Within one
year of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary is directed
to make these nutrition standards public.

SNAP Card Skimming.—The Committee remains concerned
about the prevalence of SNAP benefit theft due to identity theft,
card skimming, card cloning, and other fraudulent methods. The
Committee is also concerned that Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT)
cards lack the proper security features necessary to protect against
benefit theft. The Committee directs FNS to engage with State and
local agencies and appropriate stakeholders to develop a more se-
cure EBT card that contains innovative technologies to protect
against benefit theft. Further, the Committee directs FNS to take
immediate action and safeguard SNAP from fraudulent activity by
adopting industry-standard, real-time analytics capable of detecting
and preventing fraudulent transactions before they are completed.
SNAP–Ed.—Within the funds provided for Nutrition Education
and Obesity Prevention Grants, FNS is encouraged to work with
Medicaid practitioners to provide nutrition education to their pa-
tients on the importance of a healthy diet to prevent negative
health outcomes.
Further, when administering SNAP–Ed, the Committee encour-
ages FNS and NIFA to prioritize evidence-based interventions that
include hands-on cooking paired with nutrition education. The
Committee believes that SNAP–Ed grants should include cooking
programs that deliver community-based nutrition education to
SNAP-eligible families with the intention of helping households
maximize their food budgets and prepare healthier meals.
Territories.—The Committee recognizes the differences in assist-
ance provided through Nutrition Assistance Program block grant
funding for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
Puerto Rico, and American Samoa, compared to SNAP. The Com-
mittee encourages FNS to continue engaging the appropriate stake-
holders and directs FNS to provide the Committee with updates on
the separate plans and discussions to includes these territories in
SNAP.
COMMODITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
The Committee provides an appropriation of $516,070,000 for the
Commodity Assistance Program. This includes $425,000,000 for the
Commodity Supplemental Food Program, $10,000,000 for the
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program, $80,000,000 for administra-
tive funding for TEFAP, and $1,070,000 for the Food Donations
Programs for Pacific Island Assistance.
Kosher and Halal Foods in TEFAP.—USDA is encouraged to con-
tinue working to increase the purchase of Kosher and Halal food
from food manufacturers with a Kosher or Halal certification and
to keep the Committee apprised of efforts to increase the number
of kosher and halal certified products available.
Program Vouchers.—While the Committee supports efforts to
modernize and streamline program administration of the Senior
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program, there is concern about the un-
intended consequences for both seniors and farmers who are facing
significant barriers in adapting to the new digital system. The
Committee notes that many farmers, particularly smaller or rural
vendors, lack the infrastructure or resources to support digital
transactions and that many seniors in rural communities lack ac-

cess to the necessary technology, such as reliable internet, to effec-
tively use digital coupons. Therefore, the Committee directs USDA
to work with State and local administrators to address the needs
of all program participants and to ensure that no senior or farmer
is excluded from the program due to the limitations of digital tech-
nology. The Committee further directs USDA to provide a report
within 90 days of enactment of this Act on vendor participation and
benefit redemption rates.
TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.—In addition to grant
funds supporting commodity handling and distribution costs, the
bill permits States to use up to 20 percent of the funds provided
for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of stor-
ing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee ex-
pects State agencies to consult with their emergency feeding orga-
nizations on the need for the conversion of such funds.
Wild Game.—The Committee is aware that TEFAP regulations
allow the use of administrative funds for the repackaging and proc-
essing of donated wild game. Some State agencies and eligible re-
cipient agencies utilize a portion of annually allocated administra-
tive funds for this purpose. The Farm to Food Bank Projects also
allow funds to be used for wild game. The Committee urges FNS
to ensure State agencies are aware of this option and work with
State-based wild game hunger relief programs.
NUTRITION PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION
COMMITTEE PROVISIONS
For Nutrition Programs Administration, the Committee provides
an appropriation of $135,348,000.
Nutrition Education and Guidelines.—As the diabetes epidemic
increases, it is crucial that USDA consistently examine the role
that nutrition plays in the prevention and management of diabetes
and prediabetes. FNS shall examine how nutrition guidelines and
education for individuals living with diabetes, prediabetes, and
other chronic conditions could help decrease the prevalence of
chronic diet-related disease and improve health, reducing overall
healthcare spending. The Committee directs FNS to submit a re-
port within 180 days of enactment of this Act detailing the results
of this examination and recommendations for implementation.

503A Pharmacy and 503B Outsourcing Facility Inspections.—The
Committee is concerned about FDA inspection delays for phar-
macies and outsourcing facilities, citing staffing and resource short-
ages as contributing factors. The Committee requests a report with-
in 180 days of enactment of this Act detailing inspections and ad-
dressing resolution timelines for observation and warning letters.
Abraham Accords Region.—To help diversify and protect the
American medical product and food supply chains, the FDA shall
develop a plan in cooperation with the Secretary of State for ex-
panding its international presence, including consideration of a
physical office support of the Abraham Accords. FDA foreign offices
provide advice and guidance on regulatory requirements for the
safety and quality of FDA-regulated products for sale in the U.S.
and, as appropriate, perform in-person inspections to verify that
products exported to the U.S. meet the agency’s requirements. The
plan shall consider required personnel and input from other rel-
evant Federal agencies that would assist in facilitating interactions
with nations of the Abraham Accords on issues relevant to the
FDA.
Accelerated Approval Program.—The Committee continues to rec-
ognize the importance of and supports the FDA’s continued use of
the Accelerated Approval Pathways to provide patients with unmet
medical needs access to new therapies, including ALS patients. The
Committee is concerned that the application of the Accelerated Ap-
proval Pathway is not uniform between CDER and CBER. The
Committee requests that FDA brief the Committee within 120 days
of enactment of this Act detailing the steps the FDA can take to
ensure the Accelerated Approval Pathways is being administered
equally in both CDER and CBER. Further, the Committee urges

FDA to clarify its guidance that when considering new therapies
for Accelerated Approval, including in ALS, survivability is a clin-
ical endpoint that will be considered, consistent with the current
statute.
Access to Compounded Hormones.—As the FDA reviews rec-
ommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine (NASEM) report on the Clinical Utility of Com-
pounded Hormones, the Committee urges FDA to engage with
compounders and other stakeholders to help ensure access to com-
pounded drugs for patients who need them.
Accountability for Unsafe Drug Products.—The Committee is
troubled by reports of companies knowingly withholding research
that showed their products had adverse health outcomes. The Com-
mittee awaits the briefing regarding the agency’s surveillance and
enforcement efforts to ensure accountability for companies that
withhold material information concerning unsafe drug products.
Advanced Manufacturing Standards Development.—The Com-
mittee commends FDA for its focus on advanced manufacturing
technologies which include new or innovatively applied medical
product manufacturing technologies that can help improve drug
quality, address shortages of medicines, and speed time-to-market
for safe and effective therapies. The Committee recognizes the op-
portunity for the agency to partner with qualified external experts
to efficiently advance the development of technical guides, edu-
cational tools, and industry standards in furtherance of accel-
erating the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and
working through technical challenges that are hindering wider
adoption of these innovations. The Committee recognizes that fa-
cilitating greater adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies
is an important strategic objective for our nation and will benefit
American patients by strengthening domestic pharmaceutical man-
ufacturing. The Committee encourages the Commissioner to de-
velop a plan to coordinate efforts with qualified external experts in
the development of industry standards and other tools and re-
sources to overcome technical challenges to wider adoption and im-
plementation of advanced manufacturing technologies. The Com-
mittee requests an update on this plan no later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act.
Adverse Drug Events.—The Committee commends the FDA’s ini-
tiatives to increase the number of women and minorities in clinical
trials to represent their unique health needs, gather safety and ef-
ficacy information to inform proper product labeling, and prevent
adverse drug events (ADEs), which are twice as high for women.
The Committee appreciates the progress the FDA has made in ex-
amining past drug approvals with identified pharmacogenomic
safety issues and developing strategies that may mitigate risks of
ADE’s. The Committee welcomes any additional updates on anal-
ysis of the data gathered and how it impacts clinical trials, what
has and has not been effective, and recommended best practices for
drug sponsors.
Allergen Labeling.—The Committee is concerned about the in-
crease in the diagnosis of food allergies to new and emerging food
allergens not currently required to be labeled as allergens but rec-
ognizes that FDA currently lacks the authority to amend the list
of major food allergens. The Committee encourages the FDA’s

Human Foods Program to identify other food allergens for which
labeling on food packaging as a non-major food allergen would be
appropriate and implement a rulemaking process toward such la-
beling on packaged foods.
Angelman Syndrome.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of patient-focused drug development for Angelman syndrome, a
rare and devastating monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. Pa-
tient and family preferences and broader patient experience data
should have an impact on drug development. For this population,
seemingly small gains in self-care are critical for patients and their
caregivers in building toward independence. Without treatments
individuals are completely dependent on a caregiver to perform the
fundamental activities of daily living such as dressing, eating,
grooming, and navigating their environment. The Committee en-
courages FDA to utilize patient experience data to inform regu-
latory decision-making, as well as the further development of
Angelman syndrome clinical endpoints and biomarkers. FDA
should ensure clinically meaningful improvements that matter to
patients and families are recognized in regulatory decision-making.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee supports the steps FDA
has taken to identify and oversee issues related to AI in drug de-
velopment and urges the Commissioner to formalize a dedicated,
cross-center team of experts in AI-enabled drug development. In es-
tablishing the AI Team, the Committee encourages the agency to
engage internal and external experts with a deep understanding of
machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, predictive mod-
eling, and model validation, and who can help inform the evalua-
tion of the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models trained on
complex biological datasets as resources permit. The Commissioner
shall brief the Committee no later than 180 days after enactment
of this Act on any plans to formalize a team of experts on AI.
Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials.—The Committee recognizes the need
to advance innovative clinical trial designs to increase diversity in
clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease. The Committee encourages
FDA to increase efforts to make Alzheimer’s clinical trials more in-
clusive and innovative and to conduct necessary outreach to under-
represented populations.
Animal Drug Compounding.—As the agency continues to imple-
ment Guidance for Industry #256, Compounding Animal Drugs
from Bulk Drug Substances, the Committee encourages the FDA to
continue collaborating with stakeholder organizations, including
State boards of pharmacy, pharmacy organizations, and accredita-
tion bodies, to develop inspectional guidelines that are shared with
the inspected pharmacies and allow for consistent application. Fur-
thermore, the Committee encourages FDA to consult with prac-
ticing veterinarians and to adequately consider their concerns
when evaluating nominations and making decisions for the List of
Bulk Drug Substances for Compounding Office Stock Drugs for Use
in Nonfood-Producing Animals.
Bacterial Endotoxins Testing.—The Committee recognizes that
use of recombinant Bacterial Endotoxins Testing (rBET) methods
as alternatives to tests using horseshoe crab blood could provide
scientific, economic, supply chain, environmental, and animal pro-
tection benefits in the safety testing of vaccines, injectable thera-
pies, and medical devices. The Committee recognizes that the

United States Pharmacopeia chapter 86, which includes rBET
methods for endotoxins testing for products, has been finalized. The
Committee directs the FDA to update its 2012 Guidance for Indus-
try on Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing by publishing revised draft
guidance within one year of enactment of this Act to include ac-
ceptance of appropriate rBET methods for endotoxins testing for
new and existing products. The FDA will provide staff training on
rBET methods.
Biosimilars.—The Committee urges the FDA to consider a single,
shared system Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for
biosimilars and their reference products based on the risk mes-
saging and profile that encourages cooperation among the REMS
participants, while allowing adequate flexibility for REMS with dif-
ferent, but comparable elements, if appropriate. This may drive in-
creased biosimilar development, expanded patient access, and pro-
vide savings for patients and the healthcare system. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA to provide a report to the Committees no
later than 120 days from the date of enactment of this Act.
Biosimilars Interchangeability Update Draft Guidance.—The
Committee directs the FDA to finalize the recommendations in the
Biosimilars Interchangeability Update Draft Guidance, which pro-
posed to eliminate switching studies as a default requirement for
interchangeable biosimilar approval, given the evidence dem-
onstrating equivalent safety profiles between reference products
and biosimilars, as well as the absence of significant adverse effects
in switching studies. The Committee notes that streamlining the
approval process for biosimilar interchangeability designations will
increase patient access to medications and bolster innovation by re-
ducing development costs and encourage manufacturer investment
in biosimilar production.
Blood Donor Procedures.—The Committee continues to recognize
the need for scientifically sound, evidence-based policy relative to
FDA blood donor recommendations. The Committee is aware of the
Agency’s work on blood donor procedures and encourages the FDA
to continue monitoring the safety of the nation’s blood supply and
update the Committee on any changes as the revised donor deferral
recommendations guidance is implemented.
Blood Safety and Pathogen Reduction.—The Committee urges the
FDA to modify guidance on screening for prospective plasma and
platelet donors when scientific evidence supports the use of FDA-
approved pathogen reduction technology as an alternative to cer-
tain donor deferrals to adequately and appropriately reduce the
risk of certain transfusion-transmitted infections and safeguard the
blood supply.
Blood Supply Chain Task Force.—The Committee recognizes the
challenges in ensuring a safe and available blood supply, which de-
pends on a reliable supply chain of critical supplies and equipment.
The Committee directs the Commissioner to establish a taskforce,
in conjunction with FDA, NIH, CDC, and private stakeholders, to
study, review, and evaluate the supply chain to manufacture blood
and blood components. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act,
the Commissioner shall submit a report on its strategic plan to de-
velop a taskforce and how it will coordinate with relevant federal
agencies to address blood supply chain issues to help predict and

prevent shortages of supplies and equipment that may impact the
safety and availability of the blood supply.
Boxed Warnings in Drug Product Labeling.—The Committee con-
tinues to be concerned about the class-wide warning labels for
antipsychotic medications, last updated in 2008, and that this la-
beling may be impeding patient access to appropriate care and
treatment. The Committee appreciates FDA’s responsiveness in
holding a December 2024 public workshop on Mortality and
Antipsychotic Use in Dementia-related Behavioral Disorders as di-
rected in H. Rpt. 118–124. The Committee urges FDA to prioritize
and expedite its review of data to characterize risk of mortality as-
sociated with use of antipsychotic medications in older adults with
mental health conditions associated with dementia to determine if
revisions to the boxed warning are needed. The Committee re-
quests FDA provide an update on these analyses and its assess-
ment of whether revisions to the class-wide warning labels for
antipsychotic medications are needed no later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act.
Breakthrough Therapies.—The Committee recognizes the in-
creased interest and need to study psychedelics and qualified plant-
based alternative therapies and their potential therapeutic effects.
The Committee encourages FDA to work with the DoD on
leveraging clinical trials, as authorized by title 10 United States
Code, chapter 55, to improve our understanding of psychedelics.
The Committee also encourages FDA and DoD to work together in
developing and supporting public-private collaborations to advance
psychedelic research for therapeutic purposes.
Cannabidiol Oil Enforcement.—The Committee is concerned
about the proliferation of products marketed in violation of the
FFDCA, including products containing derivatives of the cannabis
plant. The Committee is aware that non-FFDCA-compliant prod-
ucts pose potential health and safety risks to consumers through
misleading, unsubstantiated, and false claims that cannabis and
cannabis derivatives can treat serious and life-threatening diseases
and conditions, including COVID–19 and cancer. Such products
may also be contaminated with harmful substances. The Com-
mittee recognizes FDA’s use of existing authorities to undertake
cannabis-related efforts, including research, requests for data, con-
sumer education, issuance of guidance and policy around cannabis-
based drug product development, and enforcement against wrong-
doers. The Committee expects FDA to continue and increase these
efforts given the proliferation of non-FFDCA-compliant, cannabis-
containing products and the risks they pose to public health. The
Committee also expects FDA to take enforcement action against
the manufacturers of any cannabis products marketed with unlaw-
ful therapeutic claims to preserve the integrity of the drug develop-
ment and approval processes, which ensures that products, includ-
ing cannabis-containing products, marketed as drugs have under-
gone a rigorous scientific evaluation to ensure that they are safe,
pure, potent, and effective for the diseases and conditions they
claim to treat. It is also imperative that FDA continue to exercise
its existing authorities to preserve incentives to invest in robust
clinical study of cannabis so its therapeutic value can be better un-
derstood.

Canned Tuna.—While the Committee is pleased that FDA has
issued a proposed rule on canned tuna standards of identity and
standard of fill of container for canned tuna, the Committee is con-
cerned that the proposed rule has not been finalized. FDA is di-
rected to finalize the proposed regulations revising the standard of
identity and standard fill for canned tuna.
Cell and Gene Therapy Modernization.—The Committee com-
mends the FDA’s prioritization of cell and gene therapies, particu-
larly noting the progress in maximizing approval pathways and
considering the totality of the scientific evidence. The agency
should continue modernizing its approach by incorporating innova-
tive clinical trial designs that better reflect the range of patient
populations who could benefit from these therapies. FDA is encour-
aged to establish modern pathways that embrace novel endpoints
for safety and efficacy assessment, ensuring appropriate evaluation
of benefits and risks, ultimately better ensuring that the tools FDA
applies are fit for purpose. Given the transformative potential of
these therapies, the Committee encourages enhanced alignment be-
tween FDA centers and the patient community regarding risk tol-
erance. The FDA should consider that for conditions where cell and
gene therapies offer significant clinical outcomes, including type 1
diabetes, a broader risk-benefit assessment may be warranted be-
yond viewing these as rescue therapies. The Committee also rec-
ommends utilizing accelerated development pathways for therapies
demonstrating significant clinical evidence and/or in instances of
significant patient unmet need, such as when no other therapeutic
alternative exists. To advance these efforts, FDA reviewers should
actively collaborate with expert researchers and stakeholders to
stay current with field developments. While maintaining the crit-
ical balance between patient safety and treatment access, the Com-
mittee emphasizes the need for clear communication and proactive
engagement with sponsors to address regulatory concerns effi-
ciently, ensuring that clinical holds are applied judiciously and
with transparent rationale.
Cell Cultured Meat Labeling.—The Committee is aware that
FDA has completed its first pre-market consultation for a human
food made from cultured animal cells, the first action completed
under the Formal Agreement Between the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Food Safety (the ‘‘For-
mal Agreement’’) announced on March 7, 2019. The Committee is
interested in the internal FDA protocols related to pre-market con-
sultations for cell-cultured protein products, specifically whether or
not there are special or unique considerations made for these prod-
ucts in pre-market consultation processes under the Formal Agree-
ment. The Committee awaits the report outlining the pre-market
consultation process for cell-cultured protein products, noting any
special accommodations made to comply with the Formal Agree-
ment and any agency plans to coordinate with its counterparts at
USDA on further action regarding the same products.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).—COPD con-
tinues to be among the leading causes of death, chronic illness, and
disease economic burden in the U.S. Over 15 million Americans
have been diagnosed with COPD, and it is estimated that a similar
number are undiagnosed and not receiving appropriate treatment.

The Committee is aware of efforts to support development of COPD
treatments for earlier stages of the disease aiming to slow progres-
sion and reduce the burden of disease on individuals and society.
To support these efforts, patient-centered, novel clinical outcome
measures are needed to advance these potential therapies. The
Committee encourages FDA to continue to collaborate with the
COPD Foundation and other stakeholders in this important area.
Clinical Trial Diversity.—The Committee supports FDA’s contin-
ued efforts to implement legislation and policies requiring study
sponsors to submit a diversity action plan for phase 3 studies of
new drugs. The Committee directs FDA to consider how it can
flexibly use its authorities and to provide additional guidance to
study sponsors regarding mechanisms to remedy inadequate
progress as those study sponsors continue to work with FDA to
overcome common barriers to participation, including restrictive
eligibility criteria and limited enrollment outreach, particularly in
rural or underserved areas. FDA is directed to provide a report
within 180 days of enactment of this Act on steps it can take to
overcome barriers.
Clinical Trial Guidance.—The Committee welcomes the draft
guidance under docket FDA–2023–D–1987. The Committee directs
FDA to issue final guidance no later than 270 days after enactment
of this Act.
Compounding.—The Committee is concerned about recent drug
shortages and considers patient access to critical medications a pa-
tient safety issue. The Committee recognizes the important role
503A state-licensed compounding pharmacies and 503B outsourcing
facilities have played during shortages of drugs needed to treat
COVID patients and subsequent shortages of children’s suspension
drugs. The Committee urges the FDA to continue to utilize the reg-
ulatory flexibility provided by Congress to quickly respond to drug
shortages in the short term by allowing pharmacies and outsourc-
ing facilities to safely compound those drugs and protect patient ac-
cess until manufacturers are able to stabilize the supply chain and
meet patient needs.
Counterfeit Medicines.—The Committee is concerned about the
production of counterfeit and untested GLP–1 and GIP/GLP–1
medications, posing a serious risk to public health and patient safe-
ty. The Committee encourages the FDA to exercise its existing au-
thority to combat the illegal distribution of counterfeit and inappro-
priately labeled or manufactured GIP/GLP–1 medications to ensure
patients’ safety. The Committee directs the FDA to provide to the
Committee a briefing, no later than 60 days after enactment of this
act followed by a report within 120 days, outlining the FDA’s plan
to stop the entrance of counterfeit GIP/GLP–1 medications in the
supply chain to avoid harm to patient safety.
Dairy Standard of Identity.—The Committee is pleased that the
FDA has begun a deliberative process to review how it will enforce
the standards of identity for dairy products in the Code of Federal
Regulations. The Committee continues to hear concerns with the
labeling of certain foods and beverages as dairy products when the
products are plant-based rather than derived from an animal. As
such, the Committee urges the FDA to continue its work related to
standards of identity for dairy products.

Device Remanufacturing Safety and Awareness.—The Committee
is aware of the FDA’s work on medical device remanufacturing and
servicing requirements, including the May 2024 final guidance, and
directs the agency to provide a report detailing the agency’s efforts
to implement the guidance. The report should outline outreach ef-
forts that the FDA has undertaken to inform independent servicers
(who aren’t FDA-regulated and may not monitor Federal Register
notices) about their responsibilities, including industry group com-
munications and trade publication education. The report should
also cover FDA’s surveillance of servicers and remanufacturers to
ensure proper documentation of remanufacturing determinations
(this shall include a summary of conducted inspections and enforce-
ment actions taken). Additionally, the report should include data
on whether the guidance has increased establishment registrations
or 510(k) submissions by remanufacturers and explain how FDA is
addressing concerns that the guidance might be misinterpreted to
permit unsupervised device modifications by third parties, empha-
sizing independent servicers’ understanding of their regulatory ob-
ligations. The Committee expects the report to be completed within
90 days of enactment of this Act with all relevant information post-
ed on FDA’s public website.
Dietary Supplements.—The Committee supports increased in-
spections and enforcement for high-priority supplements with a
history of being tainted and bearing illegal claims, including, but
not limited to, products marketed as supplements for weight loss,
muscle, arthritis or pain, or diabetes.
Domestic Infant Formula Supply.—The Committee remains con-
cerned about the fragility of the infant formula market in the U.S.,
especially following the 2022 infant formula shortage crisis. The
Committee supports the FDA’s efforts to ensure the ongoing qual-
ity, safety, nutritional adequacy, and resilience of the domestic in-
fant formula supply as part of Operation Stork Speed. As part of
these efforts, the Committee encourages FDA to develop and pub-
licly publish a plan of operation for ensuring a safe supply of infant
formula, including plans to ensure the continuation of inspections
of infant formula manufacturing facilities on a safe and timely
basis during public health emergencies and/or natural disasters.
The Committee further encourages the FDA to streamline approval
processes for small domestic manufacturers to increase and diver-
sify the domestic supply of infant formula, including providing
guidance for formulas such as plant-based non-soy, non-dairy solu-
tions that may be needed by some infants. The Committee is also
monitoring the availability and quality of specialty formulas and
fortifiers administered to pre-term or low birth-weight infants,
often the sole source of nutrition for many of these infants, and di-
rects the agency to focus on the fragility and safety of this market
and keep the Committee apprised of any changes to the availability
of these formulas and to report back to the Committee on agency
authorities and potential actions to ensure stability of the market
for this most vulnerable population. The Committee encourages the
agency’s review to include, but not be limited to, current FDA au-
thorities to offer limited (both in time and scope) protections for
manufacturers of these preterm formulas, current regulatory path-
ways for these preterm infant formula products, whether the FDA

Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—There are currently
eight approved therapies for Duchenne, five of which aim to ad-
dress the underlying cause of Duchenne, the lack of dystrophin, in-
cluding via gene therapy. In addition, individuals with Duchenne
are routinely prescribed a variety of therapies for symptom man-
agement—including three approvals for Duchenne-specific symp-
toms. However, none of these treatments are transformational, and
a significant unmet need remains for therapies that substantially
alter the disease trajectory. The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant work of patient, provider, and research organizations to better
understand the effects of treatments used in sequence and encour-
ages the FDA to convene a public meeting on the topic to inform
agency actions.
Essential Medicines List.—The Committee is concerned by the
ongoing shortage of commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs, in-
cluding cisplatin and carboplatin. These shortages have hurt cancer
care, including, in some cases, care rationing. Reliable access to
chemotherapeutic drugs is essential to cancer care. The Committee
is concerned that the FDA has only included a single
chemotherapeutic drug on its FDA Essential Medicines list.
Evidentiary Hearings.—The Committee urges the FDA to conduct
an evidentiary hearing as governed by 21 U.S.C. 360b(e)(1)(B) and
21 C.F.R. Part 12 before removing any approved drug from the
market. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other fed-
eral laws require FDA to afford the sponsor of an animal drug due
process before taking a drug off the market.
FASTER Act.—The Committee recognizes the importance of en-
forcing the FASTER Act in a manner consistent with Congressional
intent to protect those suffering from sesame allergies and clearly
label sesame as an allergen on food products. The Committee is
concerned by reports of companies circumventing the intent of the
law by intentionally adding sesame to food products to avoid the
cost of preventing cross-contamination.
FDA Modernization Act.—The Committee urges the continued
implementation of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, designed to
modernize the drug development process and empower free market
competition. Significant delays may sow confusion among drug
sponsors and stifle free-market innovation in new drug develop-
ment. The Committee requests a briefing 120 days after the enact-
ment of this Act providing an update on implementation and
timeline of future activities.
Food Advisory Committees.—The Committee urges the FDA to
reestablish the Food Advisory Committee as recommended in the
Reagan-Udall Report. Advisory Committees are an important
method to deliver necessary external information, insight, and ex-
pertise from outside the agency. Any renewed Advisory Committee
shall be established to elevate external input to Human Foods Pro-
gram activities, including from agriculture and food industry stake-
holders.

Food Chemical Safety Reviews.—The Committee supports FDA’s
ongoing efforts on the pre-market review process for new food and
color additives petitions and GRAS substances, conducting new
safety assessments of food chemicals currently on the market, as
well as the development and implementation of an enhanced
framework for post-market safety assessments of chemicals in food,
including in support of the Closer to Zero initiative to reduce heavy
metals in foods intended for children. The Committee additionally
recognizes that more research is required to better understand the
health impacts of ultra-processed foods in the nation’s food supply
and how to best define ultra-processed foods. The Committee en-
courages FDA, in coordination with CDC and NIH, to conduct addi-
tional research on ultra-processed foods.
Food Packaging Health and Safety.—The Committee recognizes
the critical importance of cold-ship and protective packaging that
comply with FDA requirements for intended use to ensure food
safety and food security and to promote public health. Packaging
materials and solutions are specifically tailored to support the do-
mestic and international distribution of agricultural products,
meat, and seafood to minimize risks to public health and safety
and, to the extent practicable, to extend shelf life and reduce food
waste. The Committee urges the FDA to prioritize public health
and safety and food waste prevention in any review of materials
used to package, ship, and distribute food and agricultural prod-
ucts.
Food Traceability Rule.—The Committee directs FDA, before im-
plementing or enforcing the compliance requirements of the ‘‘Re-
quirements for Additional Traceability Records for Certain Foods’’
published on November 21, 2022 (87 Fed. Reg. 70910), or any other
rule promulgated by section 204 of the FDA Food Safety Mod-
ernization Act (21 U.S.C. 2223), to conduct at least 4 pilot projects,
using numerous products on the Food Traceability List, with the
regulated entities, including farms, restaurants, retail food estab-
lishments, and warehouses distributing to retail food establish-
ments and restaurants to: (1) measure the effectiveness of
foodborne illness outbreak investigations conducted without requir-
ing tracing to a single lot code; and (2) identify and evaluate the
feasibility and effectiveness of low-cost food tracing technologies.
Furthermore, the Committee expects FDA to provide a report fol-
lowing the completion of the pilot projects.
Foreign Medical Device Inspections.—The Committee is con-
cerned about medical device recalls from foreign facilities and di-
rects FDA to strengthen its foreign inspection pilot programs to in-
clude medical device inspections. The FDA should identify what, if
anything, is needed to increase unannounced inspections of over-
seas drug and device manufacturers, with emphasis on facilities in
China and India where quality issues are most prevalent. The FDA
should enhance inspector language capabilities, technological re-
sources, and staffing levels across both programs. The Committee
expects FDA to report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on
concrete steps taken to integrate and improve these inspection pro-
grams, including unified metrics on inspection frequency, violation
rates, and progress in eliminating the backlog of uninspected facili-
ties. The report shall detail specific measures that are available if
efforts to conceal violations during inspections are discovered and

ensure imported drugs and devices consistently meet U.S. safety
standards.
Foreign Unannounced Inspections Pilots.—The Committee con-
tinues to support the pilot. The Committee reminds FDA of direc-
tion included in the fiscal year 2022 bill on the Committee’s intent
for the use of these funds. The Committee directs FDA to provide
quarterly briefings on its efforts to implement these funds in ac-
cordance with the Committee’s intent.
Highly Sensitized Kidney Transplant Patients.—The Committee
recognizes that highly sensitized patients, who comprise 10–30 per-
cent of the kidney transplant waiting list, face severe challenges in
finding compatible donor organs. These patients experience signifi-
cantly higher rejection rates compared to non-sensitized patients,
and many remain on dialysis for extended periods. The Committee
notes that current desensitization protocols, while promising, still
face challenges with antibody rebound and high rejection rates. The
Committee directs the FDA to submit a report within 180 days of
enactment of this Act detailing strategies to facilitate the develop-
ment and approval of desensitization therapies, ensure the safety
of medications used in desensitization protocols, and improve long-
term outcomes for highly sensitized patients.
Homeopathy.—The Committee appreciates that many Americans
use homeopathic medicines. Consumer safety and access to these
products are best ensured by implementing a legal pathway that
includes homeopathic-specific standards for the regulation of these
medicines. The Committee understands FDA now takes the posi-
tion that it is limited to enforcing pharmaceutical-specific stand-
ards when taking enforcement action against products labeled as
homeopathic. FDA’s interpretation of the law that all homeopathic
medicines are unapproved new drugs that are illegally marketed
has created confusion both for the homeopathic community and en-
forcement officials. The Committee urges the FDA to work with the
homeopathic community regarding the regulation of these medi-
cines.
HPV Self Sampling.—One in four women in the U.S. do not re-
ceive regular cervical cancer screenings, with more than half of cer-
vical cancer diagnoses occurring in women who are not screened.
While there are many barriers to screening, including, but not lim-
ited to, fear of the procedure, embarrassment, or lack of time or
transportation. The Committee encourages FDA to exercise the use
of regulatory authorities to expedite innovation related to at-home
self-collection tests that could increase and expand access to
screenings for women and address a persistent cancer health dis-
parity for women who are never screened or under-screened.
Human Drug Review Performance Trends.—The concurrent in-
vestment of discretionary resources and Prescription Drug User
Fee Act (PDUFA) Program funds has resulted in a successful pro-
gram for over three decades, enabling faster review times in the
U.S. and allowing the American people to gain quicker access to
FDA-approved prescription drugs. The Committee is aware of a re-
cent decrease in FDA first cycle approval rates with an increasing
number of Complete Response Letters (CRLs) being issued to drug
manufacturers. This decline is observed across all human drug re-
view programs, including novel drug approvals. In keeping with the
PDUFA Performance Goals to increase the first cycle approval rate

for medicines that are ultimately approved, the Committee directs
FDA to provide a report with an analysis of how issues that led to
CRLs for medicines over the past five years could have been re-
solved within the first review cycle.
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE).—The Committee recog-
nizes the lack of any pharmaceutical treatment for infants born
with HIE, a rare brain injury due to insufficient cerebral oxygen
and blood flow. While HIE injuries tragically take the lives of many
newborns, of the surviving babies, approximately 25 percent will
endure significant and lifelong neurological disability. HIE is a
leading cause of physical and cognitive deficits, including recurrent
seizures and cerebral palsy. Due to the severity of the condition,
long-term impact on the patients, and high cost to healthcare, the
Committee encourages the FDA to consider endpoints for clinical
trials that may predict improvements in neurodevelopmental out-
comes and expedite therapeutic development for HIE.
Illegal Imports of Unapproved New Drugs.—The Committee ex-
presses deep concern over the health risks posed by illegal importa-
tion of unapproved and misbranded drugs, particularly through
third-party brokers facilitating access via employer-sponsored
health plans. These unapproved drugs lack FDA oversight, poten-
tially containing incorrect dosages, unknown ingredients, or con-
taminants, which can lead to serious health consequences, espe-
cially for vulnerable populations with conditions like HIV, cancer,
or hepatitis. The substitution of FDA-approved medications with
unapproved versions can cause patient confusion, medication er-
rors, and negatively impact treatment outcomes, as healthcare pro-
viders may unknowingly base decisions on patients’ responses to
these unregulated drugs. Furthermore, sourcing from uninspected
and unregulated supply chains increases the risk of receiving adul-
terated or improperly stored medications. Given these significant
dangers, the Committee directs the FDA to provide a comprehen-
sive report within 180 days of enactment of this Act addressing
this issue, including safety risks, verification challenges, enforce-
ment actions, and recommendations for strengthening oversight.
This action is critical to protect U.S. consumers from the potential
harm of unapproved and misbranded drugs circumventing regu-
latory safeguards.
Illicit Nicotine Products.—The Committee remains deeply con-
cerned with the enormous surge of flavored disposable e-cigarettes
and nicotine pouch products being illegally imported into the U.S.
(primarily from China) that are openly evading FDA’s regulatory
requirements. The Committee believes these illegal imports con-
stitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the public health of
the U.S. The Committee directs FDA to prioritize the use of re-
sources to ensure these illegal products are expeditiously removed
from the market and that those illegally importing and distributing
such products are subject to significant compliance and enforce-
ment actions. Further, the Committee directs the FDA to increase
its coordination with the Department of Justice and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to address the ongoing importation and
distribution of illegally imported flavored disposable e-cigarettes
and nicotine pouch products.

cans with healthier food choices but is concerned by the lack of co-
ordination and transparency between USDA, FDA, and CDC in
safeguarding our nation’s food supply, particularly during
foodborne illness outbreak investigations. The Committee directs
the USDA Secretary, FDA Commissioner, and CDC Director to pro-
vide recommendations on ways to improve interagency collabora-
tion in order to efficiently deploy inspectional resources, conduct co-
ordinated outbreak investigations, and provide unified messages to
the American public. These recommendations should also include
ways to work with industry to improve food safety. The Committee
requests a report from USDA, FDA, and CDC on these rec-
ommendations within 90 days of enactment of this Act to ensure
that U.S. consumers have access to safe, healthy and affordable
foods.
Insomnia.—The Committee encourages FDA to work with the
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to prioritize actions to expand ac-
cess to insomnia treatments that greatly reduce the risk of addic-
tion compared to other treatments on the market. The Committee
understands that our servicemembers, veterans, and first respond-
ers have a higher-than-average prevalence of insomnia and that
DEA is currently undergoing a review to potentially deschedule the
DORA class of insomnia treatments. FDA is encouraged to work
swiftly to complete their Eight-Factor Analysis, potentially even
analyzing the class concurrently with DEA to ensure that safer in-
somnia treatments get to those who need.
International Device Inspections.—The Committee is concerned
about the impact of imported drugs and devices on overall health
product availability and safety. The Committee encourages FDA to
increase the frequency and rigor of international drug and device
manufacturer inspections to be consistent with domestic manufac-
turer inspections.
International Mail Facilities.—The Committee supports contin-
ued efforts at International Mail Facilities on preventing con-
trolled, counterfeit, or otherwise dangerous pharmaceuticals from
entering the U.S. The Committee requests a report on all products
refused import at international mail facilities by classifying such
products as controlled or non-controlled drugs and further
classifying controlled or non-controlled drugs as counterfeit, mis-
branded, or unapproved.
Interstate Commerce.—The Committee is concerned that state
legislative activity to ban FDA-approved food and color additives
threatens both the FDA’s unified, science-based federal food safety
system and the interstate commerce of agricultural, food, and bev-
erage goods. The Committee reaffirms the essential role FDA plays
in determining the safety of food and color additives in the nation’s
food and beverage supply and encourages FDA to clearly and ac-
tively communicate with the public and state legislatures the ef-
forts it undertakes to protect public health from unsafe chemicals
and the risks to the food supply and interstate commerce that
would result without a unified, federal, science-based food safety
system. The Committee requests that FDA provide a report 90
days after the enactment of this Act that details food and color ad-
ditives that are under current FDA review and that FDA is other-
wise prioritizing for future review, including the basis of potential

safety concerns, the current status of the review, and a timeline of
review for each additive.
Kratom Safety.—The Committee is encouraged by the results of
the Single Ascending Dose (SAD) safety study on kratom that
found no serious adverse effects among participants. The Com-
mittee urges the FDA to reconsider its import alerts concerning
kratom products based on the findings of the SAD study. Further-
more, the Committee urges the FDA to enforce current quality and
wholesomeness standards for imported kratom raw materials based
on presence of contaminants that pose a specific threat to the pub-
lic safety, and to impose these enforcement standards on vendors
importing violative raw materials until they demonstrate they can
comply with those standards.
Laboratory Developed Tests.—The FDA’s final rule on Laboratory
Developed Tests (LDTs) puts forth a proposed regulatory frame-
work that is a significant shift in the way LDTs are regulated and
changes expectations for patients, doctors, and laboratories for the
first time since the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
Act was passed in 1988 at the risk of greatly altering the United
States’ laboratory testing infrastructure and reducing patient ac-
cess to information that informs their healthcare decision making.
The Committee directs the FDA to suspend its efforts to implement
the rule and continue working with Congress to modernize the reg-
ulatory approach for LDTs.
Listeria.—The Committee emphasizes reducing incidence of
foodborne illness as an important public health goal and believes
that coordinated and targeted resources are required to appro-
priately assess and combat the public health risks of foodborne
pathogens. The Committee is aware that FDA is in the process of
finalizing industry guidance regarding Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)
in foods under their jurisdiction. The Committee directs FDA to
apply a risk-based approach and direct its regulatory efforts toward
high risk ready-to eat foods, those that support the growth of Lm.
Additionally, the Committee expects FDA to incorporate current
scientific knowledge regarding the public health impact of foods
that do not support growth of Lm. Recently published scientific re-
search from food safety and public health experts recommends a
regulatory action level of Lm for these low-risk foods. This regu-
latory approach will encourage industry to adopt quantitative Lm
testing schemes and facilitate robust environmental monitoring
programs, ultimately resulting in reductions in disease incidence.
The Committee directs FDA to work with industry stakeholders to
gather supporting information and data to assist with implementa-
tion of this Lm approach. Policies reflecting these regulatory ap-
proaches align with other international regulatory standards and
restore a level playing field for U.S. food processors in the global
marketplace.
Lupus.—The Committee is aware of barriers that have long af-
fected the development of therapeutics for lupus, a disease that pri-
marily affects women. The Committee is pleased that FDA has
partnered with researchers, industry, patients, and other stake-
holders to launch the Lupus Accelerating Breakthroughs Consor-
tium (ABC), a public-private partnership to accelerate development
of new therapies. The Committee encourages FDA to continue this
engagement and provide updates on its efforts to accelerate devel-

opment of safer and more effective treatments for people with
lupus.
Marijuana Rescheduling.—The Committee is concerned about de-
viations from established drug scheduling evaluation standards in
the FDA 2023 marijuana scheduling review. The Committee directs
the HHS Inspector General to complete a report on the 2023 mari-
juana scheduling review including but not limited to: deviations
from the established five-factor currently accepted medical use test,
justification for a new, two-factor currently accepted medical use
test and whether this will be the standard for all future reviews,
use of a limited number of hand-selected comparator substances,
and inclusion of research results that are not statistically signifi-
cant or inconclusive. The Committee is concerned about reports of
the mental health hazards of regular use of high-potency mari-
juana, particularly among adolescents. The Committee encourages
the FDA to support research on high-potency marijuana and its ef-
fects on the adolescent brain, specifically regarding addiction and
mental illness such as schizophrenia or psychosis.
Maternal Substance Use Disorders.—The Committee remains
concerned about increasing numbers of overdose deaths of pregnant
and postpartum women. The Committee encourages FDA to col-
laborate with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration and relevant stakeholders on efforts to address mater-
nal substance abuse disorder.
Medication Review.—The Committee is aware of new data re-
garding the safety and efficacy of mifepristone. The Committee
supports the FDA conducting an internal review in light of new
findings and data and directs the FDA to provide a briefing to the
Committee within 30 days upon the completion of any internal re-
views undertaken at the agency. This briefing shall include an
overview of the review process, findings, and any subsequent regu-
latory actions or guidance considerations the agency may pursue.
Microplastic Testing.—The Committee directs FDA to develop a
validated methodology for detecting and analyzing microplastics in
human foods. A standardized national testing protocol will ensure
accurate, reproducible results across laboratories and provide the
scientific foundation needed for future regulatory action. This in-
vestment will enhance food safety, reduce regulatory uncertainty,
and support evidence-based decision-making to protect public
health.
Natural Cheese.—The Committee encourages FDA to clarify and
define the category of natural cheese as cheese produced from ani-
mal milk or certain dairy ingredients and in accordance with estab-
lished cheesemaking standards.
Net Weights.—The Committee remains concerned that FDA has
not devoted appropriate efforts to address suspected economic in-
tegrity issues, particularly with respect to net weights and treat-
ment of seafood. The Committee appreciates the ongoing review of
processes for gathering information about potential short-weighted
seafood adulteration and how to best apply inspectional resources
to this issue. The Committee believes short-weighted labeled prod-
ucts are in violation of the law and that, despite industry reporting
such examples and Committee requests, FDA has not prioritized
enforcement.

Neurological Conditions.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant work to bring innovative treatments to people living with neu-
rological conditions such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS),
Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), and
Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) through strategic partner-
ships. The Committee notes the recent externally led patient-fo-
cused drug development meeting on CIDP and encourages FDA to
continue its collaboration with relevant stakeholders and key regu-
lators.
New Alternative Methods.—The Committee strongly supports
FDA initiatives to reduce and replace animal testing and advance
new alternative methods (NAMs) and appreciates the Science
Board to the FDA’s report on Potential Approaches to Drive Future
Integration of NAMs for Regulatory Decision-Making. The Com-
mittee acknowledges that NAMs, including in vitro tests and com-
putational models, may represent cost-effective, reliable, and
human-relevant advances to support safety and efficacy testing of
pharmaceuticals. To encourage the use of NAMs by industry, the
FDA is directed to revise its regulations to make clear, where ap-
plicable, that animal toxicology tests are not required to support
clinical testing in humans. The FDA must provide a written report
to the Committee describing progress toward implementing Science
Board recommendations and revising regulations within one year
of enactment of this Act. The agency should limit funding to carry
out new animal testing to situations in which comparisons between
an animal method and alternative methods are scientifically nec-
essary and use existing animal data and alternative methods that
will reduce animal use in research when human data is not avail-
able.
Olive Oil Standards of Identity.—The Committee is aware that
the U.S. continues to be an important producer of olive oils and one
of the largest olive oil markets globally. The Committee recognizes
that the establishment of a uniform set of standards would better
inform and protect consumers. The Committee is aware that a peti-
tion was submitted to FDA in July 2022 to establish a Standard
of Identity for different grades of olive oil. The Committee supports
this effort and urges the FDA to work with USDA on the issue of
grade standards and to expeditiously evaluate and act on the peti-
tion to establish a U.S. Standard of Identity. The Committee re-
quests a briefing on these efforts within 120 days of enactment of
this Act.
Opioid Abuse.—The Committee continues to be pleased that,
with the Opioids Action Plan, Opioid Policy Steering Committee,
and several significant regulatory actions, FDA is doing its part to
help stem the tide of abuse. The use of opioids as first-line thera-
pies for any form of pain has led to over-prescribing, and the CDC
has made clear that clinicians should consider opioid therapy only
if expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to
outweigh the risks to the patient. The Committee hopes that FDA
will continue to support the development of alternative and non-ad-
dictive alternatives to opioid analgesics and, when opioids are
medically necessary, will continue to incentivize development and
use of abuse-deterrent formulations. The Committee notes that
every patient’s treatment regimen should be tailored by his or her
doctor to his or her unique needs. The Federal government, there-

fore, should promote the full suite of available treatment options,
including abstinence-based models and non-opioid medications. Fi-
nally, the Committee continues to be supportive of naloxone dis-
tribution among trained, licensed healthcare professionals and
emergency responders.
Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.—The
Committee recognizes the critical importance of preventing drug
misuse, promoting public health, and addressing the opioid crisis.
The Committee directs the FDA to study and evaluate data to de-
velop appropriate specifications for in-home disposal systems that
may be required under the Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategy (OA REMS). Any determination that the OA
REMS should be modified to include additional in-home disposal
system requirements will be communicated promptly to the manu-
facturers of those opioid analgesic products.
Optimal Timing and Sequencing of Cancer Immunotherapy.—The
Committee commends the FDA for supporting the rapid implemen-
tation of life-saving immunotherapies into the clinic. New data sug-
gests that the administration of immunotherapies early in the
treatment timeline may be able to prevent or intercept cancers be-
fore they develop into serious diseases, thus improving patient out-
comes. To support continued research, the field must develop novel
tools to efficiently run early-stage clinical trials, including biomark-
ers that can detect early disease, inform appropriate treatments,
and serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints. In addition, deter-
mination of early-stage clinical trial endpoints at large that can
characterize patient benefit are necessary for continued momen-
tum. The Committee urges FDA to provide guidance on the devel-
opment of early disease clinical trial tools, including early-stage
biomarkers and clinical endpoints.
Orange Juice.—The Committee is concerned that pests, disease,
and hurricanes are having a devastating impact on Florida’s citrus
growers and processors. These circumstances have resulted in a
natural decline in the Brix level for Florida’s mature oranges, with
no known adverse health consequences for consumers. The Com-
mittee believes it is necessary to provide for analytical deviation in
the minimum Brix level for pasteurized orange juice to account for
these naturally occurring growing conditions. The Committee en-
courages USDA and FDA to expedite work with Florida citrus
growers and processors and other stakeholders as necessary to con-
sider additional flexibility by modernizing requirements for pas-
teurized orange juice that better account for naturally occurring
Brix variation.
Orphan Products Grants Program.—The Committee continues to
support the Orphan Products Grants Program at FDA and recog-
nizes the continued advancements in the number of therapies in
development for rare disease patients.
OTC Acetaminophen Dosing Information for Children.—The
Committee continues to be concerned that Over-the-Counter (OTC)
single-ingredient acetaminophen does not contain weight-based
dosing instructions for children ages 6 months to 2 years, despite
the recommendations of the FDA Nonprescription Drugs Advisory
Committee and Pediatric Advisory Committee in 2011, which held
that data supported this information being added to the labeling.

this vulnerable population may lead to dosing errors, adverse
events, and inadequate treatment of fever and pain. While the
Committee is encouraged that FDA has included this important
issue among its annual forecast of planned monograph activities,
this list is nonbinding and the issue remains pending after multiple
decades, despite its importance for public health. As such, the Com-
mittee directs FDA to provide an update to the Committee no later
than 90 days after enactment of this Act on the timing of amending
the monograph label for acetaminophen to include weight-based
dosing instructions for children ages 6 months to 2 years.
OTC Oral Contraception.—The Committee encourages the FDA
to issue guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers on how to sub-
mit a successful prescription to OTC oral contraception products.
Outreach to Small Farmers.—The Committee expects FDA’s
Human Foods Program to provide funding for critical outreach and
training services at not less than the fiscal year 2025 level.
Ovarian Health.—The Committee recognizes that ovarian health
impacts a woman’s whole health throughout her lifetime, affecting
health of her heart, immune system, and metabolic function,
among other systems. When ovarian function declines or ceases due
to menopause, various medical conditions, or following surgery,
women are at increased risk for developing many chronic condi-
tions, including heart disease, osteoporosis, dementia, and auto-
immune diseases. Advancing knowledge and research on ovarian
health could reduce many of these chronic conditions, especially as
women age.
Over-the-Counter Diagnostic Tests.—The Committee remains con-
cerned for Americans lacking equitable access to healthcare.
Diagnostics have proven to be a critical component in protecting
public health, mitigating the spread of infectious disease, as well
as informing treatment options, yet access remains limited. The
Committee is aware of existing OTC diagnostic tests that would
improve accessibility for Americans and encourage more frequent
testing of common infections, providing an overall benefit to public
health. Additionally, the Committee directs that no later than 180
days after enactment of this Act, the agency provides a briefing on
the FDA’s efforts to expand access to OTC diagnostics, including an
update on the pipeline in general for these tests, with special atten-
tion to products that address infections for which there is no OTC
diagnostic currently authorized.
Patient Experience Data.—The Committee supports the FDA’s ef-
forts to identify patient experience data standards to inform clin-
ical research design and regulatory review under the patient-fo-
cused drug development process and to accept such data as a part
of new drug applications. The Committee also encourages FDA to
make every effort to incorporate relevant patient experience and
preference data into product labeling to better inform patients,
caregivers, and providers.
Patient Prescribing Information.—The FDA is encouraged to fi-
nalize the proposed rule for Patient Medication Information (PMI)
with an option for pharmacies to deliver PMI electronically to en-
hance patient choice, education, and medication adherence for pre-
scription drugs. This standardized information will provide patients
with clear, concise, and accessible information about their medica-
tions, including drug names, important safety information, common

side effects, and directions for use. The availability of PMI in elec-
tronic format may offer users features like adjustable text size and
language options to improve comprehension for a diverse patient
population. Importantly, patients will always have the choice of
paper information, ensuring all patients have access to their pre-
ferred format of medication information.
Pediatric Devices.—The Committee is aware of the success of the
FDA’s Pediatric Device Consortia (PDC) program and appreciates
FDA’s plans to incorporate real-world evidence demonstration
projects into the program.
Pediatric Therapies for IBD.—The Committee is concerned about
limited FDA-approved therapies to treat children impacted by Pedi-
atric IBD—also known as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis—
and the myriad challenges associated with recruiting children into
clinical trials, especially ‘‘washout’’ periods or time during which
patients must abstain from therapy to participate in trials. The
Committee is aware of FDA efforts to address these challenges
more broadly, including a recently issued final guidance on the use
of pediatric extrapolation in drug development as well as 2024
draft guidance to industry focused on developing drugs to treat pe-
diatric IBD. The Committee notes an increased reliance on extrapo-
lation and other approaches to support the approval of similar
therapies to treat other pediatric autoimmune conditions, such as
juvenile arthritis. The Committee directs FDA to build upon these
guidance documents and to work with patient, researcher, and
therapy development stakeholders to update the draft guidance
document on pediatric IBD based on emerging data and stake-
holder feedback and incorporating the potential use of other data
sources, including real-world evidence, in clinical trials for pediatric
IBD.
Pet Food Packaging.—The Committee encourages the FDA to re-
view the potential health effects of PFAS migration from pet food
packaging on animals and take any needed action to protect house-
holds from PFAS. The Committee recognizes that FDA has already
taken some steps to reduce PFAS in human food packaging and
should take further action to eliminate PFAS in animal food pack-
aging.
Pet Food Regulation.—The bill includes a provision that provides
for the modernization of the pet food and animal feed regulatory
framework. The current system has been in place since the early
1900s and no longer keeps pace with pet food and animal feed mar-
ketplace improvements. This provision does not preclude, prohibit,
or limit in any way the ability for States to continue to collect li-
censing, registration, and inspection fees necessary for the adminis-
tration of State commercial feed laws for which the purposes of
such fees range from bolstering general funds, spay and neuter ac-
tivities, and research.
Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC).—The
Committee recognizes that the PCAC established under the Drug
Quality and Security Act provides recommendations to FDA on sci-
entific, technical, and medical issues concerning drug compounding
under sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act. It is therefore vital that voting members of PCAC have
a thorough understanding of compounding to appropriately advise
FDA. The Committee encourages FDA to appoint qualified voting

members with actual and diverse experience in the preparation,
prescribing, and use of compounded medications.
Plant-Based Product Labeling.—The Committee is concerned
that the current labeling and marketing practices of some plant-
based alternatives to animal derived foods have the potential to
cause consumer confusion. The Committee directs the FDA to con-
tinue to evaluate public comment and input from interested parties
as part of the draft guidance for industry issued in January 2025
and keep the Committee informed of any updates.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).—The Committee commends
the FDA for supporting the Externally-led Patient-Focused Drug
Development (EL–PFDD) meeting on PCOS but remains concerned
that there has not been an FDA-approved treatment specific to
PCOS. The Committee encourages FDA, based on the findings of
the EL–PFDD meeting, to support incentives for investigators and
industry to develop safe, new, evidence-based therapies,
diagnostics, devices, and technologies in collaboration with pa-
tients, practitioners, and researchers that address the identified
needs and treatment priorities of PCOS patients.
Pregnancy and Lactation Registries.—The Committee recognizes
the FDA’s efforts to develop consensus standards for pregnancy and
lactation registries, including common data elements, so that reg-
istry data can be interoperable within and between such registries.
The Committee directs the FDA to continue to develop these con-
sensus standards by convening a forum including participants from
Federal agencies with experience in patient registries, including
the agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, CDC, NIH, and
others. The Forum should also include representatives of
healthcare professionals who serve pregnant and lactating women,
the pharmaceutical industry, electronic medical record companies,
and other organizations with registry experience.
Pregnant Women in Clinical Research.—The Committee remains
concerned about FDA’s failure to issue final regulations relating to
the protection of human subjects, including parts 50 and 56 of title
21, Code of Federal Regulations, with the latest regulations of the
Department of Health and Human Services relating to the inclu-
sion of pregnant women as subjects in clinical research, as required
by 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255). Despite 90 percent of
pregnant women taking prescription medication during their preg-
nancy, 70 percent of medications approved by the FDA have no
human pregnancy data and 98 percent have insufficient data to de-
termine the risk to the infant, leaving both the mother and infant
at risk to adverse health events. Following recommendations of the
Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating
Women, the Committee urges the agency to issue final regulations.
Premarket Tobacco Applications.—The Committee is concerned
that many timely filed tobacco products still await review by FDA,
and this delay in the review of filed applications is confusing con-
sumers, distributors, and manufacturers. The Committee urges
FDA to publish and regularly update guidance to communicate to
manufacturers, distributors, and retailers an enforcement discre-
tion policy for products with timely-filed and pending Premarket
Tobacco Applications (PMTAs) and to prioritize any enforcement
actions against products without pending PMTAs or that did not
file timely applications.

Quality Management Maturity (QMM).—The Committee is con-
cerned about the ongoing impacts of drug shortages, particularly
those for generic sterile injectable drugs, on patients and believes
that a key driver of these shortages is the lack of resilient supply
chains. While FDA has piloted a QMM program and launched a
voluntary QMM Prototype Assessment Protocol Evaluation Pro-
gram, the Committee believes a robust QMM program is essential
to ensuring product quality and enhancing supply chain reliability.
The Committee is eager to learn the results of the current evalua-
tion program and requests an update on this evaluation and an es-
timate of the cost to support a QMM program within 180 days of
enactment of this Act.
Quantifiable Limits Task Force.—The Committee recognizes the
growing consumer demand for American made hemp-derived prod-
ucts following the expanded legalization of hemp under the Agri-
culture Improvement Act of 2018. As the industry continues to ex-
pand to meet consumer demand, the Committee acknowledges the
need for clear, science-based guidance to ensure product safety,
consumer confidence, and regulatory clarity. To support this effort,
the Committee directs the FDA to establish a task force comprised
of industry stakeholders, including scientists, manufacturers, pub-
lic health experts, academic researchers, and other relevant parties
in the industrial hemp community. The task force should provide
input on determining the level of quantifiable amounts of
tetrahydrocannabinol or other cannabinoids in hemp-derived
cannabinoid products, as required by this Act. Further, the task
force should provide recommendations to create a minimum con-
sumer safety floor for hemp-derived cannabinoid products such as
uniform packaging, labeling, testing, and adverse event reporting.
In providing these recommendations, the task force should consider
actions taken by individual states to address consumer safety con-
cerns like quantifiable limits and age restrictions. The Committee
directs the FDA to provide an update within 180 days of enactment
of this Act on the formation and progress of the task force, with
final recommendations to be submitted within one year. In deter-
mining the quantifiable amounts, the Committee does not intend
for industrial or non-intoxicating hemp-derived cannabinoid prod-
ucts with trace or insignificant amounts of THC to be affected.
Rare Diseases.—The Committee recognizes the unique barriers to
developing innovative therapies for rare diseases. Approximately 25
to 30 million Americans suffer from a rare disease, yet only 500 out
of the 7,000 known rare conditions have an FDA-approved treat-
ment. The Committee commends FDA for its efforts to modernize
and expedite the regulatory environment for rare disease drug de-
velopment. However, the Committee is concerned that disparate
approaches to similar rare disease treatment applications between
centers pose risks to innovation. While acknowledging the auton-
omy of both CDER and CBER, particularly in their restructuring
efforts tailored to the products they review, the Committee under-
scores the necessity of a more aligned approach specifically for rare
diseases. The alignment of novel approaches to rare disease drug
development helps expedite timely access to innovative safe and ef-
fective therapies to address the urgent, unmet needs of patients liv-
ing with rare diseases. Therefore, the Committee urges CDER and

CBER to align their approach to rare disease drug approvals, to
the greatest extent possible.
Rare Mitochondrial Diseases.—The Committee is concerned
about the potential loss of access to Elamipretide for patients with
rare mitochondrial diseases for whom the drug has demonstrated
efficacy and life-sustaining benefits through the Expanded Access
Program. The Committee is aware of the FDA’s rejection of the
New Drug Application for Elamipretide under a standard review
timeline and subsequent proposal for an accelerated approval path-
way for Elamipretide. The Committee requests FDA provide a re-
port detailing a transparent overview of its review process for
Elamipretide no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act.
Real Cost Campaign.—From funds authorized for the Center for
Tobacco Products (CTP) in this bill, the Committee directs the FDA
to allocate no less funding than FY24 funding levels to maintain
the Real Cost Campaign’s national scope and public health impact
consistent with evidence-based health communication campaign
best practices.
Regional Medical Research Institutes.—Consistent with Congres-
sional intent that clinical trials include data representing diversi-
fied populations, the Committee encourages the CBER to utilize its
authority and engage with regional medical research institutes lo-
cated in medically underserved areas on best practices for expand-
ing access to and storing specimens from underrepresented popu-
lations, particularly those with high incidences of chronic disease,
located in underserved communities. The Committee requests FDA
provide a report on its intentions and progress no later than 120
days after enactment of this Act.
Seafood Product Labeling.—The Committee continues to hear
concerns with the labeling of certain foods as a fish or seafood
product when the products are highly-processed plant-based foods
rather than derived from actual fish or seafood and that the label-
ing of these products are misleading, deceptive, and confusing to
consumers. The Committee is concerned that the terms ‘‘plant-
based’’ and ‘‘vegan’’ exempt the producer from describing the actual
plant source as part of the product name, in opposition to other
FDA guidance, such as with Surimi (imitation crab), which is made
from actual fish. The Committee directs FDA to provide clarity
around the labeling of these plant-based foods and foods using sea-
food terminology to avoid consumer confusion and align with the
structure it has applied to the draft guidance for the labeling of
plant-based milk alternatives.
Shrimp Import Testing.—The Committee remains concerned
about the threats that farm-raised shrimp imports contaminated
with illegal antibiotics continue to pose to U.S. consumers and
about the low rate of testing the FDA performs on such imports.
The Committee urges FDA to complete additional testing on these
products.
Skin Lightening Products.—The Committee continues to be con-
cerned about the dangers of mercury and hydroquinone in skin
lightening products, particularly those that disproportionately tar-
get men, women, and girls of color. The Committee continues to be
concerned about the accessibility of skin-lightening products in
stores around the U.S. The Committee urges FDA to more quickly
identify unauthorized products that already exist and new products

that enter the market and to pursue all legally authorized rem-
edies to remove unauthorized products from the market. The Com-
mittee encourages FDA to educate the public on the dangers of
skin-lightening products containing mercury, hydroquinone, and
other toxic chemicals, including partnering with community-based
organizations that have historically provided services to ethnic
communities on the issue of skin-lightening and chemical expo-
sures in the past. The FDA is directed to report back within 180
days of enactment of this Act detailing how the funds provided for
this work in fiscal year 2025 were spent, including the community-
based organizations and vulnerable communities they partnered
with and how those determinations were made, the specific actions
taken to educate the public about these products, how they are
evaluating the impact and success of this public education, and any
lessons learned.
Smoking Cessation Treatment Innovation.—The Committee rec-
ognizes the important work of advancing smoking cessation treat-
ment innovation to help adult smokers be more successful in quit-
ting and the critical role of CDER in this work. The Committee fur-
ther acknowledges the agency’s October 2024 public meeting on ad-
vancing smoking cessation innovation, which underscored the im-
portance of bringing forward new pharmacotherapies for smokers
seeking to quit and the key opportunity for CDER to be more mod-
ern and efficient in its work in this area. The Committee requests
an update from CDER on new actions the Center will take to ad-
dress the sustained unmet public health needs in this space not
later than 90 days after enactment of this Act.
Sodium.—The Committee recognizes the importance of reducing
sodium in the food supply and encourages FDA to develop an over-
all sodium monitoring and evaluation plan detailing how industry
compliance with the short-term voluntary targets will be monitored
and evaluated, including how FDA will identify data sources, col-
lect and analyze data, create a timeline for assessments, and work
with industry on voluntary compliance. As part of this plan, the
Committee encourages FDA to coordinate with other government
agencies, such as USDA and CDC, on these monitoring efforts and
instructs the FDA to set a timeline for the establishment of interim
and long-term voluntary targets that would aim to fully bring so-
dium in the food supply to align with DGA recommendations.
State and Local Inspection Programs.—The Committee supports
collaboration between FDA and state and local inspection pro-
grams, noting that the majority of food processing, produce safety,
retail, and animal feed inspections occur through state and local
programs. The Committee provides $117,000,000 for Field Oper-
ations Programs for state and local programs, which are critical to
protecting the human and animal food supply and more cost-effec-
tive than FDA providing these services.
Sunscreen Regulation.—The Committee is concerned that Ameri-
cans are falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to ac-
cess to sunscreen, even though skin cancer is the most common
cancer in the U.S. According to the Surgeon General, more than
five million Americans each year are treated for skin cancer at a
cost of over eight billion dollars per year. As a result, the Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to work with stakeholders to harmonize
its approach with international testing standards to the extent pos-

sible and to ensure Americans have access to the broadest spec-
trum of sunscreens as possible recognizing the benefit of currently
marketed sunscreens as a proven preventative tool against skin
cancer when used as directed along with other sun protection
measures. In addition, the Committee urges FDA to utilize its au-
thorities provided under the CARES Act to evaluate new sunscreen
ingredients already approved for use around the world and to edu-
cate stakeholders about the administrative order process to encour-
age research and development of new sunscreen technology. The
Committee directs the FDA to provide a briefing within 90 days of
enactment of this Act on its efforts surrounding sunscreen testing
standards and new ingredients and technologies.
Toxic Elements Viability.—The Committee commends FDA’s on-
going efforts to reduce levels of toxic elements such as lead, ar-
senic, mercury, and cadmium in infant and toddler foods. The Com-
mittee expects the agency to continue partnering with other Fed-
eral agencies, academia, and other stakeholders to better under-
stand the variability of toxic element levels in different foods, in-
cluding point of origin concerns and the associated health effects.
As such, the Committee urges FDA to collaborate with USDA and
relevant stakeholders to support grower-led solutions to further re-
duce toxic element levels at the source.
Traceback.—The Committee recognizes that the ability to pre-
vent, identify, and trace back contaminated products is critical to
containing food safety outbreaks but that challenges associated
with tracing these products through the supply chain continue to
persist. The Committee is especially concerned with lead contami-
nation in certain applesauce and ground cinnamon products im-
ported into the U.S. and urges the FDA to modernize data systems
to receive, track, and process information and ensure timely notifi-
cation of significant public health threats. This ability is critical to
more proactively identify or prevent threats of contamination with
toxic chemicals that can lead to long-term adverse health effects.
Youth E-Cigarette Use.—The Committee remains deeply con-
cerned about data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey show-
ing more than 1.6 million youth use e-cigarettes and urges FDA to
use its full authority to address this serious public health problem.
The Committee urges FDA to promptly complete its required pre-
market review of e-cigarettes and other deemed tobacco products
that remain on the market. The Committee also urges FDA to take
enforcement action against all companies that failed to file a pre-
market tobacco product application or received a marketing denial
order.

Public/Private Partnerships.—The Committee recognizes the
value of public/private partnerships in financing rural communities
and facilities and recognizes that the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as
amended, provides authority for Farm Credit System institutions
to make investments in vital rural community facilities. The Com-
mittee recognizes that the FCA’s current approach to approving
these types of Farm Credit System investments on an individual
basis does not meet the needs of rural communities. The FCA is
encouraged to change its current process to create a clear, pro-
grammatic approval process which enables timely, comprehensive,
and cost-effective rural community facilities financing packages by
allowing and expediting Farm Credit System institutions’ partner-
ships with community banks, other financial institutions, and
USDA.

or other special dietary need other than a disability
described in subparagraph (A)(iii).
(ii) NOTICE.—The substitutions may be made if the
school notifies the State agency that the school is im-
plementing a variation allowed under this subpara-
graph, and if the substitution is requested by written
statement of a medical authority or by a student’s par-
ent or legal guardian that identifies the medical or
other special dietary need that restricts the student’s
diet, except that the school shall not be required to
provide beverages other than beverages the school has
identified as acceptable substitutes.

(3) Students in senior high schools that participate in the school
lunch program under this Act (and, when approved by the local
school district or nonprofit private schools, students in any other

the requirements of this subsection or the amount of payments
made under this Act to any such school for such lunch.
(4) PROVISION OF INFORMATION.—
(A) GUIDANCE.—Prior to the beginning of the school year
beginning July 2004, the Secretary shall issue guidance to

SEC. 17. (a)(1) The Secretary may enter into contracts with or
make grants to public or private organizations or agencies under
this section to undertake research that will help improve the ad-
ministration and effectiveness of the supplemental nutrition assist-
ance program in delivering nutrition-related benefits. The waiver
authority of the Secretary under subsection (b) shall extend to all
contracts and grants under this section.
(2) The Secretary may, on application, permit not more than two
State agencies to establish procedures that allow households whose
monthly supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits do not
exceed $20, at their option, to receive, in lieu of their supplemental
nutrition assistance program benefits for the initial period under
section 8 and their regular allotment in following months, and at
intervals of up to 3 months thereafter, aggregate allotments not to
exceed $60 and covering not more than 3 months’ benefits. The al-
lotments shall be provided in accordance with paragraphs (3) and
(9) of section 11(e) (except that no household shall begin to receive
combined allotments under this section until it has complied with
all applicable verification requirements of section 11(e)(3)) and

days of the last benefit issuance.
(b)(1)(A) The Secretary may conduct on a trial basis, in one or
more areas of the United States, pilot or experimental projects de-
signed to test program changes that might increase the efficiency
of the supplemental nutrition assistance program and improve the
delivery of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits to
eligible households, or improve the health of members of partici-
pating households by restricting their purchase of non-nutritious
food and beverage items, as determined by the Secretary, and may

funds made available under this Act to services or
benefits provided primarily through another pub-
lic assistance program, or using the funds for any

subject to the State or local sales tax; and
(II) the State agency conducting the demonstration project
pays the cost of any increased allotments.
(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if a waiver or demonstration project
already provides a household with assistance that exceeds that

tions made in benefits provided under this Act pursuant to part 1
of subtitle A of title I of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1981, the Food Stamp and Commodity Distribution Amendments of
1981, the Food Stamp Act Amendments of 1982, and any other
laws enacted by the Ninety-seventh Congress which affect the sup-
plemental nutrition assistance program. The study shall include a
study of the effect of retrospective accounting and periodic report-
ing procedures established under such Acts, including the impact
on benefit and administrative costs and on error rates and the de-
gree to which eligible households are denied supplemental nutri-
tion assistance program benefits for failure to file complete periodic
reports. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agri-

while ensuring that individuals receive correct benefit amounts on
a timely basis. Intelligent benefit cards developed under such a
demonstration project shall contain information, encoded on a com-
puter chip embedded in a credit card medium, including the eligi-
bility of the individual and the amount of benefits to which such
individual is entitled. Any other automated or electronic benefit de-
livery system developed under such a demonstration project shall
be able to use a plastic card to access such information from a data
file.
(g) In order to assess the effectiveness of the employment and
training programs established under section 6(d) in placing individ-
uals into the work force and withdrawing such individuals from the
supplemental nutrition assistance program, the Secretary is au-
thorized to carry out studies comparing the pre- and post-program
labor force participation, wage rates, family income, level of receipt
of supplemental nutrition assistance program and other transfer
payments, and other relevant information, for samples of partici-
pants in such employment and training programs as compared to
the appropriate control or comparison groups that did not partici-
pate in such programs. Such studies shall, to the maximum extent
possible—
(1) collect such data for up to 3 years after the individual has
completed the employment and training program; and
(2) yield results that can be generalized to the national pro-
gram as a whole.
The results of such studies and reports shall be considered in de-
veloping or updating the performance standards required under
section 6.
(h) The Secretary shall conduct a sufficient number of dem-
onstration projects to evaluate the effects, in both rural and urban
areas, of including in financial resources under section 5(g) the fair
market value of licensed vehicles to the extent the value of each
vehicle exceeds $4,500, but excluding the value of—
(1) any licensed vehicle that is used to produce earned in-
come, necessary for transportation of an elderly or physically
disabled household member, or used as the household’s home;
and
(2) one licensed vehicle used to obtain, continue, or seek em-
ployment (including travel to and from work), used to pursue
employment-related education or training, or used to secure
food or the benefits of the supplemental nutrition assistance
program.
(i) The Secretary shall conduct, under such terms and conditions
as the Secretary shall prescribe, for a period not to exceed 4 years,
projects to test allowing not more than 11,000 eligible households,
in the aggregate, to accumulate resources up to $10,000 each
(which shall be excluded from consideration as a resource) for later
expenditure for a purpose directly related to improving the edu-
cation, training, or employability (including self-employment) of
household members, for the purchase of a home for the household,
for a change of the household’s residence, or for making major re-
pairs to the household’s home.
(j) The Secretary shall use up to $4,000,000 of the funds provided
in advance in appropriations Acts for projects authorized by this

It has been nearly six months since Donald Trump was sworn in.
It has been a time of rising food and housing costs, chaos in the
federal government, new concerns about our Nation’s security, a se-
ries of chaotic tariff policies that will have disastrous effects on
American farmers and the larger economy, and a constitutional cri-
sis.
In the face of all this, the Democrats on the House Appropria-
tions Committee challenged their Republican counterparts on the
Committee to stand up to the Administration’s actions and tackle
problems facing American families and our rural communities.
They did not do so.
With the exception of two amendments, every Republican present
voted to defeat the following important Democratic amendments.
The two amendments that each received a single Republican ‘‘yes’’
vote are noted with an asterisk.
Cost of living
• Restore the bill’s cut to the WIC fruit and vegetable voucher.
• Prohibit any tariffs that raise food costs.
• Increase USDA direct loans for low-income rural families to
buy homes.*
• No dismissal of FDA staff who work to keep infant formula
safe and available.
• Ensure people with cancer don’t get thrown off SNAP if they
are subject to a work requirement when they are undergoing treat-
ment or have other related health issues.
• Prevent the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the House Repub-
lican budget bill from causing schools or students who currently
are eligible for free lunches to lose access to those benefits unless
USDA certifies no student would be cut off.
• Require USDA to submit a report to Congress on the possible
loss of small independent grocers due to the pending House Repub-
lican SNAP cuts.
Rural America
• Increase funding for rural water and waste grants that are es-
sential to helping small and lower-income communities afford safe
water services.
• Restore the Trump USDA’s abrupt termination of grants for
local foods to be purchased for food banks and schools, supporting
small farmers.*
• Require an updated study on healthcare coverage of farm oper-
ators.

• Prevent the closure of USDA Service Centers, co-located Farm
Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service offices, that
provide essential supports to producers.
• Prevent the dismissal of USDA or FDA employees working to
address ‘‘bird flu’’ in the U.S.
Oversight and stopping Trump abuses
• Prevent use of the ‘‘Deferred Resignation Program’’ in 2026,
under which federal employees are paid through the end of the fis-
cal year with no requirement to keep working at their jobs.
• Prevent the Department of Government Efficiency from having
any access to personally identifiable information about Americans.
• Restore signed agreements or contracts providing assistance to
farmers that were canceled by the Trump USDA and prohibit any
such cancellations in the future.
• Strike report language supporting an FDA re-review of the
safety of mifepristone based on a non-peer-reviewed study and re-
place it with bill language preventing FDA from any further re-
strictions on the drug.
A critical improvement was made in the manager’s amendment
by striking language that moved the Food for Peace program to the
Department of Agriculture. However, the program is still suffering
from drastic Republican funding cuts and indiscriminate firings
that will prevent it from functioning as Congress intended.
Unfortunately, many significant problems in the bill remain.
The bill provides discretionary funding of $25.5 billion, 4.4 per-
cent below the comparable level for fiscal year 2025, including sev-
eral disturbing program cuts including:
• WIC—funding is at a level that likely will not allow every eli-
gible person to participate in this vital program.
• Food for Peace—the bill provides $900 million for the Food for
Peace program, which is a $788 million cut from the enacted level,
which would bring the program to its lowest funding level since
2002.
• Staffing—there is a seven percent cut to Farm Service Agency
staffing and a five percent cut to Conservation Operations which
heavily focuses on direct technical assistance to farmers in the
field.
• FDA—is nine percent below the 2025 level.
• CFTC—the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions’ ability
to operate and to protect itself and its data from international
predatory cyber criminals is severely hampered by being funded at
eight percent below fiscal year 2025.
While the bill drops some of the policy riders from the FY 2025
House bill, it maintains others. The inclusion of riders in the FY
2026 bill only makes the path towards bipartisan agreement and
the avoidance of another continuing resolution more challenging.
Another major problem is the administration’s unconstitutional
disregard for spending laws.
This bill has been considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since taking office in January 2025, the
executive branch has been engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and
unconstitutional disregard for spending laws.

In particular, the Office of Management and Budget has been at
the center of a government-wide effort to thwart the intent of this
Committee’s laws in its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to
publish the agency’s legally binding budget decisions (known as ap-
portionments) in contravention of an unambiguous and constitu-
tionally sound assertion of the Congress’s authority to impose
transparency requirements upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all the Democrats on the Committee,
the debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just as
former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
William Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney
General with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’
The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any purpose in the bill, so too does the Committee de-
cide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling
(upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it
does so in contrast to every other instance where it has included
a specific amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear
intent to be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
In closing, we oppose the bill and will work to produce a bipar-
tisan bill in conference with an appropriate funding level.
