A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs from transmitting certain information to
the Department of Justice for use by the national instant criminal
background check system, and for other purposes.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1041, the ‘‘Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act,’’ was
introduced by Representative Mike Bost of Illinois on February 6,

Section 5:
2025. The bill, as amended, would prohibit the Secretary of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) from transmitting the name and
information of a veteran or a beneficiary of VA benefits to the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) solely on
the basis that VA has appointed them a fiduciary to help them
manage their VA benefits, unless there is an order or a finding of
a judicial authority that such veteran or beneficiary is a danger to
themselves or others. It would also require VA to notify the Attor-
ney General that the basis for all previous reporting of a veteran
to NICS solely because they were appointed a fiduciary, does not
apply or no longer applies, thereby activating the F.B.I.’s statutory
duty to update the NICS list accordingly.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

Section 6:
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans 2nd Amendment Protec-
tion Act.’’

Section 7:
Section 2: Prohibition on Secretary of Veterans Affairs Transmittal
of Certain Information to the Department of Justice for Use by
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
The Gun Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90–617) (Gun Control Act)
makes it illegal for individuals ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’
to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms and ammunition.
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Pub. L. 103–159)
(Brady Act), enacted on November 30, 1993, established the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), a com-
puter database used to store information about individuals who are
not eligible to transfer, receive, or possess firearms and ammuni-
tion. The Brady Act requires federally licensed gun dealers to use
NICS to conduct a background check on any person attempting to
purchase a firearm. State and federal agencies are required to re-
port to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the name and information
of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’
for inclusion in NICS.1
VA appoints fiduciaries for veterans and other beneficiaries of
VA benefits, who are unable to manage their VA benefits on their
1NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110–180); 18 U.S.C. § 922.

own because of a disability. Fiduciaries receive payments of VA
funds on behalf of those beneficiaries and disburse those funds for
the beneficiaries’ care and support. VA will appoint a fiduciary for
a person who is determined by a VA career employee in the Vet-
erans Benefits Administration (VBA) to be ‘‘mentally incompetent.’’
VA defines ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ in its regulation 38 C.F.R.

Section 8:
§3.353(a) as a person ‘‘who because of injury or disease lacks the
mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, in-
cluding disbursement of funds without limitation.’’
Congress did not define the term ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defec-
tive’’ in the Gun Control Act or the Brady Act. The Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) promulgated a regula-
tion, which interprets the term ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’
to mean ‘‘[a] determination by a court, board, commission, or other
lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal in-
telligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1)
Is a danger to himself or to others; or (2) Lacks the mental capacity
to contract or manage his own affairs.’’ 27 C.F.R. §478.11. VA and
ATF have concluded that a person who has been determined by VA
to be ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ has been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental de-
fective.2
As a result, for decades VA has reported the names and informa-
tion of veterans and other VA beneficiaries whom a VA bureaucrat
has determined to be ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ without a ruling by
a judge or magistrate, to the DOJ for inclusion in NICS. The deter-
mination of whether a veteran is ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ is made
by a VA bureaucrat based on a statement from a medical profes-
sional that the veteran is unable to handle their VA compensation
because of a disability. The Committee understands that these
statements do not indicate one way or the other whether the per-
son’s disability causes them to be a danger to themselves or others.
In other words, for decades VA bureaucrats have stripped over
250,000 veterans of their Constitutional right to bear arms simply
because they need assistance from a fiduciary to handle their VA
financial compensation benefits.3
Further, before VA sends their name to NICS, a veteran can only
dispute VA’s proposed determination of mental incompetency under
38 C.F.R. 3.101 and 3.353 by proving that they are able to handle
their finances. A veteran receiving VA compensation may or may
not wish to receive assistance from a VA-appointed fiduciary to
help them manage their compensation, but that is a separate issue
from whether they may wish to retain their Constitutional right to
bear arms. Only after VA has already determined them incom-
petent to handle their VA financial benefits, does a veteran have
a separate opportunity to petition VA for relief from inclusion in
NICS. The burden falls on the veteran to prove to a VA bureaucrat
that they are not a danger to themselves or others.4 The Com-
2 ATF, ‘‘Definitions for the Categories of Persons Prohibited from Receiving Firearms,’’ 62

mittee is concerned that a veteran who is appointed a fiduciary is
not provided the same Constitutional due process rights as a civil-
ian, who must be found to be a danger to themself or others by a
judge, in a court of law, before their name is transmitted to NICS.
The Committee understands that VA’s reporting practice discour-
ages veterans from seeking mental health care from VA. As Patrick
Murray, Director, National Legislative Service, Veterans of Foreign
Wars of the United States (VFW) testified: ‘‘The VFW hears from
veterans that a negative consequence of VA’s current practice is
that they are hesitant to seek mental health care because they fear
their firearms will be taken away. This has created a significant
stigma surrounding mental health and has created a barrier to
care for many.’’5
The Committee understands that VA’s NICS reporting practice
perpetuates the harmful stigma that disabled veterans are auto-
matically dangerous. The Committee also understands that no
study has been conducted on veterans with fiduciaries to determine
whether they can be presumed to be dangerous to themselves or
others.6 Therefore, there is no data to support any presumption
that disabled veterans who need help from a fiduciary to manage
their finances are at greater risk of firearm suicide or violence. In
a May 5, 2025, letter to Chairman Bost and Ranking Member
Takano from Jennifer Mathis, Deputy Director of the Bazelon Cen-
ter for Mental Health Law, Ms. Mathis stated:
The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law supports the
amended version of H.R. 1041 . . . . [VA’s NICS reporting
practice] is inconsistent with the statute it purports to im-
plement, has no evidentiary justification, wrongly perpet-
uated inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental
disabilities as dangerous, and if continued, would divert al-
ready scarce VA resources away from efforts to address the
agency’s critical mission.
Ms. Mathis further stated:
‘‘[T]he practice is an ineffective strategy to address gun
violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis, targeting individ-
uals with fiduciaries as potential perpetrators of gun vio-
lence despite the lack of any connection between a person’s
need for assistance managing V.A. benefits and dangerous-
ness or propensity to engage in gun violence . . . . [T]he
practice perpetuates the prevalent false association of
mental health disabilities with violence and undermines
important efforts to promote community integration and
employment of people with disabilities.
5Statement of Patrick Murray, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (February 25,
2025), https://docs.house.gov/meetings/VR/VR00/20250225/117899/HHRG-119-VR00-Wstate-
MurrayP-20250225.pdf.
6There is only one study that purports to find that veterans with fiduciaries are at higher
risk of firearm suicide, but this study did not actually study any veterans with fiduciaries. See
Jeffrey Swanson, et al., Informing Federal Policy on Firearm Restrictions for Veterans with Fidu-
ciaries: Risk Indicators in the Post-Deployment Mental Health Study, 45 Admin. and Policy in
Mental Health and Mental Health Services Rsch. 673, 673–83 (2018) (admitting that ‘‘[a] limita-
tion of the study is that its outcome measures . . . do not directly assess the risk of misusing
a firearm, which is the ultimate issue for NICS reporting’’; and admitting that ‘‘[t]his study was
also limited with regard to its sample and indirect measure of fiduciary need’’).

To address this issue, this section would prohibit VA from trans-
mitting information to the DOJ for use by NICS of a person solely
because VA has determined that a person requires a fiduciary to
help them manage their VA benefits, without an order or finding
of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority, that the person
is a danger to themselves or others.
The Committee believes that this section is critical to protect the
Constitutional due process rights of veterans. This change would
also ensure that veterans are not subject to different rules and
NICS reporting standards compared to civilians simply because
those veterans require a fiduciary to help them manage their VA
financial compensation benefits. This change would remove a bar-
rier to veterans seeking VA mental health care. This section would
also be a critical step towards removing the erroneous stigma that
disabled veterans are automatically dangerous.

Section 10:
Section 3: Notification of Lack of Basis for the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to Have Transmitted Certain Information to the Depart-
ment of Justice for use by the National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System
As of December 31, 2024, roughly 7.7 million individuals are in
NICS because they were ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’ by
state and territorial courts. On the other hand, roughly 206,000 in-
dividuals are in NICS pursuant to reporting by federal agencies. Of
that number, roughly 200,000 of those individuals are on NICS
pursuant to VA reporting. Thus, 97% of all the individuals included
in NICS due to federal agency reporting are from VA. As discussed
above, VA erroneously interpreted the statutory term ‘‘adjudicated
as a mental defective’’ as including persons who satisfy VA’s regu-
latory definition of ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ under 38 C.F.R.

Section 11:
§3.353(a).
To address the hundreds of thousands of VA beneficiaries have
been already added to NICS solely because they require a fidu-
ciary, this section would require VA to notify the Attorney General,
in accordance with the notification requirement in 34 U.S.C.

Section 12:
§40901(e)(1)(D) that the basis for reporting beneficiaries to NICS
since November 30, 1993, solely because they have a fiduciary, does
not apply or no longer applies. This notification would require the
F.B.I. to update the NICS list accordingly.
The Committee believes that this section is important because it
would remedy the past due process and Second Amendment rights
violations of hundreds of thousands of veterans already in NICS
solely because they required a fiduciary. Veterans on the NICS list
solely for this reason would be removed, thereby restoring their
Constitutional right to purchase and possess firearms to protect
themselves and their families. Veterans on the NICS list for other
reasons—i.e., because another federal agency or state or territorial
court found them to be a danger to themselves or others and ‘‘adju-
dicated them as a mental defective’’—would not be removed from
the NICS list under this section.

Section 13:
Section 4: Determination by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that
a Person is Mentally Incompetent is Insufficient to Treat Such
Person as a Mental Defective
As discussed above, VA erroneously interpreted Congress’s intent
when it interpreted the statutory ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defec-
tive’’ as including persons who satisfy VA’s regulatory definition of
‘‘mentally incompetent’’ under 38 C.F.R. §3.353(a) and who there-
fore require a fiduciary to help them manage their finances.
To address this issue, this section would prohibit the Secretary
from treating a person as having been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental de-
fective’’ solely on the basis such person meets the definition of
‘‘mentally incompetent’’ under 38 C.F.R. §3.353(a) and requires a
fiduciary.
The Committee believes that this section is critical to ensure that
statutory category of ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’ is never
again misinterpreted by VA as including VA benefits beneficiaries
who simply require a fiduciary to help them manage their VA bene-
fits.

COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion with a quorum being present, and ordered H.R. 1041, as
amended, be reported favorably to the House of Representatives by
a recorded vote of 13 ayes, 11 noes. During consideration of the bill,
the following amendments were considered:
An amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1041 of-
fered by Chairman Bost to require VA to notify the Attorney
General that the basis for all previous reporting of veterans to
NICS, solely because they have a fiduciary, does not apply or
no longer applies. This would also prohibit the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs from treating any veteran as ‘‘a person adju-
dicated as amental defective,’’ solely because that veteran has
a fiduciary. This amendment in the nature of a substitute was
agreed to by a recorded vote of 13 ayes, 11 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Representative Morrison to
provide the following exceptions to the NICS reporting prohibi-
tion under the bill: exceptions for a beneficiary who has been
diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mental illness with psychotic
features, dementia of any type, Alzheimer’s disease,
frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Prion disease, advanced
Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. The amend-
ment was not agreed to by a recorded vote of 11 ayes, 13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Ranking Member Takano
to replace sections two through four of the amendment in the
nature of a substitute, with provisions that would require VA,
when determining whether a veteran is mentally competent to
handle their VA funds, to make an additional determination as
to whether the veteran is a danger to themselves or others.
Such determination would be based on opinion(s) from a li-
censed mental health professional, and if it is determined that
the veteran is not a danger to themselves or others, VA would
be prohibited from submitting their name to NICS solely be-
cause the veteran is unable to manage their VA funds. Fur-
ther, if it is determined that a beneficiary is not a danger to
themselves or others, the amendment would allow VA to still
determine that a beneficiary is not mentally competent to man-
age their VA benefits. The amendment was not agreed to by
a recorded vote of 11 ayes, 13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Representative McGarvey
to require the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
(CAVC) be the judicial body that must issue an order or find-
ing that the person is a danger to themselves or others. The

amendment would also require the CAVC to establish expe-
dited procedures for making such orders or findings. The
amendment was not agreed to by a recorded vote of 11 ayes,
13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Representative Morrison to
prohibit VA from sending names for removal from NICS until
after the VA Secretary submits to Congress certification in
writing that the underlying legislation’s implementation will
not lead to an increase in the rate of death by suicide using
a firearm among veterans who have VA-assigned fiduciaries.
The amendment was not agreed to by a recorded vote of 11
ayes, 13 noes.
A motion by Representative Bergman to report H.R. 1041, as
amended, favorably to the House of Representatives was agreed to
by a recorded vote of 13 ayes, 11 noes.
COMMITTEE VOTES

tives requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the mo-

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 1041, as amended, are to ensure that veterans
and their families can access their VA benefits without any viola-
tion of their Constitutional rights and that prior violations of their
Constitutional rights are remedied.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 1041, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the Congressional Budget Of-
fice cost estimate on this measure.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST
ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1041,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

22
H.R. 1041 would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) from reporting certain information to the Department of Jus-
tice (DOJ) for use in the National Instant Criminal Background
Check System (NICS). That system is used by licensed firearms
dealers to determine whether a person can legally purchase a fire-
arm.
VA appoints fiduciaries to manage benefits for people who have
been determined unable to manage benefits on their own. Under
current law, in some cases, VA reports that information to the
NICS. As a result of that reporting, a person may be deemed ineli-
gible to purchase a firearm. (The Full-Year Continuing Appropria-
tions and Extensions Act, 2025, prohibits the department from
making such reports in the current fiscal year.)
Under the bill, VA would be prohibited from transmitting infor-
mation to the NICS about a person solely because a fiduciary man-
ages their VA benefits. The department could make such a report,
however, if a judge finds that the person poses a danger to them-
selves or others. VA must also notify DOJ that any information
previously transmitted about people who use a fiduciary no longer
applies. CBO estimates that implementing the bill could reduce ad-
ministrative costs by decreasing VA’s reporting to the NICS. Con-
versely, VA could incur additional costs for seeking judicial findings
that a person poses a danger and should be reported to the NICS.
CBO estimates that, in either case, the net change in spending
would not be significant. Any related spending would be subject to
appropriation.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Logan Smith. The esti-
mate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.

MINORITY VIEWS
On May 6, 2025, the full House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs
met in open markup and considered H.R. 1041, the Veterans 2nd
Amendment Protection Act, introduced by Chairman Mike Bost.
The measure was ordered favorably reported to the full House,
with an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, on a straight
party line vote, with Committee Democrats united in opposition.
Sadly, this legislation not only carries forward the Majority’s
flawed and dangerous language from H.R. 7051 in the previous
Congress, but H.R. 1041 as reported expands that language to in-
clude new provisions which exacerbate the increased risk of harm
inherent in the underlying legislation. Accordingly, Committee
Democrats have, and must continue to, reject this legislation.
As with previous versions of this bill, H.R. 1041 would prevent
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from reporting informa-
tion on a beneficiary in its Fiduciary Program to the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) without a deter-
mination from a judicial body that the beneficiary poses a potential
danger to themselves or others. This provision is based on several
false premises: (1) that VA’s Fiduciary Program bases its decisions
on financial acumen, (2) that there is insufficient due process in
VA’s system to protect the constitutional rights of beneficiaries,
and (3) that only judicial review is sufficient to satisfy due process.
Regarding the first premise: according to VA’s testimony in this
and previous years, as well as program guidelines, decisions on
whether to appoint a fiduciary for a beneficiary are based on the
medical evidence on record, not a math test. It is that medical evi-
dence, which often includes a mental health diagnosis such as
schizophrenia, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease
and others, which leads VA to adjudicate that a beneficiary is un-
able to manage their own finances.
On the second: regarding the due process protections already
built into VA’s system in compliance with the Administrative Pro-
cedures Act (APA) and the NICS Improvement Amendments Act
(NIAA)2, veterans and other beneficiaries currently have signifi-
cant avenues for redress. VA notifies beneficiaries of the con-
sequences of their proposed determination, including NICS report-
ing requirements as required by the APA and the NIAA. They may
then appeal both the determination to appoint a fiduciary, and the
subsequent reporting to NICS, independently of one another and at
several points in the process. Moreover, decisions regarding VA
benefits determinations are already able to be appealed to judicial
authorities such as the Court of Appeals for Veterans’ Claims and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

And with respect to the third premise: in Welch v. US (1985), the
First Circuit stated, ‘‘All due process requires is that a statutory
prohibition be . . . set out in terms that the ordinary person exer-
cising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and com-
ply with, without sacrifice to the public interest.’’3 NIAA requires
VA to give multiple notices, both oral and written, that mention
what the term ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’ means and how
it applies to beneficiaries, what penalties there are for violating it,
and what relief from such disability with respect to firearms is
available under federal law, even before any proceedings to adju-
dicate a person as a ‘‘mental defective’’ begins.
VA is also required to follow the 21st Century Cures Act,4 which
codified existing procedural due process policies and regulations of
the VA, which is in line with the Fifth Amendment Due Process
Clause’s notice and fair warning requirements. VA has to provide
a notice of the proposed determination and all supporting evidence,
and an opportunity for the beneficiary to request a hearing, be rep-
resented by counsel and present evidence, including from a medical
professional. NIAA also requires the VA to notify beneficiaries as-
signed a fiduciary of the ramifications of metal incompetency deter-
minations and the possible loss of their gun rights due to their
name being placed in NICS. So, VA’s administrative processes
clearly satisfy constitutional muster with respect to due process.
As mentioned previously, the reported language of H.R. 1041
goes beyond the addition of a layer of judicial review on an already
lengthy and rigorous process. This bill also contains a provision to
make it effective retroactively. This would mean all beneficiaries
currently on the NICS list because of VA reporting would be re-
moved upon enactment, without any consideration of whether or
not that person warrants removal or poses a danger to themselves
or others. This is contrary to the Majority’s stated desire for these
determinations of ‘‘dangerousness’’ for new transmittals and rep-
resents a dangerous level of uncertainty.
Additionally, this bill clumsily attempts to sever the link between
VA’s mental competency determinations, and the definition of ‘‘ad-
judicated as mental defective’’ under the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act and the Gun Control Act.5 According to VA’s testi-
mony before the Committee, the language in the bill is insufficient
to accomplish the goal. The Minority concurs with this interpreta-
tion and would add that the language in the bill would only serve
to put beneficiaries at risk of unwittingly committing a felony. By
no longer being on the NICS list, while still being considered ineli-
gible to purchase and own a firearm, beneficiaries may attempt
and even succeed in purchasing a firearm. Therefore violating the
law and making them subject to prosecution.
Lastly, there is one aspect of the Majority’s arguments about this
bill that the Minority does agree with. The stigma around seeking
mental health help for fear of losing Second Amendment rights is
real and deserves to be addressed in a meaningful way. However,
it is part of the broader issue of misinformation and disinformation
propagated online and elsewhere. It is a perception issue that the

Majority and, unfortunately, many Veterans Service Organizations
are perpetuating, both through this bill and in their failure to de-
nounce the rumors as untrue. In fact, there are documented great-
er hurdles to seeking care including convenience and cost. And the
Minority will note that the Veterans Health Administration, where
veterans would be receiving mental healthcare, plays absolutely no
role in the Fiduciary Process and does not ever report patients to
NICS. Moreover, according to recent Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion data,6 beneficiaries reported to NICS by VA make up only
199,455 or 0.6 percent of a total 33,025,815 of entries in the data-
base.
During full Committee markup on this measure, Committee
Democrats offered several amendments in an attempt to improve
the legislation. Those amendments included, among others, an
amendment that would strike the underlying bill and replace it
with language stating that VA cannot report beneficiaries to NICS
until obtaining a secondary mental health determination, and an
amendment to exempt those with the most serious mental health
conditions from the underlying bill’s prohibition on NICS reporting.
Committee Democrats felt both those amendments would have sig-
nificantly improved the underlying bill and struck a fair balance
between the Majority’s desire to expand firearms ownership and
Committee Democrats’ desire to protect beneficiaries and those
around them from the potential for harm. As in the past, both
amendments were voted down on a party-line roll call vote, along
with many other amendments that would have marked a much-
needed shift away from the Majority’s wrongheaded policy choice.
For these reasons and more, Committee Democrats continue to
oppose this legislation. We will recommend the broader House re-
ject the measure should it come to the floor of the full House for
consideration.

Amend the title so as to read:
A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs from transmitting certain information to
the Department of Justice for use by the national instant criminal
background check system, and for other purposes.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1041, the ‘‘Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act,’’ was
introduced by Representative Mike Bost of Illinois on February 6,
2025. The bill, as amended, would prohibit the Secretary of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) from transmitting the name and
information of a veteran or a beneficiary of VA benefits to the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) solely on
the basis that VA has appointed them a fiduciary to help them
manage their VA benefits, unless there is an order or a finding of
a judicial authority that such veteran or beneficiary is a danger to
themselves or others. It would also require VA to notify the Attor-
ney General that the basis for all previous reporting of a veteran
to NICS solely because they were appointed a fiduciary, does not
apply or no longer applies, thereby activating the F.B.I.’s statutory
duty to update the NICS list accordingly.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans 2nd Amendment Protec-
tion Act.’’
Section 2: Prohibition on Secretary of Veterans Affairs Transmittal
of Certain Information to the Department of Justice for Use by
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
The Gun Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90–617) (Gun Control Act)
makes it illegal for individuals ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’
to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms and ammunition.
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Pub. L. 103–159)
(Brady Act), enacted on November 30, 1993, established the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), a com-
puter database used to store information about individuals who are
not eligible to transfer, receive, or possess firearms and ammuni-
tion. The Brady Act requires federally licensed gun dealers to use
NICS to conduct a background check on any person attempting to
purchase a firearm. State and federal agencies are required to re-
port to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the name and information
of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’
for inclusion in NICS.1
VA appoints fiduciaries for veterans and other beneficiaries of
VA benefits, who are unable to manage their VA benefits on their
1NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110–180); 18 U.S.C. § 922.

own because of a disability. Fiduciaries receive payments of VA
funds on behalf of those beneficiaries and disburse those funds for
the beneficiaries’ care and support. VA will appoint a fiduciary for
a person who is determined by a VA career employee in the Vet-
erans Benefits Administration (VBA) to be ‘‘mentally incompetent.’’
VA defines ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ in its regulation 38 C.F.R.
§3.353(a) as a person ‘‘who because of injury or disease lacks the
mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, in-
cluding disbursement of funds without limitation.’’
Congress did not define the term ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defec-
tive’’ in the Gun Control Act or the Brady Act. The Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) promulgated a regula-
tion, which interprets the term ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’
to mean ‘‘[a] determination by a court, board, commission, or other
lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal in-
telligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1)
Is a danger to himself or to others; or (2) Lacks the mental capacity
to contract or manage his own affairs.’’ 27 C.F.R. §478.11. VA and
ATF have concluded that a person who has been determined by VA
to be ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ has been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental de-
fective.2
As a result, for decades VA has reported the names and informa-
tion of veterans and other VA beneficiaries whom a VA bureaucrat
has determined to be ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ without a ruling by
a judge or magistrate, to the DOJ for inclusion in NICS. The deter-
mination of whether a veteran is ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ is made
by a VA bureaucrat based on a statement from a medical profes-
sional that the veteran is unable to handle their VA compensation
because of a disability. The Committee understands that these
statements do not indicate one way or the other whether the per-
son’s disability causes them to be a danger to themselves or others.
In other words, for decades VA bureaucrats have stripped over
250,000 veterans of their Constitutional right to bear arms simply
because they need assistance from a fiduciary to handle their VA
financial compensation benefits.3
Further, before VA sends their name to NICS, a veteran can only
dispute VA’s proposed determination of mental incompetency under
38 C.F.R. 3.101 and 3.353 by proving that they are able to handle
their finances. A veteran receiving VA compensation may or may
not wish to receive assistance from a VA-appointed fiduciary to
help them manage their compensation, but that is a separate issue
from whether they may wish to retain their Constitutional right to
bear arms. Only after VA has already determined them incom-
petent to handle their VA financial benefits, does a veteran have
a separate opportunity to petition VA for relief from inclusion in
NICS. The burden falls on the veteran to prove to a VA bureaucrat
that they are not a danger to themselves or others.4 The Com-

mittee is concerned that a veteran who is appointed a fiduciary is
not provided the same Constitutional due process rights as a civil-
ian, who must be found to be a danger to themself or others by a
judge, in a court of law, before their name is transmitted to NICS.
The Committee understands that VA’s reporting practice discour-
ages veterans from seeking mental health care from VA. As Patrick
Murray, Director, National Legislative Service, Veterans of Foreign
Wars of the United States (VFW) testified: ‘‘The VFW hears from
veterans that a negative consequence of VA’s current practice is
that they are hesitant to seek mental health care because they fear
their firearms will be taken away. This has created a significant
stigma surrounding mental health and has created a barrier to
care for many.’’5
The Committee understands that VA’s NICS reporting practice
perpetuates the harmful stigma that disabled veterans are auto-
matically dangerous. The Committee also understands that no
study has been conducted on veterans with fiduciaries to determine
whether they can be presumed to be dangerous to themselves or
others.6 Therefore, there is no data to support any presumption
that disabled veterans who need help from a fiduciary to manage
their finances are at greater risk of firearm suicide or violence. In
a May 5, 2025, letter to Chairman Bost and Ranking Member
Takano from Jennifer Mathis, Deputy Director of the Bazelon Cen-
ter for Mental Health Law, Ms. Mathis stated:
The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law supports the
amended version of H.R. 1041 . . . . [VA’s NICS reporting
practice] is inconsistent with the statute it purports to im-
plement, has no evidentiary justification, wrongly perpet-
uated inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental
disabilities as dangerous, and if continued, would divert al-
ready scarce VA resources away from efforts to address the
agency’s critical mission.
Ms. Mathis further stated:
‘‘[T]he practice is an ineffective strategy to address gun
violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis, targeting individ-
uals with fiduciaries as potential perpetrators of gun vio-
lence despite the lack of any connection between a person’s
need for assistance managing V.A. benefits and dangerous-
ness or propensity to engage in gun violence . . . . [T]he
practice perpetuates the prevalent false association of
mental health disabilities with violence and undermines
important efforts to promote community integration and
employment of people with disabilities.
5Statement of Patrick Murray, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (February 25,
2025), https://docs.house.gov/meetings/VR/VR00/20250225/117899/HHRG-119-VR00-Wstate-
MurrayP-20250225.pdf.
6There is only one study that purports to find that veterans with fiduciaries are at higher
risk of firearm suicide, but this study did not actually study any veterans with fiduciaries. See
Jeffrey Swanson, et al., Informing Federal Policy on Firearm Restrictions for Veterans with Fidu-
ciaries: Risk Indicators in the Post-Deployment Mental Health Study, 45 Admin. and Policy in
Mental Health and Mental Health Services Rsch. 673, 673–83 (2018) (admitting that ‘‘[a] limita-
tion of the study is that its outcome measures . . . do not directly assess the risk of misusing
a firearm, which is the ultimate issue for NICS reporting’’; and admitting that ‘‘[t]his study was
also limited with regard to its sample and indirect measure of fiduciary need’’).

To address this issue, this section would prohibit VA from trans-
mitting information to the DOJ for use by NICS of a person solely
because VA has determined that a person requires a fiduciary to
help them manage their VA benefits, without an order or finding
of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority, that the person
is a danger to themselves or others.
The Committee believes that this section is critical to protect the
Constitutional due process rights of veterans. This change would
also ensure that veterans are not subject to different rules and
NICS reporting standards compared to civilians simply because
those veterans require a fiduciary to help them manage their VA
financial compensation benefits. This change would remove a bar-
rier to veterans seeking VA mental health care. This section would
also be a critical step towards removing the erroneous stigma that
disabled veterans are automatically dangerous.
Section 3: Notification of Lack of Basis for the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to Have Transmitted Certain Information to the Depart-
ment of Justice for use by the National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System
As of December 31, 2024, roughly 7.7 million individuals are in
NICS because they were ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’ by
state and territorial courts. On the other hand, roughly 206,000 in-
dividuals are in NICS pursuant to reporting by federal agencies. Of
that number, roughly 200,000 of those individuals are on NICS
pursuant to VA reporting. Thus, 97% of all the individuals included
in NICS due to federal agency reporting are from VA. As discussed
above, VA erroneously interpreted the statutory term ‘‘adjudicated
as a mental defective’’ as including persons who satisfy VA’s regu-
latory definition of ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ under 38 C.F.R.
§3.353(a).
To address the hundreds of thousands of VA beneficiaries have
been already added to NICS solely because they require a fidu-
ciary, this section would require VA to notify the Attorney General,
in accordance with the notification requirement in 34 U.S.C.
§40901(e)(1)(D) that the basis for reporting beneficiaries to NICS
since November 30, 1993, solely because they have a fiduciary, does
not apply or no longer applies. This notification would require the
F.B.I. to update the NICS list accordingly.
The Committee believes that this section is important because it
would remedy the past due process and Second Amendment rights
violations of hundreds of thousands of veterans already in NICS
solely because they required a fiduciary. Veterans on the NICS list
solely for this reason would be removed, thereby restoring their
Constitutional right to purchase and possess firearms to protect
themselves and their families. Veterans on the NICS list for other
reasons—i.e., because another federal agency or state or territorial
court found them to be a danger to themselves or others and ‘‘adju-
dicated them as a mental defective’’—would not be removed from
the NICS list under this section.

Section 4: Determination by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that
a Person is Mentally Incompetent is Insufficient to Treat Such
Person as a Mental Defective
As discussed above, VA erroneously interpreted Congress’s intent
when it interpreted the statutory ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defec-
tive’’ as including persons who satisfy VA’s regulatory definition of
‘‘mentally incompetent’’ under 38 C.F.R. §3.353(a) and who there-
fore require a fiduciary to help them manage their finances.
To address this issue, this section would prohibit the Secretary
from treating a person as having been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental de-
fective’’ solely on the basis such person meets the definition of
‘‘mentally incompetent’’ under 38 C.F.R. §3.353(a) and requires a
fiduciary.
The Committee believes that this section is critical to ensure that
statutory category of ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’ is never
again misinterpreted by VA as including VA benefits beneficiaries
who simply require a fiduciary to help them manage their VA bene-
fits.

COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion with a quorum being present, and ordered H.R. 1041, as
amended, be reported favorably to the House of Representatives by
a recorded vote of 13 ayes, 11 noes. During consideration of the bill,
the following amendments were considered:
An amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1041 of-
fered by Chairman Bost to require VA to notify the Attorney
General that the basis for all previous reporting of veterans to
NICS, solely because they have a fiduciary, does not apply or
no longer applies. This would also prohibit the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs from treating any veteran as ‘‘a person adju-
dicated as amental defective,’’ solely because that veteran has
a fiduciary. This amendment in the nature of a substitute was
agreed to by a recorded vote of 13 ayes, 11 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Representative Morrison to
provide the following exceptions to the NICS reporting prohibi-
tion under the bill: exceptions for a beneficiary who has been
diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mental illness with psychotic
features, dementia of any type, Alzheimer’s disease,
frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Prion disease, advanced
Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. The amend-
ment was not agreed to by a recorded vote of 11 ayes, 13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Ranking Member Takano
to replace sections two through four of the amendment in the
nature of a substitute, with provisions that would require VA,
when determining whether a veteran is mentally competent to
handle their VA funds, to make an additional determination as
to whether the veteran is a danger to themselves or others.
Such determination would be based on opinion(s) from a li-
censed mental health professional, and if it is determined that
the veteran is not a danger to themselves or others, VA would
be prohibited from submitting their name to NICS solely be-
cause the veteran is unable to manage their VA funds. Fur-
ther, if it is determined that a beneficiary is not a danger to
themselves or others, the amendment would allow VA to still
determine that a beneficiary is not mentally competent to man-
age their VA benefits. The amendment was not agreed to by
a recorded vote of 11 ayes, 13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Representative McGarvey
to require the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
(CAVC) be the judicial body that must issue an order or find-
ing that the person is a danger to themselves or others. The

amendment would also require the CAVC to establish expe-
dited procedures for making such orders or findings. The
amendment was not agreed to by a recorded vote of 11 ayes,
13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 1041 was offered by Representative Morrison to
prohibit VA from sending names for removal from NICS until
after the VA Secretary submits to Congress certification in
writing that the underlying legislation’s implementation will
not lead to an increase in the rate of death by suicide using
a firearm among veterans who have VA-assigned fiduciaries.
The amendment was not agreed to by a recorded vote of 11
ayes, 13 noes.
A motion by Representative Bergman to report H.R. 1041, as
amended, favorably to the House of Representatives was agreed to
by a recorded vote of 13 ayes, 11 noes.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 1041, as amended, are to ensure that veterans
and their families can access their VA benefits without any viola-
tion of their Constitutional rights and that prior violations of their
Constitutional rights are remedied.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 1041, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the Congressional Budget Of-
fice cost estimate on this measure.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST
ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1041,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

H.R. 1041 would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) from reporting certain information to the Department of Jus-
tice (DOJ) for use in the National Instant Criminal Background
Check System (NICS). That system is used by licensed firearms
dealers to determine whether a person can legally purchase a fire-
arm.
VA appoints fiduciaries to manage benefits for people who have
been determined unable to manage benefits on their own. Under
current law, in some cases, VA reports that information to the
NICS. As a result of that reporting, a person may be deemed ineli-
gible to purchase a firearm. (The Full-Year Continuing Appropria-
tions and Extensions Act, 2025, prohibits the department from
making such reports in the current fiscal year.)
Under the bill, VA would be prohibited from transmitting infor-
mation to the NICS about a person solely because a fiduciary man-
ages their VA benefits. The department could make such a report,
however, if a judge finds that the person poses a danger to them-
selves or others. VA must also notify DOJ that any information
previously transmitted about people who use a fiduciary no longer
applies. CBO estimates that implementing the bill could reduce ad-
ministrative costs by decreasing VA’s reporting to the NICS. Con-
versely, VA could incur additional costs for seeking judicial findings
that a person poses a danger and should be reported to the NICS.
CBO estimates that, in either case, the net change in spending
would not be significant. Any related spending would be subject to
appropriation.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Logan Smith. The esti-
mate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.

Director, Congressional Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Con-
trol Act (as amended by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandate
Reform Act, P.L. 104–4 is inapplicable to H.R. 1041, as amended.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act would be created by H.R. 1041, as
amended.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H.R. 1041, as amended, does not relate
to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public serv-
ices or accommodations within the meaning of section102(b)(3) of
the Congressional Accountability Act.
STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1041, as amended, would establish or reauthorize a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal

ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 would establish the short title of the bill as the ‘‘Vet-
erans 2nd Amendment Protection Act.’’
Section 2. Prohibition on Secretary of Veterans Affairs transmittal
of certain information to the Department of Justice for use by
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
Section 2 would amend Title 38, U.S. Code, Chapter 55, by cre-
ating a new section 5501B that would prohibit VA from transmit-
ting to any entity in the DOJ, for use by NICS, the names and per-
sonally identifiable information of a beneficiary of VA benefits for
whom VA has assigned a fiduciary to assist with their VA benefits
under 38 U.S.C. §5502, unless there is an order or finding of a
judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority, that such beneficiary
is a danger to themselves or others.
Section 3. Notification of lack of basis for the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to have transmitted certain information to the Depart-
ment of Justice for use by the National Instance Criminal Back-
ground Check System
Section 3 would amend Title 38, U.S. Code, Chapter 55, by cre-
ating a new section 5501C that would require VA, within 30 days
of enactment, to notify the Attorney General, in accordance with 34
U.S.C. §40901(e)(1)(D), that the basis for the transmittal of a bene-
ficiary’s personal information to the DOJ for use by NICS solely be-
cause VA has determined that beneficiary requires a fiduciary, does
not apply, or no longer applies.
Section 4. Determination by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that
a person is mentally incompetent is insufficient to treat such
person as a mental defective
Section 4 would amend Title 38, U.S. Code, Chapter 55 by cre-
ating a new section 5501D that would prohibit VA from treating a
person as having been adjudicated as a mental defective, solely be-
cause that person is mentally incompetent under 38 C.F.R. §3.353
or requires a fiduciary under section 5502 of title 38.

MINORITY VIEWS
On May 6, 2025, the full House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs
met in open markup and considered H.R. 1041, the Veterans 2nd
Amendment Protection Act, introduced by Chairman Mike Bost.
The measure was ordered favorably reported to the full House,
with an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, on a straight
party line vote, with Committee Democrats united in opposition.
Sadly, this legislation not only carries forward the Majority’s
flawed and dangerous language from H.R. 7051 in the previous
Congress, but H.R. 1041 as reported expands that language to in-
clude new provisions which exacerbate the increased risk of harm
inherent in the underlying legislation. Accordingly, Committee
Democrats have, and must continue to, reject this legislation.
As with previous versions of this bill, H.R. 1041 would prevent
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from reporting informa-
tion on a beneficiary in its Fiduciary Program to the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) without a deter-
mination from a judicial body that the beneficiary poses a potential
danger to themselves or others. This provision is based on several
false premises: (1) that VA’s Fiduciary Program bases its decisions
on financial acumen, (2) that there is insufficient due process in
VA’s system to protect the constitutional rights of beneficiaries,
and (3) that only judicial review is sufficient to satisfy due process.
Regarding the first premise: according to VA’s testimony in this
and previous years, as well as program guidelines, decisions on
whether to appoint a fiduciary for a beneficiary are based on the
medical evidence on record, not a math test. It is that medical evi-
dence, which often includes a mental health diagnosis such as
schizophrenia, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease
and others, which leads VA to adjudicate that a beneficiary is un-
able to manage their own finances.
On the second: regarding the due process protections already
built into VA’s system in compliance with the Administrative Pro-
cedures Act (APA) and the NICS Improvement Amendments Act
(NIAA)2, veterans and other beneficiaries currently have signifi-
cant avenues for redress. VA notifies beneficiaries of the con-
sequences of their proposed determination, including NICS report-
ing requirements as required by the APA and the NIAA. They may
then appeal both the determination to appoint a fiduciary, and the
subsequent reporting to NICS, independently of one another and at
several points in the process. Moreover, decisions regarding VA
benefits determinations are already able to be appealed to judicial
authorities such as the Court of Appeals for Veterans’ Claims and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

And with respect to the third premise: in Welch v. US (1985), the
First Circuit stated, ‘‘All due process requires is that a statutory
prohibition be . . . set out in terms that the ordinary person exer-
cising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and com-
ply with, without sacrifice to the public interest.’’3 NIAA requires
VA to give multiple notices, both oral and written, that mention
what the term ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective’’ means and how
it applies to beneficiaries, what penalties there are for violating it,
and what relief from such disability with respect to firearms is
available under federal law, even before any proceedings to adju-
dicate a person as a ‘‘mental defective’’ begins.
VA is also required to follow the 21st Century Cures Act,4 which
codified existing procedural due process policies and regulations of
the VA, which is in line with the Fifth Amendment Due Process
Clause’s notice and fair warning requirements. VA has to provide
a notice of the proposed determination and all supporting evidence,
and an opportunity for the beneficiary to request a hearing, be rep-
resented by counsel and present evidence, including from a medical
professional. NIAA also requires the VA to notify beneficiaries as-
signed a fiduciary of the ramifications of metal incompetency deter-
minations and the possible loss of their gun rights due to their
name being placed in NICS. So, VA’s administrative processes
clearly satisfy constitutional muster with respect to due process.
As mentioned previously, the reported language of H.R. 1041
goes beyond the addition of a layer of judicial review on an already
lengthy and rigorous process. This bill also contains a provision to
make it effective retroactively. This would mean all beneficiaries
currently on the NICS list because of VA reporting would be re-
moved upon enactment, without any consideration of whether or
not that person warrants removal or poses a danger to themselves
or others. This is contrary to the Majority’s stated desire for these
determinations of ‘‘dangerousness’’ for new transmittals and rep-
resents a dangerous level of uncertainty.
Additionally, this bill clumsily attempts to sever the link between
VA’s mental competency determinations, and the definition of ‘‘ad-
judicated as mental defective’’ under the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act and the Gun Control Act.5 According to VA’s testi-
mony before the Committee, the language in the bill is insufficient
to accomplish the goal. The Minority concurs with this interpreta-
tion and would add that the language in the bill would only serve
to put beneficiaries at risk of unwittingly committing a felony. By
no longer being on the NICS list, while still being considered ineli-
gible to purchase and own a firearm, beneficiaries may attempt
and even succeed in purchasing a firearm. Therefore violating the
law and making them subject to prosecution.
Lastly, there is one aspect of the Majority’s arguments about this
bill that the Minority does agree with. The stigma around seeking
mental health help for fear of losing Second Amendment rights is
real and deserves to be addressed in a meaningful way. However,
it is part of the broader issue of misinformation and disinformation
propagated online and elsewhere. It is a perception issue that the

Majority and, unfortunately, many Veterans Service Organizations
are perpetuating, both through this bill and in their failure to de-
nounce the rumors as untrue. In fact, there are documented great-
er hurdles to seeking care including convenience and cost. And the
Minority will note that the Veterans Health Administration, where
veterans would be receiving mental healthcare, plays absolutely no
role in the Fiduciary Process and does not ever report patients to
NICS. Moreover, according to recent Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion data,6 beneficiaries reported to NICS by VA make up only
199,455 or 0.6 percent of a total 33,025,815 of entries in the data-
base.
During full Committee markup on this measure, Committee
Democrats offered several amendments in an attempt to improve
the legislation. Those amendments included, among others, an
amendment that would strike the underlying bill and replace it
with language stating that VA cannot report beneficiaries to NICS
until obtaining a secondary mental health determination, and an
amendment to exempt those with the most serious mental health
conditions from the underlying bill’s prohibition on NICS reporting.
Committee Democrats felt both those amendments would have sig-
nificantly improved the underlying bill and struck a fair balance
between the Majority’s desire to expand firearms ownership and
Committee Democrats’ desire to protect beneficiaries and those
around them from the potential for harm. As in the past, both
amendments were voted down on a party-line roll call vote, along
with many other amendments that would have marked a much-
needed shift away from the Majority’s wrongheaded policy choice.
For these reasons and more, Committee Democrats continue to
oppose this legislation. We will recommend the broader House re-
ject the measure should it come to the floor of the full House for
consideration.
