COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the Chinese Communist Party has infil-
trated American K–12 schools through grants, sister school part-
nerships, and other programming called Confucius Classrooms,
which is a trojan horse for Chinese propaganda.
CHINA’S ACTIVITY IN U.S. K–12 SCHOOLS
Styled as language and culture programs, Confucius Classrooms
are an important element of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP)
global influence campaign. The Chinese government’s effort to
forge ties with American schools through its Ministry of Education
Office of Chinese Language Council International, which until re-
cently was known as ‘‘Hanban,’’ is one facet of the CCP’s broader
soft-power strategy to influence policy in nations throughout the
world. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on In-
vestigations found that expanding Confucius Classrooms in the
United States has been a top priority for the Chinese government.1
Many K–12 schools eagerly accepted CCP-linked grants, which
came with perks including fully funded teacher exchanges, Chinese
language programs, and opportunities for American students to
learn in China.2
Confucious Classrooms are smaller-scale, K–12 versions of
Confucious Institutes that the CCP has pushed for on U.S. college
campuses. These institutes purport to teach Chinese language and
culture. Confucius Institutes are established as partnerships be-
tween a host institution, a Chinese partner (usually a Chinese uni-
versity), and a Chinese government agency. The Ministry of Edu-
cation Office of Chinese Language Council International funds each
Confucius Institute, often at around $100,000 per year, and asks
host institutions to match those funds with their own contributions,
usually classroom and office space.

China heavily encouraged the creation of Confucius Classrooms,
and many of these developed as offshoots of a Confucius Institute.
China strategically deployed and rapidly expanded their Confucius
Classrooms, going from very few in 2008 to more than a thousand
worldwide by 2017. More than 500 American K–12 schools have
hosted Confucius Classrooms, aided in part by the Asia Society, an
American nonprofit that previously ran a network of 100 Confucius
Classrooms before they ended the partnership in 2021.3 A Parents
Defending Education report tracked Chinese affiliation in 143
schools across 34 states, with at least seven still active as of publi-
cation.4
Confucius Institute funding comes with strings attached that
compromise academic freedom. The Chinese government approves
teachers, events, and speakers and requires teachers to sign same
contracts pledging they will not damage the national interests of
China. The contracts make clear Chinese directors or teachers will
be terminated if they ‘‘violate Chinese laws’’ or ‘‘engage in activities
detrimental to national interests’’ and states that they must ‘‘con-
scientiously safeguard national interests.’’5
OTHER COUNTRIES’ INFLUENCE IN US K–12 SCHOOLS
While it appears that no other country has a program similar in
scope and size to the CCP’s propaganda campaign in American
schools, other countries have also invested in language and cultural
educational programs in American K–12 schools.
One notable example is Qatar. The Qatar Foundation, along with
its subsidiaries like Qatar Foundation International and the Qatar
National Research Fund, has been actively involved in influencing
American K–12 education through financial partnerships with indi-
vidual schools.6 From 2009 to 2017, the Qatar Foundation allocated
$30.6 million to various schools across 12 U.S. states. The funds
are predominantly directed towards facilitating Arabic language
programs, and they cover expenses for teacher education, mate-
rials, and salaries. These contributions have taken various forms,
from direct funds to professional development initiatives, such as
teacher councils and language conferences. Additionally, there are
instances of school districts, like the Tucson Unified School District
and New Haven Public Schools, receiving substantial grants over
multiple years.7
Other countries have also made notable donations to U.S. K–12
schools. After the May 8, 2024, subcommittee hearing on anti-
semitism in K–12 schools, then-New York City Public Schools
Chancellor David Banks informed Committee staff that the Italian-
American Committee on Education, which is connected to the
Italian government, contributed $257,000 to New York City Public
Schools from 2021 to 2024. Chancellor Banks also reported that the
Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in New York contrib-
uted $16,000 to support Korean instruction and programming in

New York City Public Schools. It is unclear the extent to which
these foreign ties had been publicized prior to the Committee’s re-
quest for information.8
It is imperative to ensure that American students are not subject
to malicious foreign influence in their schools. As such, the CLASS
Act requires school districts to disclose to the Secretary of Edu-
cation within 30 days any instance of receiving funding from or en-
tering into a contract with a foreign source. The written disclosure
must include the name and country of origin of the foreign source,
the amount of funds received, and any terms and conditions that
apply to the funds.
CONCLUSION
It is unacceptable that foreign adversaries such as the CCP are
attempting to influence U.S. K–12 schools. Congress should take
immediate action to ensure that students are not being indoctri-
nated with communist propaganda. Congress should also take ac-
tion to ensure that foreign influence is fully disclosed. The CLASS
Act will help ensure that the Chinese government does not take ad-
vantage of local school districts and that the U.S. Department of
Education is aware of all significant spending by foreign countries
in the U.S. K–12 education system.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1005 is to require K–
12 school districts to disclose the receipt of funding from foreign
governments.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 1005 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 1005: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1005 would require all public elementary and secondary
schools that receive funding from the Department of Education to
disclose to the department funds received from or contracts signed
with foreign sources that are more than $10,000.
CBO expects that schools would comply with the new require-
ments; thus, enacting the bill would not affect their eligibility to re-
ceive federal funds. Based on the costs of similar activities, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost the Department of
Education less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any re-
lated spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Garrett Quenneville.
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(l) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs that
would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1005. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 1005, as reported by the Committee, makes no changes to
existing law.

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1005, the Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School
Systems (CLASS) Act, requires public elementary and secondary
schools to disclose any receipt of funds ‘‘in excess of $10,000 in the
aggregate from a foreign source, or entering into one or more con-
tracts with an aggregate value in excess of $10,000 with a foreign
source’’,1 to the Secretary of Education within 30 days of receiving
funds as a condition of receiving federal funds. The Majority claims
the only way to tackle ‘‘nefarious foreign influence’’ in K–12 class-
rooms is by ‘‘ensuring no federal education funds go to schools that
collaborate with, receiving funding from or otherwise engage in
agreements with the People’s Republic of China.’’2 Yet, it has not
proven foreign influence exists in public schools, leaves raises a
number of administrative questions and concerns for public schools,
and ignores real issues facing public education.
SUMMARY OF CONCERNS
Foreign influence has not posed a threat to K–12 classrooms
Confucius Classrooms, which are affiliated with Confucious Insti-
tutes, are centers for Chinese culture and language established at
public and private elementary and secondary schools—either to bol-
ster a Chinese language program already at the school or to start
a new one. Many countries around the world lack quality Chinese
language and culture resources and Confucious Institutes and
Classrooms provide those resources for free.3 However, over nearly
five years, the number of U.S. Confucius Classrooms has dropped
from more than 500 to currently no more than 16.4 Experts have
summed up the current state of these programs, saying ‘‘[t]he
harsh reality is that Confucius Institutes/Confucius Classrooms
stepped up to fulfill a need that governments were not—and they
were happy to accept a ‘freebie,’ . . . . Now that Confucius Insti-
tutes have been tainted by wider distaste and suspicion of the Chi-
nese government, this ‘freebie’ now has a cost.’’5

Parents Defending Education (PDE), a right-wing non-profit or-
ganization, published a report in July 2023 entitled, ‘‘Little Red
Classrooms: China’s Infiltration of American K–12 Schools.’’ The
report cites the mere presence of Confucius Institutes, Confucius
Classrooms, and related ‘‘programming’’ (including local program-
ming that may have pre-dated the establishment of a Confucius
Classroom), sometimes in areas near U.S. military bases, to allege
the Classrooms exert undue Chinese influence in America.6 Despite
the claims in the report, Committee Democratic staff have been un-
able to locate credible evidence to support either the claims made
by the Majority or PDE that there is inappropriate and undue for-
eign influence in our nation’s K–12 public schools currently as a re-
sult of Confucius Classrooms. In 2019, the Senate Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ (HSGAC) Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing entitled ‘‘Chi-
na’s Impact on the U.S. Education System’’. The hearing was held
the day after the HSGAC released a bipartisan staff report with
the same title.7 While the staff report made recommendations that
schools should ensure that Chinese partnership organization’s ‘‘vet-
ting, screening and interview processes are aligned with their own
hiring protocols and procedures’’8 and that ‘‘the State Department
should demand reciprocal and fair treatments of its diplomats and
employees in China.’’,9 the Committee did not find security risks or
curriculum vulnerability, as claimed by the Majority.
H.R. 1005 Will Raise Administrative Questions and Concerns for
Public Schools
Republicans argue schools should come into compliance with
H.R. 1005 without additional financial resources to fund staff, mon-
itor programs, and provide other necessary support to ensure such
compliance. The overwhelming majority of K–12 schools are not
equipped to identify where their donors are from. For example, a
parent who is not yet a U.S. citizen could potentially be ‘‘foreign
source’’ or a donation from a local business that is owned by some-
one who is not a U.S. citizen also could be a ‘‘foreign source’’. Addi-
tionally, many construction and other infrastructure related busi-
nesses a school might have common interaction with (e.g., roofing,
HVAC) could be ‘‘foreign sources’’ as defined in the bill. However,
citizenship information is not a consideration taken by most schools
when receiving donations, planning to purchase materials to up-
date buildings, or contracting with companies. If H.R. 1005 were to
become law, schools may establish a formal process to ascertain
this data. But, without resources to support such formal processes,
we can expect to see a general disincentive to contract with, or ac-
cept donations from anyone who looks or sounds ‘‘foreign’’, for fear
of losing federal financial assistance.
Additionally, the bill does not mention the roles of local edu-
cational agencies (LEAs) and state education agencies (SEAs) in

this process. Typically, LEAs and SEAs distribute Federal financial
assistance to schools in the form of services after they receive funds
from ED. The main pathway that has funds move directly from ED
to schools is Title I–A, adding to the confusion this bill would
bring.10
H.R. 1005 Does Nothing to Address Current Issues in Public Edu-
cation
There are real issues facing public education that Americans are
concerned about, such as inadequate early childhood education,
achievement gaps, teacher shortages, and unfettered access to
guns. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation,
guns are the leading cause of death among children and teens.11
According to data provided by Everytown—a gun violence preven-
tion organization—‘‘[i]n 2023, there were at least 158 incidents of
gunfire on school grounds, resulting in 45 deaths and 106 injuries
nationally.’’12 However, the Majority chooses to spend its time fo-
cusing on issues that do not present challenges for students or the
public education system. Foreign influence is not mentioned as a
top concern in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
Report on the Condition of Education 2024.13 This sort of legisla-
tion does not address the root cause of issues that are harming stu-
dents or assist with helping our students learn. Similar to H.R.
1049, the Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Com-
munist Teachings (PROTECT) Act, and H.R. 1069, the Trans-
parency in Reporting Adversarial Contributions to Education
(TRACE) Act—two bills also considered in the same markup with
H.R. 1005—this bill is a solution in search of a problem and does
nothing to benefit students or the public education system.
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENT OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1005
Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–VA) put forward an amend-
ment to provide funds to assist with the administrative burden of
complying with the bill. Significant effort may need to be expended
to investigate existing and new contracts, to determine whether ex-
isting or potential business partners are foreign governments or
‘‘foreign entities of concern’’, to create and maintain systems to
keep track of all the new information and respond to inquiries and
to train staff in each school on on the reporting and compliance re-
quirements of the bill. This amendment authorized $300 million for
fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent fiscal year to carry out the
requirements in the bill—providing on average approximately
$3,000 to every public school in America to assist with coming into
compliance with H.R. 1005.14 Committee Republicans rejected this
amendment.

Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) put forward an
amendment designed to ensure the Department of Education, and
no other agency, is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of
this legislation. Over the past several weeks, President Trump has
suggested he will have a plan soon to eliminate the Department of
Education, calling into question how this bill would be adminis-
tered. Yet H.R. 1005 specifically calls for funds that are adminis-
tered by the Department of Education to be withheld if schools do
not comply. Therefore, the Bonamici amendment sought to ensure
that the Department be the sole agency empowered to enforce the
bill. However, Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on
a party-line vote.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1005 is a solution in search of a problem. While the Major-
ity claims adversarial governments are abusing U.S. laws due to
exerting influence through shady financial contributions to public
schools; it has not proven any foreign influence even exists. Fur-
thermore, the bill raises a number of administrative questions and
concerns for public schools, while doing nothing to address real
issues facing public education. For the reasons stated above, we
urge the House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 1005.

dollars would provide $3000 per year to each of those schools to offset the costs of compliance.
In reality, the administrative burden this bill poses could easily require a full time administra-
tive staff person at each school. Providing a modest salary of $50,000 to each of those schools
for such a position would cost approximately 5 billion dollars.

COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the Chinese Communist Party has infil-
trated American K–12 schools through grants, sister school part-
nerships, and other programming called Confucius Classrooms,
which is a trojan horse for Chinese propaganda.
CHINA’S ACTIVITY IN U.S. K–12 SCHOOLS
Styled as language and culture programs, Confucius Classrooms
are an important element of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP)
global influence campaign. The Chinese government’s effort to
forge ties with American schools through its Ministry of Education
Office of Chinese Language Council International, which until re-
cently was known as ‘‘Hanban,’’ is one facet of the CCP’s broader
soft-power strategy to influence policy in nations throughout the
world. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on In-
vestigations found that expanding Confucius Classrooms in the
United States has been a top priority for the Chinese government.1
Many K–12 schools eagerly accepted CCP-linked grants, which
came with perks including fully funded teacher exchanges, Chinese
language programs, and opportunities for American students to
learn in China.2
Confucious Classrooms are smaller-scale, K–12 versions of
Confucious Institutes that the CCP has pushed for on U.S. college
campuses. These institutes purport to teach Chinese language and
culture. Confucius Institutes are established as partnerships be-
tween a host institution, a Chinese partner (usually a Chinese uni-
versity), and a Chinese government agency. The Ministry of Edu-
cation Office of Chinese Language Council International funds each
Confucius Institute, often at around $100,000 per year, and asks
host institutions to match those funds with their own contributions,
usually classroom and office space.

China heavily encouraged the creation of Confucius Classrooms,
and many of these developed as offshoots of a Confucius Institute.
China strategically deployed and rapidly expanded their Confucius
Classrooms, going from very few in 2008 to more than a thousand
worldwide by 2017. More than 500 American K–12 schools have
hosted Confucius Classrooms, aided in part by the Asia Society, an
American nonprofit that previously ran a network of 100 Confucius
Classrooms before they ended the partnership in 2021.3 A Parents
Defending Education report tracked Chinese affiliation in 143
schools across 34 states, with at least seven still active as of publi-
cation.4
Confucius Institute funding comes with strings attached that
compromise academic freedom. The Chinese government approves
teachers, events, and speakers and requires teachers to sign same
contracts pledging they will not damage the national interests of
China. The contracts make clear Chinese directors or teachers will
be terminated if they ‘‘violate Chinese laws’’ or ‘‘engage in activities
detrimental to national interests’’ and states that they must ‘‘con-
scientiously safeguard national interests.’’5
OTHER COUNTRIES’ INFLUENCE IN US K–12 SCHOOLS
While it appears that no other country has a program similar in
scope and size to the CCP’s propaganda campaign in American
schools, other countries have also invested in language and cultural
educational programs in American K–12 schools.
One notable example is Qatar. The Qatar Foundation, along with
its subsidiaries like Qatar Foundation International and the Qatar
National Research Fund, has been actively involved in influencing
American K–12 education through financial partnerships with indi-
vidual schools.6 From 2009 to 2017, the Qatar Foundation allocated
$30.6 million to various schools across 12 U.S. states. The funds
are predominantly directed towards facilitating Arabic language
programs, and they cover expenses for teacher education, mate-
rials, and salaries. These contributions have taken various forms,
from direct funds to professional development initiatives, such as
teacher councils and language conferences. Additionally, there are
instances of school districts, like the Tucson Unified School District
and New Haven Public Schools, receiving substantial grants over
multiple years.7
Other countries have also made notable donations to U.S. K–12
schools. After the May 8, 2024, subcommittee hearing on anti-
semitism in K–12 schools, then-New York City Public Schools
Chancellor David Banks informed Committee staff that the Italian-
American Committee on Education, which is connected to the
Italian government, contributed $257,000 to New York City Public
Schools from 2021 to 2024. Chancellor Banks also reported that the
Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in New York contrib-
uted $16,000 to support Korean instruction and programming in

New York City Public Schools. It is unclear the extent to which
these foreign ties had been publicized prior to the Committee’s re-
quest for information.8
It is imperative to ensure that American students are not subject
to malicious foreign influence in their schools. As such, the CLASS
Act requires school districts to disclose to the Secretary of Edu-
cation within 30 days any instance of receiving funding from or en-
tering into a contract with a foreign source. The written disclosure
must include the name and country of origin of the foreign source,
the amount of funds received, and any terms and conditions that
apply to the funds.
CONCLUSION
It is unacceptable that foreign adversaries such as the CCP are
attempting to influence U.S. K–12 schools. Congress should take
immediate action to ensure that students are not being indoctri-
nated with communist propaganda. Congress should also take ac-
tion to ensure that foreign influence is fully disclosed. The CLASS
Act will help ensure that the Chinese government does not take ad-
vantage of local school districts and that the U.S. Department of
Education is aware of all significant spending by foreign countries
in the U.S. K–12 education system.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause (3)(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 1005 is to require K–
12 school districts to disclose the receipt of funding from foreign
governments.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
No provision of H.R. 1005 establishes or reauthorizes a program
of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Fed-
eral program, a program that was included in any report from the
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section
21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program iden-
tified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
STATEMENT OF OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE COMMITTEE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
body of this report.
REQUIRED COMMITTEE HEARING
In compliance with clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII the following hear-
ing held during the 119th Congress was used to develop or consider
H.R. 1005: On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Education and
Workforce held a hearing on ‘‘The State of American Education.’’
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the
Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1005 would require all public elementary and secondary
schools that receive funding from the Department of Education to
disclose to the department funds received from or contracts signed
with foreign sources that are more than $10,000.
CBO expects that schools would comply with the new require-
ments; thus, enacting the bill would not affect their eligibility to re-
ceive federal funds. Based on the costs of similar activities, CBO
estimates that implementing the bill would cost the Department of
Education less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any re-
lated spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Garrett Quenneville.
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(l) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs that
would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 1005. However, clause
3(d)(2)(B) of that Rule provides that this requirement does not
apply when, as with the present report, the Committee adopts as
its own the cost estimate for the bill prepared by the Director of
the Congressional Budget Office.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
H.R. 1005, as reported by the Committee, makes no changes to
existing law.

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
H.R. 1005, the Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School
Systems (CLASS) Act, requires public elementary and secondary
schools to disclose any receipt of funds ‘‘in excess of $10,000 in the
aggregate from a foreign source, or entering into one or more con-
tracts with an aggregate value in excess of $10,000 with a foreign
source’’,1 to the Secretary of Education within 30 days of receiving
funds as a condition of receiving federal funds. The Majority claims
the only way to tackle ‘‘nefarious foreign influence’’ in K–12 class-
rooms is by ‘‘ensuring no federal education funds go to schools that
collaborate with, receiving funding from or otherwise engage in
agreements with the People’s Republic of China.’’2 Yet, it has not
proven foreign influence exists in public schools, leaves raises a
number of administrative questions and concerns for public schools,
and ignores real issues facing public education.
SUMMARY OF CONCERNS
Foreign influence has not posed a threat to K–12 classrooms
Confucius Classrooms, which are affiliated with Confucious Insti-
tutes, are centers for Chinese culture and language established at
public and private elementary and secondary schools—either to bol-
ster a Chinese language program already at the school or to start
a new one. Many countries around the world lack quality Chinese
language and culture resources and Confucious Institutes and
Classrooms provide those resources for free.3 However, over nearly
five years, the number of U.S. Confucius Classrooms has dropped
from more than 500 to currently no more than 16.4 Experts have
summed up the current state of these programs, saying ‘‘[t]he
harsh reality is that Confucius Institutes/Confucius Classrooms
stepped up to fulfill a need that governments were not—and they
were happy to accept a ‘freebie,’ . . . . Now that Confucius Insti-
tutes have been tainted by wider distaste and suspicion of the Chi-
nese government, this ‘freebie’ now has a cost.’’5

Parents Defending Education (PDE), a right-wing non-profit or-
ganization, published a report in July 2023 entitled, ‘‘Little Red
Classrooms: China’s Infiltration of American K–12 Schools.’’ The
report cites the mere presence of Confucius Institutes, Confucius
Classrooms, and related ‘‘programming’’ (including local program-
ming that may have pre-dated the establishment of a Confucius
Classroom), sometimes in areas near U.S. military bases, to allege
the Classrooms exert undue Chinese influence in America.6 Despite
the claims in the report, Committee Democratic staff have been un-
able to locate credible evidence to support either the claims made
by the Majority or PDE that there is inappropriate and undue for-
eign influence in our nation’s K–12 public schools currently as a re-
sult of Confucius Classrooms. In 2019, the Senate Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ (HSGAC) Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing entitled ‘‘Chi-
na’s Impact on the U.S. Education System’’. The hearing was held
the day after the HSGAC released a bipartisan staff report with
the same title.7 While the staff report made recommendations that
schools should ensure that Chinese partnership organization’s ‘‘vet-
ting, screening and interview processes are aligned with their own
hiring protocols and procedures’’8 and that ‘‘the State Department
should demand reciprocal and fair treatments of its diplomats and
employees in China.’’,9 the Committee did not find security risks or
curriculum vulnerability, as claimed by the Majority.
H.R. 1005 Will Raise Administrative Questions and Concerns for
Public Schools
Republicans argue schools should come into compliance with
H.R. 1005 without additional financial resources to fund staff, mon-
itor programs, and provide other necessary support to ensure such
compliance. The overwhelming majority of K–12 schools are not
equipped to identify where their donors are from. For example, a
parent who is not yet a U.S. citizen could potentially be ‘‘foreign
source’’ or a donation from a local business that is owned by some-
one who is not a U.S. citizen also could be a ‘‘foreign source’’. Addi-
tionally, many construction and other infrastructure related busi-
nesses a school might have common interaction with (e.g., roofing,
HVAC) could be ‘‘foreign sources’’ as defined in the bill. However,
citizenship information is not a consideration taken by most schools
when receiving donations, planning to purchase materials to up-
date buildings, or contracting with companies. If H.R. 1005 were to
become law, schools may establish a formal process to ascertain
this data. But, without resources to support such formal processes,
we can expect to see a general disincentive to contract with, or ac-
cept donations from anyone who looks or sounds ‘‘foreign’’, for fear
of losing federal financial assistance.
Additionally, the bill does not mention the roles of local edu-
cational agencies (LEAs) and state education agencies (SEAs) in

this process. Typically, LEAs and SEAs distribute Federal financial
assistance to schools in the form of services after they receive funds
from ED. The main pathway that has funds move directly from ED
to schools is Title I–A, adding to the confusion this bill would
bring.10
H.R. 1005 Does Nothing to Address Current Issues in Public Edu-
cation
There are real issues facing public education that Americans are
concerned about, such as inadequate early childhood education,
achievement gaps, teacher shortages, and unfettered access to
guns. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation,
guns are the leading cause of death among children and teens.11
According to data provided by Everytown—a gun violence preven-
tion organization—‘‘[i]n 2023, there were at least 158 incidents of
gunfire on school grounds, resulting in 45 deaths and 106 injuries
nationally.’’12 However, the Majority chooses to spend its time fo-
cusing on issues that do not present challenges for students or the
public education system. Foreign influence is not mentioned as a
top concern in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
Report on the Condition of Education 2024.13 This sort of legisla-
tion does not address the root cause of issues that are harming stu-
dents or assist with helping our students learn. Similar to H.R.
1049, the Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Com-
munist Teachings (PROTECT) Act, and H.R. 1069, the Trans-
parency in Reporting Adversarial Contributions to Education
(TRACE) Act—two bills also considered in the same markup with
H.R. 1005—this bill is a solution in search of a problem and does
nothing to benefit students or the public education system.
DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENT OFFERED DURING MARKUP OF H.R. 1005
Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D–VA) put forward an amend-
ment to provide funds to assist with the administrative burden of
complying with the bill. Significant effort may need to be expended
to investigate existing and new contracts, to determine whether ex-
isting or potential business partners are foreign governments or
‘‘foreign entities of concern’’, to create and maintain systems to
keep track of all the new information and respond to inquiries and
to train staff in each school on on the reporting and compliance re-
quirements of the bill. This amendment authorized $300 million for
fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent fiscal year to carry out the
requirements in the bill—providing on average approximately
$3,000 to every public school in America to assist with coming into
compliance with H.R. 1005.14 Committee Republicans rejected this
amendment.

Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D–OR) put forward an
amendment designed to ensure the Department of Education, and
no other agency, is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of
this legislation. Over the past several weeks, President Trump has
suggested he will have a plan soon to eliminate the Department of
Education, calling into question how this bill would be adminis-
tered. Yet H.R. 1005 specifically calls for funds that are adminis-
tered by the Department of Education to be withheld if schools do
not comply. Therefore, the Bonamici amendment sought to ensure
that the Department be the sole agency empowered to enforce the
bill. However, Committee Republicans rejected this amendment on
a party-line vote.
CONCLUSION
H.R. 1005 is a solution in search of a problem. While the Major-
ity claims adversarial governments are abusing U.S. laws due to
exerting influence through shady financial contributions to public
schools; it has not proven any foreign influence even exists. Fur-
thermore, the bill raises a number of administrative questions and
concerns for public schools, while doing nothing to address real
issues facing public education. For the reasons stated above, we
urge the House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 1005.

(2023), https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23—216.10.asp. Three hundred million
dollars would provide $3000 per year to each of those schools to offset the costs of compliance.
In reality, the administrative burden this bill poses could easily require a full time administra-
tive staff person at each school. Providing a modest salary of $50,000 to each of those schools
for such a position would cost approximately 5 billion dollars.
