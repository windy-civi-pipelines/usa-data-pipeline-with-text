UNITED STATES RESEARCH PROTECTION ACT OF 2025
JULY22, 2025—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 769]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 769) to amend the Research and De-
velopment, Competition, and Innovation Act to clarify the defini-
tion of foreign country for purposes of malign foreign talent recruit-
ment restriction, and for other purposes, having considered the
same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and rec-
ommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 769 is to amend the Research and Develop-
ment, Competition, and Innovation Act1 to strengthen protections
for U.S. research by clarifying the definition of the term ‘‘foreign
country of concern’’ and identifying restricted programs, positions,
and activities linked to malign foreign talent recruitment.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
The Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation
Act2—part of the CHIPS and Science Act3—prohibits federally
funded researchers from participating in malign foreign talent re-
cruitment programs.4 The Act’s language does not clearly define
whether such programs include situations where entities linked to
142 U.S.C 18901 et seq.

foreign countries of concern provide indirect support to researchers,
which is a potential loophole. This bill would aim to clarify that
ambiguity.
Foreign talent programs, run by foreign countries, offer incen-
tives or compensation for activities, such as sharing proprietary in-
formation and intellectual property.5 A key reason behind strength-
ening research security was concern over China’s Thousand Talents
Program. Between 2008 and 2018, China used this program to re-
cruit elite scientists, many of whom were U.S.-trained, with gen-
erous financial incentives.6 One renowned Harvard chemist work-
ing on federally funded nanotechnology research received $50,000
per month, $150,000 in living expenses, and $1.5 million to estab-
lish a lab at Wuhan University of Technology—leveraging U.S.-
based knowledge and research.7
The Thousand Talents Program is not a new concept and is only
one of the many iterations of the Chinese foreign talent program.
In 2022, Strider Technologies, an intelligence firm based in Utah,
published a report revealing that at least 162 scientists from Los
Alamos National Laboratory returned to China between 1987 and
2021.8 Many later supported China’s military advancements in
fields such as hypersonics and submarine technology.9 The report
exposed China’s systematic recruitment strategy, which included
lucrative financial incentives to exploit expertise acquired at the
U.S. Department of Energy lab for strategic gain. The Research
and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act largely ad-
dressed these concerns, and this bill refines that Act to clarify
questions that have been raised during implementation.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 769 would do the following:
• Clarify the definition of malign foreign talent recruitment pro-
gram to cover a ‘‘foreign country of concern’’, rather than a
‘‘foreign country’’.
• Expand restrictions to cover benefits provided directly or indi-
rectly by a foreign country of concern or an entity based in,
funded by, or affiliated with a foreign country of concern.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 769, United States Research Protection Act of 2025, was intro-
duced on February 27, 2025, by Senator Cornyn (for himself and
Senator Padilla) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Senator Curtis was
added as a cosponsor. On April 30, 2025, the Committee met in
open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 769 reported
favorably without amendment.

H.R. 1318, a House companion bill to S. 769, was introduced on
February 13, 2025, by Representative Kennedy (for himself and
Representative Stevens) and was referred to the Committee on
Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives.
On March 24, 2025, the House passed H.R. 1318 by voice vote.
118th Congress
H.R. 7686, a bill to amend the Research and Development, Com-
petition, and Innovation Act to clarify the definition of foreign
country for purposes of malign foreign talent recruitment restric-
tion, and for other purposes, was introduced on March 15, 2024, by
Representative Garcia (CA) (for himself and Representative Ste-
vens) and was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology of the House of Representatives. On March 30, 2024,
the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by vote of 38–
0, ordered H.R. 7686 reported favorably with an amendment (in the
nature of a substitute). On September 9, 2024, H.R. 7686 passed
the House under suspension of the rules by voice vote.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 769 would clarify that the prohibition on receiving benefits re-
lated to participation in programs sponsored by foreign countries
for researchers who receive federal funds includes the indirect pro-
vision of such benefits. CBO estimates that implementing S. 769
would have no effect on the federal budget over the 2025–2030 pe-
riod.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Johnny Willing. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
NUMBER OF PERSONS COVERED
S. 769 would cover a broader range of individuals and entities by
clarifying that the term ‘‘foreign country of concern’’ includes those
indirectly affiliated with malign foreign talent recruitment pro-
grams. This expansion may subject additional foreign institutions,
researchers, and associated programs to scrutiny under existing
federal restrictions on participation in federally funded research.
While the bill would not create new categories of regulated persons,
it extends the reach of current law to ensure more comprehensive
oversight of foreign influence in U.S. research enterprises.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
S. 769 would have a minimal impact on the U.S. economy. By
clarifying the definition of the term ‘‘foreign country of concern’’ to
include indirect affiliations, the bill would close a loophole that has
allowed adversaries to exploit U.S. research. These safeguards
would help better prevent theft of critical technologies, strengthen
innovation security, and ensure that the economic benefits of U.S.
research remain in the domestic economy.
PRIVACY
S. 769 would have no impact on the personal privacy of individ-
uals and does not provide any additional requirements or allow-
ances that would impact business privacy. The bill would not au-
thorize new data collection or require the disclosure of private in-
formation by individuals, institutions, or businesses. It would focus
solely on clarifying eligibility restrictions related to foreign talent
recruitment and does not expand any reporting or surveillance au-
thorities.
PAPERWORK
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work burdens resulting from the passage of this legislation.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘United States Research Protection Act of 2025’’.

Section 2. Clarification of definition of foreign country for purposes
of malign foreign talent recruitment restriction
This section would amend the Research and Development, Com-
petition, and Innovation Act10 to extend research partnership re-
strictions to entities funded or affiliated with foreign countries of
concern, even if not designated as talent programs. This section
would also redefine the term ‘‘malign foreign talent recruitment
program’’ to include any program, position, or activity that provides
direct or indirect support from a foreign country of concern.
Lastly, this section would prohibit foreign actors from exploiting
loopholes to access U.S. research and innovation.

Rules of the Senate, changes in existing law made by the bill, as
