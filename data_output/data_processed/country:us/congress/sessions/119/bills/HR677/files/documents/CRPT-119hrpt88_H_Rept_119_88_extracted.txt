R E P O R T
together with
ADDITIONAL VIEWS
[To accompany H.R. 677]
The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the
bill (H.R. 677) to establish a process to expedite the review of ap-
peals of certain decisions by the Department of the Interior, having
considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an amendment
and recommends that the bill as amended do pass.
The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:

Section 2:
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expedited Appeals Review Act’’ or the ‘‘EARA’’.
SEC. 2. EXPEDITED REVIEWS.
(a) REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED REVIEW.—A party that files an appeal of a Depart-
ment of the Interior decision described under section 4.1(b)(2) of title 43, Code of
Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), with the Board of Land Appeals
may submit to the Board of Land Appeals written notice of such party’s intent to
seek expedited review of the appeal. If a party submits such written notice, the
Board of Land Appeals shall issue a final decision on the appeal by not later than
the date that is 6 months after the date on which such written notice is received,
except such deadline may not be earlier than the date that is 18 months after the
date on which the appeal was initially filed with the Board of Land Appeals.
(b) NOFINALDECISION.—If the Board of Land Appeals does not issue a final deci-
sion on an appeal by the deadline described in subsection (a)—
(1) the Department of the Interior decision is deemed to be a final agency ac-

(1) is pending before the Board of Land Appeals as of the date of enactment
of this Act; or
(2) is filed with the Board of Land Appeals after the date of enactment of this
Act.
(d) CONFLICT.—In the event of a conflict between the deadline described in sub-

Section 3:
section (a) and a deadline under section 115(h) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty
Management Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1724(h)) or section 525(b) of the Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1275(b)), the deadline described in
subsection (a) shall control.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 677 is to establish a process to expedite the
review of appeals of certain decisions by the Department of the In-
terior.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
H.R. 677, sponsored by Representative Hageman, would force the
U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Interior Board of Land Ap-
peals (IBLA) to issue final decisions within six months upon re-
quest, ensuring that appeals are heard by DOI in a timely manner.
The IBLA is an appellate review board within DOI that is re-
sponsible for resolving disputes involving public lands and natural
resources under DOI’s jurisdiction. Appeals involving grazing, min-
ing, energy development, royalty disbursement and management,
timber harvesting, wildfire management, land exchanges, rights of
way, and trespass are decided by the IBLA.1
The IBLA’s lengthy examination process has resulted in over 650
backlogged appeals dating back to 2014.2 The IBLA’s deference to
original bureau decisions is also significant. According to the IBLA
Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2023, the IBLA ruled in favor of the
respective bureaus roughly 90 percent of the time.3 Moreover,
IBLA’s decisions are based upon bureau-curated administrative
records with limited opportunities for appellants to supplement or
challenge the record. These processes can disincentivize stake-
holders from pursuing appeals, as the outcome is often predictably
aligned with the agency’s stance.
H.R. 677, the ‘‘Expedited Appeals Review Act,’’ seeks to mitigate
these issues by creating a predictable alternative path for appel-
lants seeking expedited reviews. The bill allows stakeholders to re-
quest an accelerated decision on their appeal and forces IBLA to
issue a decision within six months of such a request. If this dead-
line is not met, the agency decision will automatically become eligi-
ble for de novo judicial review outside of DOI.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 677 was introduced on January 23, 2025, by Representative
Harriet Hageman (R–WY). The bill was referred to the Committee
on Natural Resources. On April 9, 2025, the Committee on Natural
Resources met to consider the bill. Representative Harriet
Hageman (R–WY) offered an Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-
stitute designated Hagemanl049 ANS. The Amendment in the

Nature of a Substitute was agreed to by unanimous consent. The
bill, as amended, was ordered favorably reported to the House of
Representatives by unanimous consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing in the 118th Congress by the Subcommittee on Energy and
Mineral Resources held on November 19, 2024.

Section 1. Short title

Section 6:
Section 1 names the bill the ‘‘Expedited Appeals Review Act’’ or
the ‘‘EARA’’.

Section 7:
Section 2. Expedited reviews

Section 8:
Section 2 requires the IBLA to issue a final decision within 6
months if a party submits a written notice of intent to seek expe-
dited review of an appeal. A party would not be able to submit such
a request unless the appeal is sitting at DOI for over one year. If
the IBLA does not issue a final decision on an appeal by this dead-
line, the agency decision automatically becomes eligible for de novo
judicial review outside of DOI.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.
COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XIII AND

of House rule XIII and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act
of 1974, the Committee has requested but not received from the Di-
rector of the Congressional Budget Office a budgetary analysis and
a cost estimate of this bill.

Section 10:
2. General Performance Goals and Objectives. As required by
clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the general performance goal or objective
of this bill is to establish a process to expedite the review of ap-
peals of certain decisions by DOI.

mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chair of the Com-
mittee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional
Record upon its receipt by the Committee, if such estimate is not
publicly available on the Congressional Budget Office website.
EXISTING PROGRAMS
Directed Rule Making. This bill does not contain any directed
rule makings.

reauthorize a program of the federal government known to be du-
plicative of another program. Such program was not included in
any report from the Government Accountability Office to Congress
pursuant to section 21 of Public Law 111–139 or identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance published pur-
suant to the Federal Program Information Act (Public Law 95–220,
as amended by Public Law 98–169) as relating to other programs.

terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
PREEMPTION OF STATE, LOCAL OR TRIBAL LAW
Any preemptive effect of this bill over state, local, or tribal law
is intended to be consistent with the bill’s purposes and text and

ADDITIONAL VIEWS
H.R. 677, the Expedited Appeals Review Act, would create
timelines for the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) decisions
and remove agency deference in subsequent District Court appeals.
Under this legislation, if the IBLA does not decide on an appeal
within 18 months of filing, the appellant may request an expedited
review. The IBLA would then have six months to issue a final deci-
sion. If the IBLA does not issue a final decision by the expedited
review deadline, the appellant would be able to appeal the case in
a District Court. Judicial review in a District Court would be de
novo, meaning that the District Court judge would not use the
agency’s administrative record for the case but would newly com-
pile the evidence and establish the administrative record, effec-
tively removing judicial deference to agency decision-making.
The IBLA decides most appeals within two years, but some can
take longer to reach resolution. Some of that timeline is out of the
IBLA’s control: many cases take months to become ‘‘ripe’’ or ready
to review as the parties file documents, seek extensions, or engage
in settlement negotiations. However, some cases linger for years:
the oldest cases on the IBLA’s active docket at the end of FY23
were filed in FY17.
While Committee Democrats do agree that the length of IBLA re-
views is a problem and do not oppose passage of this legislation,
the bill does not address the underlying cause of the IBLA’s delays,
which are primarily capacity-based. Adequate funding for agency
staff could be a more effective solution for long review timelines.
H.R. 677 would also create a fast-tracked review procedure that
could advantage wealthier appellants. Taking a case to the District
Court is time- and resource-intensive, making this expedited proc-
ess less accessible to under-resourced communities coming to the
IBLA with an appeal.
