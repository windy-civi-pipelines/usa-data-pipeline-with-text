PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 618 is to amend the Apex Project, Nevada
Land Transfer and Authorization Act of 1989 to include the City
of North Las Vegas and the Apex Industrial Park Owners Associa-
tion, and for other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Clark County, Nevada experienced significant population growth
in recent years and estimates project the county will reach a popu-
lation of 3.43 million by 2080.1 This sharp rise in population pre-
sents both opportunities and challenges as local officials attempt to
attract businesses to the region to support the growing workforce.
However, over 86 percent of land in Clark County is owned by the
federal government, deterring developers from investing in the re-
gion and adding bureaucratic red tape to important projects.2
To incentivize economic growth and attract new businesses, Con-
gress created the Apex Industrial Park (Apex) in 1989 by author-
izing the sale of roughly 21,000 acres of Bureau of Land Manage-
ment (BLM) land to Clark County to establish an industrial park.
A convergence point for freight from California and other parts of
the western United States, the Apex is a prime location for many
Fortune 500 companies. Once completed, the Apex will have 7,000
acres of developable land and is expected to employ over 6,500
workers.3
While the original law directed BLM to issue utility and trans-
portation rights-of-way for the Apex, businesses that want to start
construction or expand at the Apex must endure a complicated per-

mitting process. The delayed installation of utilities like sewer and
gas, as well as access roads or broadband lines across BLM-con-
trolled corridors, has stalled the growth of existing businesses in
the Apex area. Additionally, the prolonged permitting process acts
as a deterrent for new businesses, hindering economic development
in North Las Vegas.
H.R. 618 amends the Apex Project, Nevada Land Transfer and
Authorization Act of 1989 to streamline the permitting process for
the site. Specifically, the legislation allows the Secretary of the In-
terior to grant utility and transportation rights-of-way to the Apex
Industrial Park Owners Association (Association) and City of North
Las Vegas, along with Clark County, for electric, power, water, nat-
ural gas, telephone, railroad, or highway facilities.4 These changes
are necessary, as the Association and the City of North Las Vegas,
rather than Clark County, now own most of the site. The legisla-
tion also strengthens the requirement to grant such rights-of-way
by amending the law so the Secretary shall issue the rights-of-way
rather than may issue the rights-of-way. Finally, the legislation
eases requirements regarding the sale of mineral materials from
the Apex due to grading or land balancing. In total, these changes
will simplify the process for installing the utility and transpor-
tation infrastructure necessary to facilitate economic growth and
attract new business investment.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 618 was introduced on January 22, 2025, by Representative
Steven Horsford (D–NV). The bill was referred to the Committee
on Natural Resources. On February 12, 2025, the Committee on
Natural Resources met to consider the bill. Representative Joe
Neguse (D–CO) offered an amendment designated Neguse #1. The
amendment was agreed to by unanimous consent. The bill, as
amended, was ordered favorably reported to the House of Rep-
resentatives by unanimous consent.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing in the 118th Congress by the Subcommittee on Federal Lands
held on September 18, 2024.

railroad, and highway facilities to the Kerr-McGee site and other
lands conveyed in the bill. Section 2 also grants the City of North
Las Vegas and the Apex Industrial Park Owners Association
rights-of-way on public lands as necessary to support the develop-
ment as a heavy use industrial zone. Section 2 specifies mineral
materials taken from the site due to grading or land balancing
shall be exempt from quantity and term limitations imposed on
noncompetitive sales and further specifies such transfers shall still
comply with other federal environmental laws. Finally, this section
makes minor technical clarifications to the existing statute.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.
COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XIII AND
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT
1. Cost of Legislation and the Congressional Budget Act. With re-
spect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) and (3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and sections 308(a) and
402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has
received the following estimate for the bill from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office:
H.R. 618 would direct the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
to grant utility and transportation rights-of-way to the Apex Indus-
trial Park Owners Association; Clark County, Nevada; and the City
of North Las Vegas, Nevada. The bill also would adjust the require-
ments for BLM to sell mineral materials, such as sand and gravel,
stemming from activities within the Apex Industrial Park. The
rights-of-way and the sales’ proceeds (a portion of which would be
shared with the state of Nevada) would be subject to valid existing
rights.

The receipts related to the processing of rights-of-way are classi-
fied in the budget as discretionary offsetting collections; that is, as
reductions in discretionary spending. Spending of those collections
is subject to annual appropriation. CBO expects that the additional
processing fees collected under the bill would be spent soon there-
after so that the net effect on spending subject to appropriation
would be negligible.
Additionally, any receipts generated from the sale of mineral ma-
terials and rents from the rights-of-way would be recorded in the
federal budget as offsetting receipts—that is, as reductions in di-
rect spending. Those receipts are deposited in the general fund of
the Treasury. Based on information about similar activities, CBO
estimates that the offsetting receipts would be small and that the
net decrease in direct spending over the 2025 2035 period would
be less than $500,000.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Kelly Durand. The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
2. General Performance Goals and Objectives. As required by
clause 3(c)(4) of Rule XIII, the general performance goal or objec-
tive of this bill is to amend the Apex Project, Nevada Land Trans-
fer and Authorization Act of 1989 to include the City of North Las
Vegas and the Apex Industrial Park Owners Association, and for
other purposes.
EARMARK STATEMENT
This bill does not contain any Congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined under clause 9(e),
9(f), and 9(g) of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives.
UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT STATEMENT
According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 618 contains
no unfunded mandates as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Re-
form Act.
EXISTING PROGRAMS
Directed Rule Making. This bill does not contain any directed
rule makings.
Duplication of Existing Programs. This bill does not establish or
reauthorize a program of the federal government known to be du-
plicative of another program. Such program was not included in
any report from the Government Accountability Office to Congress
pursuant to section 21 of Public Law 111–139 or identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance published pur-
suant to the Federal Program Information Act (Public Law 95–220,
as amended by Public Law 98–169) as relating to other programs.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following—
(1) The only two domestic producers of ammonium per-
chlorate (‘‘AP’’), a principal component of solid rocket fuel es-
sential to the Nation’s defense and space programs, are Pacific
Engineering and Production Company, Incorporated(‘‘Pepcon)’’
and Kerr-McGee Chemical.Corporation (‘‘Kerr-McGee’’), which
established production facilities near the city of Henderson in
Clark County, Nevada (‘‘the county’’). On May 4,1988, an ex-
plosion destroyed the Pepcon plant, thereby substantially re-
ducing the Nation’s capacity to produce solid rocket fuel.
(2) A commission subsequently appointed by the Governor of
Nevada to examine the adequacy of existing policies and regu-
lations pertaining to the manufacture and storage of certain in-
dustrial materials has recommended new policies which imply
the desirability of relocating both some of Kerr-McGee’s AP
production and storage facilities and also other industries to a
less densely populated part of Clark County, but within rea-
sonable distance of the present work force.
(3) The Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration have identified an urgent need to re-
place the domestic ammonium perchlorate production capacity
lost in the Pepcon accident and to firm up existing production
capabilities in order to meet current shortages and long-term
requirements.
(4) The county has identified as the preferred site for the re-
location of Kerr-McGee’s AP facilities approximately thirty-
seven hundred acres of land (‘‘Kerr-McGee Site’’), which is part
of approximately twenty-one thousand acres of Federal lands,
identified by the county as the ‘‘Apex Site’’, managed by the

Bureau of Land Management (‘‘BLM’’). The county has advised
the BLM it would like to purchase some or all of the lands
comprising the Apex Site for development as a heavy-industry
use zone, to locate potentially hazardous facilities. Orderly and
appropriate development of such an industrial zone, in a man-
ner consistent with public safety, protection of environmental
and other values, and relevant State and Federal policies and
programs (including the national defense) would be preferable
to development of the lands comprising the Apex Site in an un-
planned manner.
(5)) The Federal lands comprising the Apex Site are pres-
ently classified for retention and multiple use by the applicable
BLM land use plan. At the time the current land use plan was
developed, disposal of large parcels of land immediately outside
the Las Vegas Valley was not identified as a possibility. How-
ever, the expeditious transfer of the Kerr-McGee Site to Clark
County for resale to Kerr-McGee, and transfer of necessary as-
sociated rights-of-way to the county, will serve an important
national need which cannot be served as well on non-Federal
land in Clark County and which outweighs other existing and
potential public uses of the lands which would be sewed by
maintaining them in Federal ownership.
(6) Kerr-McGee has prepared an environmental assessment
on the proposed transfer of the Kerr-McGee Site and sup-
porting utility and transportation rights-of-way, dated April
1989, entitled ‘‘Apex Nevada Land Transfer Proposal and Pro-
posed Kerr-McGee Ammonium Perchlorate Facility’’, which
identifies certain environmental impacts likely to result from
the transfer of the site and supporting rights-of-way to the
county which would be mitigated with various control meas-
ures. Any transfer by the United States of lands within the
Apex Site should be conditioned upon provision of all measures
appropriate to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental im-
pacts.
(7)) Lands within the Apex Site provide habitat for the
desert tortoise. The BLM, recognizing that the desert tortoise
habitat found in Nevada, and elsewhere, is being significantly
affected, especially within the Mojave Desert, by the rapid de-
velopment associated with industrial growth and by other
human activities, has prepared a rangewide plan for desert tor-
toise habitat management on the public lands. The goal of this
plan is to ensure that viable desert tortoise populations will
continue to exist through cooperative resource management
aimed at protecting the species and its habitat. The BLM’s im-
plementation of this plan should be accelerated.
(8) Lands within the Apex Site are close to Nellis Air Force
Base and to public lands withdrawn for use by the Air Force
as part of the Nellis Air Force Range complex. Nellis Air Force
Base is the most active military airfield in the United
States(with many of the aircraft using the base carrying live
ordnance) and, together with the Nellis Air Force Range, con-
stitutes a unique facility that plays a vital role in maintaining
the combat capability of the Air Force’s tactical units. Main-
taining the capability of Nellis Air Force Base to fulfill its mis-

sion must be a central part of any decisions concerning future
use or disposition of the lands within the Apex Site.
(b) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this Act, the following terms shall
have the following meanings—
(1) The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Secretary of the Interior.
(2) The term ‘‘lands’’ means lands and interests therein.
(3) The term ‘‘county’’ or ‘‘Clark County’’ means Clark Coun-
ty, Nevada.
(4) The term ‘‘Kerr-McGee’’ means the Kerr-McGee Chemical
Corporation.
(5) The term ‘‘BLM’s Desert Tortoise Plan’’ means the plan
entitled ‘‘Desert Tortoise Habitat Management on the Public
Lands: A Rangewide Plan’’, approved November 14, 1988.
(6) The term ‘‘Apex Industrial Park Owners Association’’ has
the meaning given such term by the charter document for the
entity entitled ‘‘Apex Industrial Park Owners Association’’,
formed on April 9, 2001, and any successor documents to such
charter document, on file with the Nevada Secretary of State.
(7) The term ‘‘City of North Las Vegas’’ means North Las
Vegas, Nevada.
ø(6)¿ (8) All other terms shall have the same meaning as
such terms have when used in the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act of 1976.

retary is directed to convey the public lands comprising approxi-
mately thirty-seven hundred acres designated as ‘‘Area 1’’ and‘‘Area
2’’ within the ‘‘Kerr-McGee Site’’ on the map entitled ‘‘Apex Heavy-
Industry Use Zone’’ dated May 1989, to Clark County, Nevada,
solely for sale to Kerr-McGee, in return for payment of the lands’
appraised fair market value, as determined by the Secretary in ac-
cordance with established appraisal practices. However, the lands
within Area 1 shall not be conveyed unless and until the Secretary
has received a written commitment from Clark County and Kerr-
McGee that whichever is offered the opportunity to purchase the
lands within Area 2 will do so at such lands’ appraised fair market
value when the lands are offered pursuant to subsection (c)of this
section.
(b) RIGHTS-OF-WAY.—Subject to all valid existing rights, the Sec-
retary is directed to grant utility and transportation rights-of-way
to øClark County for the connection¿ Clark County, the City of
North Las Vegas, and the Apex Industrial Park Owners Association,
individually or jointly as appropriate, for the connection of existing
electric power, water, natural gas, telephone, railroad and highway
facilities to the øKerr-McGee Site¿ Kerr-McGee Site and other
lands conveyed in accordance with this Act, all as generally de-
picted on the map entitled ‘‘Rights-of-Way and Proposed Access and
Utility Locations’’ dated May 1989 (or any successor maps created
by the Secretary).Each right-of-way shall not exceed two hundred
feet in width and shall not preclude the Secretary from permitting
other uses of the affected lands compatible with the uses for which
such rights-of-way are granted. Clark County may permit other
parties to use the lands covered by such rights-of-way for some or
all of the purposes specified in this subsection.

ization provided for in section 4 of this Act, and the total acreage
authorized for disposition under this section shall be increased ac-
cordingly.
(2) If the lands within Area 1 are purchased pursuant to para-
graph (1) of this subsection, upon completion of a survey of the
boundaries of Area 2, the Secretary shall offer to sell to the pur-
chaser of Area l the lands within Area 2 at their appraised fair
market value, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with
established procedures of the BLM.
(3) Each right-of-way granted pursuant to this section shall be
subject to rental payments and other conditions provided for inap-
plicable law, including the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976 and this Act. The amounts received by the United
States from sales of lands covered by this section shall be distrib-
uted pursuant to laws generally applicable to sales of public lands.
SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS.
(a) SALE AUTHORIZED.—Notwithstanding any BLM land use plan
calling for retention of the Apex Site and notwithstanding the re-
porting requirements and competitive bidding requirements of sec-
tion 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of
1976,the Secretary is authorized, subject to any other requirements
of law, including the conditions of this section, to sell to Clark
County some or all of the lands within the Apex Site, depicted on
the map referred to in section 3(a), that lie outside the boundaries
of the Kerr-McGee Site (as depicted on such map) for fair market
value as determined by the Secretary in accordance with estab-
lished appraisal procedures.
(b) REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS.—If, no later than one year
after the date of enactment of this Act, the county demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the Secretary that the county has designated the
lands comprising the Apex Site as a heavy-use industrial zone, pur-
suant to applicable laws of the State of Nevada, and has adopted
a plan for the development of some or all of such lands accordingly,
the Secretary shall offer to enter into a land sales agreement with
Clark County for the transfer of some or all of such lands to the
county by one or more direct sales pursuant to this section over a
period not to exceed ten ears. Such agreement shall provide for
purchasers of parcels of tie lands within the Apex Site, with any
specific parcels to be sold to be determined by the Secretary, in re-
