PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on February 25, 2025, by Representative Andy Ogles,
H.R. 1577, the Stop Fentanyl Money Laundering Act of 2025, au-
thorizes the Department of the Treasury to utilize its existing spe-
cial measure authorities to target and thwart money laundering ac-
tivities that are used to facilitate fentanyl trafficking in foreign ju-
risdictions and provides law enforcement with streamlined and up-
dated Suspicious Activity Reports that will allow them to follow the
money of narcotics trafficking.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
There is broad bipartisan agreement that the ongoing opioid epi-
demic is one of the most serious threats facing our nation. The
business of fentanyl is not possible without financial support and
accompanying illicit financial activities. While many of the tech-
niques involved in traditional cartel money laundering have been
prevalent for decades, fentanyl and its global supply chain have
generated a number of novel techniques. For example, Chinese
money laundering organizations facilitate the movement of cartel
cash from America back to China. Once in China, funds are used
to procure and export precursor chemicals to Mexico.
Special measures are used by the Department of Treasury
(Treasury) to learn more about or disrupt a foreign money laun-
dering threat to the U.S. financial system. Treasury’s special meas-
ure authority can have serious impacts on foreign financial institu-
tions that are found to be assisting money laundering, going so far
as to close their correspondent accounts at U.S. banks. Special
measures, once sufficient evidence of money laundering is found,
are issued through regulation and are authorized for a period of
120 days.
Narcotics trafficking is a national money laundering priority, yet
narcotics trafficking does not have a suspicious activity checkbox
on the suspicious activity report (SAR) form. The absence of such
checkbox results in inconsistent reporting by financial institutions,
data capture shortfalls, cumbersome SAR queries, and government
agencies relying on incomplete data when assessing narcotics traf-
fickers’ money laundering methodologies. Adding a narcotics traf-
ficking checkbox on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s

(FinCEN) SARs will streamline law enforcement investigations in
fentanyl trafficking and the money laundering that facilitates it.

mittee on the Judiciary was discharged from consideration.
On July 18, 2023, the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit

1577:

retired United States Treasury Department Special Agent; Martin
Muhleisen, Nonresident Senior Fellow at the GAO Economic Cen-
ter at the Atlantic Council; and Dr. Rush Doshi, C.V. Starr Senior
Fellow for Asian Studies, and Director of the China Strategy Initia-
tive at the Council on Foreign Relations, and an assistant professor
at Georgetown University.
Witness Cassara described how well-established Chinese under-
ground banking systems are among the most pernicious enablers of
money laundering for drug cartels and also other sectors of CCP-
supported criminal activity, including counterfeit goods, intellectual
property theft, human trafficking, illicit tobacco, and trade fraud.
These systems are designed to bypass U.S. financial transparency
reporting requirements, employing tactics like trade-based money
laundering, underground financial systems, value transfers, mobile
phone apps and evade detection by U.S. money laundering counter-
measures. Witness Cassara also mentioned a recent Wall Street
Journal article, which described how illegal proceeds from fentanyl
sales are being laundered through China for reinvestment in real
estate and other vehicles in the United States.
The Committee on Financial Services met in open session on
March 5, 2025 to consider, among others, H.R. 1577.

tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote

ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes

ported favorably to the House by a recorded vote of 49 to and 0
