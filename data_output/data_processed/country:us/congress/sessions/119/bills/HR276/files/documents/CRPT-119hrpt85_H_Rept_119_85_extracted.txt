HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing by the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held on
March 25, 2025.

Section 18:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 19:
Section 1. Short title
Establishes the short title of this act as the ‘‘Gulf of America
Act’’.

Section 20:
Section 2. Renaming of Gulf of Mexico as ‘‘Gulf of America’’
Establishes that any reference in law, map, regulation, docu-
ment, paper, or other record of the United States to the Gulf of
Mexico shall be deemed a reference to the ‘‘Gulf of America.’’ Sec-
tion 2 also directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the
Chair of the Board on Geographic Names to oversee the implemen-
tation of the name change and requires the head of each federal
agency to update each document and map within 180 days of enact-
ment.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.
COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XIII AND
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT

Section 21:
1. Cost of Legislation and the Congressional Budget Act. With re-
spect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) and (3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and sections 308(a) and
402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has
received the following estimate for the bill from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office:

H.R. 276 would rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of Amer-
ica.’’ The bill would require federal agencies, under the oversight
of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, to update documents and
maps to reflect the name change. Based on the cost of similar ac-
tivities, CBO estimates that updating federal documents and maps
would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any re-
lated spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
Enacting H.R. 276 also could affect direct spending by some
agencies that are allowed to use fees, receipts from the sale of
goods, and other collections to cover operating costs. CBO estimates
that any net changes in direct spending by those agencies would
be negligible because most of them can adjust amounts collected to
reflect changes in operating costs.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Kelly Durand. The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.

Section 22:
2. General Performance Goals and Objectives. As required by
clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the general performance goal or objective
of this bill is to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of Amer-
ica’’.
EARMARK STATEMENT
This bill does not contain any Congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined under clause 9(e),
9(f), and 9(g) of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives.
UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT STATEMENT
According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 276 contains
no unfunded mandates as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Re-
form Act.

EXISTING PROGRAMS
Directed Rule Making. This bill does not contain any directed
rule makings.
Duplication of Existing Programs. This bill does not establish or
reauthorize a program of the federal government known to be du-
plicative of another program. Such program was not included in
any report from the Government Accountability Office to Congress
pursuant to section 21 of Public Law 111–139 or identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance published pur-
suant to the Federal Program Information Act (Public Law 95–220,
as amended by Public Law 98–169) as relating to other programs.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
PREEMPTION OF STATE, LOCAL OR TRIBAL LAW
Any preemptive effect of this bill over state, local, or tribal law
is intended to be consistent with the bill’s purposes and text and
the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.

DISSENTING VIEWS
H.R. 276 is an unserious bill that would force federal agencies
that in many cases are currently being gutted illegally and without
justification to spend time, money, and staffing on renaming the
Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of America,’’ a symbolic and costly re-
branding effort that offers no benefit to the American people.
This wasteful stunt comes at a time when Americans face rising
costs of food, housing, healthcare, and necessities1—cost increases
largely self-inflicted by President Trump’s reckless, aimless, and
chaotic trade war and tariff taxes. It comes at a time when House
Republicans have voted on a budget plan requiring cuts to Med-
icaid.2
Instead of addressing any of the mounting crises facing the na-
tion under this President, this bill would mandate a complete over-
haul of federal maps, documents, and regulations that reference
the Gulf of Mexico, further diverting limited agency staff time and
resources at a time when budget cuts and widespread workforce re-
ductions already strain federal agencies.3 This legislation does
nothing to improve national security, energy prices, environmental
health, or economic stability—it is simply a performative exercise
in political messaging, all on our constituents’ dime.
Recent polling shows that 70% of Americans overwhelmingly op-
pose this proposal.4 Renaming a major international body of water
distracts from more pressing national priorities and attempts to re-
write history. This bill continues a broader crusade to redefine his-
torical narratives around an exclusionary vision of American iden-
tity, ignoring the interconnected realities of the region and our
shared stewardship of the Gulf of Mexico.
The amount of government time and expense that the Repub-
lican House of Representatives is putting toward this nonsense is
an insult to the American people. No doubt our constituents will
take note in the coming months of what the Republican House was

HEARINGS
For the purposes of clause 3(c)(6) of House rule XIII, the fol-
lowing hearing was used to develop or consider this measure: hear-
ing by the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries held on
March 25, 2025.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title
Establishes the short title of this act as the ‘‘Gulf of America
Act’’.
Section 2. Renaming of Gulf of Mexico as ‘‘Gulf of America’’
Establishes that any reference in law, map, regulation, docu-
ment, paper, or other record of the United States to the Gulf of
Mexico shall be deemed a reference to the ‘‘Gulf of America.’’ Sec-
tion 2 also directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the
Chair of the Board on Geographic Names to oversee the implemen-
tation of the name change and requires the head of each federal
agency to update each document and map within 180 days of enact-
ment.
COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on
Natural Resources’ oversight findings and recommendations are re-
flected in the body of this report.
COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XIII AND
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT
1. Cost of Legislation and the Congressional Budget Act. With re-
spect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) and (3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and sections 308(a) and
402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has
received the following estimate for the bill from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office:

H.R. 276 would rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of Amer-
ica.’’ The bill would require federal agencies, under the oversight
of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, to update documents and
maps to reflect the name change. Based on the cost of similar ac-
tivities, CBO estimates that updating federal documents and maps
would cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any re-
lated spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
Enacting H.R. 276 also could affect direct spending by some
agencies that are allowed to use fees, receipts from the sale of
goods, and other collections to cover operating costs. CBO estimates
that any net changes in direct spending by those agencies would
be negligible because most of them can adjust amounts collected to
reflect changes in operating costs.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Kelly Durand. The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
2. General Performance Goals and Objectives. As required by
clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the general performance goal or objective
of this bill is to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of Amer-
ica’’.
EARMARK STATEMENT
This bill does not contain any Congressional earmarks, limited
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined under clause 9(e),
9(f), and 9(g) of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives.
UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT STATEMENT
According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 276 contains
no unfunded mandates as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Re-
form Act.

EXISTING PROGRAMS
Directed Rule Making. This bill does not contain any directed
rule makings.
Duplication of Existing Programs. This bill does not establish or
reauthorize a program of the federal government known to be du-
plicative of another program. Such program was not included in
any report from the Government Accountability Office to Congress
pursuant to section 21 of Public Law 111–139 or identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance published pur-
suant to the Federal Program Information Act (Public Law 95–220,
as amended by Public Law 98–169) as relating to other programs.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
PREEMPTION OF STATE, LOCAL OR TRIBAL LAW
Any preemptive effect of this bill over state, local, or tribal law
is intended to be consistent with the bill’s purposes and text and
the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
As ordered reported by the Committee on Natural Resources,
H.R. 276 would make no changes in existing law.

DISSENTING VIEWS
H.R. 276 is an unserious bill that would force federal agencies
that in many cases are currently being gutted illegally and without
justification to spend time, money, and staffing on renaming the
Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of America,’’ a symbolic and costly re-
branding effort that offers no benefit to the American people.
This wasteful stunt comes at a time when Americans face rising
costs of food, housing, healthcare, and necessities1—cost increases
largely self-inflicted by President Trump’s reckless, aimless, and
chaotic trade war and tariff taxes. It comes at a time when House
Republicans have voted on a budget plan requiring cuts to Med-
icaid.2
Instead of addressing any of the mounting crises facing the na-
tion under this President, this bill would mandate a complete over-
haul of federal maps, documents, and regulations that reference
the Gulf of Mexico, further diverting limited agency staff time and
resources at a time when budget cuts and widespread workforce re-
ductions already strain federal agencies.3 This legislation does
nothing to improve national security, energy prices, environmental
